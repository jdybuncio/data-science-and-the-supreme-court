1975.74-220,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.087,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Hancock, the Attorney General of Kentucky against Train the administrator of EPA."
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,16.598,19.43,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-220,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,268.164,279.308,"Mr. Beals, do you envisage situations where the state would not grant a Federal installation of permit?"
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,279.308,316.415,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I envision a situation where if the control strategy proposed by a Federal source will in the opinion of the State Air Pollution Control Agency not result in the attainment of the ambient standards, will not result in the meeting of the admitting standards that that Federal source would have to redraft its control strategy, its compliance schedule so that it would indeed meet these standards as required by the act."
1975.74-220,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,316.415,320.612,So you would stop at the permit stage rather than later?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,320.612,324.732,"At the permit stage, these things can be worked out."
1975.74-220,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,361.301,366.346,So you are zeroing in on something more than merely identification on the source of pollution?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,366.346,367.123,We are indeed Your Honor --
1975.74-220,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,367.123,368.392,At the permit stage?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,368.392,382.048,The implementation plan as expressed by Congress contains considerably more than just identification of the sources of pollution and it contains considerably more than simply emission standards.
1975.74-220,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,387.141,391.828,"Of course you could do that by a compulsion suit later, could you not after the permit is issued?"
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,391.828,393.934,That would hardly be prevention Your Honor.
1975.74-220,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,436.706,454.358,Is it not the environmental agency state that it would submit all of the information which is called for about the application but would not submit it in the form of an application for reasons which were given.
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,458.554,465.341,"Yes Mr. Chief Justice, that gives everything that the application would give you but it does not give you what the permit requires."
1975.74-220,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,471.67,482.98,"Well, as Mr. Justice Blackmun’s suggestion why not wait until you have the problem and then go in on the enforcement where the environmental agency raises no question."
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,482.98,490.088,"Once again Your Honor, the ambient standards are interfered with the attainment and likeness of the ambient standards are interfered with if we --"
1975.74-220,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,490.088,495.387,"Well, cannot you not tell them that when they submit the data that they have offered?"
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,495.387,499.14,But the data they offer is just a status report.
1975.74-220,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,500.181,502.315,Everything you get in an application?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,502.315,506.347,Yes but the process does not stop at the application.
1975.74-220,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,529.238,541.453,"Do you say if you really had the authority to require permit you could say no to an application, whereas if you do not have the authority require permit, all you can do is kind of file what they are doing and not say no?"
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,541.453,542.27,That is correct.
1975.74-220,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,547.161,566.471,"But if you read the government’s brief, you get the impression that the government installations will fully comply with the substantive requirements and presumably EPA and that is what is regulating the government’s installations would be saying no in place of the State agency."
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,566.471,596.358,"That would have been fine, if the administrator had come in 1972 under 313 when the implementation plan broke down when they refused to comply with the implementation plan, what the installations, what the respondents have done so far is when requested not on the basis of a periodic report, when requested they have submitted a status report."
1975.74-220,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,629.574,633.819,"The compliance schedule originates at the time, the permit is issued?"
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,633.819,636.059,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-220,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,671.96,678.921,"Mr. Beals, that is the information the government did furnish you was that acceptable or rejected?"
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,678.921,683.25,It was taken as what it was.
1975.74-220,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,683.268,688.979,"Well, that has not been in the form of an application would have permit, when you grant it or not."
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,688.979,691.006,In some cases perhaps it would have been.
1975.74-220,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,692.674,694.574,What about in this case?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,694.574,698.276,"Well, this case deals with quite a number of different respondents."
1975.74-220,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,698.276,699.904,With any (inaudible)?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,699.904,702.482,Some of them may have gotten the permit.
1975.74-220,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,703.251,706.233,"Well, do you have a complaint on those?"
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,706.233,707.437,The complaint?
1975.74-220,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,709.228,713.154,"Well, I mean you just want the formality of asking for permit?"
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,713.154,714.499,"No, we want the cooperation."
1975.74-220,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,714.499,717.89,How about those that did meet the standards?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,724.324,726.881,"Well, they did not apply for a permit."
1975.74-220,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,726.881,731.952,"But they give you all the information that they would have given, if it applied for permit?"
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,731.952,739.174,"Only those few sources and I am not sure how many of them, there are which would be in compliance."
1975.74-220,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,763.192,767.877,I thought all you asked for was that did they applied for permit.
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,767.877,773.215,"In asking that they applied for a permit, we are asking that they submit to our entire implementation plan system."
1975.74-220,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,773.215,778.13,But I thought you just wanted to go through the formality in some instances?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,778.13,787.804,"Well, in the instances where they are already in compliance, I agree if they applied for permit, they would be granted a permit."
1975.74-220,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,969.396,979.815,(Inaudible) at least for me fully answered the questions of Justice Blackmun or Justice Marshall or the ones I was trying to put.
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1003.77,1006.613,We are here for the fact that they have not than that.
1975.74-220,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1006.613,1014.552,Well have you responded to the informal approach just the way you would to a formal application?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1014.552,1016.772,Perhaps not but we have not had the same information.
1975.74-220,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1016.772,1019.466,That is the starting point.
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1019.466,1025.79,"Well, the informal approach nonetheless is totally unrelated to our implementation plan."
1975.74-220,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.501,1079.743,"Mr. Beals, may I ask you a question?"
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1104.383,1106.59,Not specifically Your Honor.
1975.74-220,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.167,1140.494,"That is purely a state requirement, the permit itself."
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1140.494,1140.943,"Well, it has been approved."
1975.74-220,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.943,1145.535,It is a state technique for implementing Section 110.
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1145.535,1151.512,"Well, yes, but it has been approved by the Federal EPA."
1975.74-220,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1165.843,1175.837,"Well, the reason I asked, I was wondering what would happen if the Federal point source were in compliance with the substantive standards and simply refuse to get a permit."
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1181.967,1184.538,The Federal statutory authority?
1975.74-220,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1184.538,1186.271,Yes.
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1186.271,1189.038,"I take it, that there would be not."
1975.74-220,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1189.038,1189.603,So there really have been –-
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1189.603,1213.106,"However, if Section 118 clearly makes that is the Federal Statutory Authority which makes all state and Federal requirements respecting control and abatement of air pollution applicable to each of these Federal respondents."
1975.74-220,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1236.721,1241.164,"Well, that is the remedy that you pursued this litigation is it not?"
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1251.414,1252.694,That is correct.
1975.74-220,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1252.694,1257.188,"That is a remedy to enforce your permit system, is it not?"
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1257.188,1258.366,That is exactly.
1975.74-220,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1266.148,1275.867,Then what you really want is some kind of reports other than the status report?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1275.867,1280.084,"Well, the point where you –-"
1975.74-220,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1280.084,1283.373,Why do you not go up to those instead of going out with permit?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1283.373,1286.09,Because the permit will give us everything. The permit will get us –-
1975.74-220,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1286.09,1289.516,Or you just want to show up with?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1289.516,1297.946,"Administratively, it is practically impossible to go after each requirement of the permit system individually."
1975.74-220,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1309.808,1316.857,Could you not file the same suit to require them to file these reports?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1316.857,1326.711,"Well, other than the proliferation of Federal District Court suits that that would bring on."
1975.74-220,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1346.337,1351.292,Has the Congressional program broken down in the states that do not have a permit procedure?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1351.292,1352.679,It has indeed Your Honor.
1975.74-220,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1353.64,1357.185,Where do we find that in the record?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1357.185,1364.062,I find that in the record by the fact that none of the respondents herein are committed to compliance schedules.
1975.74-220,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1429.515,1464.159,"Mr. Beals, let us just go down the road away, assume that you prevail in this lawsuit and the Federal government is required to apply for a permit and after all the negotiations and all of the good faith have been exhausted, let us assume the appropriate Kentucky authorities conclude that the -- let us take Fort Knox is not in compliance with the standards."
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1469.118,1475.973,"Well, that would be the direction of the Clean Air Act that is what they say that we should do."
1975.74-220,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1475.973,1484.799,What section of the Act suggests that Congress intended to allow any state to close down Fort Knox?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1484.799,1489.825,"Well, no section suggests that we should be allowed to close down Fort Knox."
1975.74-220,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1523.773,1528.476,This is a national statute we are talking about.
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1551.371,1560.521,"Well, I take that it would but the possibility of shutting down EPA and TVA all together is very, very remote."
1975.74-220,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1584.148,1586.359,It is not like what presumed.
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1592.771,1594.131,It is not just the purpose.
1975.74-220,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1603.37,1607.258,"That is quite similarity, as it would be against any utility company?"
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1607.258,1611.105,"That is correct, just exactly as it would be against any other utility company."
1975.74-220,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.105,1613.934,"And certainly Congress contemplated that, is it not?"
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1622.389,1629.599,But the Congress did not contemplate that they would be subject only to the substantive --
1975.74-220,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1629.599,1630.763,But Congress contemplated at least that.
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1630.763,1632.064,At least that --
1975.74-220,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1632.064,1639.092,That the TVA and Fort Knox would be subject to the substantive requirements of the state program?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1639.092,1640.834,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-220,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1704.352,1718.808,And so far as you know is EPA undertaking any parallel monitoring of Federal facilities to see that they come into compliance with the state requirement?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1718.808,1744.685,"In 1975, a month-and-a-half before the attainment dates, the Federal EPA was trying to determine the compliance status of Federal sources and to get them to enter consent agreements, if they were not in compliance, consent agreements which are exactly identical in every respect to what a compliance schedule would have been."
1975.74-220,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1744.685,1750.599,Well do you say if they have been subjected to the permit program you would have had those on in 72 and not 75?
1975.74-220,0,20561,david_d_beals,,1750.599,1752.396,That is correct.
1975.74-220,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1785.395,1788.547,Mr. Friedman?
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1788.547,1790.945,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-220,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.776,1865.7,Can it be candidly said Mr. Friedman that the EPA is treating the Federal facilities just as the Kentucky Agency would be treating private facilities?
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1865.7,1866.791,I think it can.
1975.74-220,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1951.61,1968.827,"And those as possible that each of the states has its own, it is likely that each have their own schedules and own notions about how the compliance can be accomplished so that there will be no uniformity applicable to all Federal installations, is that the way?"
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1968.827,1973.676,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice because now all states have permit.
1975.74-220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2057.795,2061.62,"Well, everybody agrees with that Mr. Friedman, I think we do not need to go into that."
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2065.655,2069.134,And whether in 118 Congress has –
1975.74-220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2069.134,2070.117,Precisely!
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2070.117,2083.042,"-- precisely and clearly indicated that the Federal facilities are -- but I think in determining, I think Mr. Justice in determining whether 118 has that effect, it is important to keep in mind this broad back --"
1975.74-220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2083.042,2086.484,But if does not have that effect then you win.
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2086.484,2086.681,That is correct.
1975.74-220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2086.681,2090.17,"And if it does, you lose."
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2090.17,2106.308,That is the thing but our submission is that before one can conclude the Congress intended to subject the Federal facilities to this kind of state control there has to be some clear indication that Congress did so.
1975.74-220,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.168,2126.939,He concedes what in this agreement?
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2126.939,2127.854,I thought as I understood it --
1975.74-220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2127.854,2132.715,He says the plain meaning of the language is very explicit as I understood it.
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2138.739,2139.879,"Well, but he has conceded."
1975.74-220,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.984,2143.003,"No, he concedes there is nothing else maybe?"
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2143.003,2149.053,No he is conceded there is nothing in the statute that explicitly refers to permits.
1975.74-220,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2149.053,2153.537,There is nothing in the statute that refers to substantive requirements either.
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2153.537,2155.202,It says it used the word “requirements.”
1975.74-220,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.202,2156.55,Well it does not say substantive.
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2156.55,2157.902,It does not say substantive but --
1975.74-220,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.902,2159.378,It does not say procedural.
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2159.378,2159.912,It does not.
1975.74-220,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.912,2161.98,so which one would you like to leave out?
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2161.98,2166.305,"Well, it is not, with all due respect Mr. Justice it is not a question of leaving it out."
1975.74-220,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2166.305,2167.444,Well which one would you think that would be included?
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2167.444,2169.21,We think it means only substantive.
1975.74-220,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.29,2172.102,But why?
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2172.102,2179.711,Because that is precisely we think what the legislative history of this statute shows that what Congress is intending to do in this statute.
1975.74-220,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.711,2196.896,"But if it means only substantive requirements then is it not EPA under a duty to enforce just as rigorously against the Federal facilities, the state's substantive requirements so that Fort Knox will be shutdown if it does not comply?"
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2201.454,2211.743,"Well, I do not think that the shutting down –- I agree that the Federal administration is required to enforce the standards just as rigorously as the state is doing."
1975.74-220,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2228.628,2233.215,"Well, then you are talking about a good deal more than just a permit requirement."
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2240.17,2255.882,"But the remedies Mr. Justice, the remedies are themselves tied into permit requirement because if you have a state permit requirement then you cannot operate unless you have obtained the permit."
1975.74-220,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2286.884,2293.465,But you say that even though the state commission dealing with says the Kentucky Power Company.
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2309.235,2314.812,Well it does not say Mr. Justice with all due respect to try to come around within five years.
1975.74-220,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2320.533,2322.76,This is before us now?
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2327.53,2333.861,"Well, the only question really is whether the state can require the Federal facility to obtain a permit."
1975.74-220,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2333.861,2338.896,So it would be another case and another day when we have to deal with the question of whether they can close Fort Knox?
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2338.896,2344.029,"Yes, and I would hope that it would never come to that but the state apparently claims the power."
1975.74-220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2352.599,2357.242,"Well, of course the President of the United States has the – You have that escape clause --"
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2357.242,2363.604,There is in an escape clause but it has been interpreted rather narrowly because it says in the paramount interest of the United States.
1975.74-220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2363.604,2369.338,And I would suppose the President can interpret it and make a finding that it is in the paramount interest of the United States --
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2369.338,2369.379,Not close.
1975.74-220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2369.379,2370.681,To keep Fort Knox open.
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2370.681,2372.93,"Yes, but it is not just that."
1975.74-220,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.971,2424.062,"Mr. Friedman, can I be sure, I understand your position?"
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2429.1,2429.981,Yes.
1975.74-220,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2429.981,2436.336,"-- And assume the president has not made an exception, would you not agree that the state could then close a facility down?"
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2436.336,2442.473,I would not think it could close it down Mr. Justice. It could bring a lawsuit under Section 304 --
1975.74-220,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2442.473,2444.508,"Well then, and would the lawsuit not have merit?"
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2444.508,2445.485,I would think so and I would think --
1975.74-220,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2445.485,2447.516,"Of course, the Court would have to decide."
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2449.965,2450.318,I do not know.
1975.74-220,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2450.318,2452.758,If you assume a violation of the substantive requirement?
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2452.758,2461.291,"If one assumes that I would think the Court would order them to comply and if they fail to comply, the court has whatever sanctions are available to compel compliance."
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2473.075,2477.446,We do not have any question that we have to comply with the standards.
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2485.781,2495.507,The original Bill that was passed by the House directed that Federal facilities would have comply with local emissions standards.
1975.74-220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2824.762,2827.032,"The administrator is a party to this litigation, is it not?"
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2827.032,2837.108,"Yes, he is a party but he is also a party in the Train case Mr. Justice in which this Court placed considerable reliance on his interpretation."
1975.74-220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2843.617,2844.608,Why does --
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2844.608,2845.554,It usually is suit to challenge the --
1975.74-220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2845.554,2848.888,(Inaudible) since the ordinary party does not have?
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2848.888,2854.889,"Well, the ordinary party however does not have the expertise of the administration."
1975.74-220,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2927.449,2936.583,"Mr. Friedman, before you sit down, would you say it is a fair summary of the legislative history to say that it does not indicate that anybody actually thought of the precise problem that this case would have?"
1975.74-220,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2936.583,2949.229,I think that is a fair summary but then our answer is that in this kind of situation unless Congress clearly intended to permit this kind of state authority it should not be implied.
1975.74-220,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2955.371,2956.09,Thank You gentlemen.
