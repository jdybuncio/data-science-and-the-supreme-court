1983.82-1994,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.654,We will hear arguments next in Kirby Forest Industries against the United States.
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,64.193,73.627,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, this is a Fifth Amendment taking in just compensation case."
1983.82-1994,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,157.953,159.796,Mr. Roady--
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,159.796,160.124,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1994,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,160.124,166.074,--was it accomplished by virtue of the government exercising dominion over the property from the time you state?
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,166.074,170.23,"There were no acts of physical possession, Your Honor."
1983.82-1994,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,173.245,175.462,Is there... Excuse me.
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,175.978,178.086,There were no acts of physical possession.
1983.82-1994,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,201.654,215.931,"When the action was taken by the government, could you sell the property to me or to your colleague on the other side of the table?"
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,215.931,222.552,"As a legal matter, Your Honor, we could sell the property, but it would have to be subject to the condemnation."
1983.82-1994,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,224.677,226.114,As a practical economic matter--
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,226.114,228.503,"--you could not, and that is--"
1983.82-1994,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,228.503,233.765,--It would be unlikely that you could find a buyer who would take that chance.
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,233.765,235.515,"--Not only unlikely, Your Honor."
1983.82-1994,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,239.561,241.858,Do you think you could borrow money at the bank on it?
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,241.858,243.231,"No, sir, Your Honor, we could not."
1983.82-1994,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,251.883,257.538,"Could this unimproved real estate, could you... do you think you could build a house on it, or a building?"
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,257.538,264.833,"You could, Your Honor, but you could not recover the cost of it once the United States has completed its condemnation."
1983.82-1994,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,281.406,302.709,"But wouldn't... as a practical matter, if you wanted to borrow money from the bank on the same type of security that that unimproved property would have afforded you for whatever loan a bank might make on it before the condemnation action was filed, couldn't you borrow money on the strength of the potential award?"
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,302.709,317.267,"I would submit not, Your Honor, because what the secured interest owner would look to would be the property, and the property is at that time in a state of limbo insofar as the award is concerned."
1983.82-1994,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,317.267,337.618,"Well, my experience has been that banks aren't crazy about unsecured property, whether it is... unimproved property, whether they are subject to condemnation proceedings or not, but are you saying the banks in that part of the country would be less likely to treat as security the potential award on the property than the property itself."
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,337.618,338.913,"That is my statement, Your Honor."
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,338.913,352.892,"But if there is a lien on the property, and then the property is condemned, surely the lienholder is going to get paid if the award is large enough."
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,352.892,353.814,That is true.
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,353.814,356.875,And I think a bank would certainly know that.
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,356.875,365.872,"The bank, if it had the lien before the condemnation was filed, is protected, but if the bank were... Excuse me."
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,365.872,383.084,"I know, but the bank says before the condemnation, this property has got a market value of X dollars, we'll loan you X over two dollars on it, and after they know it is going to be condemned, isn't the property just as good as security?"
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,383.084,385.067,"Your Honor, the problem with that is--"
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,385.067,386.41,"Well, isn't it just as good as security?"
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,386.41,396.094,"--It is security to the extent of the value that may be realized in the condemnation, and that is the problem."
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,405.528,407.419,"Well, there is no certainty any time about that."
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,423.114,437.484,"--Well, in our view, Your Honor, the practical burdens which are placed upon the property by the condemnation process are such that viable economic uses are no longer available."
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,437.484,440.67,"So when do those restraints accrue, in your view?"
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,442.576,452.182,That is the position we are taking before this Court as a matter of the legal impact relating to condemnation proceedings.
1983.82-1994,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,452.182,453.618,Mr. Roady--
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,453.618,453.947,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1994,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,453.947,458.209,--what economic use was the property put to prior to the filing of the complaint?
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,458.209,467.846,"The property was not being put to any economic use, if I understand Your Honor's question."
1983.82-1994,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,492.603,501.411,"If your client were to receive interest from the date of the filing of the complaint, would that not be a windfall there?"
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,501.411,504.16,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1983.82-1994,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,504.16,505.737,"You are not receiving any interest now, are you?"
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,505.737,511.438,"No, sir, we are not receiving interest on the property, but that is really not the question."
1983.82-1994,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,515.015,525.23,"I understand, but your argument is, as I understood it, that from the date of the filing of the complaint there was no further economic use to which the property could be put--"
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,525.23,525.98,That's true.
1983.82-1994,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,525.98,526.838,--and be profitable.
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,526.838,527.729,Well--
1983.82-1994,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,527.729,533.398,"They could still go hunting on it, fishing... what they were doing on it now."
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,533.398,536.867,"--Your Honor, respectfully, I wouldn't say that those were viable economic uses."
1983.82-1994,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,538.583,539.848,I don't know.
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,539.848,544.893,"--in the language of the Fifth Amendment, we are talking about just compensation, and I think that implies economic uses."
1983.82-1994,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,544.893,548.173,"In Texas, don't people pay to hunt down there?"
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,548.173,549.486,"They do, Your Honor."
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,557.092,558.606,"Well, you weren't getting any income off of it."
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,558.606,560.637,"--That is my understanding, Your Honor."
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,562.183,562.824,Even for hunting.
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,562.824,565.854,Even for hunting is my understanding.
1983.82-1994,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,568.15,570.384,How about the potential income on inflation?
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,589.047,592.311,"--We submit that that would not have been possible, Your Honor."
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,643.182,649.821,Did I read in your brief or in somebody's brief that your client agreed not to develop the timber?
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,649.821,651.351,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,651.351,654.849,During the process of the passage of the legislation?
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,654.849,656.239,"That's correct, prior--"
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,656.239,659.753,And so I take it that your client was supporting passage of the legislation.
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,659.753,662.048,"--Not entirely, Your Honor."
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,663.454,667.0,"Well, why would you agree not to develop any of the timber?"
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,667.0,669.218,--As a good faith effort--
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,669.218,670.327,To what?
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,670.327,675.7,--to demonstrate to Congress that Kirby wanted to be a good citizen and not out--
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.7,679.058,So go ahead and pass the legislation.
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,679.058,682.416,"--It did not oppose the legislation, Your Honor."
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,687.414,689.304,"Now, is this undertaking of yours in the record?"
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,689.304,690.663,"Which undertaking, Your Honor?"
1983.82-1994,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,690.663,691.99,Not to develop the timber.
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,691.99,696.848,It is an admitted fact.
1983.82-1994,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,699.972,701.845,Mr. Roady--
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,701.845,703.002,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1994,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,703.002,721.306,"--the facts that you rely on here to constitute a taking, a prepayment taking, wouldn't those same facts exist in any Section 257 straight condemnation proceeding?"
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,721.306,724.852,"To a great degree, Your Honor, yes."
1983.82-1994,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,724.852,731.443,"Well, wouldn't it turn every 257 proceeding into a 258 proceeding, in effect?"
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,731.443,760.556,"The only distinction, Your Honor, is that in a 257 case involving land which has income-producing capabilities and is producing income, that situation does not fit as readily into this Court's taking analysis under the police power cases, that is, those cases which say that there is no taking when there is remaining, such as in Agins against City of Tiburon, a viable economic use."
1983.82-1994,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,780.282,784.031,May I get back to when it was you made this agreement?
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,786.0,786.608,That is correct.
1983.82-1994,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,786.608,787.577,And with whom did you make it?
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,787.577,795.73,"The Texas Forestry Association, as a group, indicated to--"
1983.82-1994,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,795.73,798.775,Was this the group supporting the Big Thicket?
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,798.775,799.666,"--No, sir."
1983.82-1994,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,813.44,816.596,Did your client expect any compensation for that agreement?
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,816.596,821.282,"I would say not, Your Honor, would be my supposition."
1983.82-1994,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.282,825.78,Does your position hinge on that agreement?
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,828.607,832.809,"I would make the same arguments if there were no such agreement, Your Honor."
1983.82-1994,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,833.34,842.569,"You would make the same arguments even if you had this vast timber land that was not economically being developed, but you had a right to cut down the trees any time you wanted to."
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,842.569,843.054,--Yes.
1983.82-1994,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.054,846.365,"You would still say that as soon as they filed the complaint, you are entitled to interest."
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,846.365,846.63,Correct.
1983.82-1994,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,848.332,856.346,What was it about the filing of the complaint that prevented you from cutting down the trees if it had not been for your prior agreement?
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,856.346,874.12,"Your Honor, our position relating to the filing of the complaint is based upon the fact that that was the moment when the federal government asserted in a positive public way its intent to take the property."
1983.82-1994,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,874.12,877.962,But this was not a declaration of taking proceeding.
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,892.128,892.861,That is true.
1983.82-1994,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,900.047,914.369,"Well, maybe I am asking the same question my brother Rehnquist did, but I don't understand how the institution of the condemnation proceedings deprived you of anything when you had agreed before the proceeding was begun not to use it."
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,914.369,920.741,"This, Your Honor, was the impediment on the legal interests which had not existed before."
1983.82-1994,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,950.448,962.288,"Well, I don't know what the effect of a lis pendence is in Texas, but I know that when I practiced in Arizona, it simply was to say, advise everyone that the property was subject to a condemnation action."
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,975.796,987.245,"Your Honor, the lis pendence is the confirmation in the public record in addition to the condemnation petition itself that the government is going forward with its intent to take."
1983.82-1994,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,987.245,990.369,But it is going forward and proceeding by straight condemnation.
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,990.369,990.776,Correct.
1983.82-1994,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,990.776,998.179,"But I am still not satisfied with what you have said, that there were any other impediments on the use of the land."
1983.82-1994,0,32550,joe_g_roady,,1027.34,1061.982,"Our position, Your Honor, is that the practical impediments to the economic use of the property were such that after the filing of the complaint and after the posting of the lis pendence notice rendered all economic use unavailable, and this within this Court's police power taking analysis demonstrates that the burdens which the property has not borne before had reached the level that a taking occurred."
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1846.478,1860.409,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the basic procedure that the government uses in exercising its power of eminent domain is the straight condemnation or complaint procedure."
1983.82-1994,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1944.376,1950.124,Isn't there one procedure where the money is paid in and deposited in a bank?
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1950.124,1951.967,That's the declaration of taking.
1983.82-1994,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1975.207,1979.767,"To the court, but may they take it out and put it in their own bank account?"
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1979.767,1980.142,Yes.
1983.82-1994,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1980.142,1980.814,That is the important thing.
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1980.814,1981.158,Yes.
1983.82-1994,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1981.158,1984.938,I thought the court deposited it in the bank.
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1984.938,1994.807,"It is deposited into the court, but Rule 71(a) provides that it shall be paid out to the landowner promptly."
1983.82-1994,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2020.984,2021.594,You mean on the deferred payment.
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2021.594,2025.686,"Yes, on the difference between the amount that is deposited--"
1983.82-1994,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2025.686,2026.061,--deferred.
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2026.061,2027.482,--Yes.
1983.82-1994,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2027.482,2030.637,They get interest at... is it the statutory rate?
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2030.637,2034.558,There is a statutory rate.
1983.82-1994,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2052.957,2086.943,"Mrs. Shapiro, the petitioner is arguing that the effects on it of the government's condemnation action here were such as to give cause to... a cause of action to them for what amounts to inverse condemnation, in effect, to force payment and damages or alternatively by way of interest for their loss suffered before date of payment."
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2086.943,2087.583,Um-hm.
1983.82-1994,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2087.583,2109.2,"Now, in your brief, you indicate that a landowner can get damages on an inverse condemnation theory for adverse effects on the property caused by the condemnation proceedings, but only for effects over and above collateral consequences."
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2109.2,2109.465,Right.
1983.82-1994,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2109.465,2112.293,"Now, what do you mean by collateral consequences?"
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2115.432,2135.595,"Well, there are... In the eminent domain jurisprudence, it is fairly well established that there are collateral consequences that are... that may be suffered by the landowner when eminent... when his property is taken."
1983.82-1994,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2136.672,2137.094,What are they?
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2137.094,2148.277,"--A couple of examples would be if he... his business is destroyed, if--"
1983.82-1994,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2148.277,2157.178,Could there be any collateral consequences for unimproved realty that you can think of?
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2157.178,2183.076,"--Yes, I suppose financing problems, or... I mean, the collateral consequences really are the... they relate to the particular value of this property to the landowner."
1983.82-1994,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2232.977,2241.004,"Well, could there be any so-called collateral consequences in this type situation for unimproved realty?"
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2241.004,2246.003,"I find it very hard to think of any, and--"
1983.82-1994,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2246.003,2247.815,What if access were cut off?
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2250.423,2264.137,"--I suppose that could be a... Well, no, that's the kind of consequence... I mean, that could be a situation where you would have a taking by inverse condemnation."
1983.82-1994,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2264.137,2269.212,But there would have to be a remainder there for taking access.
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2278.319,2293.764,"Well, what I was thinking of was if the landowner owns property in the middle of a project, and the government takes the property... takes the property all around it so that he can't get into his property."
1983.82-1994,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2293.764,2296.31,As is so often the case in highway construction.
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2301.746,2335.951,"But our basic point really is that those kinds of damages are... they are damages that are unrelated to the standard procedures for inverse condemnation, where the government comes in and says, we're going to take the property, and files their complaint, and then the commission determines the value of the property."
1983.82-1994,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2374.326,2377.263,Is that an inverse condemnation suit?
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2377.263,2378.886,That's an inverse condemnation claim.
1983.82-1994,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2378.886,2382.979,And the property owner has to file an entirely separate suit?
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2382.979,2384.275,In the... in the--
1983.82-1994,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2384.275,2388.946,And the court in the condemnation action can't take account of those damages in any away?
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2388.946,2389.602,--That's--
1983.82-1994,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2389.602,2391.678,That's your position?
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2391.678,2394.959,"--That is our suggestion, yes."
1983.82-1994,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2394.959,2398.583,Has that been determined?
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2403.282,2412.873,"Well, in some sense yes, it is... I mean, it is... this is a tough question."
1983.82-1994,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2421.916,2425.758,I am confused by your answer to Justice O'Connor's question.
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2444.64,2445.203,That's right.
1983.82-1994,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2445.203,2448.014,That just compensation did not include that kind of damages.
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2448.014,2448.358,That's--
1983.82-1994,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2448.358,2453.34,So why talk about bringing an action under the Tucker Act for collateral consequences?
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2454.996,2456.589,--That is absolutely right.
1983.82-1994,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2460.338,2463.54,But your brief said they could be.
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2467.226,2502.774,"--Our point is that when... what you have in the... under your Tucker Act, you go into the Court of Claims, and the Court of Claims then has to decide what you are asserting... whether what you are asserting are legitimate inverse condemnation claims or whether they are simply collateral consequences, and that, if they are collateral consequences, you don't get any recovery for them."
1983.82-1994,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2508.178,2516.238,"But you are quite certain that they'd have to file a separate suit, the landowner, which seems so unfair."
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2516.238,2535.463,"Well, the problem is that Congress has said that claims arising under the Constitution against the United States are to be tried in the Court of Claims only if they are over $10,000."
1983.82-1994,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2622.055,2627.881,You are saying all the commissioners value is the full fee interest--
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2627.881,2629.833,"Well, or whatever--"
1983.82-1994,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2629.833,2638.423,"--If you are talking about a temporary taking or something like that, you are talking about something that is measured by quite a different measure--"
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2638.423,2644.31,"--Yes, it is simply a valuation situation."
1983.82-1994,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2644.31,2662.022,"--It does seem kind of difficult to me if you are talking about the same piece of property, if there is a claim of another kind of taking, of a taking of a less than a full fee interest, that the landowner would have to file an action separately in the Court of Claims."
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2662.022,2689.324,"Well, as I say, it may be that there is some kind of a pendent jurisdiction, but my main point is that what the landowner has to show in his inverse condemnation suit is something that is far beyond anything that the landowner here has even started to show."
1983.82-1994,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2693.946,2705.879,"Well, is it the government's position that the filing of the papers doesn't inflict any injury on the--"
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2705.879,2708.66,It certainly is.
1983.82-1994,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2709.582,2717.358,--But we must know as a practical matter that that... that it does damage the property owner.
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2717.358,2752.469,"--Well, what the petitioner is claiming is that he has got a cloud on his title, that the cloud really kind of arises gradually, it starts at the point when the interest in acquiring the land focuses and, you know, before the statutes passed it kind of increases as the statute is passed, and then when the land is identified and finally when the condemnation suit proceeds."
1983.82-1994,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2752.469,2764.48,"Let's take a practical situation in this area recently, Highway 66, which was seven, eight, nine years in construction."
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2789.315,2791.611,And they remained in possession all that time.
1983.82-1994,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2791.611,2801.357,"--No, many of them were torn down by the governmental action, demolished long before payment was made."
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2801.357,2840.933,"Well, if in fact they were... the government entered into possession and filed a declaration of taking, it had to make a payment at that point, and to the extent that that payment didn't cover the amount that was actually ultimately determined, then the landowners were entitled to interest, but absent any such payment or entry into possession, the landowners under the federal scheme remain in possession."
1983.82-1994,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2846.651,2851.133,You don't thank their prospects of selling the property are impaired?
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2851.133,2873.532,"Well, the point is, this cloud on the title, it may as a practical matter affect what the landowner can do, but that will be simply because of the subjective reactions of the landowner and the people that he wants to deal with."
1983.82-1994,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2873.532,2875.656,"Well, is that necessarily true, Mrs. Shapiro?"
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2884.448,2885.838,"No, I really--"
1983.82-1994,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2885.838,2887.51,"In the real world, you don't think so?"
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2887.51,2891.397,"--Well, in the real world, it may, and the--"
1983.82-1994,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2891.397,2897.41,That's the one your friend thinks he is in.
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2899.957,2916.184,"--But... well, as far as he is concerned, in his real world, he has held this property since at least 1949, and the only difference... he has never cut the timber."
1983.82-1994,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2957.37,2959.276,"Ms. Shapiro, one point."
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2963.337,2964.962,There is a cloud on the title.
1983.82-1994,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2964.962,2966.179,"Well, isn't that a damage?"
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2966.179,2968.787,"Well, in some cases--"
1983.82-1994,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2968.787,2969.616,Or am I just playing with words?
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2969.616,2985.251,"--In some cases, it may be a damage, but the point is that in other cases, the landowner may vastly prefer to remain in possession rather than to be put out of possession."
1983.82-1994,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2985.251,2992.67,"Well, suppose somebody comes to him and says, I would like to buy your property for $18 million, but it has to be done today."
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,2992.67,2997.854,"Well, he can sell it."
1983.82-1994,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2997.854,3000.868,You think anybody would buy it?
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3000.868,3005.132,"Well, I doubt that anybody would come to him."
1983.82-1994,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3005.132,3006.21,That's right.
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3006.21,3007.069,But--
1983.82-1994,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3007.069,3010.333,"But if they did come, then he could sell it?"
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3010.333,3012.161,--Sure he could sell it.
1983.82-1994,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3014.145,3022.469,"Ms. Shapiro, a moment ago Justice Marshall asked you if there weren't a cloud on the title as a result of the condemnation proceeding, and you said yes, there was."
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3025.75,3043.023,"--What I understand it to mean is that there is going to be... people are going to act as though the landowner can't... I mean, they will be less willing to buy and sell, or they will be less willing to deal with it."
1983.82-1994,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3043.023,3046.038,People will do what they do when they know a condemnation action is--
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3046.038,3046.507,Yes.
1983.82-1994,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3046.507,3053.768,--You don't understand the cloud on the title in that sense to suggest any question about the owner's ability to pay fee title?
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3053.768,3055.581,"Oh, no, no, no, absolutely not."
1983.82-1994,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3172.018,3177.796,"So long as he recovers interest from the date of taking, if the judgment isn't paid."
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3177.796,3185.606,"Well, if the government is taking, but our point is that in straight condemnation cases of course we haven't taken until we pay the judgment."
1983.82-1994,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3387.915,3394.756,"But that doesn't lay down any rule, the government's situation, the fact that they can agree on something."
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3394.756,3415.778,"That's true, but the point is that it's... what you have to be concerned about is the market value of the land, and not the interest rate, and our point is that the proceeding is not probably going to be a very complicated one."
1983.82-1994,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3422.978,3425.9,Courts can't deal with the value.
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3428.305,3430.57,It is the commission's--
1983.82-1994,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3430.57,3431.023,Yes.
1983.82-1994,1,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3431.023,3431.6,--Yes.
1983.82-1994,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3543.18,3543.835,Very well.
1983.82-1994,2,32550,joe_g_roady,,3545.273,3546.179,"Yes, please, Your Honor."
1983.82-1994,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3546.179,3549.334,You have three minutes remaining.
1983.82-1994,2,32550,joe_g_roady,,3549.334,3552.925,Thank you.
1983.82-1994,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3728.026,3730.775,What if we agree with you that interest does run?
1983.82-1994,2,32550,joe_g_roady,,3732.557,3740.397,--We have submitted to the Court that the rate is a question which should be discussed in this case.
1983.82-1994,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3745.238,3746.301,Do you think the Constitution requires that?
1983.82-1994,2,32550,joe_g_roady,,3746.301,3747.723,"--I do indeed, Your Honor."
1983.82-1994,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3750.067,3750.614,"Thank you, counsel."
