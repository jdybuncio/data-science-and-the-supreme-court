2009.09-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.737,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-497, Rent-A-Center West v. Jackson."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,7.787,14.76,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The agreement between Antonio Jackson and Rent-A-Center should be enforced as written."
2009.09-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,51.949,55.551,But not to the question of which parties have agreed to arbitrate?
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,55.551,56.753,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2009.09-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,56.753,59.519,Not the question of which parties have agreed to arbitrate?
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,59.519,64.089,Which parties can be potentially scope issues and which parties potentially as well.
2009.09-497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,80.534,95.211,"But if -- if fraud in the inducement, I take it, is considered -- even if you have a very broad arbitration clause, as we do here, fraud in the inducement is considered a question for the court, not the arbitrator; is that right?"
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,95.211,96.728,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.09-497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,96.728,99.496,So why should unconscionability be treated differently?
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,99.496,110.387,"Justice Ginsburg, fraud in the inducement, pursuant to Prima Paint, goes to the making of the agreement, and under section 4, the court retains decisions over the making of the agreement."
2009.09-497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,119.243,120.426,Why is it post-formation?
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,136.952,141.422,"--In some instances, Justice Kennedy, duress could be; for example, a gun to somebody's head."
2009.09-497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,150.159,159.515,"Well, I'm not sure what procedural unconscionability, but this is -- as Justice Ginsburg indicates, it's not clear to me why this isn't a formation issue."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,159.515,163.383,--Formation is a very basic existential analysis.
2009.09-497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.487,184.811,"I guess you could argue that on its face the agreement is so one-sided, so unconscionable, that one of the parties must have been coerced into signing it."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,186.763,188.699,"--Justice Scalia, you could make that argument--"
2009.09-497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,188.699,190.432,Has -- has that argument been made here?
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,190.432,196.268,"--There was an argument made that it was one-sided, but it was the same type of argument that pertains--"
2009.09-497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,196.268,204.291,"Was the argument made that because it was so unconscionable, the employee must have been coerced into making it?"
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,204.291,205.541,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.307,208.074,I didn't think it -- it had been made.
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,208.074,212.111,--Getting back to Justice Ginsburg's question about making--
2009.09-497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,212.111,212.661,I'm a little puzzled.
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,216.58,225.686,"--Justice Stevens, the argument was that there was unequal bargaining power because Mr. Jackson was the -- a putative employee and Rent-A-Center was the employer."
2009.09-497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,265.996,267.23,You have--
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,267.23,271.9,"Now, in some instances, the courts will make decisions as to attacks such as unconscionability."
2009.09-497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,273.017,299.817,"--Counsel, is your problem with unconscionability being -- as described by the Chief Justice or Justice Scalia, being forced to or coerced into signing something -- that's okay for the courts, but this type of argument that goes to the unfairness of the process, that's for the arbitrator; is that your position?"
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,299.817,301.186,"--That's -- that's right, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.09-497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,301.186,304.288,So why -- isn't that an unwieldy rule?
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,320.547,328.236,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, unconscionability and fairness attacks go to post-formation issues that -- that are--"
2009.09-497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,328.236,335.859,We just gave you one that didn't: If someone was forced into signing the agreement in an unconscionable way.
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,335.859,342.746,"--But, Justice Sotomayor, if for example it's fraud in the inducement, such as in Prima Paint, that does go to the section 4."
2009.09-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,363.04,369.11,But I suppose that the substance of the agreement -- maybe this is just the same question as Justice Scalia's.
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,375.764,377.548,Well--
2009.09-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,377.548,378.716,And that is for the court.
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,378.716,390.789,"--If -- if there is something in the agreement that would indicate that there was not mutual assent, as in somebody put a gun to somebody's head, somebody forced them to do it, that would be for the court."
2009.09-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,390.789,391.939,"No, the point is -- it's not that."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,400.812,402.129,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.09-497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.741,421.393,I don't agree with that.
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,457.216,466.988,"--Justice Scalia, under the section 4 analysis, in the making there needs to be some evidence that it was forced, the gun to the head example."
2009.09-497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,493.055,494.888,You don't think that could be used along with other evidence?
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,503.458,505.844,--It certainly would not in and of itself be enough--
2009.09-497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.844,509.296,But you could use it as evidence if there's other evidence supporting that.
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,510.747,514.849,"--Your Honor, you would have to look at the objective manifestation of mutual assent."
2009.09-497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,516.384,518.401,I think you can answer that yes or no.
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,525.823,527.692,"--Justice Scalia, I don't think so."
2009.09-497,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,534.013,537.215,And that's no matter how one-sided?
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,552.808,572.638,"Justice Stevens, if there is an issue about arbitral access, as in there is a block at the door, you cannot get a ticket to the show, because of some impediment in getting to arbitration in the first place, under the Court's principles announced in Randolph and in First Options, you must have access to the arbitrator."
2009.09-497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,581.158,594.134,"What about the specific examples he gave, that the -- just take that the -- that the employee must bear all the costs of the arbitration, win or lose, that's the provision."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,602.49,607.125,"--Justice Ginsburg, if it's simply a complaint about the fairness, it would not be."
2009.09-497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,608.144,608.577,But is it?
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,626.539,628.122,"--It could, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.09-497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,686.641,687.307,"Yes, that's -- that's true."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,768.693,776.049,"Justice Breyer, under section 4, which is the enforcement mechanism, the court is limited to make decisions about the making."
2009.09-497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,787.007,806.984,"Well, making itself could be, but I think that's a harder question, whether a -- certainly if the person says you see my signature there; that's not mine; that's Joe Banana's, who tries to imitate me -- there is no contract, and no matter what it says, it doesn't go to the arbitrator."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,870.224,878.897,"Justice Breyer, Jackson, first and foremost, did not ever complain that the arbitrability provision, the clear and unmistakable delegation provision, is unconscionable."
2009.09-497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,878.897,882.032,He's not saying that this whole arbitration clause is unconscionable?
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,882.032,883.817,He's complaining that generally it's unconscionable--
2009.09-497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,883.817,884.717,"Well, all right."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,889.519,897.275,"--Justice Breyer, this is really very similar to First Options, in which the party said: I'm not party to the agreement; the scope does not cover--"
2009.09-497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,897.275,899.81,"Yes, and in First Options, we said it wasn't clear and unmistakable."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,899.81,903.529,"--The Court said it was not, but in First Options the Court set out the rule--"
2009.09-497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,903.529,905.262,And the rules were what I just described.
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,905.262,914.134,"--The rule is -- in this case, there is language that has never been contested, and that language clearly and unmistakably says that the arbitrator has exclusive authority."
2009.09-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,933.281,945.506,"So your position is that the arbitrator gets to decide questions of unconscionability, but the court gets to decide whether the arbitrator can do that?"
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,945.506,950.557,"In some instances, Justice Roberts -- Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct."
2009.09-497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,967.667,971.035,"Well, do you understand -- and we can ask the Respondent."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,985.545,986.545,He has made generalized--
2009.09-497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,986.545,995.334,"Because the complaint is a bare-bones complaint, and I don't know if there's anything in the pleadings that reflects what his answer to that question would be."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,995.334,1000.721,"--Justice Kennedy, he has attacked certain provisions specifically of the agreement."
2009.09-497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1015.861,1020.432,"But all of the arbitration agreement, not the employment contract as a whole."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1020.432,1024.217,"Justice Ginsburg, it is a stand-alone four-page arbitration agreement."
2009.09-497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1024.8,1026.567,So let's go back to that.
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1045.296,1046.713,"--We agree, Justice Breyer."
2009.09-497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1046.713,1046.98,Okay.
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1063.756,1065.691,We agree--
2009.09-497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1066.108,1065.691,Okay.
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1067.208,1067.208,--because that's part of the fraud issue.
2009.09-497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1067.208,1067.574,Okay?
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1101.526,1103.976,"No, Justice Breyer, that would be a very different situation."
2009.09-497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1108.844,1121.77,"Do you agree that a contract cannot be unconscionable unless it was coerced, that a finding of unconscionability is the same as a finding of coercion?"
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1122.62,1124.12,"--No, there could be other types of unconscionability."
2009.09-497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1124.12,1125.139,"Yes, but that's what I want the answer to."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1128.757,1140.832,"With respect to procedural unconscionability, issues of unequal economic bargaining power, which is essentially what we have here -- those are non-issues that cannot be addressed by the arbitrator."
2009.09-497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1147.653,1149.005,But I'm not interested in arbitration law.
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1176.838,1183.076,--It does not rise to the same level as something that's fraudulent or something that is forced with a gun to your head--
2009.09-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1183.076,1189.23,"I would have thought the answer to your -- the answer to your answer would be, well then, the -- you're more likely to win on that question."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1211.826,1225.634,"--Mr. Chief Justice, most everything is for the arbitrator, and I want to distinguish between unconscionability, as Justice Breyer is referring to, and access issues and issues that go to the making, because there is a very bright line."
2009.09-497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1249.599,1250.201,Can you--
2009.09-497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1250.201,1263.426,"Mr. Friedman, this contract is -- is unusual in that, as Judge Hall said, it was more employee-friendly than most."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1317.077,1322.379,"Justice Ginsburg, there will be court review at the end pursuant to section 10."
2009.09-497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1327.433,1328.849,But it was very limited review.
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1340.341,1342.693,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.09-497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1354.314,1355.75,"--Once again, has this argument been made here?"
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1376.58,1378.03,"Justice Scalia, that's absolutely correct."
2009.09-497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1385.151,1386.686,How could it be in the district court?
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1391.055,1396.208,"--But, Justice Ginsburg, at the district court no evidence of any sort attacking any provision."
2009.09-497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1400.326,1405.397,"I thought you were making, in answer to Justice Scalia, the question -- he said, well, they didn't raise it."
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1418.205,1422.507,"--Justice Ginsburg, my point simply is they put in no evidence of any sort attacking anything."
2009.09-497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.84,1423.757,Can they make it here now?
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1429.994,1430.844,--I -- I--
2009.09-497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1430.844,1435.315,"--that since they didn't have an opportunity to make it in the district court, they can make it in the Supreme Court?"
2009.09-497,0,39292,robert_f_friedman,,1435.315,1441.485,"--Justice Scalia, they could make that argument before the arbitrator, and the arbitrator could make that decision."
2009.09-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1539.213,1540.482,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,1551.688,1567.715,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Petitioner would have the Court adopt a rule whereby agreements to arbitrate are presumed enforceable before their validity has been determined by a court under section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act."
2009.09-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1577.071,1583.058,Could you describe for us what is unconscionable about this contract?
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,1594.831,1615.327,"Yes, Your Honor, that -- that what is unconscionable about this is it's unusually one-sided in that the issues that are most important to Mr. Jackson, such as his racial discrimination case, he is required to arbitrate, but those issues that might be most important to the Petitioner, such as trade secrets and unfair competition, they are not bound to arbitrate."
2009.09-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1615.86,1622.414,"I would have thought the issue would be -- it's odd to say, I think, that if you have 10 provisions, some are unconscionable and some are not."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,1648.11,1660.501,"--If I understand Your Honor's question, the -- the threshold determination must first be made by the court under section 2 as to whether there is unconscionability either of the entire agreement or any of the provisions."
2009.09-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1670.606,1684.616,"No, my point is that once you get past that gateway question of whether the formation of the contract was not unconscionable, then claims that particular provisions were unconscionable are by definition for the arbitrator to decide."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,1684.616,1693.805,"--No, we would disagree with that, and here's why, Your Honor, and I think this goes to something that Justice Sotomayor asked, which is it creates a very difficult rule to deal with."
2009.09-497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1708.315,1724.991,"Why is that -- why is that a big concession, because I thought, as the First Circuit said, if argument is the -- the contract is illusory, that goes to the court, but here the only claim is unconscionability."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,1728.561,1735.215,--The -- the reason it's a concession is because that's not their original position and that's not the question that they presented to this Court.
2009.09-497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1735.215,1740.203,"But if they -- if they made that concession, so what, under the First Circuit's reading?"
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,1740.203,1746.44,"The First Circuit, Your Honor, we believe did not interpret this correctly."
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1768.936,1770.019,Is that -- is that right?
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,1800.869,1815.962,"Well, the problem is, Your Honor, and if I understand Your Honor's question correctly, that determination must of course be made by the court, because the arbitrator doesn't have any authority to do anything until the requirements of section 2 are met."
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1817.728,1830.619,"No -- I mean, you -- I thought you were saying that if we allow this to go to the arbitrator, the arbitrator can simply disregard the question of unconscionability."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,1830.619,1832.087,"That -- in essence, yes."
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1832.087,1832.821,And that's not my understanding.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,1859.972,1870.262,"Respectfully, I -- I disagree with that, and here's why, Your Honor: The back-end review -- presumably it would be, I believe, under section 10(a)(4) that he exceeded his authority."
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1888.141,1894.878,That doesn't mean -- does that mean he can disregard -- let's assume the contract is a contract to maim.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,1918.306,1921.443,"I think the concern is, Your Honor, and it's hard to draw the line--"
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1921.443,1922.66,Can he ignore the State law?
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,1922.66,1928.347,--I think there's no adequate review if he chooses to without the court's review of--
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1928.347,1928.697,Is that right?
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,1935.101,1944.29,"--Your Honor, I would hope they would, but I -- in reading the narrow review of section 9, 10, and 11, I don't think we have that guarantee."
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1944.29,1948.093,"I think you have a misunderstanding of the law, then, if that's what you believe."
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1951.462,1960.485,"What is -- what I'm not sure about what you are arguing now is my -- as I came into this, I thought there were three situations."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,1975.995,1977.028,Right.
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1977.028,1985.201,"As to that one, we assume that the parties intended the question of arbitrability to be arbitrated; we assume it."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2060.062,2061.93,"That -- Your Honor, it would be the second one."
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2062.947,2069.268,"Well, the second one -- I don't see how you get there, because if it's the second, one you concede that there is an arbitration agreement that's valid."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2084.01,2085.462,"--But we don't concede that, Your Honor."
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2089.431,2090.931,As to each provision?
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2093.216,2095.668,Because that's the mandate of section 2.
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2097.603,2118.1,"But suppose you and your -- your client -- rather, your client and the other side have absolutely agreed, clear as could be, under the arbitration agreement: We want arbitrated too whether the provision that these words are contained in is unconscionable."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2120.733,2130.241,"--Your Honor, the parties are -- don't necessarily have to take every issue to court, but should a party challenge that issue as unconscionable, that door should remain open."
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2135.562,2135.645,Okay.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2164.729,2170.699,"Your Honor, it is our position that -- that the threshold determination as to the validity of the contract--"
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2170.699,2171.568,"Right, but if you're going to say yes--"
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2171.568,2172.201,--would go the court.
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2172.201,2176.02,"--then I think if you're going to say yes to that, then it's contrary to First Options, I think."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2177.972,2187.578,"Well, Your Honor, I think that what Your Honor is describing is the first part of First Options that looked -- and that's what the Petitioner would like to rely on, is objective contract language."
2009.09-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2210.793,2211.326,After this--
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2211.326,2211.809,--saying both--
2009.09-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2211.809,2226.469,"--After this suit was filed and both parties are going up the steps to the court, could the attorneys and the parties stop and say let's arbitrate this issue of unconscionability and pick an arbitrator?"
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2226.869,2236.158,"--They -- I think the answer there would be yes, but the door needs to be open in case there is a challenge, Your Honor."
2009.09-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2236.991,2237.408,"No, then -- then the--"
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2237.408,2238.308,--required to go to court.
2009.09-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2238.308,2241.96,--Then the employee loses.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2246.93,2250.048,I think if Your Honor is asking--
2009.09-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2250.048,2257.821,"Because, you see, if you say yes, that they can arbitrate this, then the question is why can't they do it when the contract's signed?"
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2257.821,2260.273,"--Again, Your Honor--"
2009.09-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2260.273,2264.641,"Let's assume that the answer to my question is yes, they can put that to an arbitrator."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2274.414,2276.799,"--Well, we don't concede that it clearly does that."
2009.09-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2278.549,2280.934,"I'm -- I'm asking, assume you do?"
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2280.934,2290.956,"--I don't think that gets us around the requirements of section 2, Your Honor, that says the court and the doors to the court must always remain open for that."
2009.09-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2290.956,2291.406,I thought your--
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2291.406,2292.474,I hope I'm understanding your question.
2009.09-497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2292.474,2308.084,"Mr. Silverberg, the section 2 on which you place much emphasis just says that agreements are enforceable save on such grounds as exist in law or equity for revocation of a contract."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2313.305,2326.53,"That's true, Your Honor, the -- but the logical reading of that statute would indicate that these three elements -- a writing, in interstate commerce, and not revocable at law and equity -- would have to be met before the arbitrator has any authority to do anything."
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2345.359,2354.382,"I read your -- I promise you I'll go back to First Options, which I thought was of gem-like clarity--"
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2356.382,2357.234,That's because it was well argued.
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2357.234,2358.484,--the only one in the world who thinks that.
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.5,2360.9,"You wrote that, didn't you?"
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2362.619,2365.054,--I'll go back to that and look at it.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2371.458,2371.874,Yes.
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2371.874,2382.164,"--it seemed to me you said here that -- that because of your -- your position, your client's position, that the whole thing is unconscionable."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2383.516,2389.852,"Well, we said that -- it was certainly my position that the entire agreement was unconscionable based on Nevada law--"
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2389.852,2390.285,Yes.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2390.285,2420.122,"--And that it was so incredibly one-sided, and also the limited discovery provisions, and also because, frankly, we are not looking to treat this anything other than like we would ordinary contract law that also strikes one-sided provisions in -- for example, in Nevada, the Fick case, which would strike down a one-sided prenuptial agreement, or lease agreements that have one-sided attorney fee provisions are routinely struck down as one-sided."
2009.09-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2420.872,2423.49,But which is the stronger case for arbitration?
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2443.218,2451.454,--I think this Court has made clear in the severability cases that challenges to the contract as a whole would go to the arbitrator to decide.
2009.09-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2453.97,2458.691,"I find that somewhat paradoxical, but I -- I agree that that -- that that's the law."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2458.691,2463.428,"--So the stronger one would be an -- as this case, which we believe is very strong, an attack--"
2009.09-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2463.428,2477.42,"So if you do go to the State court, suppose the State court says: I can't really decide this question about the one clause unless I determine the conscionability or the unconscionability of the entire contract, and I now proceed to do that."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2479.355,2492.162,"--I think that's what sections 3 and 4 contemplate, is for -- and they have been in existence since the passage of the Act -- for parties to come in and make their case as to whether or not the FAA would apply or not apply."
2009.09-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2492.162,2494.947,But suppose the State court judge says that he has to look at the whole contract.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2498.149,2501.887,"That's not the situation in this case, but assuming it were--"
2009.09-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2501.887,2503.47,"What's your -- no, it's a hypothetical case."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2503.47,2503.953,--I understand.
2009.09-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2503.953,2508.541,"What would your position be in the hypothetical case, representing your client?"
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2508.541,2520.282,"Representing my client, who is Mr. Jackson, I would want the court to look at the whole thing, but if I were in the Petitioner's shoes I think I would have an argument that, based on this Court's precedent--"
2009.09-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2520.282,2523.883,And what do you think the judge should decide as between those two possibilities?
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2523.883,2527.502,"--If it's an attack on the contract as a whole, it should go to the arbitrator."
2009.09-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2536.006,2543.843,"Counsel, I think I heard Justice Kennedy's question to be -- let's not confuse the contract as a whole."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2545.445,2546.145,--Correct.
2009.09-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2546.145,2547.145,It's an agreement to arbitrate.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2547.145,2547.545,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.09-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2547.545,2559.086,"So an attack on the -- as I think Justice Breyer noted, you -- an argument that it's one-sided goes to the entire arbitration agreement."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2563.307,2563.89,Correct.
2009.09-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2563.89,2565.859,"That, you say, is for the court."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2565.859,2566.492,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.09-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2566.492,2581.201,"The difference here is that there are provisions within how the arbitration is going to be held that, standing alone, you think are unconscionable, even though the agreement to arbitrate is not."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2583.617,2584.569,"No, Your Honor."
2009.09-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2596.46,2610.969,"You see, that's what I'm confused by, because when I first asked you this question, you said: I would be happy to arbitrate if the court struck the discovery provision and, I guess, the fees provision."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2614.021,2623.444,"I'm giving you the one I just gave you, I think, Your Honor, which is we've got both certain provisions that are unconscionable, that under Nevada law render the entire agreement unconscionable--"
2009.09-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2623.444,2623.877,Okay.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2624.694,2624.944,--and that's what the Court is to rely on.
2009.09-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2624.944,2625.26,--Okay.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2653.593,2656.279,"That would be the court under our position, Your Honor, and that--"
2009.09-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2656.279,2656.629,"--No, that can't be right."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2687.415,2687.498,--Well--
2009.09-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2687.498,2688.998,I know you're arguing in the alternative.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2697.854,2700.204,"--Your Honor, that is our position."
2009.09-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2715.36,2719.312,"Well, it's a matter -- it may be a matter of State law, but the open question is who gets to decide it."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2719.312,2720.514,"--Right, and our--"
2009.09-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2720.514,2722.95,Arbitrators decide matters of State law all the time.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2722.95,2724.15,"--Certainly, they do."
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2734.656,2749.515,"Let's assume Nevada law says you cannot -- you cannot fire somebody for coming in late to work any fewer than 10 times, all right?"
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2794.31,2810.486,"--No, Your Honor, and here's why: I think Your Honor has described a situation similar to -- I believe that was the Green Tree situation, where there was an allegation that the entire contract was illegal, the usurious contract."
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2828.947,2839.736,"Well, your -- your position seems to be that unconscionability is the same as coercion in the making of the agreement."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2841.421,2852.877,"Well, Your Honor, respectfully, in Doctor's Associates, I think the Court spoke very clearly that fraud, duress, and unconscionability are there and are part of something that can be raised under section 2."
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.745,2855.929,"No, I don't care what we--"
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2855.929,2856.181,--where fraud--
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2856.181,2857.914,--I don't care what we said in dictum.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2864.434,2866.45,"--To -- oh, I'm sorry."
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2866.45,2874.623,--that you can -- you can be a stupid person who voluntarily signs an unconscionable contract.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2888.215,2889.915,"Not under section 2, Your Honor."
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2904.223,2906.258,Why is that?
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2906.258,2906.875,--and other unconscionability challenges didn't go to the court.
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2906.875,2907.441,Why is that?
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2917.149,2933.842,"All of them should go to the court, Your Honor, based on this Court's holding both in Doctor's Associates and Prima Paint, in that both fraud in the inducement, like in Prima Paint, and unconscionability envision a situation where you've got a formed contract that people can choose to opt out of."
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2956.791,2957.707,But not every contract.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,2976.818,2983.191,My understanding is that it's so unfair that it couldn't really be said that a party assented to -- to that.
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2983.691,3001.236,"See, that's what I wonder, that last part -- is it that the basic theory is we want to protect a group of people by -- who voluntarily entered into contracts by giving them the right to opt out, or is is that we don't think that they really meant to do it?"
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3001.236,3002.769,"--It's the latter, Your Honor."
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3004.27,3004.504,Okay.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3034.957,3037.492,--If I understand your question--
2009.09-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3037.492,3039.628,"You said ""all"", and I just don't think you meant all."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3042.98,3057.322,"--I -- I think that the safe thing to do is to keep the door open to people, especially in situations like this, where there is such unequal bargaining power, where people are presented with a nonnegotiable term of their employment--"
2009.09-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3057.322,3057.738,May I ask this kind of elementary question?
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3057.738,3058.255,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.09-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3058.255,3068.194,"Are there cases out there that hold that an agreement can be partially unconscionable, that it's unconscionable for some clauses but not in its -- in its entirety?"
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3068.194,3069.713,Certainly.
2009.09-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3072.915,3074.498,But there are cases that -- that draw that distinction?
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3074.498,3075.165,--I'm sorry.
2009.09-497,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3075.165,3078.734,There are cases drawing that very elementary distinction?
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3078.734,3079.65,"I believe so, Your Honor."
2009.09-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3097.129,3108.504,Does it make a difference in response to Justice Stevens's hypothetical that there is a provision saying the arbitrator will decide the conscionability of all clauses?
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3121.577,3124.427,If the agreement -- I think I understand your question.
2009.09-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3127.731,3129.014,Right.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3129.014,3147.625,"--there's no unconscionability challenge to that, and there's no other fraud in the inducement or any other thing that the court has mentioned it would go to the broader view of making the grounds for revocation, if those grounds for revocation are not present, then I believe the arbitrator would be empowered to make those decisions, Your Honor."
2009.09-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3147.625,3155.029,Can I ask you just a follow-up on Justice Breyer's hypothetical to you where he had the first agreement and then the issue to the second?
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3159.949,3179.078,"I think the door should be open on all the agreements, because until that door is open under section 2 -- as long as that door is open under section 2, then we don't have the concern about parties making the terms of arbitration so onerous or burdensome that they would not be able to even access the arbitral forum."
2009.09-497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3193.337,3194.154,Mr. Silverberg--
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3194.154,3194.687,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.09-497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3194.687,3217.62,"--on that, underlying your whole case I think is the notion that this is an adhesion contract; it's a take-it-or-leave-it contract, very common in consumer, credit card agreements, in employment contracts, that one party has no say except to sign or not to sign."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3230.76,3233.962,"I would suggest, Your Honor, that they all are subject to that."
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3250.638,3253.84,"Not much use signing an arbitration agreement then, not much use for the employer."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3260.742,3261.66,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3261.66,3262.96,"I mean, kiss good-bye to arbitration."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3262.96,3263.827,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3263.827,3264.244,No?
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3264.244,3267.564,That door's been open under section 3 and 4 since the inception of the Act.
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3298.131,3300.5,The amici certainly claim the contrary.
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3307.237,3335.071,"--We disagree with them and Your Honor, and I would cite that we have some of the most prestigious arbitrators in this country that have joined our position and recognized the courts' vital role in maintaining the fairness of the arbitration process so the public can trust it and so the weaker parties to these agreements can be protected, because should that disappear, there will be nothing to stop stronger parties from again sending Mr. Jackson, who lives in Reno, to Minnesota to arbitrate his claim."
2009.09-497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3335.071,3335.321,"Well, this--"
2009.09-497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3335.321,3335.787,There--
2009.09-497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3335.787,3342.408,"--This clause is not of that kind, and you've singled out three things that made it unconscionable."
2009.09-497,1,28706,ian_e_silverberg,,3371.825,3373.427,There -- there is something unusual.
2009.09-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3381.831,3382.449,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-497,2,39292,robert_f_friedman,,3384.699,3386.901,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.09-497,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3464.881,3465.167,All right.
2009.09-497,2,39292,robert_f_friedman,,3495.769,3496.435,"Justice Breyer, I'm sorry."
2009.09-497,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3497.185,3498.721,"They said, look, there's a four-page document."
2009.09-497,2,39292,robert_f_friedman,,3516.081,3521.65,"--No, Justice Breyer, the determination of unconscionability is for the arbitrator."
2009.09-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3528.021,3553.206,"The problem -- I -- I keep going back to my initial question to you, is you want to parse out what making is from unconscionability, and you want us to say, well, if it's too onerous a fee for arbitration, that goes to the making, because you're depriving the party of -- of an arbitration forum."
2009.09-497,2,39292,robert_f_friedman,,3564.145,3576.285,"--No, Justice Sotomayor, our argument about the onerous fee -- and it would have to be evidence put in by the party opposing counsel -- by the party opposing arbitration, that there was an actual barrier, an impossibly burdensome barrier."
2009.09-497,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3615.243,3622.73,"If there's no access to arbitration, there's no way that you can leave that issue to the arbitrator, is there?"
2009.09-497,2,39292,robert_f_friedman,,3622.73,3624.182,"--Exactly, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-497,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3624.182,3625.366,Because you never get to the arbitrator.
2009.09-497,2,39292,robert_f_friedman,,3625.366,3626.801,"Exactly, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3657.281,3659.45,"Thank you, Mr. Friedman, Mr. Silverberg."
