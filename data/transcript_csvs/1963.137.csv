1963.137,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6261.406,6261.692,Is that right?
1963.137,2,30278,j_franklin_fort,,6261.692,6274.854,"-- that's not correct because it says that we unqualifiedly accepted the charter but we accepted it with the qualification that if this provision was unlawful, we would have a right to raise the issue --"

1963.137,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6920.53,6921.311,Why?
1963.137,2,30278,j_franklin_fort,,6921.311,6924.141,Because this is a minimum and a maximum.
