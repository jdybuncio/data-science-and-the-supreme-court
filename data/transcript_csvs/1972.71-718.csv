1972.71-718,0,35627,michael_colodner,,4.146,8.058,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-718,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,75.964,84.205,How does the state institution go about evaluating the good behavior of a man who is not in their custody?
1972.71-718,0,35627,michael_colodner,,84.205,90.237,There is no way for the state to evaluate the good behavior of a man was is not in their custody.
1972.71-718,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,90.237,96.556,"But you want credit for it even though they have no way of evaluating it, isn’t that the essence of this case?"
1972.71-718,0,35627,michael_colodner,,96.556,103.791,The essence of this case is that plaintiffs say that they wish to be credited for this time and the state contends —
1972.71-718,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,103.791,117.538,Would this be an irrebuttable presumption that during the 11 months period this behavior was good as defined by the state institution?
1972.71-718,0,35627,michael_colodner,,117.538,124.251,"Well, if we were to accept the reasoning of the District Court judge we would have to -- may have any irrebuttable presumption to that fact."
1972.71-718,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,125.488,135.343,"Even though his behavior might have been such as in the state institution, it would be rated as very bad."
1972.71-718,0,35627,michael_colodner,,139.49,158.748,"That is true, but the real problem with this case presents is that the concept of good behavior in a county jail over and apart from the supervisory problem and the evaluation problem is totally different from the concept of good behavior in a state prison after someone has already been convicted and is now part of a rehabilitation program."
1972.71-718,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,193.331,216.51,"Is there any classification process, at the detention level, as have the state level when they get into the penitentiary, do they undertake to classify people in categories of either skills or psychological--"
1972.71-718,0,35627,michael_colodner,,216.51,222.553,"Your Honor, there is an orientation program when someone reaches the state penitentiary he goes to a receiving center."
1972.71-718,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,222.553,225.018,"No, but in the jail I am speaking of."
1972.71-718,0,35627,michael_colodner,,225.018,227.125,There is nothing in the county jails at all.
1972.71-718,1,32978,jeffrey_sorge,,1683.811,1693.115,Your Honor I believe it would be very difficult to really answer that question if it refers to a penal institution in France.
1972.71-718,2,35627,michael_colodner,,3390.638,3392.553,"Your Honor, I have two minutes --"
1972.71-718,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3392.553,3394.814,"Yes, you have a few minutes left."
