2008.08-214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.237,"We'll hear argument next in Case 08-214, Atlantic Sounding v. Townsend."
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,7.087,20.996,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Townsend is a Jones Act seaman who seeks punitive damages for the willful failure to pay maintenance and cure."
2008.08-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,76.916,88.356,"Mr. McCreadie, in this case, why is it necessary to get into that, whether they are punitive damages under FELA and the Jones Act?"
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,144.644,149.179,"--First, Justice Ginsburg, those are just allegations."
2008.08-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,150.548,160.404,"Yes, but -- but now we're at the pretrial stage, and we're supposed to assume the truth of the allegations in Townsend's complaint."
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,173.295,190.189,"--Well, if -- if those allegations are true, there's no distinction between the willful wanton misconduct that traditionally has been the subject of the dispute about maintenance and cure and punitive damages as opposed to those allegations."
2008.08-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.189,194.125,But let's take this out of the maintenance and cure spot altogether.
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,210.353,212.539,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there is a remedy."
2008.08-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,229.714,241.356,I thought that all that was at stake there was whether the employer wrongfully withheld maintenance and cure that was owing.
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,280.516,283.801,I think there's a -- there's a number of potential sanctions.
2008.08-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.289,291.439,Is any of them called punitive damages?
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,293.257,294.374,"No, I do not."
2008.08-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.374,303.347,"--And punitive damages, of course, requires that you first find the guilty person to lose the case."
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,312.118,312.818,I -- I agree with--
2008.08-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.818,314.487,"We've got to call it something else, don't we?"
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,314.487,315.754,--I agree with your position there.
2008.08-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,337.52,338.003,How many--
2008.08-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,338.003,349.827,But do you read Vaughan v. Atkinson as necessarily implying punitive damages would be inappropriate?
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,371.674,372.109,--No.
2008.08-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,406.414,407.18,Whose dissent was that?
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,412.668,420.34,"I do -- I do not believe -- it is coming Justice Harlan, but I just -- I just cannot say off the top of my head who wrote the dissent."
2008.08-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,420.34,421.857,--But you said never in the history.
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,457.263,474.224,"Justice Ginsburg, I made the distinction between there's no case in the history of the United States before Vaughan v. Atkinson awarding punitive damages to a seaman, a Jones Act seaman, for the failure to pay maintenance and cure."
2008.08-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,542.869,551.456,Did this Court ever hold that under FELA or under the Jones Act there are no punitive damages?
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,554.24,562.246,"No -- no, there is no specific holding, and I would point out that if there was, that would answer our question today and we wouldn't be here."
2008.08-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,606.192,610.394,"Well, but that -- but that was a common law wrongful death action, correct, Miles?"
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,610.394,612.513,Miles was--
2008.08-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,612.513,614.798,It was not admiralty maintenance and cure.
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,614.798,618.833,"--Justice Kennedy, Miles was a wrongful death action."
2008.08-214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.055,685.311,"Excuse me, that the maintenance and cure claim could proceed or that the punitive damages claim could be made?"
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,685.311,687.244,--You're absolutely correct.
2008.08-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,701.654,708.14,"Mr. McCreadie, there's a question about this case, a troublesome feature of it."
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,779.503,790.627,"--I certainly agree with you, Justice Ginsburg, that the answer to this case answers the question of what damages are available under the Jones Act and -- and FELA."
2008.08-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,970.362,988.84,"As -- as I read your reply brief -- and please correct me if it's a misimpression -- you didn't dispute the fact that punitive damages were available historically for the shipowner's wrongful refusal to provide maintenance and cure, or am I wrong about that?"
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,988.84,1008.987,"I -- that must have been the Respondent's brief, because our position is -- is -- hopefully was clearer than that, that punitive damages have never been awarded in the history of the United States for the willful failure to pay maintenance and cure until after -- until after Vaughan v. Atkinson."
2008.08-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1008.987,1013.991,"And what about English admiralty, under the English precedents?"
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1013.991,1017.093,The -- the English precedents we did not analyze.
2008.08-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1031.067,1036.887,"Of course, in Miles -- again, we're coming back -- was wrongful death, not maintenance and cure."
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1036.887,1047.795,"--Miles was a wrongful death case that analyzed an unseaworthiness cause of action, which is brought under general maritime law."
2008.08-214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1064.407,1069.894,"Of course, your friend on the other side distinguishes that argument by noting that death is different."
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1073.512,1075.062,In that case--
2008.08-214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1075.062,1077.881,--you have different considerations under the maintenance and cure.
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1077.881,1085.035,"--Mr. Chief Justice, that take us back again to Cortes, which this Court has already decided and analyzed."
2008.08-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1140.872,1142.638,I thought there was -- it was on the high seas.
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1153.046,1153.863,That's correct.
2008.08-214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1182.115,1184.234,But that's what the common law was.
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1208.866,1212.468,"Moragne did create some law, yes."
2008.08-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1215.436,1219.74,But I just -- and you can go ahead and answer that question without my interrupting.
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1254.228,1255.58,--That is incorrect.
2008.08-214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1271.44,1272.875,I'm talking pre-Miles.
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1272.875,1279.295,--And I'm saying the cases that are cited in those law review articles -- the purpose of the articles is to criticize Miles.
2008.08-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1300.442,1307.096,"Is -- how many -- how many would you say there are in a typical year, maintenance and cure cases?"
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1316.586,1333.095,"Justice Breyer, because maintenance and cure is so often linked to the Jones Act and the unseaworthy cause of action, and because of the leverage that seems to be brought with punitive damages, they are virtually included in every seaman's case--"
2008.08-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1333.095,1333.595,All right.
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1333.595,1334.161,--from the get-go.
2008.08-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1334.161,1335.13,So how many would you guess?
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1335.13,1344.903,"And -- and I would have to estimate, just extrapolating from my own experience, thousands of Jones Act cases are filed in the country every year."
2008.08-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1344.903,1346.355,Uh-huh.
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1348.288,1349.473,Necessarily they do.
2008.08-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1349.473,1351.59,Can you get punitives under the Jones Act or not?
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1351.59,1354.175,You cannot recover punitive damages under the--
2008.08-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1354.175,1355.544,What about unseaworthiness?
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1355.544,1362.864,--You cannot recover punitive damages under unseaworthiness because that's the same rule that Miles already decided.
2008.08-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1365.482,1377.207,"Okay, so if I have about 30 cases -- no, I had, actually, to be honest, I thought we found about 12 in the period around 1980-2000, where they do give some punitive damages."
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1377.207,1384.361,--And -- and -- and I hope I was clear that the can of worms was opened by Vaughan.
2008.08-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1389.598,1389.948,All right.
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1403.006,1416.931,"There -- there are some pre-Jones Act cases, like the Amiable Nancy, that -- that talk about punitive damages; and there are some cases where some seamen have not been treated very well."
2008.08-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1426.703,1433.19,"Over here, there is one called -- Unica v. U.S. The master should have put the libelant into the hospital, give him $1,500."
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1443.263,1445.748,--The Troop is on the list.
2008.08-214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.826,1468.28,"The Troop gave them $4,000."
2008.08-214,0,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,1478.636,1492.229,"--And our position is that even if there is -- and there is not; let me be clear -- but even if there was one rogue case, one individual case, that does not create general maritime law."
2008.08-214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1624.565,1625.482,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,1634.504,1641.742,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: I would like to start by answering the question that was raised by Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1807.598,1815.102,"Well, surely there will be some incidents in which the employer in good faith thinks that there's no illness, that there's no basis for maintenance and cure."
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,1815.102,1815.818,And absolute--
2008.08-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1815.818,1820.489,"For you to tell me, oh, this will just never happen, I mean, that's -- that's not the way the world works."
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,1820.489,1821.189,--No.
2008.08-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1834.665,1860.214,"Well, of course, there are going to be disputes, and the question is whether or not, just from the standpoint of fulfilling professional responsibility, in almost any maintenance and cure action where the counsel for the plaintiff thinks that -- for the seaman thinks that the employer has been remiss, he doesn't add the punitive damages complaint, if we -- if we agree with your position, which changes completely the settlement and the bargaining aspect."
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,1862.233,1868.136,"--Well -- and I agree, Your Honor, that is a prospect and a possibility, something which I personally abhor doing."
2008.08-214,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1909.462,1918.485,How many of these seamen who seek maintenance and cure are represented?
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,1934.828,1940.566,"Judge, I'd be picking a number out of the air, but I can give you anecdotal evidence of this."
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1990.248,1995.485,"Well, why -- why does joining it to a Jones Act case help?"
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,1995.485,2007.543,"Well, because when you join it to a Jones Act case, you have the substantial possibility of getting either a settlement or a verdict at the end of the case which is going to compensate the attorneys for taking on the maintenance and cure case as a portion of it."
2008.08-214,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2018.518,2030.491,"Well, the -- the point you are making is that the recovery under the Jones Act can be very large, and the attorney on a contingent basis would get a piece of that."
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2030.491,2031.208,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2008.08-214,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2031.208,2038.245,Because it would be swelled by the pain and suffering damages which are not available in maintenance and cure.
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2038.245,2039.431,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.08-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2039.431,2050.12,What is the pre-Vaughan case that awarded punitive damages -- awarded punitive damages in a maintenance and cure case?
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2050.12,2057.143,"Judge, first of all, I would cite to you two cases: The Rolf case, which is a 1924 Ninth Circuit case--"
2008.08-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2057.143,2060.595,I am -- what -- which -- any case from this Court?
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2060.595,2061.228,--No.
2008.08-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2061.228,2061.711,Okay.
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2061.711,2064.297,This issue did not come before this Court.
2008.08-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2064.297,2064.763,Right.
2008.08-214,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2064.763,2069.8,"It hasn't come before this Court under FELA or the Jones Act, either, the punitive damage question?"
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2069.8,2071.383,"It hasn't -- it has not, Your Honor."
2008.08-214,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2071.383,2079.222,Rolf -- Rolf is not a -- Rolf was maintenance and cure and personal injury and unseaworthiness.
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2084.393,2087.495,"We don't, but we know that there was outrage on behalf of the court."
2008.08-214,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2092.447,2104.79,Is it the case that we can't find a single pre-Jones Act case where punitives were awarded and what was sought was maintenance and cure?
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2107.326,2109.176,"--Well, Judge, I would say that--"
2008.08-214,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2109.176,2110.36,What is your best?
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2110.36,2111.91,--Yes.
2008.08-214,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2127.637,2142.999,"So we have a history all the way back to Catherine of Aragon, and what we've been able to find in these pre-Jones Act cases is really two or three, or maybe -- I found ten actually, that I couldn't say--"
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2142.999,2145.032,Judge--
2008.08-214,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2145.032,2148.736,"--Leaning over in your direction, I could take maybe three or four."
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2155.639,2157.591,"--Well, let me -- let me respond to that in a couple of ways."
2008.08-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2230.188,2249.434,"If I thought that the lack of counsel in maintenance and cure cases was a pivotal point or a relevant point for our decision, other than the representations of counsel, where would I look to verify that?"
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2249.434,2253.053,The existence of prior maintenance and cure cases?
2008.08-214,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2253.053,2260.826,The -- the -- that there is a problem in seamen finding attorneys who will take maintenance and cure cases.
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2260.826,2263.409,"Yes, Judge, there is not empirical evidence out there."
2008.08-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2291.678,2302.253,"Well, if -- if the -- if the existence of the punitive damages and maintenance cure were as well established, why wasn't that mentioned in terms in the Vaughan majority?"
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2304.269,2312.841,"Well, it does come up in the Vaughan dissent because it was not requested by the low -- in the -- in the lower courts."
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.374,2339.676,"Do you think Stewart knew more about these -- these obscure, ancient cases than we do?"
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2339.676,2340.778,--I'm sorry?
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2341.461,2346.313,"Do you think he knew more about these obscure, ancient cases than we do?"
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2346.313,2347.348,"--No, I -- I think--"
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2347.348,2354.268,"Had he had the benefit of briefs by Professor Robertson and -- I think not, right?"
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2354.268,2354.434,--No.
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2355.201,2358.486,It was just sort of off the top of his head that he thought there should be punitive damages.
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2358.486,2362.938,--He was quoting from McCormick on damages and some basic treatises.
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2370.294,2375.829,"They -- they normally are, but the question is whether there -- whether this -- this is a different quiver."
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2375.829,2380.815,"--Well, I think that he was saying that this is one of the weapons we have."
2008.08-214,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2387.469,2389.921,And that -- that was not argued by anybody.
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2394.742,2395.659,"No, it wasn't."
2008.08-214,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2412.452,2416.505,With attorneys' fees there is a compensatory aspect.
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2452.012,2454.548,"Judge, I would like you to look at how Congress treats this problem."
2008.08-214,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2498.475,2499.742,Maybe it would be a good thing.
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2499.742,2500.409,Yes.
2008.08-214,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2500.409,2505.063,But the -- the problem here is it has pros and cons.
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2519.054,2519.656,That--
2008.08-214,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2519.656,2523.108,"And so we'd be making this up out of whole cloth, it seems to me."
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2523.108,2524.742,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2530.362,2531.381,We've abandoned that.
2008.08-214,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2531.381,2533.248,--because Miles says don't do that.
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2533.248,2534.014,Exactly.
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2546.14,2546.773,--Well--
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2546.773,2551.509,Do you acknowledge that there are no punitive damages available in the event of death?
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2551.509,2552.544,--Yes.
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2552.544,2558.365,"Well, that -- that -- now, you want to talk about what's a sensible system and what is not a sensible system."
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2579.429,2580.679,"Judge, I--"
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.679,2591.252,"--Is -- is -- is this going to be the same thing, where -- where the shipowner says, well, you know, if -- if -- if I treat him badly enough that he dies, I don't get hit with the punitive damages?"
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2591.252,2593.371,"--I would -- I would hope that would not be the case, Your Honor."
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2593.371,2594.888,"Yeah, but it is invited, isn't it?"
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2594.888,2598.406,"Well, I don't think it is invited, Judge."
2008.08-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2668.919,2670.285,"Well, I'm not sure as sure -- I'm not sure I follow that."
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2681.66,2684.595,"--This is a very narrow area of law, Your Honor."
2008.08-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2690.466,2696.987,"Yeah, but the normal medical malpractice area has given rise to a lot of punitive damage litigation."
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2698.522,2703.807,I think this would be different because all we're talking about is does the seaman get the surgery he needs.
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2713.848,2719.852,"Well, it certainly -- it certainly makes these maintenance and care cases a lot more attractive to the plaintiffs' bar, doesn't it?"
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2726.172,2728.124,"--The goal here, Judge, is not money."
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.474,2731.41,Of course it shouldn't be the goal.
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2744.134,2747.835,--I think it would decrease the incidence when -- when medical care is denied.
2008.08-214,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2747.835,2764.214,"There -- there wouldn't be any maintenance and cure claim if the system worked as it was intended; that is, that if you have a sailor who is injured, the shipowner pays room and board and medical expenses."
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2764.214,2766.181,"That's all it is, Your Honor."
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2799.72,2802.756,I -- I wish it were as clearcut as that.
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2819.468,2820.484,"I don't think so, Judge."
2008.08-214,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2829.922,2831.955,He's going to say that was willful and wanton.
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2836.243,2841.813,--And the court is going to have to -- the district courts are going to have to make a judgment as to the bona fides of that case.
2008.08-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2860.375,2877.153,"Well, I mean, it -- whether it gives rise to more litigation or not, it is still a significant and it will give rise to greater costs on the part of the -- the shipper which will be passed on, as is the case in a lot of areas where you have punitive damages, it will be passed on to the consumer."
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2878.653,2882.105,"If the punitive damages are But the hope, of course, is that--"
2008.08-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2882.105,2883.057,"No, no, even if they're not."
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2891.996,2893.746,--It's going to err on behalf of the seaman.
2008.08-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2893.746,2894.282,Yeah.
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2894.282,2894.815,Yes.
2008.08-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2894.815,2898.484,But that doesn't make -- that doesn't mean there are no costs involved in ruling in your favor.
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2898.484,2899.35,"That's true, Judge."
2008.08-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2926.301,2927.253,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-214,1,26123,gj_rod_sullivan_jr,,2927.253,2928.069,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.08-214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2928.069,2930.121,"Mr. McCreadie, you have three minutes remaining."
2008.08-214,2,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,2930.121,2944.631,"Justice Ginsburg, I wanted to respond first to a question that you asked that I think there may have been some confusion with respect to the answer."
2008.08-214,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2989.493,2990.909,Is that a separate cause of action?
2008.08-214,2,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,2993.295,3003.734,--It's -- it's maintenance and cure and it can be brought either under the maintenance and cure with an injury or it can be brought under the Jones Act.
2008.08-214,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3007.886,3023.565,Are you -- are you then disputing what your colleague said about lawyers being reluctant to take maintenance and cure claims that are not tied with a Jones Act claim?
2008.08-214,2,21192,david_w_mccreadie,,3023.565,3033.17,"Justice Ginsburg, we're relying on Supreme Court precedent as opposed to anecdotal information."
2008.08-214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3122.561,3123.513,"Thank you, counsel."
