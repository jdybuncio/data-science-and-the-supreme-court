1994.93-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,16.36,"We'll hear argument now in Number 93-1456, U.S. Term Limits, Inc., v. Ray Thornton, 93-1828, Consolidated, Winston Bryant v. Bobbie E. Hill."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,17.962,22.08,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,149.513,160.036,Is the theory that by this rotation the policy that the legislators adopt will be different one system than in the other system?
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,168.391,171.193,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1994.93-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,185.686,205.266,"Well, but you're explaining the rationale for the limitation, and I'm asking if part of that rationale is that rotated representatives will vote differently than incumbents would have, would shape public policy in a different way."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,205.266,216.657,"Your Honor, they would be more beholden to the people under the theory of Amendment 73 because they would not be career politicians."
1994.93-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,219.374,225.846,So there would be a difference in the kind and the shape and the policies of the legislation that they would enact.
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,225.846,227.313,"There could be, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,227.313,230.898,"Well, is that the justification for the rule, or isn't it?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,230.898,232.767,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,259.0,263.971,"But once they're denied the ballot access, they're denied it for life, is that right?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,263.971,265.621,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,265.621,273.661,Doesn't the permanency of the denial carry a suggestion of what we would normally refer to as a qualification?
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,273.661,275.696,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,293.907,298.442,"Well, I realize that's your position, but in any case, your position would take us beyond Storer, wouldn't it?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,298.442,299.561,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,299.561,302.93,"Well, in Storer... maybe my recollection is wrong."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,305.715,306.932,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,306.932,315.988,"I mean, if you... you know, had been party-affiliated within a certain period of time, you couldn't be there as an independent, but the next election was coming, and that was a new day."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,317.356,318.773,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,318.773,325.094,So Storer didn't have that implication of permanence which is in fact a feature of the Arkansas system.
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,325.094,345.257,"That is correct, Your Honor, but the State's position is that Amendment 73 is consistent with Storer, the difference being that under Amendment 73 a candidate can actually serve a couple of terms in the Senate, or three terms in the House, so it does not absolutely prohibit a candidate from serving."
1994.93-1456,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,352.446,353.163,General--
1994.93-1456,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,353.163,367.455,"--precedent, any case where a group based on past experience, past lawful experience, has been categorically hobbled in this way."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,375.209,395.523,"Your Honor, to answer your question, the State does not take the position that Amendment 73 is an absolute handicap, because we're dealing with multiterm incumbents who would have great name recognition, resources available to them that ordinary challenges would not have."
1994.93-1456,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,395.523,403.462,"I'm trying to contrast a mere handicap from a hobbling, and it seems to me this falls in the latter category."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,403.462,407.098,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,421.09,436.35,"Well, General Bryant, a good many States have passed so-called term limit measures that just disable a candidate from appearing on the ballot for a short period of time, isn't that correct?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,436.35,437.333,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,437.333,445.139,And Arkansas has a very different provision in that it extends for the rest of that particular candidate's life.
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,445.139,446.907,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,446.907,468.571,"Do you think that there may well be, even if you are correct that it is seen as a ballot access measure, that there may be First Amendment issues at stake here, the associational rights, for instance, of the political party that might want to have the candidate on the ballot as its candidate?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,468.571,469.738,"Yes, Your Honor, there are--"
1994.93-1456,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,469.738,475.808,And are those issues issues that were resolved in the courts below?
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,475.808,477.177,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.177,483.914,"So that would be open on remand, I assume, even if we agreed with you it were a ballot access measure?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,483.914,485.616,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,486.85,495.187,Those... you say the First Amendment issue were presented to the supreme court of Arkansas but not decided by it.
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,495.187,496.539,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,516.534,522.273,"Yes, and what about a State like Hawaii that has no write-in voting allowed at all?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,522.273,524.039,--Your Honor--
1994.93-1456,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,524.039,525.741,Would it become a qualification then?
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,525.741,532.962,"--It would become a qualification at that point, if there is no write-in provision, but even assuming--"
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,532.962,533.695,How is that?
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,557.077,577.574,"--Your Honor, under that scenario, Congress can consider the... obviously can consider under Article I, section 5, the qualifications, and under the position of the State in this particular case, a pure write-in, a pure term limits proposal--"
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,577.574,582.812,"Let's assume in Hawaii the person gets on the ballot by mistake, or in Arkansas."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,587.899,588.399,--If--
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.399,589.816,Reports to Congress.
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,592.75,594.302,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,598.921,601.975,Well then it is a qualification in Arkansas.
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,610.914,615.199,"Your Honor, I was considering it under a pure term limits proposal."
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,615.199,615.949,I'm not talking about--
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,615.949,617.068,Under Amendment--
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,617.068,620.603,"--I'm talking about, Hawaii exclusion from the ballot system."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,630.292,641.183,"--And under the Arkansas system, Your Honor, the Congress could not consider the Amendment 73 proposal as a qualification under that scenario."
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,641.183,643.885,"It seems to me they couldn't with respect to Hawaii, either."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,651.372,652.006,That is correct.
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,652.006,654.241,"And if that happens, you're not unqualified."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,654.241,655.943,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.943,661.847,Could I ask you... you say that this is not a qualification.
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,664.382,665.832,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,665.832,666.166,It is.
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,672.904,678.606,"Neither a qualifica... no, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,678.606,679.725,It's either one or the other.
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,679.725,680.091,It's either one--
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.091,681.677,Everything falls into one or the other category.
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,681.677,682.377,--According to our--
1994.93-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.377,686.712,Which category would a law providing that you only count half the votes of a candidate fall?
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,691.616,696.085,"--That would probably fall under time, place, and manner, Your Honor, but--"
1994.93-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.085,697.103,"Time, place, and manner?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,699.922,700.639,--It would be the manner.
1994.93-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.639,701.405,"The manner, okay."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,701.405,710.828,"But, Your Honor, that would have to undergo First and Fourteenth Amendment scrutiny if that proposal were adopted by the State."
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,710.828,720.968,"If it's time, place, and manner, this means, of course, that the current Congress, composed mainly of incumbents, can simply revise the Arkansas law right?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,720.968,722.401,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,722.401,735.728,"And indeed, the current Congress could revise those laws that don't provide for term limitations or don't provide for exclusion from ballot access to incumbents."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,735.728,736.878,"Yes, Your Honor,--"
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,736.878,746.516,So in effect you could have the Federal legislature doing something that discourages... that discourages incumbency.
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,746.516,749.535,"--Yes, Your Honor, under Article 1, section 4."
1994.93-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,749.535,752.32,What could the Federal legislature do?
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,752.32,763.211,"The Federal legislature, Your Honor, is given authority under Article I, section 4, to override anything the States do in the area."
1994.93-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,763.211,770.882,"Yes, but are you suggesting that it could do... the Federal legislature could do anything more than simply negate a State regulation?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,770.882,771.734,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,771.734,773.817,And what would be the authority for that?
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,773.817,777.685,"Article I, section 4 would give Congress that authority, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,777.685,780.471,To do more than just negate a State regulation?
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,780.471,781.321,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,781.321,787.125,And what part of the language is it of that section that--
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,787.125,808.788,"The term 4, has a very broad, expansive meaning, and during the ratification debates the States were concerned about the fact that under Article I, section 4, Congress was being given the authority which the States concluded would allow Congress to override anything the States did in the area."
1994.93-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,834.439,844.829,"--So that even though, perhaps, a State hasn't acted, Congress could, by law, make regulations governing the time, place, and manner?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,844.829,850.983,"Yes, Your Honor, and in fact Congress could override amendment 73 if Congress so desired."
1994.93-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,850.983,860.339,"But what if Arkansas had made no provision for term limits at all, could Congress step in and make a provision for term limits?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,860.339,864.041,"Yes, Your Honor, under Article I, section 4, Congress could do that."
1994.93-1456,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,864.041,871.314,You've mentioned that there were qualifications that don't come from the Constitution itself.
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,905.885,913.972,"Your Honor, the qualifications that the States could add would all be time, place, and manner under Article I, section 4."
1994.93-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,947.712,950.164,"If you call those qualifications, can the State override them?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,950.164,952.347,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,952.347,953.782,So the--
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,953.782,954.732,I'm sorry--
1994.93-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,954.732,956.068,"--Pardon me, can the Congress override them?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,956.068,957.818,"--Yes, Your Honor, the Congress could under Article--"
1994.93-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,957.818,965.007,"So anything the State adds as either a qualification or a time, place, and manner can be overridden by the Congress?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,965.007,977.397,"--Your Honor, the specific provisions that can be overridden by Congress are the Article I, section 4 grants of authority to the States by--"
1994.93-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,977.397,986.337,"Well, are there some qualifications that the State can add, and I... this was suggested by Justice Ginsburg's question, that cannot be overridden by the Congress?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,986.337,991.491,"--None comes to mind, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,992.591,993.191,General Bryant--
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,996.026,996.909,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,996.909,997.276,Oh.
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,997.276,999.295,Congress can impose additional qualifications.
1994.93-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,999.295,999.945,What's the source for that?
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1001.18,1002.747,"Article 1, section 4."
1994.93-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1002.747,1004.315,That doesn't talk about qualifications.
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1005.682,1018.308,"Yes, Your Honor, but under our definition the Congress can add additional qualifications based on Article 1, section 4 authority, and Congress has done so since the very first Congress."
1994.93-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1019.574,1023.76,You think Congress could pass a statute saying every Senator must be at least 50 years old?
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1023.76,1026.795,--Congress could pass--
1994.93-1456,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1026.795,1027.579,What's your answer?
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1027.579,1027.914,--Yes.
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.151,1033.8,"Now, where do you get that?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1036.02,1038.805,"That comes under Article I, section 4 authority, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1038.805,1040.887,"But that's time, place, and manner, not qualifications."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1045.709,1047.91,"Yes, we make a distinction, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1049.51,1052.529,"Well, you must be... 50 has nothing to do with time, place, and manner of elections at all."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1054.647,1060.901,--The narrow issue before this Court is whether or not Amendment 73 amounts to a ballot access regulation.
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1068.574,1073.043,"Well, I can understand why you argue the States can on the basis of the Tenth Amendment."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1075.728,1078.53,"--And that is under Article 1, section 4, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1078.53,1081.632,"But that doesn't relate to qualifications, that relates to time, place, and manner."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1089.57,1092.689,"Yes, Your Honor, that would be consistent with the State's position."
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1092.689,1093.822,Every qualification--
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1093.822,1094.206,Under that--
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1094.206,1095.724,"--is a time, place, and manner provision."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1095.724,1096.708,--Under that theory we advance.
1994.93-1456,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1096.708,1099.343,"How is the age qualification a time, place, and manner?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1109.199,1122.542,"Oh, Your Honor, that is a time, place, and manner because if the State of Arkansas or Congress did that, that would be... that is constitutional, according to our position, under Article I, section 4."
1994.93-1456,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1128.113,1130.18,"That is a manner condition, as it were?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1130.18,1131.731,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1137.135,1148.943,"Well, General Bryant, this is a very remarkable proposition--"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1149.776,1158.065,"Your Honor, the State's argument is that Amendment 73 amounts to a ballot access regulation."
1994.93-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1177.978,1184.866,"But what we're interested to know is, does it follow from that that the Congress could not override that qualification?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1190.786,1196.274,"Because, Your Honor, that qualification would be adopted under Article I, section 4."
1994.93-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1196.274,1197.924,"Well, but then we're right back where we're--"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1197.924,1198.292,Yes.
1994.93-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1198.292,1209.498,"--Let's assume that we tell you that under the Constitution we think there are two things, two semantic, two juridical categories, one qualifications and the other time, place, and manner."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1228.478,1229.545,Under that--
1994.93-1456,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1229.545,1249.892,"And the gravamen of the argument is it would be very strange to allow Congress to override a time, place, and manner regulation, but not to override a greater restriction, which is a qualification, and you're not answering that argument because you keep resorting to Article I, section 4, but that's a very odd interpretation."
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1249.892,1254.712,"--Your Honor, under that scenario, then the States would have the authority under Amendment 10."
1994.93-1456,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1260.116,1266.853,"On that assumption, may we put the question directly that Justice Kennedy alluded to?"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1294.52,1297.389,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.334,1323.273,"Or you might have responded that perhaps they were willing to trust the Federal Congress with respect to the relatively minor matters of time, place, and manner--"
1994.93-1456,0,29280,j_winston_bryant,,1330.527,1331.463,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1332.196,1342.484,"Mr. Kester, we'll hear from you."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1342.484,1346.055,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1456,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1350.84,1362.648,"Mr. Kester, do you adopt the same argument as your predecessor here about everything is either a qualification or a time, place, and manner?"
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1362.648,1365.434,"--No, not precisely, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-1456,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1486.546,1500.738,"Well, Mr. Kester, let me ask you this, do you this Congress has the power under Article I, section 4, to adopt precisely the kind of law that Arkansas has applicable to all States?"
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1500.738,1501.072,No.
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1572.585,1577.473,"More specifically, gives you the power to override that State authority if it exists under 10."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1581.274,1608.777,"--Right, but we're talking now, as I understood it, Justice Scalia, we're talking about Congress just acting in the first instance, and I'm saying the reason Congress could not do this just by itself in the first instance, say we're going to pass a statute imposing term limits, is furthermore that you have another provision which we haven't talked about yet this morning, and that's Article I, section 2, Clause 1, and that says the people shall choose their representatives in the House of Representatives."
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1615.264,1616.68,"Let me ask you about the Tenth Amendment, before we get--"
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1616.68,1617.064,Surely.
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.064,1617.48,--too far away from that.
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1617.48,1618.08,Surely.
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1618.08,1647.499,"If that is the source of the State's power that you assert would justify this piece of legislation, then I assume that the State could also say that the State's electors shall not vote for a President who, in addition to having the qualifications set forth in Article II of the Constitution, has certain other qualifications."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1648.449,1650.451,Now we're talking about a different provision of the Constitution.
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1651.535,1652.218,"Yes, we are--"
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1652.218,1652.653,Right.
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1652.653,1653.92,--but the Tenth Amendment hasn't changed.
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1654.737,1655.522,"Right, but I--"
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.522,1666.145,"If they can add conditions to whom its citizens may vote for for their representatives, why may it not add conditions to the person for whom its electors may vote for as President?"
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1666.145,1671.032,"--Justice Scalia, I would say that the Tenth Amendment applies differently in different situations, and you have to--"
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.032,1672.899,"Oh, that's very convenient, but I don't know why."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1673.501,1680.47,"--Because the question would be, in your case of the presidential electors, it's like the case of Williams v. Rhodes."
1994.93-1456,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1719.31,1729.118,"But the test of whatever the State does, did I understand you to say that it could be overridden by Congress, but Congress has to come second?"
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1729.118,1730.535,--The Congress--
1994.93-1456,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1730.535,1734.337,"Whether the State is acting under the Tenth Amendment, or whatever source."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1734.337,1743.026,"--I believe, Justice Ginsburg, that the proper understanding of section 4 is that was the check that the Framers intended to place on the States."
1994.93-1456,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1746.663,1750.699,"Well then, time, place, and manner is not a limitation, as you see it."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1760.137,1764.291,"Any of those things which would be Fourteenth Amendment issues, yes."
1994.93-1456,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1772.295,1788.324,"--So we should forget all about the way we use time, place, and manner in the context of the First Amendment where it's a limited category of things that don't go to the core of free expression, but here you say it covers everything."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1788.324,1801.381,"Here we're construing specific language in the Constitution, and it's different, and the power given to Congress was broad enough to do whatever was necessary to keep the States from passing inappropriate legislation."
1994.93-1456,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1801.381,1806.035,But I don't see why it isn't also broad enough to authorize Congress to act in the first instance.
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1806.035,1816.574,"It is... Justice Souter, in the first instance, it may well be, but then Congress is checked in a number of ways, and in some ways that the State isn't, particularly if you look--"
1994.93-1456,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1816.574,1817.676,You mean by other provisions of the--
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1817.676,1818.259,--By other provisions.
1994.93-1456,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1818.259,1818.659,--Yes.
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1818.659,1838.006,"And in particular, Article I, section 2, Clause 1, which here is a source of the State's power, an independent source of the State's power, but when Congress acts, it becomes a restriction, if anything, on Congress' power, because there you have Congress going in and saying to the people of the State, you can't do what you want."
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1838.006,1844.326,"Well, if that is a restriction, it just negates... it just negates section 4."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1844.326,1846.409,To that... to that--
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.409,1847.278,Whatever the people--
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1847.278,1847.594,--If--
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.594,1848.544,"--do is okay, so... right?"
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1848.544,1849.911,--No.
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1851.23,1853.348,"You can't possibly read it that broadly, or it negates section 4."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1853.348,1854.148,No.
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1857.717,1862.871,"So long as the people of a State vote for this time, place, and manner restriction, Congress can't do anything about it."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1862.871,1864.121,"We're... no, no, no, no."
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1865.072,1866.572,That's what I thought you were saying.
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1866.572,1867.689,"--I did not express myself clearly, then."
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1867.689,1869.191,"Or I didn't understand clearly, I guess."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1869.191,1870.441,"Well, whatever--"
1994.93-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1895.609,1897.342,May I ask this question to be sure I understand your theory?
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1912.018,1918.272,"--Well, yes, I think they could, because otherwise you're driven, and this is where some of the argument--"
1994.93-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1918.272,1922.708,But then you're adopting the Attorney General's position that a manner includes a qualification.
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1922.708,1928.127,"--What I'm saying is, yes, manner is the broad word... that's the hook--"
1994.93-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1928.127,1929.479,Which includes qualifications?
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1929.479,1930.096,--Surely.
1994.93-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.348,1934.131,"Well, it doesn't have to."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1943.171,1959.766,"--Otherwise Article IV, the power of Congress in Article IV would make no sense, because then you'd be in a position, and this is where the Solicitor General's argument leaves you, is saying that Congress would have the power to override minor State laws but not huge--"
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.766,1965.902,"It would make no sense unless there is a prohibition upon additional qualifications, in which case it would make perfect sense."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1965.902,1966.619,--And... and--
1994.93-1456,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1966.619,1969.371,It only would make no sense under your theory of the Constitution.
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1969.854,1980.179,"--And... but I submit that my theory of the Constitution, Justice Scalia, has historical validity and makes sense when you--"
1994.93-1456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1980.179,1992.304,"Under your theory, Mr. Kester, could Congress say that no person shall be a Senator who is not over the age of 25 and have that the controlling qualification?"
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,1992.304,2009.015,"--I... if Congress or the States passed a law that was absolutely flat-out contrary to those provisions in Article I, if they've made it contrary to it, then that would be unconstitutional just on the face of it."
1994.93-1456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2009.015,2019.537,"How about saying no person over 50 under 50, saying... you know, Congress obviously was... the Framers were concerned about age, 35, and you know, we're also concerned about age."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2024.108,2039.951,"I think there you've got legislation going right at the heart of provisions that were put in the Constitution, and it could be that those are minimum qualifications, or it could be that they could be enhanced with respect to age or district residence."
1994.93-1456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2039.951,2041.987,"So what's your answer, under your theory?"
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2041.987,2048.239,"My answer, sir, is that it would never stand up under the Fifth Amendment, under Article I, section 2."
1994.93-1456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2048.973,2053.627,"But it could stand up under the framework we're talking about now, Article I?"
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2053.627,2059.411,"--Possibly in the first instance, but it hardly matters because it would so clearly violate those other provisions."
1994.93-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2059.411,2061.147,Why would it violate those other provisions?
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2067.034,2068.301,"Well, I think--"
1994.93-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2068.301,2069.203,I just don't understand that.
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2069.203,2069.603,--Well--
1994.93-1456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.603,2073.022,We've held age is not a suspect classification.
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2073.022,2076.706,"--I think in that case it would be, and in looking at it as a suspect--"
1994.93-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2076.706,2081.527,"Well, then the constitutional provision is invalid, the 35-year thing is irrational under your approach."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2085.395,2087.697,"--Well, it would have to be judged."
1994.93-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.716,2094.168,And not under the Qualifications Clause?
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2094.168,2105.19,"The Qualifications Clauses are there... if a law is enacted that this Court believes contradicts those qualifications, that would be unconstitutional."
1994.93-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2105.19,2110.261,"No, it's just merely what I thought was your basic position, that the State has every right to impose additional qualifications if it wants to."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2110.261,2110.878,Yes.
1994.93-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2110.878,2113.48,And I don't know why 40 years is any different than being an incumbent.
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2113.48,2119.716,"Oh, but my position is not that the State can come in and impose any qualification it wants to, it's that the State--"
1994.93-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2119.716,2121.318,"Well, any reasonable qualification."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2121.318,2126.353,"--Well, any qualification that doesn't violate the other restrictions on the States, the Fourteenth Amendment."
1994.93-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2127.155,2132.793,"I just have to say, I don't see why the 40-year thing would violate the Fourteenth or Fifth Amendment."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2132.793,2138.547,"--I defer to your judgment on that, but the analysis, Justice Stevens, would be an analysis--"
1994.93-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2138.547,2142.982,"Well, if the analysis takes you to the conclusion it does not violate the Fourteenth, then you'd have to face up to the question--"
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2142.982,2143.415,--Yes.
1994.93-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2143.415,2149.403,"--whether they can have an additional qualification, which is what I thought this case was all about, but you seem to say they cannot have certain additional qualifications."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2149.403,2153.373,"No, I said... I said if they have one that's absolutely contradictory, but if it's not--"
1994.93-1456,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2153.373,2155.323,"Well, why is 40 contradictory to 35?"
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2156.158,2159.526,--I'll defer to Your Honor on that.
1994.93-1456,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2159.526,2170.466,"--Mr. Kester, let's take an age... you can't run after the age of 70, instead of upping the age from 35, a mandatory retirement."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2173.418,2181.44,"Well, it would be very much like Gregory and Ashcroft, wouldn't it, because that was upheld, a mandatory retirement was held not to violate the Fourteenth Amendment."
1994.93-1456,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2182.457,2192.498,"So if that was the qualification, nobody can run in this State after the age of 70, the State could do that, and that would be a qualification--"
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2192.498,2195.45,--The States have done things like that for 200 years.
1994.93-1456,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2207.274,2210.126,--There are States that have said you can't run after the age of so-and-so for Congress?
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2210.126,2211.309,"Mm-hmm, and--"
1994.93-1456,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2211.309,2214.828,"You said States have done that for years, put--"
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2214.828,2223.434,"--Oh, not... not that, but States have added qualifications since the very beginning, and incidentally, they called them time, place, and manner regulations."
1994.93-1456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2223.434,2224.969,"--Thank you, Mr. Kester."
1994.93-1456,1,31320,john_g_kester,,2224.969,2226.203,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.93-1456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.203,2228.338,"Mr. Cohen, we'll hear from you."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2228.338,2238.193,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2292.244,2296.03,"Why didn't they put it differently, then, Mr. Cohen?"
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2325.882,2326.834,"Well, of course--"
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2326.834,2344.36,"But they took the circuitous route of saying, no person shall be a representative who shall not have attained the age of 25 years, been 7... in other words, you can't, unless you have these conditions, but that isn't to say that just because you meet these conditions you are eligible."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2346.795,2347.847,--I agree that the constitutional--
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2347.847,2349.247,--pointed this out in the first congressional debate on the matter.
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2349.247,2354.818,--I agree that the constitutional text doesn't resolve the issue because it phrases it that way.
1994.93-1456,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2387.122,2390.241,"Well, you say the House Committee on Elections, Mr. Cohen."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2394.978,2400.347,"The full House didn't adopt the report, but I think it did accept the House committee's view."
1994.93-1456,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2421.645,2422.528,"Well, that's very speculative, isn't it?"
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2436.305,2437.105,We don't know--
1994.93-1456,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2437.105,2438.022,We simply--
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2438.022,2439.59,"--of course, why anyone voted."
1994.93-1456,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2450.113,2458.969,"--Well, what... how does the fact that the scholarly understanding... does that elevate what actually happened into something different?"
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2459.838,2461.671,"--No, of course not."
1994.93-1456,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2509.152,2511.521,"Well, now you're not talking about the McCreary case."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2511.521,2513.223,"Well, I'm... I'm leading up to it."
1994.93-1456,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2514.806,2515.925,We've only got 40 minutes.
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2515.925,2516.591,--Okay.
1994.93-1456,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.838,2538.804,"More clearly than Hamilton, isn't he?"
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2538.804,2545.444,"Well, I think Hamilton, when he referred to the legislature, was referring to Congress, but I think Madison is talking about the States."
1994.93-1456,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2545.444,2547.727,What was the... do you remember the phrase in 52?
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2552.531,2553.648,Well--
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2553.648,2561.62,"If it does, he was making a mistake, wasn't he, because he also was excluding the States' power to change the qualifications of electors--"
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2561.62,2562.287,--No.
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.287,2563.255,--which it obviously could.
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2563.255,2563.638,No.
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2585.002,2585.469,That's not much of a fixing.
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2590.723,2594.757,Madison uses the word 52--
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2594.757,2596.292,Why say it's a mistake?
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2596.292,2621.075,"--in relation to... in relation to the State constitutional provisions on this point, and he says that... in effect that these are fixed because the States and the people of the States won't allow changes in State provisions for voting for the most numerous branch of the State legislature, so we've dealt with that problem."
1994.93-1456,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2628.764,2629.748,Before you do that--
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2629.748,2630.314,--we'd like to disqualify--
1994.93-1456,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2630.314,2642.655,"--Mr. Cohen, may I ask whether in your view we owe any kind of precedential respect to the interpretation of history in Powell v. McCormack?"
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2661.319,2674.46,"--I think that Powell is a very persuasive opinion, and the Court should find it persuasive."
1994.93-1456,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2686.367,2692.354,Did Powell at this point purport to go beyond the decision whether Congress or a House of Congress could act?
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2694.706,2695.54,--It seems to me--
1994.93-1456,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2695.54,2711.834,"--and it seems to me that that's the limitation... with the possible exception of your reference to 52, which I'm not sure of, that seems to me the problem with some of the, or at least the limitation on the cites to the debate text and say, Federalist 60."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2725.475,2740.235,--The... it seems to me that Powell rests on the proposition that the qualifications were fixed in the Constitution and could not be supplemented legislatively.
1994.93-1456,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2740.235,2742.521,"Well, I think you're mistaken on that, Mr. Cohen."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2751.809,2768.421,"Yes, but as this Court explained in the Judge Nixon case, the basis for that holding was not an aspect of the judging power as such, it was the fact that the... or that Article I, section 2, fixed qualifications that could be applied."
1994.93-1456,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2787.649,2788.667,"And so the ultimate holding, wasn't it?"
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2788.667,2797.94,"The ultimate holding, I agree, but the logical foundation was that, and it then seems to me that the extension to the States is straightforward."
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2809.665,2815.985,"But it can't possibly be straightforward, because Congress would need to have been given the power to make the alteration."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2832.095,2835.713,I agree that I need to go on to talk about those points.
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2838.832,2841.2,"We're going to have you do that, but you're trying to not have to do it by saying--"
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2841.2,2841.366,--No--
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2841.366,2841.616,--we've decided it--
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2841.616,2842.166,"--No, no, no."
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2842.166,2842.666,--already in Powell.
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2842.666,2843.166,No.
1994.93-1456,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2891.063,2901.871,"Well, Mr. Cohen, we have Storer, for example, which certainly prevented a candidate from appearing on a ballot at least for a period of time."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2905.656,2906.672,That's right.
1994.93-1456,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2907.691,2913.928,And so in theory this provision may not be a qualification at all.
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2913.928,2914.528,--No.
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2953.12,2959.707,"Those things, if you do it on those bases it converts itself from a time, place, and manner restriction to a qualification?"
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2959.707,2960.107,--Yes.
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2960.976,2966.313,"If it's a qualification, I assume that the House would sit in judgment of whether that qualification was met."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2966.313,2973.217,--I do not think that either the States or Congress may add qualifications.
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2982.073,2984.541,You can't serve if you don't have it.
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2984.541,2986.541,--that says you can't serve if you don't have it.
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2986.541,2987.91,And that's not the case here.
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2987.91,3011.009,"That is not the case here, but the State also may not keep off the ballot in order to disadvantage somebody who lacks a substantive personal characteristic because the Constitution leaves those questions to the voters every second year."
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3011.009,3016.413,"Well, maybe, but certainly not because the State is adding an additional qualification."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3022.817,3024.784,I will accept that with this exception.
1994.93-1456,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3075.65,3077.483,May I just go back to Storer for a moment?
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3087.79,3090.142,Yes.
1994.93-1456,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3136.838,3137.623,Orderly elections.
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3138.89,3139.29,It's orderly elections.
1994.93-1456,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3192.842,3198.496,--You justify sore-loser statutes on the basis that they are procedural.
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3198.496,3212.355,"Yes, and there's a good deal of, in addition to text, legislative history that supports this reading."
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3304.365,3312.537,"Mr. Cohen, what is your view as to whether something can be neither the one nor the other, neither a qualification nor a time, place, and manner restriction?"
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3314.323,3318.625,I don't... if you mean by that something--
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3318.625,3319.977,--Some restriction that is--
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3319.977,3320.46,--permissible--
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3320.46,3321.927,"--Something... no, not permissible."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3321.927,3322.56,--Well--
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3322.56,3328.231,"Something that... whether it's permissible or not, is there anything that does not fall within one or the other category?"
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3334.986,3335.869,"--No, I think--"
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3335.869,3339.188,"You say it's impermissible, but not because it is technically a qualification."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3339.188,3339.638,--That's right.
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3341.14,3342.74,"But it's also not a time, place, and manner."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3342.74,3343.19,--That's right.
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3343.675,3346.71,"So it is a third something-or-other, but an impermissible third--"
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3346.71,3347.36,That's right.
1994.93-1456,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3382.383,3386.419,--Are you abandoning the position of the Arkansas supreme court that it was a qualification?
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3386.419,3388.204,--I think what... I'm--
1994.93-1456,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3388.204,3388.871,Yes or no.
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3388.871,3389.887,--I'm--
1994.93-1456,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3389.887,3396.041,Because that was part of the rationale of their decision.
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3396.041,3403.381,"--I am... I am reading... if that's the premise as to what it says, my answer's no."
1994.93-1456,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3408.701,3411.819,You're conceding that this is not a qualification in this case?
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3411.819,3421.425,I am arguing that it was appropriate for the Arkansas supreme court to say is does--
1994.93-1456,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3421.425,3423.208,"I understand that, but are you conceding that it's not a qualification?"
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3423.208,3425.294,--I'm willing to... yes.
1994.93-1456,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3425.66,3427.329,It's a rather major concession.

1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3429.112,3430.531,"--It's a very reasonable one, Mr. Cohen."
1994.93-1456,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3431.398,3435.435,That's not how I understood your brief.
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3442.256,3447.243,"I think that's important, and I don't think that I've made a significant concession."
1994.93-1456,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3471.108,3474.893,"Well, but you begin with the major premise that a qualification cannot be added."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3474.893,3475.527,--Yes.
1994.93-1456,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3475.527,3479.012,"And then you say... and then you say, and this is so like a qualification that it must be invalid."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3479.631,3513.702,"Yes, but I also say... but I also say that even if it is not a qualification, it is something that the States have no power to do, because the States have, as Congress has, only the power that is granted to them under the Time, Place, and Manner Clause, and the Time, Place, and Manner Clause does not... and the Time, Place, and Manner Clause does not authorize States to draw this kind of substantive distinction in the course of setting procedures for elections."
1994.93-1456,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3513.702,3526.076,"--I take it your position is, is that the State can require, or the State can be forbidden from requiring its officeholders to have the same qualifications as its electors?"
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3526.076,3528.695,Yes.
1994.93-1456,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3542.204,3545.423,So that a State could bar a felon from voting but not for running for office?
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3545.423,3554.362,"Yes, because one is a matter of the State's business, and the other is not, not for running from office... not for running from Federal office."
1994.93-1456,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3561.432,3572.074,"Mr. Cohen, what about a law that just prohibits ballot access for one election, for example?"
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3572.074,3575.025,I think--
1994.93-1456,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3575.025,3576.441,Do you make exactly the same argument?
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3583.529,3599.391,"--I make a distinction, but the distinction I would draw is that it seems to me the lifetime inability demonstrates the falsity of the suggestion that this has something to do with incumbents."
1994.93-1456,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3631.362,3643.253,"Well, I don't know what kind of a line you end up with in examining Storer and knowing what is time, place, and manner regulation and what isn't."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3648.824,3654.042,"--Well, there may be some difficult cases in drawing lines."
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3719.768,3723.403,"Mr. Cohen, maybe you think this is a clear case."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3737.162,3741.097,"Story only... I mean, Jefferson only in one letter in 1814, but okay."
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3741.097,3742.514,A letter he never retracted.
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3785.626,3791.964,"I think actually, if you sort through the lengthy appendices attached to the petitioner's briefs, there's very little there."
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3823.585,3824.685,District resident qualifications.
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3824.685,3834.226,District resident qualifications strike me as the kind of thing that somebody might... they certainly were imposed.
1994.93-1456,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3854.121,3857.472,"But there were quite a few of them, and they persist."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3860.108,3871.749,It's possible that not every State went back and read the annals to see the McCreary episode and immediately repealed its statute.
1994.93-1456,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3885.159,3885.709,By what authority?
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3888.694,3891.813,By several State and lower Federal courts.

1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3893.515,3897.633,"Actually, yes, I think most of the cases are fairly recent."
1994.93-1456,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3955.172,3956.988,"--Thank you, Mr. Cohen."
1994.93-1456,2,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,3956.988,3957.688,Thank you.
1994.93-1456,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3957.688,3959.39,"General Days, we'll hear from you."

1994.93-1456,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4000.448,4003.133,You agree that was not the holding of the Powell case.
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4003.133,4020.761,"I do, Mr. Chief Justice, but I also want to underscore the fact that this Court, after an exhaustive review of the preconstitutional... the constitutional convention, the ratification, and the post-ratification history, concluded that those requirements were fixed in the Constitution."
1994.93-1456,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4023.396,4024.998,"That's dicta, is it not?"
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4024.998,4026.715,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.93-1456,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4026.715,4028.467,And we don't... we are not bound by dicta.
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4028.467,4042.96,"That is correct, but I think that this case does not necessitate this Court's reviewing the history that it found in Powell v. McCormack, and much of the evidence that's been brought forward was addressed by this Court here."
1994.93-1456,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4042.96,4060.421,"Well, how about the McCreary episode, where now it appeared apparently to the Powell court that the committee report had the same validity as another committee report which was adopted by the full... now it appears this report was not adopted by the House."
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4065.825,4070.111,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that's one piece, and I think my cocounsel is correct."
1994.93-1456,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4070.111,4072.813,"Well, falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus."
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4073.629,4081.769,"Well, I... Mr. Chief Justice, I would be the last person to suggest that this Court was in error when it reviewed the history in Powell v. McCormack."
1994.93-1456,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4081.769,4084.621,"We're all in big trouble if that maxim is going to be applied, I must say."
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4085.437,4089.972,Let's look at the argument that the petitioners have put forward.
1994.93-1456,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4218.857,4222.642,And I believe listed the language from section 4.
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4222.642,4223.126,Yes.
1994.93-1456,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4277.609,4280.811,"If it's a qualification, Congress has to be able to judge it."
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4299.474,4307.311,"If Congress can rely only upon the textual qualifications, then they cannot exclude him."
1994.93-1456,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4307.311,4308.33,"No, no, no, no, no."
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4311.865,4312.632,Yes.
1994.93-1456,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4312.632,4320.137,"Assuming it's a qualification, and a valid qualification, I don't see how any congressional committee could possibly exclude him."
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4322.02,4323.255,"I agree with you, Justice, Souter--"
1994.93-1456,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4323.255,4323.639,He is not--
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4323.639,4324.139,--that there would be no--
1994.93-1456,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4324.139,4325.089,--disabled from serving.
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4325.089,4326.591,--There would be no point of reference.
1994.93-1456,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4335.697,4337.463,I suggest the reason is because it is not a qualification.
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4350.087,4351.956,"--Justice Scalia, I--"
1994.93-1456,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4351.956,4353.491,That seems to me to say it's not a qualification.
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4359.562,4360.828,"--Well, I do argue that--"
1994.93-1456,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4360.828,4364.03,"--but you're trying to argue that it is itself a qualification, and that just flies--"
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4364.03,4365.882,"--It doesn't really make any difference, Justice Scalia--"
1994.93-1456,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4365.882,4366.216,--Okay.
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4366.799,4367.416,--Because... because--
1994.93-1456,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4367.416,4368.268,That argument I can understand.
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4368.268,4369.034,"--All right, fine."
1994.93-1456,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4386.545,4391.181,"But if you make that argument, what do you do about the Tenth Amendment, with these--"
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4391.181,4392.533,I would agree with my cocounsel--
1994.93-1456,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4392.533,4396.235,--Why doesn't the Tenth Amendment preserve the right of the States to use all the flying objects it wants?
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4396.868,4434.943,"--Justice Stevens, I think this Court has made very clear that the Tenth Amendment restates divisions of authority that are provided elsewhere in the Constitution, and the very idea that the Tenth Amendment could give the States the power somehow to fill in the gaps with respect to the Federal structure when we're talking about provisions that do not grant Congress explicitly the power to address them, or deny to the States explicit power to deal with them, that somehow the Tenth Amendment provides that power."
1994.93-1456,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4458.742,4459.611,Before you leave that--
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4459.611,4460.611,"--Yes, Justice Breyer."
1994.93-1456,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4460.611,4472.401,"--could I go back to what I think is Justice O'Connor's question, which is, I take that your basic position is that no additional qualifications can be provided by States."
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4472.401,4473.285,That is correct.
1994.93-1456,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4473.285,4473.785,All right.
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4479.139,4480.091,That is correct.
1994.93-1456,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4480.091,4492.565,"Birth would be no good, property would be no good, being... service in the legislature would be no good, term limits would be no good, and being a pre... and being a member of a political party such as being chosen by the Democrats or Republicans would be no good."
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4492.565,4493.482,That's correct.
1994.93-1456,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4493.482,4494.232,Right.
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4506.39,4507.408,Yes.
1994.93-1456,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4507.408,4513.312,"But why, then, isn't it okay to insist on this other one, namely the term limits one."
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4513.312,4515.764,"Well, as I indicated, Justice Breyer, I think--"
1994.93-1456,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4515.764,4517.964,That... I mean you... I just want to get a very clear--
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4517.964,4519.732,"--Well, there's a temporal quality here."
1994.93-1456,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4558.674,4566.863,"--Well, would your answer be different, then, in a State which has just adopted a one-time interruption of the ballot access, as some have?"
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4566.863,4568.48,It would not be different--
1994.93-1456,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4568.48,4570.699,I didn't think you were relying on that distinction.
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4570.699,4571.684,--I'm not.
1994.93-1456,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4580.957,4584.992,That's what you were just arguing in response to Justice Scalia.
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4584.992,4590.312,--I didn't understand myself to be responding in that fashion.
1994.93-1456,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4590.828,4610.142,"Don't you also, or wouldn't you also in that case accept the point that Mr. Cohen made, that there was a justification in Storer based on a demand for orderly election procedure, and that compliments the point that you've also made about the significance of the permanence of the disqualification in this case?"
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4610.142,4611.126,"--Yes, exactly."

1994.93-1456,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4620.865,4624.736,--you have to be independent early enough to make it persuasive.
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4624.736,4625.202,--That's right.
1994.93-1456,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4674.316,4677.001,Did people who voted for this Constitution know that?
1994.93-1456,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4677.001,4680.47,I'm sure some of them did.
1994.93-1456,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4680.47,4681.072,I mean--

1994.93-1456,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4956.581,4983.899,"But my question actually was why would Hamilton or Madison, who, after all, were writing before the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, think that it was possible that this Constitution would permit qualifications for the Congress based upon birth or property, and why would we today think that a State could pass a rule saying to be in Congress you have to be a previous member of the State legislature, for example?"
1994.93-1456,4,29280,j_winston_bryant,,4983.899,4997.142,"--Your Honor, our position is that Madison and Hamilton did not preclude the State from adding additional qualifications under the Tenth Amendment."
1994.93-1456,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4997.142,5007.248,"So therefore Hamilton and Madison, when they wrote the Federalists and said to the people, don't worry about creating a Government of birth or property, that they were wrong in that?"
1994.93-1456,4,29280,j_winston_bryant,,5007.248,5021.274,"Your Honor, no, Your Honor, because under the State's position any qualification that went to the point you suggested would be unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments."
1994.93-1456,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5021.274,5021.808,This was before--
1994.93-1456,4,29280,j_winston_bryant,,5021.808,5022.46,Yes--
1994.93-1456,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5022.46,5029.697,--I guess that Madison and Hamilton and the people they were writing for weren't worried about their State legislatures.
1994.93-1456,4,29280,j_winston_bryant,,5058.966,5059.866,"--Yes, Your--"
1994.93-1456,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5059.866,5060.349,--Madison and Hamilton--
1994.93-1456,4,29280,j_winston_bryant,,5060.349,5060.683,--Yes.
1994.93-1456,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,5063.751,5080.729,--Are you aware of any case in which we have said that a State may impose a burden or restriction by reason of the fact that someone has previously exercised a Federal right or privilege?
1994.93-1456,4,29280,j_winston_bryant,,5080.729,5083.848,"I'm not sure I follow the question, Your Honor."
1994.93-1456,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,5083.848,5095.322,Are you aware of any case in which we have said that a State may impose a burden or restriction on a person by reason of his or her having exercised a Federal right or privilege?
1994.93-1456,4,29280,j_winston_bryant,,5095.322,5111.618,"If I understand your question, Your Honor, yes, I think the Storer case fit that, I think the Burdick case fit that, and the test in those cases, those cases stood for the proposition that a State can't add additional qualifications or barriers--"
1994.93-1456,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5111.618,5121.623,"What was the addition... what was the Federal right or privilege exercised in Storer, which was someone who had signed up as a member of a party and didn't quit early enough?"
1994.93-1456,4,29280,j_winston_bryant,,5121.623,5155.397,"--Your Honor, in Storer, the Federal right or privilege would have been the candidate attempting to run for Congress as an independent candidate, but was precluded from doing so by California law, and in that particular instance, the State had erected a barrier, but by the same token under the First and Fourteenth Amendment analysis, the State... that barrier passed constitutional muster, and we submit that Amendment 73 falls in that category and is clearly authorized--"
1994.93-1456,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5155.397,5158.414,"It's the most temporal of limitations, though."
1994.93-1456,4,29280,j_winston_bryant,,5169.787,5191.72,"--I'm... if I understand your question correctly, those prohibitions were temporary in that the candidate could run subsequently, but by the same token, Amendment 73 allows a candidate to serve for a certain number of terms before Amendment 73 comes into effect."
1994.93-1456,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5191.72,5193.353,"Thank you, General Bryant."
1994.93-1456,4,29280,j_winston_bryant,,5193.353,5193.953,Thank you.
1994.93-1456,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5193.953,5195.019,The case is submitted.
