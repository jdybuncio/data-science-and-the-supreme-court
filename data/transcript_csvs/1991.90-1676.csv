1991.90-1676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.808,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-1676, Mary Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Association."
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,19.712,22.929,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1676,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.81,154.25,"Mr. Simon, I suppose Illinois could have submitted a State plan under the statutory scheme."
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,154.25,156.702,"Illinois could have submitted a State plan, that's correct."
1991.90-1676,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,156.702,160.737,"Why did it not do so, if it wants to regulate in this field?"
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,160.737,166.658,Illinois does not wish to displace the Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards or enforcement.
1991.90-1676,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.185,199.545,"Well, under your view it sounds like section 18(a) is just superfluous because Illinois can adopt these regulations in any event."
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,199.545,214.455,I believe the section... the purpose of section 18 is to provide a mechanism whereby States may displace Federal standards and Federal enforcement and a mechanism by which the Secretary and the Federal Government can grant money to the States--
1991.90-1676,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.455,218.526,What about 18(a)... subsection (a)?
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,218.526,220.026,--Subsection--
1991.90-1676,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,220.026,224.145,It would appear that that's just superfluous under your reading.
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,224.145,233.785,"--I believe that subsection (a)... in the first place, subsection (a) does not express intent to preempt."
1991.90-1676,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.699,261.12,What's the implication if OSHA has adopted regulations that are in conflict?
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,261.12,263.472,Your regulations may conflict.
1991.90-1676,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,278.331,293.907,"Well, doesn't Illinois require 4,000 hours of experience for a license holder in some area of this hazardous waste business, whereas the OSHA requirement would be 40?"
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,293.907,295.276,That's correct.
1991.90-1676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,341.655,355.497,"Well, certainly there is a very arguable negative implication, Mr. Simon, from subsection (a) that where there is an OSHA standard in effect there is preemption."
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,355.497,357.183,--And that's a negative implication.
1991.90-1676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,398.224,406.264,"So you say we should analyze this case as one of implied preemption, not express preemption."
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,406.264,408.882,That's correct.
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.568,417.472,"You still are saying, though... I still... I don't entirely understand your response to Justice O'Connor as to subsection (a)."
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,439.734,440.318,--That's right.
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,443.603,444.722,Well that... it doesn't say that.
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,456.612,479.709,"I think that section 18 of the act is explaining to States how they can... that they should... it's encouraging States to come in and take a role in the occupational area, and it's saying where there's no Federal standard in place you're not precluded by any... I would make an analogy to a dormant commerce clause type thing."
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,506.895,523.488,"Why would a State proceed under (b) if it... why would a State want to proceed under (b), that is, assume its own responsibility for development and enforcement of health standards with respect to which a Federal standard already exists?"
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,523.488,525.424,--Two good reasons.
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.885,547.853,But you're telling us that the Federal Government doesn't control it anyway.
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,553.943,556.159,But it may not conflict with the regulation.
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,562.68,567.917,"Well, you don't think that OSHA's going to let any plan that they approve conflict with Federal regulation either, do you?"
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,572.321,576.023,The OSHA regulations then do not apply in a State with a State plan.
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.141,586.914,"I understand that, but I think it most unlikely that OSHA is going to approve any State plan that conflicts with a Federal regulation."
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,592.532,600.322,"--When you say conflict with it, I believe you mean anything that provides less safety protection for the employees--"
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.322,600.722,Right.
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,600.722,604.626,"--And that's correct, but you may provide more protection in a different way."
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,604.626,606.626,But you don't have to go in under (b) to do that.
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,615.832,637.347,"The second reason is the grant to the States, which is a very important reason, I submit, that the State that submits a State plan gets 90 percent of the cost of developing a State plan from the Federal Government and it gets 50 percent of the cost of operating a State plan from the Federal Government, which is a very powerful motivation, and that was the motivation that Congress offered here to encourage the States to submit the State plans, was the Federal money."
1991.90-1676,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,637.347,641.382,"May I ask on that point, if there's no Federal... excuse me."
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,651.738,654.273,Not under the... not as I read the grants to the States.
1991.90-1676,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,654.273,657.059,Only if they're replacing a Federal standard.
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,657.059,663.045,"If they're submitting a State plan, and they only submit a State plan if they want to regulate a matter regulated by OSHA."
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.045,665.747,What's the provision that governs that?
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,668.532,670.834,I do not include in my appendix the grant to the States.
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,674.703,683.876,"Yes, it's in your appendix on page 13, I think... your brief appendix."
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,686.828,692.982,Yes.
1991.90-1676,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,692.982,703.955,"You have really an identical problem in explaining the provisions of 667(h), do you not?"
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,714.013,733.975,667(h) gives the Secretary authority to allow a State to enforce less restrictive State standards even after Federal standards are in place while the State is attempting to come into compliance and get its State plan approved by the Secretary.
1991.90-1676,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,742.847,751.103,"But it doesn't say less restrictive, and if it's less restrictive... is it your view that a less restrictive legislation would displace an OSHA regulation?"
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,751.103,776.838,"If it conflicts with it, certainly it would... no, a less restrictive regulation on the subject, if OSHA says that workers have to wear helmets and States say they have to wear goggles, workers can't do both, certainly the OSHA requirement supersedes the State requirement, but under (h) the Secretary could agree that that State could just require goggles."
1991.90-1676,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,821.367,828.62,"So under your view, the Secretary can agree to suspend OSHA regulations under (h)."
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,828.62,835.042,For the period while the State plan approval is pending.
1991.90-1676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.042,837.376,"Where is (h) set out, Mr. Simon?"
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,839.594,840.378,That's correct.
1991.90-1676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,840.378,842.113,--That expired in 1972.
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,842.113,845.732,"Exactly, Your Honor, and it doesn't have any more continuing effect."
1991.90-1676,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,845.732,851.219,"Well, did it expire in '72, or was that the minimum period of its application."
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,859.325,864.11,"I think the terms of it state specifically what the answer to that question is, and I thought it was set--"
1991.90-1676,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,864.11,867.394,"It's at the bottom of page 12 of your appendix, of your blue brief."
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,883.52,898.329,--The Illinois licensing acts which promote public safety and environmental protection in addition to occupational safety should not be preempted by the OSH Act.
1991.90-1676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,976.245,982.582,"But the reason you regulate entry into this occupation is partly for safety, is it not?"
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,982.582,983.649,That's correct.
1991.90-1676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,983.649,989.921,But you say it's a different kind of safety than OSHA is supposed to provide.
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,989.921,994.89,The occupational... OSHA regulates occupational safety exclusively.
1991.90-1676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1022.476,1036.117,"So what is Illinois getting in addition to what OSHA gets by these regulations, say at a hazardous waste site?"
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1036.117,1040.604,"Illinois gets... one, that it gets a superior form of enforcement, because it's very easy to enforce."
1991.90-1676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1042.938,1056.113,"Yes, but you could say that about an Illinois regulation governing the work place, that you require 4,000 hours and we require more than OSHA does, but I think that would be very arguably preemptive."
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1056.113,1073.825,"--I think that the... Illinois, when it's regulating its environment, is not limited to accept what OSHA does to regulate workers, and Illinois here wants a licensing scheme because that's the way in which Illinois historically regulates public safety for professionals."
1991.90-1676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1073.825,1081.848,But who benefits from the Illinois regulation that wouldn't benefit from the OSHA regulations?
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1081.848,1089.334,"The Illinois regulation... I believe the public benefits more from the Illinois regulation, and I believe the environment benefits more from the Illinois regulation."
1991.90-1676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1089.334,1090.084,Why is that?
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1090.084,1110.748,"Illinois require... training requirements will be implemented by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency which will approve training courses and they have as their principal concern environmental concerns, whereas the OSHA certification of training would go towards exclusively matters to protect workers."
1991.90-1676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1110.748,1119.038,But these are... we're talking about the same hazardous waste site that is regulated by both OSHA and by the Illinois act.
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1119.038,1119.688,Yes.
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1193.418,1207.761,"But there is some preemption, or once you have a scheme in which there is some preemption on its face, do we give any deference to the agency's determination of what the precise scope of that preemption is?"
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1207.761,1212.398,You do if Congress delegated that authority to the agency.
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.206,1237.18,"Suppose the OSHA regulation said at the end of it, moreover no State shall have other regulations dealing with training necessary for workers."
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1239.03,1247.053,"I don't believe it would make a difference under the argument that I make, because I don't believe that Congress delegated authority to OSHA to preempt a State supplement--"
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.053,1273.937,"No, no, I'm saying... I'm saying assuming that we agree that there is some preemption, assuming we vote against you on that, and just as to the issue of the scope of preemption, whether it preempts not only State laws directed at the same values but also preempts State environmental laws, why shouldn't we listen to OSHA on that?"
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1273.937,1300.17,"--I think that in matters of the... the case that I found that directly answers this question was United States v. North Dakota, where this Court said that in matters of whether Congress has given power to the State or to the Federal Government to preempt, the Court looks to the command of Congress directly and does not give deference to the agency's interpretation of the command of Congress, and I think this Court should do that in this case as well."
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1300.17,1302.289,"That would work the other way, too."
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1309.693,1310.51,That's correct.
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.51,1312.426,"--Contrary regulation we would ignore that, and we would--"
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1312.426,1313.628,If that were--
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1313.628,1318.497,--We would require the OSHA rule to preempt even though OSHA doesn't want it to preempt.
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1318.497,1322.318,"--If that were the command of Congress, then I think you have to follow the command of Congress."
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.318,1324.918,It seems very strange to me.
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1324.918,1337.243,"Well, in this case it's not a question, because in this case the agency... OSHA has not asked the Court to interpret this... their regulation as preempting supplemental State regulation."
1991.90-1676,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1337.243,1339.377,I thought the Government is on the other side of this case.
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1339.377,1347.099,The Government has taken a position in this case which is contrary to the historic position taken by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
1991.90-1676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1438.943,1445.013,Even though it has the effect of regulating job site safety practices.
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1445.013,1445.913,That's correct.
1991.90-1676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1478.936,1483.905,Would you agree that your standards do regulate job site safety practices?
1991.90-1676,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1483.905,1486.924,"No, I do not agree that our standards regulate job site safety practices."
1991.90-1676,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1498.581,1500.449,"Very well, Mr. Simon."
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1509.572,1512.005,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1598.527,1614.472,"May I ask, Mr. Bliss, if a driver or an operator of one of these cranes complied with all the OSHA standards but nevertheless had an accident of some kind, could an injured party sue at common law on the theory that he was inadequately trained?"
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1614.472,1616.405,"Yes, he could, Justice Stevens."
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1616.405,1621.143,So they could have a common law rule that was more protective than the--
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1621.143,1625.861,The OSHA act specifically reserves to the State common law remedies.
1991.90-1676,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1648.543,1650.828,--What is the statutory section that you refer to?
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1650.828,1652.112,It's section 4(b)(4).
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.576,1673.842,"Of course, that section isn't just limited to common law."
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1675.861,1676.711,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1676.711,1683.265,But you say that it means to draw a distinction between common law rules and statutory rules.
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1689.019,1691.138,And those are preserved to the State--
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.138,1693.572,"Well then, why isn't this statutory right preserved?"
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1693.572,1714.986,"--These are statutory rights and duties that arise out of injuries, disease, or death of employees arising out of employment, and it's specifically intended to address those rights to which you referred in which you may have a personal right to bring an action for negligence and so forth, and they do not address the OSHA standards--"
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1714.986,1726.877,"Could a State pass a law saying that it shall be negligent for any employee to operate a crane if he hasn't had 40,000 hours of time on similar equipment?"
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1729.413,1736.082,"--That certainly would be a closer question, but in our view if it establishes a standard that directly regulates worker health and safety it would be preempted by the OSHA act."
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1736.082,1738.851,"If it's in the statute, but not if it's a common law rule."
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1738.851,1741.486,That's correct.
1991.90-1676,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1741.486,1750.009,"I must say I don't understand your answer at all, because this provision, as Justice Stevens points out, covers statutes as well as common law."
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1766.121,1783.38,"The basis for the distinction is that if the State statute establishes a standard that regulates worker health and safety by establishing conditions of employment that constitute a standard, then it would be preempted by the OSHA act expressly."
1991.90-1676,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.38,1786.951,But not conditions for liability.
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1786.951,1798.925,"Conditions for liability would raise a separate and more difficult question, but it, too, would be preempted if the direct, substantial effect of it is to intrude into employer-employee obligations in the work place as they are regulated by the OSHA standard."
1991.90-1676,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.925,1808.047,"Well, I would think that that's your answer, and that would be the same whether it's common law or statute, wouldn't it?"
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1821.504,1825.206,The standard would regulate prospectively.
1991.90-1676,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.149,1844.536,So all the State really has to do is do all this regulation through the courts rather than through the statute.
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1849.69,1853.558,That is the direction... that is the purpose of the express preemption of OSHA.
1991.90-1676,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.808,1945.335,"You don't mean to say that this language expressly preempts Illinois, do you, because I think we've analyzed a little differently in cases where there's express preemption and implied preemption."
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1945.335,1959.744,"Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that the language of section 18 in its entirety is explicit language that expressly preempts OSHA standards regulating worker health and safety relating to the issue addressed by the Federal standard."
1991.90-1676,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1959.744,1961.863,So you say this is a case of express preemption.
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1961.863,1964.163,This is very definitely a case of express preemption.
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1964.163,1966.231,Where's your preemptive language?
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1972.835,1976.62,"The preemptive language is in section 18(a), where it specifically reserves to the States--"
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1976.62,1979.255,It says nothing shall prevent State agencies from so forth--
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1979.255,1982.457,--Except where no standard is in effect.
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1982.457,1986.409,"--Right, and it implies that if a standard is in effect there may be preemption."
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,1991.963,1995.681,"Reading section 18(a) and section 18(b) together, and section 18--"
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1995.681,2001.918,"Well, section (b) deals with the situation where the State wants to preempt the Federal Government."
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2001.918,2024.998,"--But it makes clear that if the State wishes to develop any standard... it doesn't say exclusive responsibility, but if the State wishes to develop any standard, it must submit a plan for approval by the Secretary, and reading 18(a) and (b) together, the only logical conclusion that can be drawn from it is that the States, if they wish to regulate in areas subject to a Federal standard, must seek approval of a plan, and this is further supported by subsection (h)."
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2024.998,2034.39,"Well, why isn't a perfectly logical reason to say under (b) if they want to displace the Federal plan they've got to get an approval, but if they merely want to supplement it, there's no objection."
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2038.024,2041.376,The statute has no provision to allow for supplementation.
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2048.713,2053.766,"No, there's nothing in it that expressly permits it, but there's nothing in it, either, that expressly prohibits it."
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2053.766,2060.521,--The explicit prohibition we find can be inferred from the language structure and purpose of the act.
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2066.86,2069.594,But that's a different argument from an express preemption argument.
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2072.413,2080.001,"--Implied... express preemption can be derived from the language of the statute, even if there is not the magic word of prohibition."
1991.90-1676,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2090.04,2093.844,Do you have any case authority for the proposition that you just stated?
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2093.844,2109.271,"Well we... for example, in Pacific Gas and Electric at 461 U.S. at 210, we believe the reservation of authority to the States concerning everything except radiological safety hazards was construed to mean that the States were preempted and regulated--"
1991.90-1676,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2109.271,2112.74,Did the court treat that as a case of express preemption?
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2112.74,2124.697,"--In that context, the language in the court supports that proposition, and we think in other cases like Jones v. Rath Packing the language of the court does not expressly prohibit action, and yet the inference has been made from the language that--"
1991.90-1676,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2124.697,2150.015,"Well, we have held many State statutes and regulations impliedly preempted and reached the result that you want us to reach in this case, but I don't think it helps jurisprudence to try to push something over into the field of express preemption where really the language isn't expressed."
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2158.887,2174.496,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we would hope that you would look at this first as explicit language in the statutes and in the structure of section 18 and indeed in other provisions, such as (4)(b)(4), that demonstrate the clear intent of Congress, that State worker health and safety standards should be preempted."
1991.90-1676,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2198.111,2220.941,"Well, Mr. Bliss, just how clear is it that Congress wanted to prevent a State from adopting some heightened worker safety requirement that technically could be complied with along with any lesser requirement of the Federal regulation."
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2224.411,2238.135,"Justice O'Connor, we think it's absolutely clear, because Congress... the one thing Congress intended to accomplish was coordination of standard-setting in related issues, and that would be totally undermined by what Illinois has done here."
1991.90-1676,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2238.135,2238.552,Well then--
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2238.552,2246.657,"If the State can go off and regulate piecemeal without coordinating with the Federal Government, then the purpose is totally frustrated... the objective and purpose of section 18 is totally frustrated."
1991.90-1676,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2247.757,2260.417,--But the whole thrust of section 18 is to indicate that a State can have greater requirements than the Federal.
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2260.417,2267.738,"--Absolutely, and a path is set for the State to do that precisely by submitting a plan for approval by the Secretary of Labor."
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2295.507,2299.959,"No, but (b) doesn't talk about supplementing, (b) talks about displacing the Federal regulation."
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2299.959,2303.411,(b) talks about assuming responsibility for developing--
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2303.411,2304.294,Assuming entire responsibility--
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2304.294,2305.129,--And enforcing standards.
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2305.129,2309.815,"--And if they comply with (b) then the Federal Government's out of the picture entirely, isn't it?"
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2309.815,2314.433,"Over a period of time, but it would be a 3-year conditional period in which there would be--"
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2314.433,2316.302,I don't think (b) provides the answer to the question.
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2332.328,2340.667,"--That's correct, and we think it's a combination of subsection 18(a) and (b) read together along with subsection (h)--"
1991.90-1676,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2340.667,2346.254,And even if there's not even the remotest possibility of conflict between the two systems.
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2353.358,2353.758,--That's correct.
1991.90-1676,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2386.029,2413.03,"Mr. Bliss, assuming that that would qualify within... to be covered by the text of subsection 18(b), isn't it also the case that the heading to 18(b), the bold print, suggests a somewhat narrower scope, because the bold print refers specifically to State standards to preempt applicable Federal standards."
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2418.834,2424.671,"Justice Souter, we don't believe that the heading would narrow the plain language and meaning of the actual--"

1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2426.09,2436.029,"--Section 18(b), but in any event we accept that the purpose of 18(b) is to allow States to displace Federal regulation, and we accept that Congress in--"
1991.90-1676,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2436.029,2445.651,"Well, if that's the case, then the mere fact that you have a State standard addressing the same issue as a Federal standard is not enough to get you to a point of preemption."
1991.90-1676,1,20636,donald_t_bliss,,2458.458,2464.196,"--We believe it gets us to that conclusion if you read 18(a) and (b) together, and it leaves the--"

1991.90-1676,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2490.478,2493.68,Isn't (h) probably your strongest argument?

I think (h) helps, (f) helps... you have to read the entire statute in context, and together it leaves us with no other logical conclusion but that the States, if they wish to develop a standard relating to an issue addressed by a Federal standard they must do it through the planned process."
1991.90-1676,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2679.134,2680.92,"Yes, but I... is... never mind."
1991.90-1676,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,2697.43,2700.047,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1991.90-1676,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2740.105,2748.894,"Mr. Kelley, where do you find language in those sections that says in so many words that a State shall not regulate in a particular area?"
1991.90-1676,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,2748.894,2761.269,"Your Honor, section 18(b) says that if a State wishes to assume responsibility for enforcing an occupational safety standard relating to an existing OSHA standard, it shall submit a State plan."
1991.90-1676,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2770.792,2776.796,But that section doesn't say what the consequence is of failure to submit a plan.
1991.90-1676,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,2776.796,2789.955,"We believe that section 18(a), which says that a State may enforce if there is no Federal standard in place, is properly read to mean that the State has to follow the rest of the procedures provided in section 18 if a Federal standard is in place."
1991.90-1676,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2789.955,2792.307,But you derive that by implication.
1991.90-1676,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,2799.394,2810.635,"Mr. Chief Justice, our view is that the statute can only be read... can only be made sense of if it is preemptive, and in that sense we believe the statute is expressly preemptive."
1991.90-1676,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2811.352,2815.773,But I don't think... your sentence is a non sequitur.
1991.90-1676,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,2834.318,2842.34,"--Mr. Chief Justice, this Court has said that express preemption is demonstrated if that is the clear and manifest reading of the statute."
1991.90-1676,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2888.619,2890.754,"Mr. Kelley, maybe we should have three categories."
1991.90-1676,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,2916.555,2918.671,"Your Honor, we would not object to that."
1991.90-1676,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2951.043,2976.443,"Mr. Kelley, are you going to address the meaning of section 653(b)(4), which says that nothing in the chapter will affect common law or statutory rights, duties, or liabilities of employers and employees under any law with respect to injuries, diseases, or death of employees?"
1991.90-1676,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,2976.443,2983.931,"Your Honor, we believe that section 4(b)(4) further supports our reading in the statute as preemptive."
1991.90-1676,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3033.345,3038.149,I'm not sure I understand what you're saying 653(b)(4) does.
1991.90-1676,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,3042.434,3050.173,"It says, Your Honor, that... I believe the particular focus of section 4(b)(4) was to preserve State Worker Compensation schemes."
1991.90-1676,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3069.385,3071.27,But it says duties as well as remedies.
1991.90-1676,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,3083.327,3115.616,"It could be read that way, Your Honor, but we don't believe it should be read that way for a two reasons: 1) if it were read that way, it would undermine entirely the notion of occupational standards under the act, and secondly, if you did read it that way, we believe nonetheless that a statutory duty would... in the meaning of section 4(b) would not be the same thing as not... I'm sorry, could be the same thing as an occupational standard within the meaning of section 18, section 18 meaning the definitional section, section 3(8)."

1991.90-1676,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3129.306,3132.208,--Let me just ask you more.
1991.90-1676,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,3158.589,3182.391,"--Justice White, you're pointing out that... the problem with reading that section as broadly as one possibly could, and if one were to read that, it would seem to me that not only the State but every court that's considered this issue would have had no need to address section 18 at all, and would have read section 4(b) entirely to preserve State authority in every instance, and that clearly is not the proper reading."
1991.90-1676,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3223.896,3225.181,From the outset.
1991.90-1676,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,3225.181,3229.383,"That is true, Your Honor, but we believe that it certainly is a reasonable reading of the act, and--"
1991.90-1676,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3229.383,3232.149,It might be consistently wrong.
1991.90-1676,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,3232.149,3241.191,"--It may be consistently... we don't believe it was consistently wrong, but it certainly has been consistently reasonable, and we believe therefore is entitled to deference from this Court."
1991.90-1676,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3241.191,3252.312,"Well, is it clear that we should defer to State agencies in matters of this kind of preemption?"
1991.90-1676,2,45217,william_k_kelley,,3252.312,3256.95,"It has not been a proposition that has been clearly established with respect to preemption, Your Honor."
