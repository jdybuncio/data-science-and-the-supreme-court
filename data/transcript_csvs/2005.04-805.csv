2005.04-805,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.711,We'll hear argument first in Texaco Inc. v. Dagher and Shell Oil v. Dagher.
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,8.995,11.894,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-805,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,39.123,48.551,"Mr. Nager, on... on that point, I have a factual question and I figured I'd get it... excuse me... get it out on the table at the beginning so you'd know what at least is bothering me."
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,162.011,167.677,I believe the... the short answer to your question is... is yes.
2005.04-805,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,167.677,169.362,There were two questions.
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,170.416,172.681,The first question.
2005.04-805,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,172.681,172.681,Okay.
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,172.681,178.958,I think it is undeniable... and Mr. Minear can speak on behalf of the FTC to this.
2005.04-805,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,199.983,203.332,Is there a document that we could look at that... that says that?
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,203.332,210.403,"--I don't know off the top of my head, Justice Souter, whether there's a specific document that says marketing includes pricing."
2005.04-805,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,235.204,254.291,"Well, taking that point just a bit further, your reply brief... the reply brief for... for Shell says that the respondent has conceded that the pricing decision to sell at the same price was not made till 8 months afterwards."
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,275.132,283.094,"Well, I... I think that that's a... a fair interpretation of one possible understanding of their brief, Justice Kennedy."
2005.04-805,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,320.937,321.017,"Well, it would depend."
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,368.714,384.2,"Well, what I can say to that, Justice Breyer, is our opponents have repeatedly pointed out in their briefs deposition testimony that the parties refused to discuss price with each other before they had an actual memorandum of understanding out of concerns about the antitrust laws."
2005.04-805,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,384.2,388.034,"It may be, but still at some point they discussed it and I would like to know what they said."
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,388.034,393.337,"Well, I'll have to leave that for the respondents to address for you."
2005.04-805,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,426.338,437.19,Then what did it mean... I think you said it in your brief that both brands were sold exclusively by Equilon after the joint venture created... was created.
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,449.538,453.77,"I'm not sure what the reference is, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-805,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,481.986,485.918,Were the parties indifferent as to how much of each brand was sold?
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,489.538,501.424,"Well, I don't think we could say they didn't care because there were, as part of the joint venture agreement, brand management protocols to preserve the equality of the brands."
2005.04-805,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,520.388,526.305,"But... but if they cared, doesn't that show that there was still an element of competition, but the competition is suppressed if the price is the same?"
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,526.305,549.524,"Not in... not for... with regard to Equilon because why they care, Justice Kennedy, is that... that they licensed these brand names to the joint ventures and they maintained control of the asset that they licensed, their name, because they operated in other markets where they weren't in competition with Equilon and Motiva."
2005.04-805,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,586.625,594.167,One more question and then... how was it decided how much raw gas would be delivered to the venture by the two parties?
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,594.167,596.514,That was a decision made by Equilon.
2005.04-805,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,684.928,704.418,"Well, do you acknowledge that the rule of reason analysis of the... of the initial formation can include a rule of reason analysis of whether it... it would violate the... the Sherman Act to... to have the new entity price both products the same?"
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,704.418,712.3,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, but I don't think that anyone would ever do that in a rule of reason section 1 analysis."
2005.04-805,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,729.108,736.399,"I mean, that's a surprising concession to me. We... we found a... a joint marketing company."
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,752.177,752.798,--Correct.
2005.04-805,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,752.798,756.608,And you're saying now we're going to go look at their prices that they set and decide if they're reasonable?
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,756.608,760.598,"Well, what I... what I tried to say, Justice Breyer... maybe I should change my answer to no."
2005.04-805,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.828,789.955,You could say you... you just never get beyond step one. You don't go any further if there's no market power.
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,789.955,790.706,--That's correct.
2005.04-805,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,792.182,790.706,Maybe there is.
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,790.706,802.28,"--In this particular case, the respondents made a conscious litigation choice in the district court to waive a rule of reason claim."
2005.04-805,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,835.62,844.564,"Mr. Nager, what if you had a... a crazy kind of joint venture... or maybe it wouldn't be so crazy... in which it was just like this one?"
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,881.967,888.678,I think the answer to your question depends upon facts that you haven't stated.
2005.04-805,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,895.336,901.094,"Well, I'm assuming there... there are, indeed, efficiencies to be attained by it so that it's not a sham."
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,915.587,924.813,"--Well, I'm not sure at that point that they've entered into an agreement to share the risks and loss... of profit and loss from the assets that they're putting together."
2005.04-805,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,930.338,936.359,"Well, are you... are you saying in practical terms that my hypothesis is... is just a practical impossibility?"
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,936.359,939.107,"Well, I... I can't say that because you get to ask the questions."
2005.04-805,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,939.107,944.131,"No, no, but... no."
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,951.915,959.837,"It's a big country, and there are a lot of things that happen out there and so I can't assume that I want you going back to chambers thinking that it can't happen."
2005.04-805,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,961.563,961.874,Okay.
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,970.098,970.318,--I don't think so.
2005.04-805,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,988.55,995.27,"Yes, but there's... there's one part of the lot that you haven't thrown in together, and that's the pricing lot."
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1009.712,1016.281,"--Well, again, I don't think... it's hard for me to see very many business persons getting together and entering into such an arrangement."
2005.04-805,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1016.281,1017.042,I... I agree.
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1017.042,1016.281,But as long as--
2005.04-805,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1016.281,1022.728,You said we're going to do it on the hypothesis that it's a big country and somewhere out there somebody might do this.
2005.04-805,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1030.002,1047.515,"--I... I think the answer is... is that if the... if the... the joint venture itself was an efficiency creating joint venture that can survive rule of reason scrutiny, that business has the right to conduct itself subject to the restrictions that were put in the original agreement."
2005.04-805,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1067.964,1069.879,"Thank you, Mr. Nager. Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you."
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1069.879,1083.97,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-805,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1123.136,1126.317,"Respondents don't concede that the joint venture is lawful, though."
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1126.317,1133.598,"As this case comes to this Court, that's a necessary conclusion of the court of appeals determination."
2005.04-805,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1171.731,1180.989,"Well, in the Citizens Publishing case, it wasn't a necessary predicate of the Court's ruling there to find that the joint venture was unlawful, was it?"
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1180.989,1187.917,"--No, it wasn't, but we don't think that Citizens Publishing has a direct bearing on the case here."
2005.04-805,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1250.774,1256.431,"Well, the two parties obviously don't compete within the terms of the joint venture, but they compete more generally."
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1256.431,1257.644,That's correct.
2005.04-805,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1258.766,1268.695,"And you couldn't have two companies say we're not going to... we're going to have a joint venture on this corner, but in... you know, down the block, we're going to compete, and then it's all right to set prices on this corner but not down the block."
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1268.695,1269.909,--That's correct.
2005.04-805,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1280.662,1285.325,But didn't we have competition even within the joint venture for a few months?
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1297.772,1298.853,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-805,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1312.574,1316.666,Wasn't there competition in... in the... in the retail market?
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1325.711,1335.68,"--Yes, Your Honor. But in... in that regard, there's competition at the pump, but there's no competition... as between those two gas stations, but there's no competition between the owners of the joint venture here, Texaco and Shell."
2005.04-805,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1335.68,1342.871,Because that differential was not reflected in what their agreement provided that each could respectively take out of the joint venture.
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1342.871,1343.802,That's exactly right.
2005.04-805,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1343.802,1344.332,That's exactly right.
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1348.945,1349.727,That's correct.
2005.04-805,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1349.727,1351.269,It has nothing to do with the prices that end up.
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1351.269,1351.772,And in fact--
2005.04-805,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1351.772,1354.6,Maybe you could explain to me how this did work.
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1379.544,1380.498,--That is all correct.
2005.04-805,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1380.498,1380.858,All right.
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1387.749,1393.014,"Well, that's the factual dispute that the court of appeals recognized in this case."
2005.04-805,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1393.014,1393.114,All right.
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1393.014,1399.734,Texaco and Shell take the position that simply this is a decision that's made by the owners of Equilon or Equilon itself--
2005.04-805,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1399.734,1415.279,"No. I imagine there are some human beings in Equilon called marketers, and those human beings in Equilon who work for Equilon would say Equilon will sell the refined gasoline to gas stations at such and such prices."
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1419.072,1420.174,"--No, there isn't."
2005.04-805,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1430.012,1430.012,What is their view of it?
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1430.012,1444.473,"--Respondents' view is that there was an agreement that was entered into, an alleged agreement, at the time of formation of this entity, in which Texaco and Shell agreed to set the Texaco product and the Shell product at the same price."
2005.04-805,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1461.784,1477.159,"The Texaco product being a product that comes out of refineries that previously belonged to Texaco or the Texaco product being gasoline that comes out of either refinery but is sold to stations labeled Texaco, or both?"
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1477.41,1483.357,"--It is more the latter, Your Honor, that what happens in these cases the refineries refine unbranded gasoline."
2005.04-805,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1491.048,1501.81,"All right. I could see how that could be a violation because it's possible that Equilon, if left on its own, would decide that its best marketing strategy was sometimes to set a differential."
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1507.566,1509.911,But that is simply the choice that the owners--
2005.04-805,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1509.911,1509.911,Is that what happened?
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1509.911,1515.297,--That is... would be the same as if the owners or the shareholders made a decision about how two different products--
2005.04-805,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1515.297,1529.378,"That would be rather like Pan American and Grace saying that, Panagra, charge whatever price you want, but above all, don't go below $50 because remember, we, Grace, have some ships out there and we want people to take the ships."
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1529.378,1535.095,"--Well, Your Honor, in that situation there could be an antitrust violation, but it would not be a per se violation."
2005.04-805,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1640.068,1646.817,"Mr. Minear, you indicated that in the first 8 months, when there was differential pricing, you said that was the way to allocate profits."
2005.04-805,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1651.059,1659.322,"--If I said that, I misspoke. The profits were shared based on a ratio of the contributions of... of assets that were devoted to the joint venture."
2005.04-805,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1684.859,1686.112,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
2005.04-805,2,28871,joseph_michaelangelo_alioto,,1690.895,1696.261,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.515,1721.618,I don't... I don't really... who... who would set the price if it was not... if it was not the joint venture?
2005.04-805,2,28871,joseph_michaelangelo_alioto,,1721.618,1726.734,"Shell and Texaco fixed the price, if it please... if it please Your Honor."
2005.04-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1728.939,1730.936,The joint venture owns the gasoline.
2005.04-805,2,28871,joseph_michaelangelo_alioto,,1746.84,1750.662,"--Yes, Your Honor, and at page 5 of our brief, we pointed that out."
2005.04-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.719,1788.109,It's the board of directors.
2005.04-805,2,28871,joseph_michaelangelo_alioto,,1791.929,1806.121,"--If the board of directors are Shell and Texaco and if they are the ones who are... the next statement, Your Honor... the... they... they must... the company must follow the policies, strategies, and standards established by the members committee."
2005.04-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1809.612,1810.944,That's because it's a joint venture.
2005.04-805,2,28871,joseph_michaelangelo_alioto,,1810.944,1812.4,A joint--
2005.04-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1812.4,1813.752,That's the nature of a joint venture.
2005.04-805,2,28871,joseph_michaelangelo_alioto,,1819.641,1820.665,--The pricing didn't--
2005.04-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.665,1821.646,There's nothing subversive about that.
2005.04-805,2,28871,joseph_michaelangelo_alioto,,1821.646,1827.975,"--The pricing didn't have anything to do with... if it please the Court, the pricing didn't anything to do with the joint venture."
2005.04-805,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1829.65,1831.435,"No, but isn't... isn't it expectable?"
2005.04-805,2,28871,joseph_michaelangelo_alioto,,1857.252,1858.323,"--No, Your Honor."
2005.04-805,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1858.323,1862.766,"And therefore, it is a decision of the joint venture, not of the... the two original principals."
2005.04-805,2,28871,joseph_michaelangelo_alioto,,1862.766,1865.251,"No, Your Honor, for a couple of reasons."
2005.04-805,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1882.121,1889.152,Citizens... Citizens Publishing did not have a joint venture that had advance approval from the FTC.
2005.04-805,2,28871,joseph_michaelangelo_alioto,,1891.126,1891.326,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-805,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1891.326,1893.921,--And I think that makes a big difference.
2005.04-805,2,28871,joseph_michaelangelo_alioto,,1910.23,1919.157,"If it please Your Honor, there are many times in which this Court has said that the FTC does not have the authority or power to grant immunity from antitrust violations."
