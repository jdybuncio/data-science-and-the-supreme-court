1968.643,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1880.641,1881.156,-- as a respondent?
1968.643,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1881.156,1883.271,Do they speak for the State of Oregon?
1968.643,1,16948,arlen_specter,,1883.271,1883.585,"Yes, sir."
1968.643,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1883.585,1885.135,The District Attorney's Association?
1968.643,1,16948,arlen_specter,,1885.135,1886.186,"No, Mr. Chief Justice Warren."
1968.643,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1897.809,1899.367,Who made the request of you?

1968.643,1,16948,arlen_specter,,1916.118,1925.726,"It is my understanding that it is the responsibility of Mr. Rook to represent himself here, represent Clackamas County in the State of Oregon and he has --"
1968.643,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1925.726,1930.343,You vouch for that as a matter of Oregon law?
1968.643,1,16948,arlen_specter,,1930.343,1935.649,I think I have best turn to Mr. Rook to get confirmation of it.
1968.643,2,40341,roger_rook,,1935.649,1942.16,"Well, actually this is the Attorney General's positions necessary towards habeas corpus Your Honor."

1968.643,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2057.735,2060.873,"Very well, you may proceed."
1968.643,3,16948,arlen_specter,,2060.873,2083.647,The point that I think is most important on the first argument of the petitioner is that the entire sequence of events concerning the opening statement made by Mr. Rook and the amount of time that the co-indictee was on the stand involved a very small portion of this extensive trial.

1968.643,3,16948,arlen_specter,,2192.794,2197.553,"No, no, so that he could be accurate in terms of what he was saying."
1968.643,4,26947,howard_m_feuerstein,,3504.782,3512.347,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would merely say that it is true that the District Attorney did not refer to this as confession."
1968.643,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3562.131,3565.97,Was the tape recording played to the jury of the --
