1995.95-559,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.018,"We'll hear argument next in Number 85... 95-559, Doctor's Associates, Inc., v. Paul Casarotto."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,10.779,15.393,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,185.295,197.534,"Suppose that the State had a statute which said that the following terms have to be in bold face type: price, term of the contract, choice of law, add a few more if you can think of them, and arbitration."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,201.408,210.775,"Depending upon the law, the nature of the law and the things that are included, I think not, and I think it would fail really under two principles."
1995.95-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,217.799,220.971,"No, this... no... well, I'll amend the hypothetical, then."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,222.571,222.922,--Right.
1995.95-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,224.975,225.874,All written contracts.
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,225.874,227.186,"Okay, and does it apply to--"
1995.95-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,227.186,232.249,"You have to bold face type... bold face type for price, terms of the contract, choice of law, arbitration."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,232.249,232.539,--Okay.
1995.95-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,235.191,237.234,And whether or not attorney's fees are allowed.
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,237.554,247.709,"--Of course, the more things you put in it, the more it looks like a general principle, but then you have to ask yourself, it seems to me, the second test, which is, why does it make the list?"
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,267.582,273.766,"Mr. Kravitz, suppose it were concentrated, the clause were concentrated on the forum and were general."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,293.089,297.05,"--Well, certainly if that... if... I just have to ask one more question about that."
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,302.255,303.785,It applies to all contracts.
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,308.039,309.47,--Right.
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,309.47,312.872,--commercial court in Zurich.
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,312.872,313.333,Sure.
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,313.333,320.98,"It would be the same thing as... any choice of forum in a forum contract, so it's not all contracts, its just in forum contracts."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,320.98,321.52,That's--
1995.95-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,321.52,321.791,Would that be--
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,321.791,328.814,"--Well, it would... for... I believe it would cause the same problems that we're addressing, if I may explain."
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,354.021,361.886,--Suppose... do you have any doubt about whether such a provision would be valid as to choice of a court?
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,365.448,365.859,--Right.
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,365.859,371.252,--any choice of law to govern this contract has to be put in... on page 1?
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,371.252,378.387,"The FAA does not speak to such clauses, and certainly that would not run afoul of the Federal Arbitration Act."
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,379.327,392.727,"Well then, you seem to be saying the Arbitration Act, far from allowing laws of general application to apply, says a law of general application about choice of forum can apply to all other contracts but not to arbitration contracts."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,392.727,409.688,"--What I'm saying is, Your Honor, and obviously the hypothetical you're posing is very different from the statute, what I'm saying is that as the States begin to tinker with the parties' choices of the rules under which they'll conduct their arbitration, you begin to raise the same issues."
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,422.855,427.81,What does that have to do with saying choice of forum has to be on page 1?
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,427.81,445.271,"--Because I think that to the extent that one is tinkering with the choice that the parties made of the method in which they're going to resolve their dispute, that it raises the issue as to whether or not one is trying to interfere with the parties' choice of arbitration, or one is trying to do something else."
1995.95-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,445.271,445.811,Isn't the--
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,472.559,490.752,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that the text of section 2 provides the answer to that, and that text says that the written provisions are valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, whether in State court or Federal court, save upon grounds that exist for the revocation of any contract, which is to say contracts generally."
1995.95-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,525.726,530.228,Even though the evil sought to be cured is peculiarly related to arbitration contracts.
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,530.228,533.541,"Yes, even though the evil thought--"
1995.95-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,533.541,535.433,"There's something of a vacuum then, isn't there."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,535.433,560.598,"--Well, but the law generally, of course, is that all of the terms in a forum contract, an adhesion contract are, in fact, presumptively valid, if you put your signature on it, so that in fact the law of contracts generally would say these are valid, and that law of contracts generally is being skewed solely... it's singling out arbitration, and solely because of the fact that it's arbitration involved as opposed to something else."
1995.95-559,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,579.622,621.2,"But going back to Justice Ginsburg's question, if we knew for a fact that her choice of forum limitation did not... did not really bear on, or have application to arbitration agreements to any degree beyond their application to any other choice of forum agreements, if we knew that there was no reason to suppose that it was aimed at arbitration agreements, that it was being enforced sort of evenhandedly with all choice of forum agreements, and that there were plenty of choice of forum agreements which were not arbitration agreements, in that case we would say, that's general enough, and that wouldn't violate the FAA--"
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,621.2,626.936,"Certainly... certainly as you posit it, Justice Souter, it sounds general enough, but I would ask the Court to--"
1995.95-559,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,626.936,627.575,--So should... may it--
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,627.575,628.416,--what principal... I'm sorry.
1995.95-559,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,628.416,629.077,"--No, you go ahead."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,629.077,645.807,"Well, I would ask the question, what principle, then, would determine overriding the parties' choice of where they arbitrate in that case from choosing the AAA rules, which provide, for example, for the rules of evidence don't apply, and where do you draw the line--"
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,645.807,647.86,"It's not overriding the choice, it's simply a notice requirement."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,647.86,648.488,--I'm sorry.
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,648.488,657.925,"It's simply a notice requirement that you notify the... in the forum contract you put certain things on page 1, and one is choice of forum."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,657.925,658.666,I'm sorry.
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,658.666,660.266,--so we're not talking anything about the rules--
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,660.266,660.767,"Okay, I'm sorry."
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,666.46,667.251,"--No, there's--"
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,667.251,668.022,--would cause those problems.
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,668.022,672.334,--It's a... it says that choice of forum and choice of law go on page 1.
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,672.334,672.705,Mm hmm.
1995.95-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.246,677.567,"Well, the problem you're confronting is--"
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,677.567,677.958,--that's not the statute here.
1995.95-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.958,681.14,--that as far as its generality is concerned--
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,681.14,681.43,Right.
1995.95-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,681.43,687.504,--that is no different from a provision that says choice of forum provisions are invalid.
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,687.504,688.655,I think that that's--
1995.95-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,688.655,691.297,"As far as its generality is concerned, the one is the same as the other."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,691.297,692.807,--That is correct.
1995.95-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.807,696.35,"And you would certainly not assert that the latter is okay under the FAA, would you?"
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,696.35,704.076,"No, I would not, and indeed, just to follow up on that point, it has been argued by the respondents that this is just a notice statute."
1995.95-559,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,731.973,746.393,Are there other provisions... what other statutes or rules of law in Montana require other kinds of clauses besides arbitration clauses to be typed in underlying capital letters on the first page of a contract?
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,746.393,748.687,There are a few isolated examples.
1995.95-559,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,748.687,749.535,What are they?
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,749.535,749.896,Pardon?
1995.95-559,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,749.896,750.396,What are they?
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,750.396,753.588,"Actually, I'm not sure that any actually requires an underline on the first page."
1995.95-559,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,776.843,777.875,"Well, I mean, that would be the question."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,789.803,790.494,I would agree with you.
1995.95-559,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.494,791.433,So which is it?
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,794.555,795.116,It is certainly just a handful.
1995.95-559,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,795.116,795.427,Yes.
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,795.427,832.69,"It is certainly just a handful, but I would suggest that even if it were 5 or 10, and I don't believe it is, but let's say it was even 5 or 10, we're not talking about a coherent body of general law applicable generally, we're talking about things that are singled out, and why... and they're singling out arbitration in this statute in the same way in which they're singling out other things and not applying the law generally, because the law generally says that these clauses, even if it's in an adhesion contract, even if there's unequal bargaining power, if the signature's on it, these clauses are... everything else in that contract is presumptively valid."
1995.95-559,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,832.69,846.29,"You're saying that if there are several other examples, but in separate part of the statutes it still shows kind of an ad hoc approach to each particular thing rather than a general feeling that all of these particular things should be subject to heightened notice."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,846.29,847.82,"Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-559,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,847.82,860.318,"Well, are you saying, then, that there can be no... there can be no general rule within the meaning of the statute that refers to, in substantive terms to the kind of provision that it applies to?"
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,873.789,874.137,"Okay, but when you're--"
1995.95-559,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,874.137,874.638,But--
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,874.638,885.444,"--If that were the general principle announced, then you'd go to the second prong of our test, which is, is it's application in that particular circumstance, does it turn on the fact that it's arbitration, and the answer is no."
1995.95-559,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,887.568,909.34,"--But then it becomes complicated when you get to examples in which there's a whole series of terms upon which it may turn, and I think you're saying, but I'm not sure, no matter how long that series might be, as in Justice Breyer's example, as long as there is a substantive reference to arbitration, that it would fail."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,910.362,915.044,"Yes... I would say again, does it go back to our... the two tests that this Court has identified?"
1995.95-559,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,931.645,934.106,Suppose I didn't agree with you about that.
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,947.674,950.386,"Under that assumption, we'd still prevail in this case."
1995.95-559,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,950.386,951.037,--Because--
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,951.037,955.592,"Because this law only applies to arbitration, one."
1995.95-559,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,977.514,978.366,--The other things being--
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,978.366,979.417,So even under that construct it fails.
1995.95-559,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,979.417,980.246,--What are those?
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,982.129,989.383,"I know the UCC... I'm aware because of their footnote that they're retail installment contracts, but that's all I'm aware of."
1995.95-559,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1024.263,1026.267,"The other things you can waive, one is jury trial."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1028.637,1046.611,"To be honest, Justice Breyer, we have looked to see whether there are special rules for waiving any constitutional rights in Montana, and we could not find any, so its... rather than having a list of things that you can, I haven't found any in our review... in our review of the law."
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1046.611,1054.595,"Mr. Kravitz, you answered the question to Justice Breyer that it would be the same outcome."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1067.854,1068.235,Right.
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1096.973,1099.697,So are you saying I'm raising an academic question?
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1099.697,1102.439,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1168.221,1170.934,"Under that formulation, what about our decision in Volt?"
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1170.934,1181.071,"Well, Your Honor, to be honest, we... I think that Volt is about the oddest place to find support for the Montana supreme court."
1995.95-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1194.009,1199.755,"That's one way of characterizing it, but it did stay the arbitration pending judicial proceedings--"
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1199.755,1201.094,--But it didn't say--
1995.95-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1201.094,1207.429,"--as I recall the case, and I'm... it's not clear to me whether or not those judicial proceedings would have been binding on the arbitrator."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1207.429,1207.95,--Well--
1995.95-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1207.95,1217.966,"But let's for a moment assume that they would have been, which I think was quite a plausible conclusion."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1217.966,1226.76,"--Well, but you're assuming, I think, in the question that the parties intended something different, and that's what Volt is all about."
1995.95-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1272.331,1275.834,And if the parties had chosen Montana law what would your result--
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1275.834,1282.877,"I don't think the result... in the ordinary case the result wouldn't be different, and I say that for this reason."
1995.95-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1283.368,1285.401,--Then Volt becomes a harder case for you.
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1285.401,1289.091,"--Well, under Volt, then, you're trying to determine the intent of the parties."
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1396.232,1403.057,Could there be an arbitration clause in a forum contract that could be held unconscionable?
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1403.057,1406.57,"Well, let me say two things."
1995.95-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.063,1440.864,I don't understand that.
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1440.864,1442.023,"--I'm sorry, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1442.023,1449.888,You say if you have an arbitration clause the State can invalidate the whole contract because the arbitration--
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1449.888,1450.519,"Oh, no, I--"
1995.95-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.519,1451.42,--clause is unconscionable?
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1451.42,1452.76,"--No, I didn't mean to say that--"
1995.95-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1452.76,1453.19,"Oh, okay."
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1453.19,1454.042,--and let me make myself clear.
1995.95-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1467.142,1468.223,Or enough of them.
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1468.223,1472.305,"--because they're unconscionable, wholly apart from whether it has an arbitration clause."
1995.95-559,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1473.477,1477.561,Or that the arbitration clause itself got in there because of unconscionable contracts.
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1477.561,1479.754,"--Fraud in the inducement, for example."
1995.95-559,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1479.754,1480.005,Yes.
1995.95-559,0,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,1480.005,1497.777,"Or if the arbitration clause got in there because of fraud in the inducement, in that case... in that case, there would be general principle, fraud in the inducement, and it would be determined not because the subject matter is arbitration, but because there was a fraud that went on about a material term, so it would meet both of our tests in that regard."
1995.95-559,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1500.928,1502.438,"Very well, Mr. Kravitz."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1504.191,1511.454,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1995.95-559,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1558.575,1572.524,"But you want to make the arbitration agreement more consensual than other forms of the con... other elements of the contract, that's your problem, not that they want to make it consensual, but they want to make it more consensual, hyperconsensual, isn't that your difficulty?"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1572.524,1576.227,I don't think that's what Montana is doing.
1995.95-559,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1635.976,1636.416,But I--
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1636.416,1640.149,--the Montana legislature did in enacting this statute.
1995.95-559,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1640.149,1701.84,"--But I don't think we can really deal with that hypothesis based on what you give us, because if we... if it were shown on the record that this concept of the unexpected turned out to be a concept which is either applied in sort of an undisciplined fashion by courts so that it could be used to single out arbitration, or if it was shown that it was applied in a way which, by whatever set of principles, the State courts were... tended to fall heavily on arbitration, or if it could be shown that it was intended as a common law rule really to apply to arbitration and make it more difficult, we would say that there was not, in fact, a sufficient generality there, and that therefore the rule, the unexpectedness concept would fail because it wasn't sufficiently general, and we just don't know enough, I guess, even if we had the case that you hypothesize, to know how we would rule on that."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1701.84,1719.281,"Well, I think what the Montana... the Montana court has adopted the reasonable expectations doctrine, and they've spelled out how they apply the doctrine in two cases involving arbitration, and I think if you look at that doctrine, it could have been applied in this case."
1995.95-559,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1719.281,1720.172,But it wasn't.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1720.883,1723.494,"No, it wasn't applied in this case."
1995.95-559,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1723.494,1725.487,They applied the statute.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1725.487,1739.046,"Right, but my argument is, is that if it would have been okay for the Montana court to have invalidated it under those general contract principles, it should also be okay for the Montana legislature to do the same thing."
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1739.046,1741.035,"But Ms. Sikes, can you explain to me why it's unexpected?"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1750.763,1781.732,"The notice provision, the notice requirement was enacted at the same time that... in 1985, when Montana was changing their entire law, and for the 100 years previously it had been Montana... in Montana's statute that arbitration agreements weren't going to be enforced, so I think it was perfectly reasonable for the Montana legislature to assume that it would be... it wasn't a background knowledge that people had in Montana, because--"
1995.95-559,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1781.732,1784.486,But isn't there a policy answer to that?
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1804.887,1811.812,"--But the statute itself does not discourage arbitration, and it doesn't prevent the enforcement of arbitration."
1995.95-559,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1811.812,1831.564,"Well, yes, but on your assumption, your assumption is that the arbitration clause may properly be found to be unexpected within the meaning of the Montana, either common law rule or statutory rule, and it seems to me that that, in and of itself, is at odds with Federal policy."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1831.564,1832.215,"Well, that--"
1995.95-559,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1832.215,1836.589,It's not a question whether it discourages arbitration under the section 2.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1844.794,1866.879,"--That's right, and that provision has to mean something, and if there is a doctrine that says that... the unexpected terms and standardized form contract doctrine is not only applied to arbitration provisions, it's applied to terms and standardized form contracts that the person signing the agreement might not expect."
1995.95-559,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.879,1872.212,"But the Montana supreme court didn't apply that judge made doctrine here, did it?"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1872.212,1872.643,No.
1995.95-559,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.86,1886.131,"Well, except apparently it thought that only arbitration would ever be unexpected."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1886.131,1888.793,"No, that's not true."
1995.95-559,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1890.145,1892.716,There's no generality to the statute.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1895.197,1926.499,"--It does single out arbitration, but it's... but the Montana... under Montana law, other provisions in a contract could be invalidated if they weren't conspicuous under this general common law that's also in Montana, and what the legislature is doing is simply creating a bright line rule that actually helps people who are drafting agreements to know, okay, if I'm going to put an arbitration provision in, it needs to be conspicuous, and this is how I need to make sure it's going to be conspicuous."
1995.95-559,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1926.499,1931.071,"Well, why didn't it help other people who were drafting other kinds of unexpected provisions?"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1931.071,1937.004,"Well, you have to look at the reason that the legislature was doing it."
1995.95-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1949.733,1951.143,Was this done simultaneously with the--
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1951.143,1952.875,"--Yes, exactly."
1995.95-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.408,1977.761,"--You want us to look at Montana law as a whole, and not at the statutory law separately from the judge made law, and you're saying--"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1977.761,1978.852,Exactly.
1995.95-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1978.852,1986.076,"--If you look at the whole ball of wax, this is just one piece of a general rule requiring notice of surprising provisions."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1986.076,1986.617,Exactly.
1995.95-559,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1988.079,1990.51,And the other members of that class are?
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,1990.51,2001.256,"--The other members of the class in statute are terms and retail... retail installment contracts, part of the UCC requirements that petitioner was talking about."
1995.95-559,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2001.256,2001.947,And the ones that are in--
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2001.947,2011.313,"But then also in common law Montana has invalidated certain provisions in insurance contracts, and also, Montana doesn't have a huge body of case law."
1995.95-559,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2019.718,2031.326,"--I mean, is that listed in your... what I'd need would be, if we're to look at it as a whole, is the list of provisions that don't have to do with arbitration, where the law of Montana, whether judge made--"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2031.326,2032.287,--Yes.
1995.95-559,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2033.186,2042.052,"--or legislature made, does, in fact, require notice roughly similar to underlined capital letters on the first page of a contract, not that that has to be just in those words."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2042.052,2042.292,Right.
1995.95-559,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2042.693,2043.354,Where is that list?
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2044.834,2045.195,--Yes.
1995.95-559,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2048.907,2057.252,"My guess is... I would assume, perhaps, that since you went through this, that the reason that there isn't a comprehensive list is you weren't able to find many things."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2057.252,2059.155,There aren't very many cases in Montana.
1995.95-559,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2059.155,2068.382,"Or in the incorporation of California law, or any place... I mean, you've looked at this pretty thoroughly... it's a good brief... and so my guess is, there just aren't that many things."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2068.382,2081.418,"Well, I also would like to point out that in terms of arbitration agreements, they... before 1985 they were invalidated for a whole lot of other reasons, and so you'd only be looking at a short period of time, anyway."
1995.95-559,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2082.31,2099.931,"May I ask you a question before you leave the question Justice Breyer raised, and that is, in giving the answer that you could to his question, you were giving some examples that at least... perhaps I didn't understand what you were saying, but they didn't seem to suggest to me that they would be an appropriate part of the series of unexpected terms."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2125.628,2139.265,"--I think that the rationale behind what the Montana legislature was doing in that is based on the understanding that people don't necessarily read form contracts carefully, and so--"
1995.95-559,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2139.265,2141.348,That's not the same thing as being unexpected.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2141.348,2161.251,"--Well, I think that the terms that need... in the statute have to do with the high interest rates that are in retail installment contracts, and so it wouldn't be within the reasonable expectations of a person signing a retail installment contract that there were going to be such high interest rates applied--"
1995.95-559,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2161.251,2179.052,"But if that is an example of the series, then it seems to me that arbitration is being analogized with high, if not quite unconscionable interest, and it sounds to me like a series... whatever the adjective the State uses, it sounds like a series of disfavored terms, not unexpected terms."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2179.052,2194.373,"--It's not that the term is disfavored, because if that were the case... well, obviously--"
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2194.373,2194.823,"Well, they're not--"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2194.823,2195.372,--under the Federal law they couldn't do that.
1995.95-559,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2195.372,2197.645,"--They're not incompatible categories, are they?"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2200.377,2201.837,Exactly.
1995.95-559,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2201.837,2208.872,"--I assume, for the obvious reasons that parties will have their legitimate expectations, or what they felt were legitimate expectations."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2208.872,2209.313,Exactly.
1995.95-559,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2254.902,2258.575,"Well, how did the supreme court of Montana avoid the statute in that case?"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2258.575,2261.927,"It just kind of ignores it, actually."
1995.95-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2271.543,2274.997,"Well then, our invalidation of it would make no difference, would it?"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2315.633,2348.615,"--Well, it actually would do more than that, because Montana has a statute... I wanted to point this out to Justice Breyer, too, that for bids, legal contracts from restraining legal... from putting any restraints on legal proceedings, so forum selection clauses that are outside the State in Montana are void as a matter of the statute, as would jury trial, so there's no need to require notice of those waiver type provisions, because you just can't waive your legal rights, except for arbitration."
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2350.676,2353.236,Forum selection clauses that are consented to?
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2353.847,2354.118,--Right.
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2359.09,2359.991,"--And then, how about choice of law?"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2359.991,2389.932,"--Well, the statute... it says restraints upon legal proceedings are void, so any... it's been used to... every stipulation or condition in a contract by which any party thereto is restricted from enforcing his rights under the contract by the usual proceedings in the ordinary tribunals, or which limits the time within which he may thus enforce his rights, is void, and it's been used... it now has an exception, so it doesn't invalidate arbitration agreements."
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2401.579,2403.6,But if litigation is actually begun in the forum selected--
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2403.6,2405.94,"--Well, in that case--"
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2405.94,2408.454,--Montana would have no choice but to recognize it.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2408.454,2408.612,"--Oh, right."
1995.95-559,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2431.519,2432.881,"Well, we don't have to deal with that, of course--"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2432.881,2433.151,Okay.
1995.95-559,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2433.772,2434.942,"--here, do we?"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2445.55,2474.979,"--I think that's right, and I... but my point is is that Congress said that arbitration agreements can be invalidated upon grounds that exist for the revocation of any contract, and that the savings clause has to mean something, and if it doesn't mean that a State can't invalidate an unexpected clause in a standardized form contract and use that general principles and apply it specifically to arbitration clauses, then I don't think section 2 means anything."
1995.95-559,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2474.979,2498.334,"Well, what are the other... you're talking about the other unexpected things other than arbitration, and has the supreme court of Montana said that things other... provisions other than Montana, other than arbitration must be displayed on the first page of the contract in capital letters, or have they simply invalidated those provisions?"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2498.334,2499.596,They've invalidated them.
1995.95-559,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2499.596,2501.286,"Well then, that isn't the same treatment."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2501.286,2514.663,But what the Montana... the doctrine of how you determine whether or not something is within the reasonable expectations of someone signing the contract also has to go to whether it's conspicuous or not.
1995.95-559,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2529.994,2535.767,And so that's how the unexpectedness doctrine works out in practice?
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2535.767,2536.178,Yes.
1995.95-559,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.178,2538.789,"To avoid it, you put it on the front page."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2538.789,2539.02,Yes.
1995.95-559,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2540.362,2543.872,"Then you put, actually the important terms of the contract on the other pages."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2544.173,2565.688,"Well, the people would be looking for those, and the common law doesn't say it has to be on the front page, but... which is why I think the statute actually benefits parties, because it sets out what the person drafting the agreement has to do in order to make sure that their provision is conspicuous enough."
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2601.481,2617.041,"Ms. Sikes, how about the problem that a Nationwide merchant has, and Montana says page 1 in capital letters, and suppose Nevada says, page 3 and bold face... these are form contracts that are prepared so they could be used in every State."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2617.041,2647.461,"--Well, that's why I think that the Chor case is important, because it shows that in Montana technical noncompliance isn't going to mean that the arbitration provision is going to be thrown out, so that if... if, in Montana, you had a... if you made sure that the arbitration provision was conspicuous in some other way, the evidence from Chor would be that the Montana supreme court would go ahead and enforce it, and I'd also just like to say that... I mean--"
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2647.461,2649.744,But there you said it was... she knew about it.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2649.744,2650.853,--Right.
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2652.555,2652.766,All right.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2673.008,2693.412,"--I think that the... that businesses who transact in interstate commerce... Doctor's Associates has 10,000 franchisees across the country, and for each of... they have to comply with all sorts of different State laws as it is, so this is not a significant burden on them."
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2696.665,2700.027,"Well, that's a different answer than the one you gave me before."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2700.027,2700.458,--Yes.
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2701.056,2704.271,Now you're saying they must comply with divergent laws--
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2704.271,2704.299,--I--
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2704.299,2705.911,--so they can't use the one form.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2705.911,2730.797,"--I think that there's evidence, given the Chor case, that the Montana court, if the provision was conspicuous, wouldn't hold the party to such an exacting requirement as notice, because if it had been conspicuous in some other way, the purpose of the statute, of providing informed consent, would have been given."
1995.95-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2730.797,2739.002,"That's remarkable, given the terms of the statute, that unless such notice is displayed, the contract may not be subject to arbitration."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2744.205,2745.087,But the--
1995.95-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2745.087,2747.158,"--That's a little harsh, and we're not going to do that."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2747.158,2748.379,"--Well, I wish--"
1995.95-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2748.379,2750.07,"They're different out there in Montana, I guess."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2750.381,2756.365,--I think there's two... there's two points to your question.
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2834.217,2836.139,"The selected forum was Connecticut, right?"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2839.351,2840.211,--Yes.
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2840.211,2858.863,"Could a Connecticut court, State or Federal, if there's diversity, instruct the parties to cease and desist from continuing that legislation in Montana because they have bound themselves to a clause that says arbitration?"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2876.565,2882.098,I don't know.
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2907.255,2912.899,"Well, maybe it suggests that under the Federal Arbitration Act this contract has to be treated the same way in every State."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2912.899,2932.461,"Right, and so... well, I... the... I'm not sure I understand exactly what your question is."
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2932.461,2947.701,"Well, I'm trying to suggest that this... there could be an unseemly confrontation among States that are proarbitration and States that are a little slow at getting there unless there's a uniform interpretation to the Federal law, so that--"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2947.701,2962.083,But the Federal Arbitration Act did leave for the States the ability to invalidate arbitration agreements under general grounds that would apply to the revocation of any contract.
1995.95-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2962.083,2968.465,"--Yes, but the question is, how can you really argue that something that says arbitration is general grounds?"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2968.465,2988.487,"Well, I... if you can't say that, then I don't see that the savings clause in section 2 means anything, because by singling... you'd always be singling out an arbitration provision in any kind of case where you were looking at the validity of the making of that agreement."
1995.95-559,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2988.487,2990.239,May I ask you a question?
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,2991.839,2993.622,My time is limited.
1995.95-559,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2994.371,2997.343,--You may welcome a different question.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3027.345,3027.775,--Yes.
1995.95-559,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3028.314,3031.266,So that this may not end the lawsuit even if you lose.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3031.266,3032.318,Right.
1995.95-559,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3044.626,3048.79,"What the Montana legislature did under your view of Montana law was just superfluous, that they could have--"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3048.79,3048.98,Yes.
1995.95-559,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3048.98,3058.327,--simply repealed the prohibition against arbitration agreements and the Montana supreme court would have decided this case precisely the same way on this background principle of common law that they never mentioned.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3058.327,3068.301,"Yes, and so what they were doing was simply creating this bright line rule that actually benefits arbitration because it gives people that rule that they know they have to comply with."
1995.95-559,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3068.301,3076.228,"Well, do you have in your brief on this the list of other cases decided on this basis, or this background rule, so that we're... I mean, this started with Terminex--"
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3076.228,3076.469,Let me--
1995.95-559,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3076.469,3078.429,"--Like the termites, it keeps sort of coming back."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3078.72,3092.979,"--In case I don't, there's Transamerica v. Royale, which is the case where the Montana court adopted the reasonable expectations doctrine."
1995.95-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3117.144,3124.828,--Those are surely not cases which say that the provision in question must be typed in underlined capital letters on the first page of the contract.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3124.828,3125.279,--No.
1995.95-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3125.279,3126.731,There are a lot of other ways of making it prominent.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3126.731,3127.102,Right.
1995.95-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3127.102,3128.532,Like if you wave it in the face of a plaintiff--
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3128.532,3128.762,That's--
1995.95-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3128.762,3129.994,--or do all sorts of things.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3131.594,3132.295,"--No, that's--"
1995.95-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3132.295,3133.136,--that is being applied.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3133.136,3133.705,--That's correct.
1995.95-559,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3141.852,3143.382,This is a proarbitration statute.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3143.752,3146.134,--Right.
1995.95-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3172.941,3178.285,Are you going to advise the Montana supreme court to go ahead and strike it down under a common law rule?
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3182.558,3183.089,Well--
1995.95-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3183.089,3184.198,Are you sure they may?
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3185.951,3190.522,"--I think they can, because if--"
1995.95-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3190.522,3193.214,They can decree that arbitration agreements are unexpected.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3193.214,3200.689,--Not as a general... I... they would be looking to the--
1995.95-559,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3200.689,3203.401,You surely will make the same argument to them that you made to us.
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3204.442,3204.713,--No.
1995.95-559,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3207.585,3207.825,"Thank you, Ms. Sikes."
1995.95-559,1,35070,lucinda_a_sikes,,3207.825,3208.096,Thank you.
1995.95-559,2,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,3210.48,3212.64,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-559,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3300.5,3306.484,"Mr. Kravitz, isn't there another answer to my suggestion, namely that your opponent is suing on the contract, aren't they?"
1995.95-559,2,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,3308.174,3308.454,That's correct.
1995.95-559,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3308.454,3311.005,So they can't very well say the contract's invalid.
1995.95-559,2,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,3312.878,3317.129,"They're just attacking... you're absolutely right, Justice Stevens, and let me say one other thing."
1995.95-559,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3414.635,3414.976,"Thank you, Mr. Kravitz."
1995.95-559,2,36169,mark_r_kravitz,,3414.976,3415.306,Thank you.
1995.95-559,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3415.306,3416.457,The case is submitted.
