1969.402,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.924,"Number 402, United States against Key."
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,65.908,70.359,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,230.865,235.439,You say this was basically a liquidation plan and not a continuing?
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,235.439,236.211,That is correct.
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,236.211,241.926,Where were the installment payments going to be generated?
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,241.926,252.875,The payments being made by Hennis Trucking Company which has purchased the Interstate Commerce Commission rights to operate the freight line.
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,252.875,256.125,Based on the capital equipment?
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,256.125,260.625,"Now, the capital equipment had previously been disposed off."
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,260.625,262.713,I see.
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,262.713,265.238,The major remaining asset was simply the --
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,265.238,265.896,Was the license?
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,265.896,267.069,The license.
1969.402,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,268.148,275.108,While youre pausing for a moment could you answer this for me.
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,287.845,294.709,We would be entitled to object to it but the secretary also would have had discretion to accept for the plan if he wishes.
1969.402,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,294.709,298.751,"He can and sometimes does accept, does he not?"
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,298.751,308.42,"Yes, he does sir specially when it will contribute to rehabilitation of the debtor and enable the debtor to continue in business."
1969.402,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,308.42,314.575,But you regard this is simply a voluntary waiver by the Government of the priority claim.
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,314.575,319.193,"That is our view, yes Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,535.036,537.052,"I thought, I guess I misunderstood."
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,543.948,547.276,(Voice Overlap) It's admitted that we're entitled to full payment.
1969.402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,549.02,549.19,Oh!
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,564.287,568.556,I meant to say it's admitted by the respondent that they were entitled to full payment.
1969.402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,573.1,574.64,I don't understand that.
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,588.384,594.297,There is an alternative contention that we have a right to take the discounting into account.
1969.402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,594.297,599.063,"The only right is to full payment, isn't it on circumstances in this case?"
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,599.063,608.174,"Well, we also contend that we have a right to be first satisfied under Section 3466 of the Revised --"
1969.402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,608.174,619.084,"But you just said you don't claim a right to be paid now in cash simply because cash is available, haven’t you?"
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,619.084,622.493,What I just said was in Chapter X proceedings.
1969.402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,630.053,630.754,So what --
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,630.754,636.922,We don't claim that because cash is on hand and we are creditor we have a right to the immediate payment of our claim.
1969.402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,636.922,638.895,"That's what I understood you to say so, what are --"
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,638.895,644.968,"But when cash is being paid to creditors, we claim the right to be satisfied first."
1969.402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,644.968,647.506,Now on fully in cash?
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,647.506,653.189,"To the limit of what's being paid to creditors, yes Mr. Justice."
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,669.635,676.782,"Now, you should contend or 3466 gives you a priority, is that right?"
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,676.782,679.544,And that is what we understand to be the meaning of the priority.
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,679.544,687.207,"Well, you contend that's applicable in this case but so does the Bankruptcy Act give priorities."
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,693.646,700.679,"There is no general priority provision in Chapter X Mr. Justice, the only comprehensive --"
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.679,702.346,What about administrative expenses?
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,702.346,705.854,There is a provision for administrative expenses.
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,707.405,709.04,What about wages?
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,709.04,713.226,There is no wage priority in Chapter X.
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,713.226,714.71,Either --
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,714.71,722.676,There is a wage priority in Section 64 of the Act which by Section 102 of the Act is expressly inapplicable to Chapter X.
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.676,726.974,What about your creditors in Chapter X?
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,726.974,739.972,"There is nothing granting them priority in Chapter X, but there has been lengthy litigation about whether they have a priority ahead of the 3466 priority."
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,739.972,752.75,I thought you relied on the cases on strict priority -- strict priority doctrine that you have to pay -- that you really have satisfy priority creditors like the Case against Los Angeles?
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,752.75,756.805,"Well, we do contend that you have to abide by the classes of priority creditors."
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.805,763.973,"You really wouldn’t suggest to that -- you really wouldn’t suggest to the secured creditor does not have some priority to Chapter X, would you?"
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,763.973,764.998,No.
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,783.097,783.905,Alright.
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,789.262,797.911,"We believe that the standards of priority that prevail in equity receiverships have been carried over into Chapter X, yes sir."
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,797.911,818.075,"Alright, let's take a mortgagee priority over unsecured creditors, would you suggest that the mortgagee may not be postponed in payment to unsecured creditors who say have been scaled down to 25% of their claim?"
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,854.028,865.333,"Our understanding of the fair and equitable rule is that if the secured creditors object to that, they have a right to insist on their payments being made first, but --"
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,865.333,866.979,"And that is essential for your case, isn’t it?"
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,866.979,872.314,It’s not essential for your case Mr. Justice because we have a statutory right and revised statutes.
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,872.314,876.11,I know but although you say that give this priority.
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,876.11,886.376,"Moreover, we have an explicit right in Section 199 in Chapter X to object to the plan if it doesn’t satisfy our rights."
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,886.376,886.775,Yes.
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,917.84,931.991,"Well, I think it’s more explicit that it’s a right to have our claim first satisfied that’s the language used in Section 3466 where there’s no explicit statutory language giving the secured creditors such a right."
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,952.389,959.69,I take it that if you really do then find it essential to rely on 3466 in this case.
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,959.69,971.969,Not essential because we don’t think we received the full payment right granted in Section 199 since the discounting of our claims was never taken into account.
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.969,983.652,Except for that point so you aren’t just relying on being a priority creditor under Chapter X or relying of being a priority creditor under the other Section 3466.
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,983.652,991.574,"Well, we also rely on the idea that Chapter X grants two priorities only."
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.144,1081.528,"The cases have certainly adjudicated a whole system of priorities in Chapter X, aren’t they?"
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1082.456,1083.565,That is correct.
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.565,1090.258,But the cases have certainly adjudicated including administrative expenses.
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1090.258,1096.31,No one to my knowledge has contested that the administrative expenses have the priority.
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1096.31,1100.087,Or that nobody is contesting that you have a priority?
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1100.087,1111.036,"It’s just what is meant by priority that's being contested here, that is correct."
1969.402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.671,1575.031,Compensating (Inaudible)
1969.402,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1575.031,1600.146,Of course Congress also provided specifically in Section 199 in its predecessor that the Secretary of the Treasury may compromise the Government's rights and in appropriate cases this enables the Secretary to contribute to Chapter X’s objective of fostering rehabilitation of the debtor when feasible.
1969.402,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1757.529,1759.018,Mr. Beck.
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,1759.018,1762.501,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.829,2001.647,The unsecured creditors were to get only 20% --
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2001.647,2001.797,That is correct.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2001.797,2004.444,-- on their claims or 20% reduction of their claim?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2004.444,2006.673,20% of their claims.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.673,2007.286,Total?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2007.286,2008.635,Total.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2008.635,2008.637,Uh-huh.
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2008.637,2014.777,"Now, the Government is correct, this is a plan for liquidation."
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2028.441,2032.748,It's still a -- it’s still of reorganization plan even though it provides for complete liquidation?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2032.748,2036.881,It is still a reorganization -- that is correct.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.881,2041.575,"So, it's judged by the rules of Chapter X of bankruptcy?"
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2041.575,2043.646,No question about.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.498,2064.333,Or should (Inaudible)
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2064.333,2066.492,No.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2119.952,2121.105,"Well, do you -- let me ask you."
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2142.467,2143.955,"No, I do not think so."
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.955,2144.847,Why not?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2144.847,2159.097,Because I don't think in that particular point that would be fair and equitable because at that particular point you would be using money which rightfully belongs to a senior creditor for the benefit of a junior creditor.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.097,2170.635,Would you think then that fair -- that fairness and equitable -- fair and equity applied to be fair and equitable and not really recognized in full or priority?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2170.635,2172.022,I don't think that's quite true.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.931,2186.61,"Well, there's available cash it’s paid to junior creditors and not paid to a senior creditor."
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2186.61,2188.22,That is not quite true.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2193.791,2219.108,"Well, at the first distribution there is $18,000.00 paid to -- for miscellaneous taxes and $14,000.00 paid for another tax claim and certain damages for cargo loss."
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2225.6,2227.824,"Well, let me put it this way then."
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2257.318,2264.854,Where is the priority in the statute for Ohio use taxes?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2264.854,2267.093,There is no priority in the statute.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.571,2282.418,So the United States tax claims is senior to this Ohio use tax claim?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2282.418,2286.982,"In a straight Chapter X, I would say yes."
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2288.635,2289.989,Wasn't this in Chapter X?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2289.989,2299.172,"Yes, but I think we must view in the light of liquidation and what the bankruptcy priorities would be because what the alternative to this is, is the bankruptcy."
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.172,2307.995,"Well, so you're -- you're really saying that the priority rules and the rules of reorganization shouldn’t apply to this case?"
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2307.995,2332.57,I am saying that the rules of reorganization are equitable rules and they are flexible and that this Court has decided time and again that the rules in equity proceedings must be flexible depending upon the type of situation and I think we have such a situation here.
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2332.57,2340.499,What do you think about the holdings in the Case opinion and in Consolidated Rock?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2340.499,2342.708,I think that we follow them.
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2343.826,2350.262,I noticed that -- unless I missed it in the Court of Appeals’ opinion they didn't refer to them or cite them.
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2356.828,2361.16,My recollection is I don't recall whether they cited the case in them or not.
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2361.912,2368.146,They cited four or five case but they didn't mention either of those if I read it correctly.
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2370.436,2372.062,"Well, I can't answer that."
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2393.166,2402.67,But even if the Court of Appeals thought they were following these cases which would certainly be [Sneezes] that’s curious they don't think to cite them.
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2402.67,2406.326,I can't answer of course for the judges of Court of Appeals.
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2406.326,2413.515,You might -- even though your lunch hour is short you might check that out to see if I missed something.
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2413.515,2416.875,I'll be happy to do that.
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2427.367,2429.583,Very well.
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2444.768,2446.353,Mr. Beck.
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2446.353,2456.529,"Mr. Chief Justice, you asked before the recess as to the Circuit Court's opinion with respect to this case."
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2546.631,2557.371,But that isn't whether they're entitled to cash payment may not be the question is whether they're entitled to payment before a junior creditor?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2557.371,2563.316,I don't believe there is any place in the Act which says they must be paid before a junior creditor.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.316,2566.812,"Well, is the United States a senior creditor or isn't it?"
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2566.812,2574.062,I would state in my view whether the United States is a senior creditor or a junior creditor.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2589.769,2591.896,And you must take that position I -- by thinking the way (Voice Overlap)?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2591.896,2592.219,Oh!
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.097,2593.558,Yes.
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2593.558,2595.476,I don't have any qualms about taking that.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2595.476,2606.476,That a senior creditor may be postponed in payment for 10 years as long as he's assured -- he’s being paid but junior creditors can be paid immediately?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2606.476,2610.987,"No, junior creditors may not take something from the senior creditor."
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.855,2632.08,"Well, let's just take the case where a senior creditor is provided for in the plan by a promise and security that he'll be paid for full 10 years in the date of conformation of the plan."
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2632.08,2633.252,Yes.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2633.252,2640.19,And junior creditors are paid in full in cash upon the date of conformation?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2640.19,2644.018,I'm assuming now we have valued correctly and that they are entitled to that payment.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2644.018,2644.697,Apparently.
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2644.697,2649.004,I would say I find nothing wrong in terms of that.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2665.946,2670.634,"Well, the senior creditor doesn’t question in my example the fact that he will be paid in 10 years."
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2670.634,2671.815,Then I say it's --
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2671.815,2678.07,"As I agree, all will be paid, there's plenty of security there but he says, I want my money now before these junior creditors get it."
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2678.07,2679.698,I don’t think he's entitled to it.
1969.402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2679.698,2680.391,Uh-huh.
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2681.965,2684.821,I think I'm correct in view of all the other cases.
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2684.821,2690.337,"Well, if that isn't your position, you are in difficulty aren't you?"
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2692.692,2697.212,"No, I wouldn't say that necessarily but I will stick by that position."
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2697.212,2721.243,"Well, another thing isn't it possible that taking Justice White's hypothetical case that the payment out to all the unsecured general creditors in full at the outset has at least the potential for so undermining the position of the debtor that they might never get to paying the United States or the deferred creditors at the end of the line."
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2721.243,2722.44,I agree.
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2725.535,2729.318,"Well, isn’t that why the priority was granted to the United States for tax purposes?"
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2729.318,2732.786,"No, I think that's not the historical reason to bear in mind."
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2741.754,2744.242,"Well, isn't that just what I have said?"
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2746.462,2748.22,"Well, I must have misunderstood."
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2748.22,2750.567,(Voice Overlap) priority to see that the United States is paid.
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2750.567,2758.297,Yes and there's nothing in this case that says they won't be nor other cases where I can see where solvency is at issue.
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2862.806,2870.338,But that last item 100% tax claim is to just to get rid of the cats and dogs?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2870.338,2877.662,"That's correct, but in bankruptcy that they entitle to pro rate with the United States."
1969.402,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2921.315,2924.64,"Before you leave that chart, may I ask you one question."
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2930.082,2931.704,At the initial distribution.
1969.402,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2931.704,2932.833,Why is that?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2932.833,2939.69,Because Your Honor the 20% is a compromise of their claims as I will show in liquidation.
1969.402,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2949.145,2950.67,For settlement in full of their claims?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2950.67,2952.422,That is correct.
1969.402,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2952.422,2953.533,And that's all they ever get?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2953.533,2954.475,That's all they ever get.
1969.402,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2954.475,2955.368,That's the end of the line for them?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2955.368,2956.342,That's the end of the line.
1969.402,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2956.342,2958.769,Whereas all the others ultimately you say get a 100%.
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2958.769,2961.112,Get 100%.
1969.402,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2961.112,2962.222,Get 100%?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2962.222,2966.287,"Yes sir, everybody else receives 100% except the creditors."
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2968.929,2971.396,That is if the company is still in business at the --
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,2971.396,2972.833,"Well, let me put it at this way."
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3099.757,3119.222,"But counsel, if the United States is right on their argument about the priorities, then these matters become irrelevant because the wisdom of their challenging the plan is not for us if indeed there is a priority."
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,3119.222,3137.417,But I contend that even with the priority they are still bound by Section 216 (7) of the Act which indicates that a dissenting creditor can be satisfied by various means and in this case they are satisfied by two means.
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3147.018,3149.127,But there you're arguing the wisdom of it again?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,3149.127,3160.002,"No, I'm talking of terms of 216 (7) and I'm talking in terms of 216 (7) which is pointed in the appendix to our brief."
1969.402,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3261.154,3263.79,"That really isn't the point, is it?"
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,3263.79,3265.247,"Well, I think it is."
1969.402,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3266.423,3268.733,Do you concede that they're entitled to full payment?
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,3268.733,3270.384,I do.
1969.402,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3270.384,3286.118,"And full payment of $375,000.00 now is not made by paying installments that add up -- that arithmetically add up to that sum over a period of many years, that’s not full payment."
1969.402,1,41049,sigmund_j_beck,,3286.118,3296.32,"Well, if Justice will allow me I would say this; I think the question is one of substance not a form."
1969.402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3461.759,3464.121,Thank you Mr. Beck.
1969.402,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3468.523,3472.504,"I would just like to make two brief points, Your Honor."
1969.402,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3512.273,3513.973,"It rather begs the question, doesn’t it?"
1969.402,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3523.443,3527.293,"Well, this is not my assumption."
1969.402,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3613.255,3622.914,"I don't know whether this record contains it but is there any indication of what the discounted value of $375,000.00 paid over that basis."
1969.402,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3657.232,3659.769,That is correct sir.
1969.402,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3680.912,3700.543,Suppose it's not relevant here but from what you said before I take it that some plan less than the distribution under bankruptcy but more than the one offered might have been acquiesced by the Government.
1969.402,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3700.543,3702.316,There is the authority to do that.
1969.402,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3716.878,3717.895,Thank you Mr. Wallace.
1969.402,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3717.895,3736.262,"Counsel, the other counsel stated to me that payment to thereto other creditors at the first line was the payment in full but it looks like over the last line it was a not a payment in full, what is that?"
1969.402,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3736.262,3738.027,"That was the other chart, Mr. Counsel."
1969.402,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3738.027,3749.675,"In the other chart, I think his contention was that eventually there would be payment in full even though the initial payment was only 10%."
1969.402,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3762.246,3763.822,100% without interest?
1969.402,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3763.822,3770.2,"Without interest, I think that was the point he was making when he said we would get 100%."
1969.402,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3770.2,3775.824,And that the other creditors get 20% now and that's all they ever got under the plan?
1969.402,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3775.824,3784.339,"That was the contrast he was trying so that even though initially under the plan, we get only 10% compared to their 20%."
1969.402,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3786.954,3790.137,I don't understand still then.
1969.402,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3792.891,3797.212,"The general unsecured creditors well, this is not the plan."
1969.402,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3797.664,3803.238,"Yes, I understand it but what is that figure over here for?"
1969.402,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3803.238,3819.506,This is the hypothetical figure that counsel suggest as what the -- are general unsecured creditors would eventually get if these were not at Chapter X proceeding but an ordinarily liquidation.
1969.402,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3819.506,3821.442,Yes.
1969.402,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3821.442,3822.379,Thank you Mr. Wallace.
