1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,52.49,56.159,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1975.75-95,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,412.964,421.86,What if the National Guard just concludes that he is not up to par in terms of his technical competence?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,421.86,425.396,"Are you alluding Your Honor, to his military capacity?"
1975.75-95,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,425.396,431.802,(Inaudible) -- his technician in essence and they have two choices.
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,446.314,452.391,"Well, Your Honor, a guard member has no right to reenlist."
1975.75-95,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,456.097,459.093,Have these two evidences to terminate him?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,459.093,460.012,"Your Honor, exactly."
1975.75-95,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.505,499.66,"Mr. Shipley, does it really make any difference whether it is military or not?"
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,513.446,514.481,"Well, Your Honor, exactly."
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,533.033,535.95,"As you have said, this is Civil Service."
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,535.95,538.675,"Your Honor, it is civil service."
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,542.332,544.457,You then cannot fire -- then he will?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,544.457,547.077,They cannot -- you cannot fire him for cause.
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,547.077,550.798,And you can not fire him at will?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,550.798,554.722,"From his technician status, that is right, Your Honor, we agree."
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,554.722,567.365,"So that, if they want to fire him, and they are not willing to go through the normal firing processes, they just refuse the letter and reenlist."
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,567.365,568.89,"That is right, Your Honor, they can refuse the letter."
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,568.89,570.123,That is (Voice overlap)
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,570.123,571.169,That would be right.
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,571.169,572.093,That is all right?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,572.093,572.876,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,572.876,577.908,"Now, all the Court of Appeals said let us go back and find out if there is some hanky-panky on this."
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,577.908,597.158,"Well, Your Honor, I do not think that there is any allegation of hanky-panky because I think that the fact of the matter is, that a Guard Commander in making his determination on whether or not to let the guards to reenlist, might well consider his --"
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,597.158,599.866,That is what the court says go find that.
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,599.866,600.274,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,600.274,613.663,"The Court says, go find that, whether the reason to fire him -- not to let him reenlist was not to deprive him of his job."
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,613.663,617.391,That is what the court said but they went further Your Honor in stating that--
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,617.391,619.722,What is wrong with finding that out?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,619.722,633.143,"Well, Your Honor, this is the difficulty it creates there is that it would create a bifurcated guard capacity."
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,647.508,656.6,"About this case, let me just a man that has the status of the standing job, the Civil Service job I saw him in one of his limited jobs."
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,656.6,656.705,Right.
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,656.705,659.247,It does not apply to the other one?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,659.247,663.703,"But the technician status, Your Honor, is subservient to the military status."
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,669.356,672.887,"And to give him Civil Service status, this is what you are saying?"
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,672.887,673.394,It does.
1975.75-95,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,697.076,701.505,What would the level of the decision not to permit reenlistment made?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,701.505,713.298,"Your Honor, the Air Force regulation which is directive but not binding on the State of Tennessee National Guard and which I understand is generally followed is that the decision is made by the unit commander."
1975.75-95,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,715.486,718.716,This unit would be what?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,718.716,720.07,I have to refer Your Honor.
1975.75-95,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,720.07,722.461,What kind of a unit is it?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,722.461,724.77,We are dealing with the basic.
1975.75-95,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,734.363,735.339,Like a company?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,735.339,736.855,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,736.855,738.055,Most of them are major.
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,738.055,738.487,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,738.487,748.536,"But he did in fact in this case – he did in fact in this case consult some sort of advisory group of other officers, did he not?"
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,748.536,749.12,Right Your Honor.
1975.75-95,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,768.263,775.118,"I mean there is nothing in the way of review of the initial decision whatever level it is made, whether it is captain or major."
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,775.118,775.708,Your Honor I would --
1975.75-95,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,775.708,780.517,"The review of that not of right, the Guardsman has no--"
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,780.517,781.252,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,793.66,798.282,(Inaudible) -- the Tennessee Guard unit would be the Adjutant General that he would be on the top --
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,798.282,799.64,"He is at the top, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,799.64,800.697,Could it get to him?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,800.697,802.422,It could get to him and I believe--
1975.75-95,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,802.422,804.251,Not of right as far as the guardsman is (Voice overlap)
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,804.251,807.652,It is not a right vested in the Guardsman himself.
1975.75-95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,813.965,825.182,"(Inaudible) Mr. Shipley, as I understand it that a reenlistment confers no more rights upon the applicant for reenlistment than with an applicant for original enlistment."
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,825.182,826.742,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,827.117,828.43,You are at zero.
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,828.43,829.913,You are at zero.
1975.75-95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,835.355,839.992,"(Inaudible) -- go on but so far as the rights of the applicant go, they are--"
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,839.992,840.837,Starting from scratch.
1975.75-95,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,840.837,843.504,They are zero and that is your submission as I understand it?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,843.504,844.329,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,844.329,853.967,"And that it is for that reason, from your point of view, that there is nothing that for any court to review because they can do this for any reason they desire."
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,853.967,862.203,"Right, Your Honor, and I think that is the danger in the Sixth Circuit precedent in this case that a well pleaded but factually unsubstantial complaint."
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,862.203,869.117,"Final question, the man, the Adjutant General is in charge of him as a specialist, right?"
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,869.117,870.13,As a technician.
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,870.13,870.7,Technician.
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,870.7,871.776,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,871.776,875.296,He is responsible for him as a Guardsman.
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,875.296,879.929,He is subservient to the Governor’s Commander in Chief but the State Guard is a Guardsman.
1975.75-95,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.929,892.13,"And would you say that the decision to refuse enlistment or reenlistment is wholly discretionary, not subject to review on any ground?"
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,892.13,895.01,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,895.01,895.735,What if—
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,895.735,900.33,After the constitutionally protected ground such as race or First Amendment protected by--
1975.75-95,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,900.33,902.768,"Certainly a big absence, is it not?"
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,902.768,904.673,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.673,926.082,"And I suppose that if there was a statutory, if the statute regulating this technician’s job expressly said that you cannot refuse to reenlist because of your job performance."
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,926.082,930.233,Then that would be a statutory creative right which there is -- not here.
1975.75-95,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,930.233,935.7,"Well, the argument here is that the argument on the other side is that is what the statute means."
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,949.599,954.143,"Your Honor, I think that that would be an appropriate military determination."
1975.75-95,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,956.108,958.472,Do we not have to judge the case on this basis?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,958.472,960.914,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,969.706,982.805,"The Court of Appeals apparently thought as I understand it, thought that the real reason they were refusing to reenlist was that they were unsatisfied with his job performance."
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,982.805,985.435,"Well, Your Honor, the allegation was that--"
1975.75-95,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,985.435,992.084,"And, I thought your position was that even if that is the case, there is no judicial review of that decision."
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,992.084,993.38,"And we think so, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1033.359,1035.376,Which does not require any charges?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,1035.376,1036.542,"Right, right, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1040.923,1051.431,"As I understand you, you would agree that if he were terminated or refused reenlistment for a constitutionally impermissible reason that he would be entitled to some hearing."
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,1051.431,1052.462,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1052.724,1059.084,"Supposing, in other words if the purpose was to deny him a constitutional right. He would be entitled to some kind of hearing."
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,1059.084,1059.496,Yes.
1975.75-95,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1059.496,1073.886,"Supposing he has alleged, and I think one might read his complaint this way, that the statute gave him a right not to be discharged except for a cause which gave him a property interest in his job and that entitled him constitutionally to a hearing in connection with the discharge."
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,1080.752,1092.075,"That might be so, Your Honor, except for the statute itself and the legislative history itself indicates that the technician status is subservient to the military status."
1975.75-95,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.852,1130.8,Would you agree that if he were terminated for any reason other than failure to continue a status in the reserve that he would be entitled constitutionally to a hearing?
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,1130.8,1138.45,"Well, Your Honor, there are several other reasons but if he were separated for calls from his technician job, certainly he is entitled --"
1975.75-95,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.45,1139.893,He still has the right to a hearing?
1975.75-95,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1140.976,1144.535,(Inaudible) and the statute says he has that right.
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,1144.535,1155.358,"Well, I do not think we get to the question of whether he has a constitutional right and I think maybe that we are looking at the statute to see whether it does create a right to continue guard membership."
1975.75-95,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1155.358,1159.011,The statute creates a right to a hearing for an administrative dismissal as a technician--
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,1159.011,1160.522,For a cause.
1975.75-95,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1160.522,1162.534,For a cause.
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,1180.423,1181.526,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1181.526,1185.784,And that there is no review of that kind from your--
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,1185.784,1186.296,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1191.79,1194.89,(Inaudible) civilian judgment.
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,1202.506,1214.351,"In this particular instance, he may well be both but he actually wear two hats, Your Honor, because as a National Guard technician, his supervisor is a Civil Service technician."
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1214.351,1218.518,He says while I got the hat on as supervisor of this man.
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,1223.544,1225.93,"No, Your Honor, because you did not fire him in this case."
1975.75-95,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1265.907,1267.896,He has been in the guard since 17-and-half years
1975.75-95,0,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,1267.896,1268.947,"No, Your Honor."
1975.75-95,1,44554,william_terry_denton,,1709.771,1714.261,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1975.75-95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1761.693,1777.707,The decision is not a military decision if the commander reaches the conclusion that his performance as a technician is not supportive of the military mission of the unit?
1975.75-95,1,44554,william_terry_denton,,1777.707,1778.025,No sir.
1975.75-95,2,17046,alex_b_shipley_jr,,3428.448,3437.341,"Briefly Your Honor, I would like to reiterate that this was a purely military decision and to refer, Your Honors, to the prayers of the complaint."
1975.75-95,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3472.389,3473.139,Thank you gentlemen.
