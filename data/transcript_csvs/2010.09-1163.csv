2010.09-1163,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.737,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1163, Milner v. The Department of the Navy."
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,8.704,11.289,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1163,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,135.003,135.789,Could I ask you this.
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,168.407,170.759,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-1163,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,203.479,219.906,"I ask -- I ask the question because the world has changed in a lot of ways since 1981, and one is that there is now I think much greater concern about the disclosure of information that has perhaps profound security implications."
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,256.464,264.903,"--Well, Your Honor, there could be a variety of FOIA exemptions that could fit under 7 depending on whether or not it's law enforcement-related."
2010.09-1163,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,292.554,293.82,Even though--
2010.09-1163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,293.82,294.687,7 and 3--
2010.09-1163,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,294.687,312.349,"--Even though you -- you said that -- about Exemption 7, the amendment to that, so you don't need 2, you still -- as far as I know every court of appeals that has weighed in has accepted Crooker."
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,342.737,350.074,"We don't need to project -- under Judge Fletcher's viewpoint, we did not need to reject High 2 to prevail."
2010.09-1163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,370.57,372.339,--Why does that show that?
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,375.156,376.041,"Well, I think--"
2010.09-1163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,376.041,382.862,"I mean, if Crooker was interpreting section 2, that was the interpretation."
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,398.704,401.489,--I think there are three points to look at on that.
2010.09-1163,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,429.557,430.59,"Well, you get a different Congress."
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,458.657,459.44,--No.
2010.09-1163,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,459.44,460.942,That's an extraordinary proposition.
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,460.942,462.942,"No, that's not the proposition I am making."
2010.09-1163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,480.856,484.308,"How do you know, what we have is 7 E in front of us?"
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,528.337,530.203,"Well, another point that I would--"
2010.09-1163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,530.203,532.121,What's your answer to that?
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,534.24,544.679,"--Well, my answer is, is, you are correct that they did not read -- they did not specifically state what they were doing or why."
2010.09-1163,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,547.464,550.147,But there was a proposal to amend 2--
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,550.147,551.313,There had been an original proposal.
2010.09-1163,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,551.313,561.586,"--And it was a conscious decision by Congress not to do 2 to conform to Crooker more generally, but to only pass 7."
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,569.109,574.862,I would believe that they -- backing up to Crooker.
2010.09-1163,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,597.226,604.032,"Mr. Mann, do you assume there is always a reason for Congress's not passing a law?"
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,613.637,615.422,"I accept that, Your Honor."
2010.09-1163,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,615.422,636.168,Do you know of any case in which the failure of Congress to amend a law in order to overrule a court decision other than a decision of this Court has been held to be an implicit approval of that decision?
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,651.075,651.792,"No, we don't, Your Honor."
2010.09-1163,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,651.792,652.542,I don't know of any.
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,652.542,655.375,"Your Honor, but I would like to make one additional point on this."
2010.09-1163,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,696.985,708.36,"Counsel, in Rose we talked about a legitimate public purpose in seeking information."
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,756.523,765.113,"--But it does not have to be using Exemption 2, as its stated, for strictly internal personnel policies."
2010.09-1163,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,870.216,889.36,"Of course, if that's the outcome of this case and if you prevail, that would mean that more things will be classified and withdrawn wholly from scrutiny, whereas if other exemptions are used they can be shared to a greater extent."
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,898.3,905.322,"I don't think I am, Your Honor, because I believe that through the Exemption 3 they can't limit it to."
2010.09-1163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,976.402,977.968,What do you want to know?
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,1005.152,1006.504,But it shouldn't be through Exemption 2.
2010.09-1163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1006.504,1007.12,Why?
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,1007.12,1007.787,Because it's not an--
2010.09-1163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1007.787,1008.92,"Well, that's a different argument."
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,1008.92,1009.706,--Right.
2010.09-1163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1009.706,1020.162,"I mean, your four arguments seem to me to be the same arguments that Judge Edwards in the D.C. Circuit considered, and they are excellent arguments, and there are arguments on both sides, and then they considered it and came to a conclusion."
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,1025.03,1035.255,"It's a different argument in the sense that what Judge Edwards was looking at and the Crooker decision was looking at was a specific group of documents, these manuals of policy and procedure."
2010.09-1163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1047.979,1050.014,"I mean, it's only addressed from law enforcement."
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,1069.976,1071.428,Well--
2010.09-1163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1071.428,1072.895,That's -- that's their reasoning.
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,1078.015,1081.534,"--I would agree that this, perhaps, was not addressed in 7."
2010.09-1163,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1094.376,1108.72,"As I -- as I read the D.C. Circuit decision, you are assuming or you are suggesting that the D.C. Circuit saw a gap that Congress hadn't provided for, and it fills that gap."
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,1158.701,1180.249,"--Your Honor, the issue here is not so much Crooker as it is what the Ninth Circuit has done to, we believe, expand Crooker, because you are correct, obviously the Crooker decision was a well-written, long, and very detailed decision, both the en banc as well as the dissents, but -- the dissent."
2010.09-1163,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.178,1266.172,"Mr. Mann, I thought you disagreed with the premise of Justice Ginsburg's question; that is, that you assert that the language related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency is quite clear."
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,1266.172,1267.622,--I do.
2010.09-1163,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.622,1270.555,I thought maybe you were abandoning that.
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,1270.555,1271.057,"No, no."
2010.09-1163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1294.605,1296.039,How is it -- how is it broader?
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,1334.33,1341.818,"Well, I believe it is addressed in the decision during the context leading up to the decision, but it is addressed by this Court in Rose."
2010.09-1163,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1341.818,1367.802,"Oh, that -- if we're looking at Crooker, I just read the words ""would there be circumvention"", and it seemed to me in this case the Navy has plans and they use those plans to store munitions safely, and the risk that they worry about is someone will get ahold of the plans and use the positions of those munitions in order to make them unsafe, for example, blowing them up."
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,1374.539,1377.974,But not by the regulator.
2010.09-1163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1377.974,1383.542,"That's correct, and I didn't find anything in Crooker that said -- and I don't know why you would have such a theory."
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,1397.436,1414.997,"Because the basis -- it's -- the basis for that is, again, this Court's language in Rose, where it looked at -- again, we are going back to a very few words in the House report, and the House report is looking at these guidelines and manuals of procedure for government investigators or examiners."
2010.09-1163,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1469.215,1481.957,"Do you have any reason to -- just out of curiosity, do you have any reason to believe that the current version of the ESQD map is different from the one that was published in the newspaper previously?"
2010.09-1163,0,21207,david_s_mann,,1481.957,1483.307,"We do not know, Your Honor."
2010.09-1163,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1533.74,1534.957,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1543.529,1546.548,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1163,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1559.808,1570.18,"Could you tell me what the textual basing for Crooker's ""predominantly internal"" and ""circumvention of agency regulation"" requirements is?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1583.59,1590.494,"Well, I think the -- as our brief explained, there are three basic elements to Exemption 2."
2010.09-1163,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1600.533,1606.436,The problem with that in this case is that it's a mixed document.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1611.09,1612.607,"Well, I think--"
2010.09-1163,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1612.607,1617.977,"So how do you square that with the words ""related solely to internal""?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1617.977,1618.394,--Right.
2010.09-1163,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1659.754,1664.458,"Well, the case summaries there were internal solely."
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1671.544,1672.394,"Well, if it was--"
2010.09-1163,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1672.394,1674.077,And yet we ordered it disclosed.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1679.464,1683.1,"--Well, I don't believe this Court created an exception to the statute."
2010.09-1163,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1706.731,1707.9,"Oh, I agree."
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1721.208,1726.695,--I think it said that that's the case where there is no countervailing interest on the other side.
2010.09-1163,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1749.876,1759.584,"Mr. Yang, the information about location I thought was disclosed, where these explosives were stored."
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1759.584,1766.153,"There is -- for instance, the appendix includes a map of buildings."
2010.09-1163,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1769.605,1771.588,But we know they are in the building.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1772.723,1773.94,Maybe not in every building.
2010.09-1163,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1788.917,1795.054,--I thought that that information was given out for the Bangor facility.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1795.054,1808.195,"--There appears to have been a release, and the record does not provide us detail as to why, before 9/11 by the Bangor facility of some arcs."
2010.09-1163,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1853.188,1859.626,"Have you compared the two situations, in Seattle and in Bangor?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1862.745,1865.63,--Our brief briefly addresses this.
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1896.05,1900.787,"Why, if these maps are so sensitive as you suggested, why weren't they classified?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1900.787,1907.941,"--Well, it's difficult to classify when you need to share in limited circumstances with local responders."
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1910.226,1911.709,"I'm sorry, I don't understand that."
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1913.511,1926.419,"--When you classify a document, it restricts access to people with a Federal need to know, people who have been adjudicated as eligible to receive classification, received the proper training."
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1947.899,1952.101,"Well, surely you classify documents that are shared outside the Federal Government?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1952.101,1956.386,"That is true in certain circumstances, but there are other--"
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1956.386,1967.211,"Would you classify these maps after -- I mean, assume that you don't prevail, could you then classify these documents, preventing their release before they are released?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1967.211,1973.115,"--Well, if the Court were to provide us with the opportunity, I think the Navy could consider that--"
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1973.115,1986.088,"Isn't it the case when a government agency has to go through its records in response to a FOIA request and comes upon records that would otherwise be disclosable, they can at that point say we are going to classify this so we don't have to disclose it."
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1986.088,1994.011,--The relevant executive order that governs classification does allow classification of materials which have been disseminated beyond the Government.
2010.09-1163,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2014.989,2017.791,There is a document on the FBI web site called
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2038.688,2045.442,--It is -- I don't mean to suggest that only Federal Government employees can have classification.
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2055.65,2057.75,It seems to me you're asking us to do your job.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2076.813,2081.115,I don't believe that we are asking the Court to torture the language of FOIA.
2010.09-1163,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2090.221,2092.404,"So can we talk about that reading, Mr. Yang?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2102.612,2104.729,It depends on context.
2010.09-1163,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2106.731,2112.15,It could be referring to Exemption 6 or it could be referring to just generally in a conversation.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2113.836,2119.138,"Well, in the context of Exemption 6 I think it refers to files pertaining to personnel."
2010.09-1163,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2119.138,2122.692,Can you think of another context in which it means something other than that?
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2122.692,2130.612,"I think the term, the phrase ""personnel file"" itself is normally referred -- normally used to refer to personnel."
2010.09-1163,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2130.612,2132.381,"It's a kind of H.R. file, right?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2132.381,2133.564,That's generally true.
2010.09-1163,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2133.564,2142.32,So why should there be any difference if you look at the term H.R. files and practices.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2142.32,2143.856,"Well, it's certainly one reading."
2010.09-1163,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.923,2174.875,"All the rules of an agency would -- would -- would be sucked in, wouldn't it?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2174.875,2175.741,"Well, no, I think--"
2010.09-1163,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2175.741,2181.695,All the rules the agency promulgates are supposed to be enforced by the personnel of the agency.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2181.695,2182.231,--I think so--
2010.09-1163,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2182.231,2184.181,So they become personnel rules and practices.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2184.181,2199.107,"--The focus on personnel in the statute helps to distinguish between rules and practices which govern personnel, and rules and practices which also are there to govern the public in its interactions with the agency."
2010.09-1163,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2240.916,2243.851,"Well, that begs, I think Justice Scalia's question."
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2264.883,2275.255,But not everything that the agency does will relate solely or exclusively to govern the internal personnel -- the rules and practices for personnel.
2010.09-1163,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2284.528,2306.876,"Well, if the -- if the agency has a rule that says put explosive A in building 1 and put explosive B in building 2, that's hard for me to explain that it's just a personnel rule, other than, as Justice Scalia says, everything, all functions have to be undertaken by humans."
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2306.876,2310.412,"--Well, I -- I don't know that I would agree with that."
2010.09-1163,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2321.303,2322.486,"Well, what about my hypothetical?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2327.29,2331.158,--Because it is a rule that pertains to personnel.
2010.09-1163,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2335.527,2342.549,"But that goes back to the point that -- I forgot about a computer age, but, forgetting that, humans have to do most things now."
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2342.549,2343.649,--That is true.
2010.09-1163,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2375.354,2382.524,"I suppose the Office of Personnel Management has a pretty broad charter, then, on your theory of what the adjective means."
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2386.795,2388.578,"--Well, I -- it certainly is."
2010.09-1163,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2397.6,2403.338,--Can we go back to the origin of the Exemption 2?
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2444.229,2448.681,"Well, there were -- I can give you a few examples from the legislative history, for instance."
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2594.539,2598.226,I would have thought that the amendment to Exemption 7 really cut the other way.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2601.844,2604.463,"--Well, they amended Exemption 7--"
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2604.463,2607.665,"To adopt more or less Crooker, right?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2607.665,2609.765,--To adopt Crooker in certain areas.
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2609.765,2610.367,Yes.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2612.317,2628.076,"No, I think what it did is it took Crooker as understood, but what it did with respect to law enforcement records -- and remember it's only records compiled for law enforcement purposes that would disclose techniques, procedures or guidelines for investigations or prosecutions."
2010.09-1163,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2717.717,2719.167,What happens -- I'm just curious.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2739.631,2740.264,--Right.
2010.09-1163,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2740.264,2743.682,But I guess in order to see it they would have to be cleared.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2743.682,2744.967,They would have -- right.
2010.09-1163,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2744.967,2756.258,"How long does it take, approximately, roughly, to clear a fireman so that he could, in fact, see the evacuation manual from the Federal building."
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2756.258,2757.924,I don't know exactly.
2010.09-1163,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2757.924,2759.543,Could you give me a rough idea?
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2759.543,2765.447,"This is going to -- I'm going to speculate a little bit on this, but -- and if I am wildly off, I will let the Court know."
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2767.847,2769.732,For what level of classification?
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2775.636,2786.091,"I think that's for the basic secret, but I would have to -- again, I don't have a precise answer for the Court, and we could provide a more fulsome answer after--"
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2786.091,2787.959,--The lower things below secret--
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2787.959,2788.476,--Right.
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2788.476,2792.895,--Are those sufficient classifications to prevent disclosure under FOIA?
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2794.447,2796.213,"Confidential, I believe."
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2796.213,2800.751,"--So if you label something confidential, you don't have to disclose it under FOIA?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2800.751,2801.534,Right.
2010.09-1163,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2813.892,2822.93,Do you think it's practical to classify all of the information that might have security implications?
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2822.93,2824.865,I think it's difficult.
2010.09-1163,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2824.865,2828.067,"Architectural designs, passwords."
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2828.067,2830.769,I don't think if we go that far it is practical.
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2858.501,2859.037,I'm sorry.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2865.69,2869.225,Not classified as confidential.
2010.09-1163,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2883.235,2887.77,Would you classify those as internal procedural rules -- personnel rules?
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2892.508,2893.508,It depends on context.
2010.09-1163,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2909.969,2911.752,What about architectural specifications?
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2911.752,2912.168,It can.
2010.09-1163,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2945.637,2957.511,"So basically anything that the agency uses to craft its internal employee practices and rules gets swept up as private, as internal?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2957.511,2958.88,"No, no, no, no."
2010.09-1163,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2958.88,2959.263,If -- if--
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2959.263,2965.301,It certainly would be personnel rules and practices of an agency to be properly deemed internal.
2010.09-1163,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2980.126,2990.166,--So you are taking out the records related to personnel and not making it a condition of the disclosure.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3002.224,3004.757,"If I gave that, and if I said so, I certainly didn't mean to give that impression."
2010.09-1163,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3006.276,3022.97,"--How do the documents that the agency reviews to determine and craft its internal rules and practices fall under the rubric of being related to, solely related to, personnel practices and rules?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3035.878,3045.901,"--I -- to bring us to, maybe, this case, to give an example, this case involves the ESQD information for Indian Island."
2010.09-1163,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3058.81,3059.677,--The map doesn't.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3062.862,3065.797,"--Well, I guess it's a question of how you convey that information."
2010.09-1163,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3074.903,3076.953,Do you see -- I'm sorry.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3082.657,3083.24,No.
2010.09-1163,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3083.24,3087.044,We formulate your test very differently than Crooker does.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3088.427,3091.163,"I think it's essentially the same, and let me tell you why."
2010.09-1163,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3117.977,3148.647,"Mr. Yang, if -- if we assume that a majority of this Court finds this statutory interpretation untenable and that you lose, but that the Court is also concerned about the government's reliance interests here, and about this set of documents that have been exempted under exemption 2 that would become unexempt, is there anything that the Court can do about that?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3156.269,3159.954,You are assuming that we lose the case entirely.
2010.09-1163,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3159.954,3160.421,"I am assuming, yes."
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3161.388,3161.956,All right.
2010.09-1163,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3178.75,3186.689,"You couldn't return to Congress if you had to classify documents falling into the category that you previously thought, dealt with in Crooker."
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3192.926,3202.799,"--There is a very large number of documents where disclosure would circumvent the very agency functions at issue, not all of which, and perhaps very many of which, would not be able to be classified."
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3202.799,3209.535,"And all of which you already have to review to compile the Vaughn index and to make sure there are not other exemptions that are applicable, right?"
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3214.234,3214.753,That's true.
2010.09-1163,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3218.955,3219.705,That wasn't my question.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3236.648,3247.604,"It would be a very large number of documents, and it would not be practical to take those case-by-case and then of those that might have some national security interest, go--"
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3247.604,3250.222,You don't have to go through everything.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3255.275,3256.242,--We do.
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3259.311,3260.846,And it takes forever to get the documents.
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3260.846,3267.0,The statute -- we are not usually complying with the statute's 20-day turnaround.
2010.09-1163,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3295.317,3297.269,Could I just nail down one particular point?
2010.09-1163,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3306.375,3321.217,"Correct, because not all the documents here, even if there was time to review them, would fall within -- excuse me, not in this case, but within the matter of exemption 2 -- would not be able to be -- exemption 2 addresses a special problem."
2010.09-1163,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3347.699,3350.201,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1163,2,21207,david_s_mann,,3353.253,3370.881,"The two points I would like to focus again on, coming back to, is the word ""personnel matters""."
