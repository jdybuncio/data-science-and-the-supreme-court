1983.82-660,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.56,We'll hear arguments first this morning in United States against Cronic.
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,9.56,16.916,Thank you.
1983.82-660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,108.3,146.691,"Mr. Kneedler, I'm troubled in this case by the fact that there are two different types of ineffective assistance of counsel claims: one where the state itself impairs the effective assistance of counsel, either by not appointing counsel at all or by taking some action that would impair the right; a second time is, assuming there's no interference by the court or the state as such with counsel, counsel simply fails to meet whatever standard it is that the court might adopt."
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,151.642,160.592,"--Well, the principal basis of the claim and the one that the Court of Appeals decided was of the first type that you mentioned."
1983.82-660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.242,178.976,"So that it was an impairment by the state itself, in effect, of--"
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,178.976,180.083,That's correct.
1983.82-660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.083,181.037,--the right to counsel.
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,192.265,193.437,That was the principal claim.
1983.82-660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.118,217.069,"In your view, did the Court of Appeals resolve only the first type of claim?"
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,217.069,225.941,"The Court of Appeals plainly resolved only the first, because the Court noted the Government's objection that in fact Respondent had not identified any specific failings by counsel."
1983.82-660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,225.941,227.3,Is the other issue here?
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,227.3,249.135,"I believe it's not here in its entirety, largely because most of the specific failings of trial counsel that Respondent points to were never identified in the Court of Appeals, even though there was a claim that counsel in fact had performed inadequately."
1983.82-660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.367,259.005,"Well, if we dealt only with the part type, do we have to remand as to the second type?"
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,259.005,271.704,"No, as to the second type it's our position that the appropriate procedure would be for Respondent to raise any claims about specific defects in counsel's performance in a motion under 2255, because this was--"
1983.82-660,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,271.704,274.812,That's on the assumption that we reversed.
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,274.812,275.437,--Yes.
1983.82-660,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,278.577,280.341,"That was the assumption, yes."
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,280.341,302.317,"That allegations of specific defects be raised under 2255, largely because they are often thought, and usually do, arise from things outside the record, so it would often be necessary to make a record, and in any event to have the trial court in the first instance to take an assessment of the impact of any errors by counsel."
1983.82-660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,302.317,311.578,"I don't see how he could do that, Mr. Kneedler, unless we're to adopt a flat rule that assistance of counsel claims can't be raised on direct appeal."
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,311.578,326.352,"Well, if the claim can be raised on direct appeal and resolved on the basis of the record created, then there would be an appropriate occasion to dispose of the case in that instance."
1983.82-660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,334.256,349.47,"But in this particular case, supposing that the Respondent argued in the Court of Appeals specific failings and the Court of Appeals just felt they didn't have to get to that because of the shortness of time which counsel had and his lack of experience."
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,363.463,373.147,"Well, if there were specific errors that the Court of Appeals could dispose of by assessing the record, then that would be appropriate."
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,416.364,423.315,"I thought the major objection of Respondent was not the actions of the lawyer, but the non-actions."
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,423.315,426.017,"--Well, in either event they--"
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,426.017,429.266,"I mean, you said that he had to show that he did some wrong."
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,430.03,440.245,"--Well, if the error is one of omission the record may provide a basis for disposing of that and it may not."
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,446.929,451.334,"But the burden is not on the lawyer, is it?"
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,451.334,456.239,The burden on the defense counsel?
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,456.239,456.769,Yes.
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,456.769,459.956,"Yes, we submit that the burden--"
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,459.956,465.578,The burden is on him to show that he is inefficient?
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,465.578,465.906,"--Oh, no."
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,478.51,490.818,"Well, he starts off with one that he always asserts, which is that he was convicted; ergo, counsel must have been ineffective."
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,490.818,492.52,"Well, we are concerned that--"
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,492.52,494.066,"You don't need that, do you?"
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,494.066,494.8,--No.
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,516.464,519.244,"But there is one exception, the Powell case."
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,519.244,519.651,"The Powell case, that's correct."
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,519.651,521.229,That's an exception?
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,521.229,527.818,"That's correct, and this comes back to Justice O'Connor's position."
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,566.646,569.24,There was one other one: They appointed the whole bar.
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,569.24,571.082,"That's right, initially."
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,571.082,572.535,They didn't make an appointment.
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,572.535,576.674,"And then when counsel finally did assume responsibility, it was too late and he had no opportunity."
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,594.525,597.962,But it was in a small town.
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,597.962,599.164,It was.
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,599.164,604.272,"And it was limited to a small town, the Avery case."
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,604.272,613.566,"The Court did take into account the need for conducting the trial promptly, but that is an interest that exists today."
1983.82-660,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,677.383,683.567,"Does that mean, Mr. Kneedler, we're down to the difference between 30 and the 25 days?"
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,683.567,689.752,"As I understand Respondent's complaint, that's essentially what the case boils down to."
1983.82-660,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,718.194,722.473,Does the record show how long Mr. Colston had been admitted to the bar?
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,722.473,724.129,The record does not show.
1983.82-660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,733.032,744.044,Did the Defendant argue that his experience as a real estate lawyer fell below any required standing?
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,746.37,750.321,That he knew that he was not a competent real estate lawyer?
1983.82-660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,750.321,752.46,"Well, no, that he was not a criminal lawyer."
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,752.46,753.023,Because he was a real estate lawyer--
1983.82-660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,753.023,753.867,He was a real estate lawyer.
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,753.867,754.101,--Yes.
1983.82-660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,754.101,758.584,And that somehow fell below a constitutional standard?
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,758.584,774.266,"He did argue that, because his lawyer did not have prior experience in criminal cases, that that was a factor to be considered under what the Tenth Circuit in this case devised to be a five-part balancing test in which experience is one."
1983.82-660,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,800.395,806.705,"On the day when the case was called for trial, did he ask for more time, defense counsel ask for more time?"
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,806.705,817.451,"No, he did not, and when the trial court made the inquiry as to whether counsel was prepared to proceed defense counsel pronounced themselves ready."
1983.82-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,957.924,968.67,"Mr. Kneedler, what do you say about his argument that the best defense was the absence of criminal intent, and that the lawyer didn't raise that defense?"
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,968.67,986.553,"Well, with all respect, Justice Stevens, I believe that defense would be quite far-fetched in these circumstances, largely because of... or in part because of the overwhelming nature of the Government's case."
1983.82-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.872,1054.823,"Well, it would be repaid, would it not, if the two directors who signed the note made good on the note?"
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1054.823,1061.726,"Well, that's true, although unless they in turn recovered somebody was defrauded, unless the assets--"
1983.82-660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1061.726,1062.959,"Well, we don't know."
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1062.959,1064.631,--We don't know.
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1077.766,1087.34,"In your experience, do you know of many real estate lawyers that have experience in federal courts?"
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1087.34,1094.572,"Speaking from personal experience, I simply couldn't say."
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1094.572,1097.899,"Well, doesn't real estate law involve state law?"
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1097.899,1103.334,"That's correct, although a real estate lawyer could have litigation experience."
1983.82-660,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1107.238,1110.597,Did he know anything about the Jencks Act?
1983.82-660,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1110.597,1118.578,The record simply doesn't show what Colston knew or what he didn't know.
1983.82-660,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1725.456,1725.784,Very well.
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,1732.641,1735.625,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.82-660,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1822.262,1826.838,Do you mean by that that 25 days was not enough time to prepare for trial?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,1826.838,1832.21,--25 days under the circumstances of this case was manifestly not enough.
1983.82-660,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1832.21,1834.101,But 30 were?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,1834.101,1835.474,30 were?
1983.82-660,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1837.332,1838.426,He didn't ask for any more.
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,1838.426,1847.626,"At the time Mr. Colston asked for a minimum of 30, he knew nothing, virtually nothing about the case."
1983.82-660,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1866.15,1877.176,"Well then, 25 days later, however, he... we must presume he knew something more about the case, and he didn't ask for more time."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,1877.176,1881.268,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, he did not ask for more time."
1983.82-660,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1881.268,1884.392,It must be your position that that's incompetent also.
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,1884.392,1899.277,"Yes, I think... well, either that or that he was not incompetent in concluding that the judge had made a final ruling and that he was not going to reconsider."
1983.82-660,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1935.278,1941.072,"Do you think that does not happen regularly in the courtrooms, trial courtrooms, Mr. Duke?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,1941.072,1942.713,--I think it is--
1983.82-660,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1942.713,1949.46,And that frequently continuances are granted under precisely those circumstances?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,1949.46,1966.86,--I don't think it's common where a firm date has been set and it is in a district or in a courthouse where dates mean something and a jury pool is gathered for that case.
1983.82-660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2033.051,2039.329,"Mr. Duke, I guess there was a second experienced criminal lawyer also appointed to assist, was there not?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2039.329,2044.03,"--Justice O'Connor, that is partially correct."
1983.82-660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2061.696,2066.897,But he was an experienced criminal lawyer who remained available?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2066.897,2076.642,"I have no reason to dispute what is in his affidavit, that he had substantial criminal experience."
1983.82-660,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2088.575,2095.713,"Mr. Duke, is there anything in the record that shows how much federal experience Colston had?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2102.601,2122.702,"The only thing in the record is the Respondent's statement on June 19th to the court saying: Your Honor, I've just been informed by Mr. Colston that this is his second experience in a federal case."
1983.82-660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2146.146,2150.159,"Well, Mr. Duke, every lawyer is going to have his first trial."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2160.53,2161.904,"--No, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2207.464,2211.041,"You were in Arizona in the late fifties, weren't you?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2211.041,2211.682,Yes.
1983.82-660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2211.682,2214.227,Do you remember the practice of the district courts there?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2240.826,2253.867,"I think that we do not contend that it is unconstitutional to appoint inexperienced lawyers, even in felony cases."
1983.82-660,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2313.171,2318.887,"Do you know of any law schools, Mr. Duke, that do not teach criminal law?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2318.887,2320.512,--No.
1983.82-660,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2320.512,2322.777,Of the 180 law schools in the country?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2322.777,2327.29,"I think most of them, probably all of them, are required to teach it."
1983.82-660,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2332.867,2337.818,Are you saying that criminal law is not a required course in law schools today?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2337.818,2345.048,"In some law schools it is not a required course, not in my law school."
1983.82-660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2351.265,2364.01,"Well, Mr. Duke, is it your position that the Defendant has a constitutional right to an attorney with more experience than Mr. Colston had?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2364.01,2366.399,Not a defendant.
1983.82-660,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2429.389,2451.817,"Are you suggesting by that by analogy that this Court's holding in Faretta has created an inherently unfair situation, where the Defendant may waive the lawyer and try the case himself, even though he has never seen a courthouse?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2451.817,2463.438,"Well, I do think I rather preferred the dissent in that case, but the distinguishing factor about Faretta is free choice."
1983.82-660,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2463.438,2465.828,"Flattery will get you nowhere, Mr. Duke."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2471.138,2473.528,There was no free choice in this case.
1983.82-660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2499.079,2503.594,"Mr. Duke, you said you want to focus on what the trial judge did wrong, was what you said."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2505.28,2505.921,Yes.
1983.82-660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2505.921,2520.697,"Well, if there are a number of things that the trial judge did wrong, why wouldn't that be reversed by the Court of Appeals without getting to the in effective assistance of counsel issue, just on the grounds of errors of the trial judge?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2520.697,2526.788,"Well, I think that is the fair reading of this opinion, is that this was judicial error."
1983.82-660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2531.722,2539.391,"Well, you agree that that was the basis on which it was litigated below and that that was the Court of Appeals' holding, do you not?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2553.683,2560.087,"On my first point, point one of my brief, yes."
1983.82-660,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2620.358,2625.919,"You do have to end up finding that counsel was ineffective, don't you?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2625.919,2630.682,Ineffective in the Powell against Alabama sense.
1983.82-660,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2630.682,2643.506,"Well, let's assume that a lawyer had had only three or four days time to prepare a case, and that the record were reviewed by experienced counsel who said he conducted the trial flawlessly."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2658.172,2694.468,"The wisdom of the approach of the court below is the Holloway against Arkansas wisdom, that where a defense is substantially impaired, as in your example appointing an inexperienced attorney in a complex case and giving him four days, it doesn't answer the question of ineffective assistance to look at the trial record and conclude, boy, he really looked good, he knew how to ask questions and he knew how to object to questions."
1983.82-660,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2696.375,2698.842,So we really try the judge first?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2698.842,2722.489,"Where the judge has created, as in this case over numerous objections, the impairments, then the question before the court is: Did these impairments unfairly undermine the defense's opportunity to prepare and present the defense?"
1983.82-660,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2722.489,2725.113,Even though the record shows he tried the case flawlessly?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2725.113,2728.892,The record cannot show that he tried the case flawlessly.
1983.82-660,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2728.892,2730.813,You mean if he loses there's a per se rule?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2730.813,2731.078,No.
1983.82-660,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2845.064,2850.826,"Mr. Duke, one of my problems is what you just mentioned, going over the record."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2862.994,2864.775,I couldn't have done such a stupid thing?
1983.82-660,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2864.775,2866.649,"Yes, haven't you said that?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2866.649,2867.009,Yes.
1983.82-660,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2867.009,2868.351,We all have.
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2868.351,2869.008,Yes.
1983.82-660,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2869.008,2871.693,So is that ineffective assistance of counsel?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2871.693,2876.333,A mistake is not ineffective assistance of counsel.
1983.82-660,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2876.333,2877.083,I see.
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2877.083,2880.362,But this case... first of all.
1983.82-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2880.362,2885.174,Let me ask another question similar to the same sort of problem that Justice Marshall identified.
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2919.268,2922.064,You ask the lawyer why?
1983.82-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2922.064,2922.454,Yes.
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2926.407,2930.046,"Well, he can if his client is attacking his competence."
1983.82-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2932.653,2933.558,Is it gone?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2933.558,2933.965,Yes.
1983.82-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2933.965,2935.184,I see.
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2935.184,2939.683,"And he can say, I didn't do it because he said I'm guilty."
1983.82-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2955.659,2961.798,"No, but it may give you some idea of what is, you know, a useful way to allocate your time."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2961.798,2963.625,It certainly will do that.
1983.82-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2963.625,2966.468,You normally don't have 25 full days to prepare for any trial.
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2966.468,2967.421,That's true.
1983.82-660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2967.421,2977.355,"What your client tells you can have a crucial role to play, could it not, in your duty to investigate and the extent of it?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2977.355,2979.324,"Yes, it certainly could."
1983.82-660,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2979.324,2982.51,In what way?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,2994.879,2995.738,"Well, no."
1983.82-660,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3002.844,3003.313,Yes.
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3003.313,3011.717,"I would think a lawyer could say, I'm not going to bother with those witnesses unless--"
1983.82-660,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3011.717,3018.261,"Why couldn't he dispense with any witness then, because the fellow says, I'm guilty?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3019.729,3021.087,--Well--
1983.82-660,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3021.087,3037.284,"They can only testify, they'd only testify, maybe not as clearly as in your alibi case, but nevertheless they will be attempting to establish a non-fact."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3037.284,3041.641,"--Well, if it's a case of identity, perhaps."
1983.82-660,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3055.886,3057.604,And they also may be crazy.
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3057.604,3058.386,Yes.
1983.82-660,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3058.386,3077.157,"But in a complicated scheme such as is involved in a massive check-kiting case, ignorance of the consequences would hardly be something suggested by the Defendant here, do you think?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3085.015,3087.795,"It did indeed, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-660,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3196.767,3199.797,"Well, were there some guilty pleas here?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3199.797,3206.795,"There was one guilty plea, yes, and one dismissal, a guilty plea following probation."
1983.82-660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3206.795,3211.667,What specific intent do you think the statute requires?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3211.667,3221.554,"An intent at least to deceive in a material way, at least that much."
1983.82-660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3285.372,3288.448,"Mr. Duke, you say that the banks must have been aware of this."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3303.63,3308.035,"Well, that may very well be, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3348.706,3358.281,"Mr. Duke, isn't it also true that the amount of this flow of checks was also grossly larger than the actual cash flow of the man's business?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3358.281,3359.233,That is true.
1983.82-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3359.233,3366.277,"So that it's kind of hard to treat it as an ordinary float, like you characterize the corporations."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3366.277,3382.722,"Well, it is true that it's different in that obviously more checks were deposited than would normally be deposited in a typical business."
1983.82-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3382.722,3385.503,"But I mean, grossly so."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3389.423,3410.713,"There were a total of $5 million, approximately, deposited over a period of five or six months, and the revenues of the business were estimated to be... one witness said $30,000 a month, another said $150,000 a year."
1983.82-660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3420.567,3423.394,"Those are kind of tough facts to work with, I think."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3423.394,3430.625,"Well, but it seems to me Respondent's explanation is quite credible."
1983.82-660,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3510.921,3517.777,"Maybe that would impress a lay jury, however, even if it didn't appeal to a lawyer."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3517.777,3523.042,"Well, possibly, possibly."
1983.82-660,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3556.698,3560.714,Or by his experienced colleague?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3560.714,3564.618,Or by his experienced colleague.
1983.82-660,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3573.833,3575.599,Was this argument made to the Court of Appeals?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3575.599,3577.301,--Which?
1983.82-660,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3577.301,3579.286,This very argument you just made.
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3579.286,3580.393,About the remand?
1983.82-660,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3580.393,3583.283,"No, about the adequate defense."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3583.283,3585.671,Inadequate defense--
1983.82-660,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3585.671,3590.343,"Yes, that there was a perfectly sound defense available that was ignored."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3590.343,3594.138,"--If it was made, it was made mushily."
1983.82-660,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3599.073,3601.197,"Obviously, then, it wasn't you who argued the case?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3601.197,3603.275,"--That's correct, that's correct."
1983.82-660,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3615.426,3617.629,He was pro se in the Court of Appeals?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3617.629,3624.329,--He had court-appointed counsel and he also had leave to file his own brief pro se.
1983.82-660,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3624.329,3633.153,Are you the first lawyer in this entire case who's discovered that there was a perfectly adequate defense available that was ignored?
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3633.153,3639.166,I can't say.
1983.82-660,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3647.492,3652.99,"Any lawyer who didn't recognize it would have been incompetent, in your view?"
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3652.99,3653.973,--Yes.
1983.82-660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3663.985,3673.325,"Well, of course, the lawyer trying a case doesn't have the benefit of a nice record unfolding that you can look over afterwards and say, well, gee, that was here all the time."
1983.82-660,1,41243,steven_b_duke,,3689.052,3691.614,"Well, that is correct."
1983.82-660,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3749.857,3752.026,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Kneedler?"
1983.82-660,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3752.026,3755.494,"Yes, several points, Mr. Chief Justice, thank you."
1983.82-660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3856.408,3873.307,"Of course, that submission is... it seems to me really goes to counsel's actual performance, rather than to this Powell-type invalidation of this trial or setting aside of this conviction."
1983.82-660,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3873.307,3878.133,"Well, I think that's right, but I understood Mr. Duke to be mixing the two of them."
1983.82-660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3878.898,3879.898,"Oh, I know he is, I know he is."
1983.82-660,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3879.898,3882.663,--I did not understand the Court of Appeals to mix the two of them.
1983.82-660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3882.663,3883.6,"No, they didn't, I agree."
1983.82-660,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3892.862,3894.627,Yes.
1983.82-660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3894.627,3899.125,"And I suppose because it is, that's why you're saying there wasn't a showing of prejudice."
1983.82-660,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3899.125,3903.123,With respect to the performance standard--
1983.82-660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3903.123,3903.404,Yes.
1983.82-660,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3903.404,3903.795,--that's right.
1983.82-660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3923.583,3931.221,"Well, you wouldn't say that if the Defendant asked for a lawyer and the judge said, sorry, you don't get one, there's just nothing a lawyer could do for you."
1983.82-660,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3998.037,4000.755,Yes.
1983.82-660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4000.755,4007.191,And tried out the question of counsel's actual performance?
1983.82-660,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,4007.191,4007.613,Yes.
1983.82-660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4007.613,4012.656,"Would it have done any good, for example, to interview all of these witnesses and so on?"
1983.82-660,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,4012.656,4016.359,"Well, that would be the purpose--"
1983.82-660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4016.359,4016.983,Could it still go there?
1983.82-660,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,4016.983,4023.902,"--Yes, we'd say it could still go there for Defendant to make his showing that there was some effect."
1983.82-660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4023.902,4033.54,"Well, unless there were something decided here, because under the habeas statute the habeas court can't review anything that's been decided on the merits here."
1983.82-660,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,4033.54,4034.227,That's correct.
1983.82-660,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4034.227,4037.194,"Thank you, gentlemen."
