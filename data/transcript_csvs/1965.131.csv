1965.131,0,42191,stuart_n_updike,,23.354,28.198,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.131,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,43.711,46.922,"You may proceed in your own manner, Mr. Updike."
1965.131,0,42191,stuart_n_updike,,46.922,49.075,Thank you sir.
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,3922.591,3924.678,May it please Your Honors.
1965.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3997.366,3999.23,What would the remedy be?
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,3999.23,4019.63,The remedy would be to -- it would be an action against them for fraudulently if it was fraud or banally or subserviently permitting the expiration of the right to apply to this Court for a writ of certiorari to expire.
1965.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4019.63,4023.845,How could anybody measure the amount of damages?
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4023.845,4035.75,"Well, I -- one of the things I would like to know is how the -- the measure of damages is going to be measured in the underlying case because if you can measure it in the underlying case, you can measure in the action against these directors."
1965.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4037.932,4038.356,"Well, no."
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4050.433,4051.517,"Well, what I --"
1965.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4051.517,4052.456,-- merit of the case.
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4052.456,4070.946,"What I mean to say is that if as a result of the -- their action, a right was lost and it was transparently clear that this Court would reverse and it was equally transparently clear thereafter that they were liable in damages."
1965.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4197.821,4198.152,Mr. Hughes.
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4198.152,4199.859,Of course the --
1965.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4199.859,4203.769,Did the Board of Directors act on the petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeals?
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4203.769,4204.704,"Yes, they did."
1965.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4204.704,4205.799,They authorized that.
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4205.799,4206.282,They did.
1965.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4206.282,4207.365,The same people?
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4207.365,4208.805,The same people.
1965.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4213.811,4222.054,What if the -- did the board articulate any change of conditions which prompted the -- not seeking cert or --?
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4222.054,4225.791,"Well, yes, I will come to that --"
1965.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4225.791,4225.884,"Well, (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4225.884,4227.139,I'll come to it now -- if you'd like me to.
1965.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4227.139,4228.213,"Well, go ahead."
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4229.113,4238.54,The -- I do want to stress that this -- that the Board was an independent board and it's conceded that it was an independent board.
1965.131,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4319.219,4320.11,Page 79 of what?
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4320.11,4325.383,"Page 79 of Volume 1 of the record before you, Mr. Justice Black."
1965.131,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4325.383,4328.583,"How many shares, what percentage of shares does Mr. Kirby had?"
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4328.583,4335.903,Mr. Kirby had approximately 40%.I think subject to correction but it was not an absolute control.
1965.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4396.493,4401.633,"Well, they could be independent and all the words you applied to them still be quite wrong, couldn't they?"
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4401.633,4403.226,"Of cou -- oh, of course."
1965.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4414.721,4419.811,You mean that's suppose -- that's going to measure a question of inter -- of the right to intervene?
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4419.811,4420.703,No.
1965.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4426.373,4427.938,That's on the merits.
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4427.938,4428.911,No.
1965.131,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4513.885,4514.728,"Well, you can share your time."
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4514.728,4517.103,"Well, I just -- just let me finish my thought."
1965.131,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4517.103,4518.42,You can share your time any way --
1965.131,1,36031,mark_f_hughes,,4518.42,4518.609,Now --
1965.131,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4518.609,4520.151,-- you want with your co-counsel.
1965.131,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4610.842,4612.5,Mr. Mansfield.
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,4612.5,4616.185,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.131,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4773.189,4783.08,"Well, Mr. Mansfield, I take it then on this point, it wouldn't make any difference what standard the court -- either the District Court or the Court of Appeals was applying."
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,4788.104,4805.974,"Mr. Justice White, that is our view that even if you apply, the might have or the would have standards, the documents when you set them down opposite what was before the Zenn Referee showed that they add nothing of any significance --"
1965.131,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4805.974,4806.324,"Well, what if the court --"
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,4806.324,4807.826,-- to the facts before him.
1965.131,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4807.826,4810.345,What if the court disagreed with you on that?
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,4825.905,4852.465,"Our view Mr. Justice White is that it's the state law that should be applied since we are dealing here with what amounts to a standard of proof in a state court proceeding, that is the Zenn proceeding and therefore one should abide by the state law because of course, it could have a very substantial effect on the outcome of the litigation."
1965.131,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4852.465,4855.944,You don't think this was a 14 (a) suit originally at all?
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,4855.944,4885.986,I submit Justice White that that was not a 14 (a) proceeding for the reason that it was adjudicated by the state court itself not once but repeatedly to be a cause of action rooted in common law in which the allegations with respect to Section 14 (a) were incidental or as I think was set by the Referee and then affirmed by the New York Supreme Court and expresses.
1965.131,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4885.986,4890.543,Have you -- you're answering here on the basis that is res judicata in that respect (Voice Overlap).
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,4890.543,4891.734,That's right Your Honor.
1965.131,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4891.734,4901.363,"Now what -- what if the Court -- what if -- as an original matter, was that a 14 (a) suit or not?"
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,4901.363,4907.905,"As an original matter, it was in our opinion a common law cause of action in the state court."
1965.131,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4948.984,4961.026,"Well, of course if by some standard or rather there was fraud and then the case ought to be set aside, it would be set aside on that point too, I suppose."
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,4961.026,4977.223,"Your Honor, Mr. Justice White, I believe that there are other bases besides the -- that or other hurdles which must be jumped before one would set aside this appeal and I was coming to them if I may."
1965.131,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4977.223,4979.938,You go right ahead.
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,4979.938,4982.184,I'm afraid I didn't hear you sir.
1965.131,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4982.184,4983.533,I -- you go right ahead.
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,4983.533,5016.962,"Well, the third fact of significance to us and I think perhaps follows just what Justice White was pursuing is that except for the so-called corrupt bargain claim below in this action, dismissal of which after trial was never appealed, the sole issue alleged presented under Rule 16 and tried before the District Court was whether or not Kirby had defrauded the Zenn Referee, not Young, not Purcell but solely Kirby."
1965.131,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6416.845,6418.363,"Excuse me, Mr. Mansfield."
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6418.363,6418.564,"Yes, Justice Brennan."
1965.131,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6418.564,6432.799,"It seems to me that you're arguing this, as if you are arguing before the Court of Appeals, the merits (Inaudible), is that your idea of what -- the way we have to look at this case on the merits?"
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6432.799,6453.875,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I submit that it is for the reason that one never gets to the questions that are presented here on this record because they are presented on the theory that Young -- that the evidence showed fraud on the part of Young and Purcell and that Young -- and that Kirby could be held responsible for that."
1965.131,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6460.659,6462.749,"But you won in the Court of Appeals, didn't you?"
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6462.749,6464.041,"Yes, we did, Your Honor."
1965.131,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6464.041,6465.298,Well that's what I was wondering.
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6465.298,6466.296,But what we are saying is --
1965.131,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6466.296,6469.214,What are we supposed to do with that finding?
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6469.214,6469.813,I didn't hear --
1965.131,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6469.813,6475.44,What's the limit of our review of what -- determination of the Court of Appeals
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6475.44,6492.158,Our view if Your Honor pleases is that the writ here was improvidently granted because the sole question that could've been presented on the record that was before the Court was the question of whether the evidence was -- or the findings were clearly erroneous and what I am trying to --
1965.131,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6492.158,6495.976,What's the consequence of the 4 to 4 division on --
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6495.976,6507.543,I think Mr. Justice Brennan that the three judges who joined Judge Friendly were likewise unaware of record proof before the Zenn Referee showing that their inferences were unjustified.
1965.131,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6507.543,6513.014,"Well, of course what I'm getting at -- of course, I'm not anxious to do it, do I have to go all through this thing in order to (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6513.014,6529.282,"Oh, we submit Your Honor that one does not have to go very far through it because on the first point raised that the issues, pleadings and everything else would direct it solely to fraud on the part of the -- the claim of fraud on the part of Kirby, that that ends the case."
1965.131,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6543.648,6550.007,"Have you had any idea, what's the status of the panel decision in light of 4-4 division en banc?"
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6550.007,6550.609,What is the status --
1965.131,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6550.609,6556.35,What is the status of the panel decision in light of the 4-4 division en banc?
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6556.35,6567.732,"Well, of course, we cannot -- it's difficult to speculate Mr. Justice Brennan as to just what the intracourt views of all eight members were."
1965.131,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6577.266,6587.272,"Well the -- it would be very easy here to say that, “Oh well, the Court of Appeals reviewed this record and decided that these documents wouldn't have made any difference anyway."
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6618.519,6619.129,Mr. Justice --
1965.131,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6619.129,6620.247,-- we do have a lot of reading --
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6620.247,6648.788,"Well, Justice White, I think that -- I think if I may be so full that the writ was granted (Inaudible) improvidently for the reason that the questions here which are -- whether there should be a duty of disclosure in a Section 14 (a) action comparable of what would've been required in disclosure to stockholders in a proxy statement are not presented by this record."
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6684.132,6700.276,"What about Judge Friendly's statement, the evidence was improperly excluded and that therefore he wants -- what he wants to do is to send it back and let them consider the case, the issue you talked about on the basis of the evidence that was improperly excluded?"
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6700.276,6707.664,"Well, I -- but the majority opinion did consider it Justice Black and concluded that it was cumulative."
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6736.835,6740.617,But they seem to have disagreed 4 to 4 on the facts.
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6740.617,6749.394,"That they did and I think they disagreed on the facts because Justice Black, they were unaware of certain things in the Zenn record."
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6759.221,6762.063,"If it's all that's the case, why isn't it reasonable?"
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6780.904,6784.346,"Judge Black -- Justice Black, this case begun in 1960."
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6784.587,6788.699,"I understand the delay, it's a good argument, but is that the only argument?"
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6788.699,6803.579,"Well, the other argument it seems to me is that if we were to allege -- if you were to allege wrongdoing on the part of Young and Purcell, we of course would have possibly considered pleading over against them in the action."
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6828.058,6845.797,"Well, if you consider the delay, wouldn't it be far more delaying to dismiss this on the theory that they can file a new suit and start over from the very beginning and offer a great deal of this evidence that's here and other evidence that you could offer more."
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6849.137,6850.545,"Well, we --"
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6850.545,6851.774,And I also having doubts (Voice Overlap) --
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6851.774,6852.45,(Inaudible)
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6852.45,6859.353,-- also wondering about how they could ever prove damages because you couldn't predict what the Courts would do on the new hearing.
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6859.353,6892.721,"Well, our position on that Justice Black would be that this is the kind of a case that should not in any event be brought in the federal court because what it seeks to do is to set aside a fraud, a state court settlement which the state court referee and that court reviewed the evidence at great length and the availability of a clear and open remedy in the state court in which all the parties would be before the state court as valid basis for dismissing this appeal."
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6920.165,6921.641,Could they not have them here?
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6921.641,6922.422,"No, Your Honor."
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6924.822,6925.711,Who do they not have?
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6925.711,6929.123,"They seek -- they do not have Young, they do not have Purcell."
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6945.892,6952.594,But they could -- other parties could be added if the issue had been denied then they could file a new suit because (Voice Overlap) --
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6952.594,6953.977,I don't know whether they could've explained --
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6953.977,6956.682,Following the pages of evidence again.
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6956.682,6963.361,"But Your Honor, at that instant, the state court has is this, it had all the evidence before it."
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6973.029,6973.541,"Well, are you -- are you saying (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6973.541,6974.093,-- the rule in New York --
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6974.093,6976.763,-- the federal court doesn't have jurisdiction?
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,6976.763,7011.359,"What I am saying Your Honor is that a collateral attack of this sort should be dismissed on the ground that the best remedy and the utmost -- most equitable and adequate remedy is on the state court and that this is the kind of a case which should be pursued as it would under state law before the very judge, the state court rules provided that it's reassigned to the very judge who had before him and that he's in a much better position to decide whether he was defrauded after having lived with the evidence in the case, then a new judge to whom it's exposed for the first time and I might also --"
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7011.359,7017.597,"You mean, apart of these thousands and thousands of pages of evidence have to be reintroduced in a state court suit?"
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,7017.597,7033.203,"I don't think they would because, if Your Honor pleases, the state court, the Zenn Referee had before him 480 exhibits and that's already in the state court filed before the judge who is still serving and the Referee, they're both in service."
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7059.83,7067.323,In your judgment does this -- would the federal court have jurisdiction of this suit?Does it have it?
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,7067.323,7070.234,In my judgment Your Honor on the proof that is now --
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7070.234,7074.302,I'm not talking about where -- what -- I'm not talking about whether it should be exercised.
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,7075.479,7101.837,I think that the federal court has jurisdiction to collateral -- to entertain a collateral attack upon a state court judgment for -- in New York for what is called extrinsic fraud and that the proof in this record shows that the fraud was not of the type which under New York state law would permit collateral attack and therefore it would be dismissed on the record for lack of jurisdiction.
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7101.837,7107.195,"Well, then you think it could not -- the suits should not be filed?"
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,7107.195,7108.087,On the proof?
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7384.072,7385.305,May I ask you just one question?
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,7385.305,7386.181,Yes Justice Black.
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7386.181,7391.012,You said there's no proof of fraud on the part of Purcell and Young.
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,7398.8,7418.886,"In -- on the basis of this record, Your Honor, first of all, the issue was never raised below and we say that it would be unfair now to charge us on the basis of evidence that did not relate to an issue to set aside the judgment below."
1965.131,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7445.067,7450.573,"It didn't amount as to practically to say there's no jurisdiction, doesn't it, in the federal courts?"
1965.131,2,45701,walter_r_mansfield,,7450.573,7460.027,"There is no jurisdiction for collateral attack on the basis of the kind of evidence that has since been brought out in this case, Justice Black."
