1969.64,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,58.858,"Number 64, Mills and others against the Electric Auto-Lite Company."
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,58.858,62.454,Mr. Chief Justice --
1969.64,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,62.454,63.72,Mr. Shure?
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,63.72,68.034,-- and may it please the Court.
1969.64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,881.439,885.243,I perhaps have missed the point in this case.
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,890.411,891.007,The complaint --
1969.64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,891.007,892.206,Am I mistaken about that?
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,892.206,897.171,That is not pending before the Court Your Honor at this time.
1969.64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,904.323,905.863,Yeah.
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,905.863,919.728,"The attack that the trial here, the manner -- the resolution of the case below that brought the case here did not involve the question of fairness at all."
1969.64,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,929.227,930.229,That's what I thought and --
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,930.229,930.799,That's right.
1969.64,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1037.838,1050.674,Do you think it's irrelevant whether or not these misrepresentations or these omissions affected any votes?
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1050.674,1060.708,I believe that it is irrelevant because Congress in passing its statute did not inject any element of reliance.
1969.64,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1089.375,1090.935,Do you rely on Borak?
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1090.935,1092.057,I certainly do.
1969.64,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1092.057,1096.265,"Well, didn't Borak say cause or connection will be tried out in the District Court?"
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1096.265,1100.8,Borak does not say that that cause or relationship must be tried.
1969.64,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1105.616,1106.27,Yeah.
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1106.27,1113.855,"In Borak, the case came to this Court on the pleadings and it was not after a resolution."
1969.64,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.883,1116.358,And what did Borak say?
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1116.358,1122.437,Borak said that cause or relationship is a matter for the trial court.
1969.64,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1160.246,1161.118,You speak of remedy.
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1163.032,1167.509,"As far as remedy is concerned, the --"
1969.64,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.509,1169.337,But do you want damages?
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1169.337,1170.981,We have the alternative.
1969.64,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1188.859,1192.207,Do you want your old pieces of paper?
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1192.207,1192.702,No --
1969.64,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.702,1194.474,Rather than the money that you can get out of your new -- that one?
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1194.474,1196.753,"No Your Honor, I don't want the old pieces of paper."
1969.64,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.233,1289.263,Well don't you get right to the fairness of the merger then?
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1289.263,1290.982,No.That has nothing to do with fairness Your Honor because --
1969.64,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1290.982,1299.908,"Well, I would say it would if your stock is worth more than now than it would've been if the merger hadn't taken place, what about your restitutionary --"
1969.64,0,16984,arnold_i_shure,,1299.908,1302.739,No one can speculate what the stock would be worth.
1969.64,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1445.752,1451.842,You have about seven minutes -- about seven minutes remaining.
1969.64,1,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,1454.158,1459.864,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1969.64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2005.216,2008.695,That is one to one?
1969.64,1,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,2008.695,2015.151,1.88 of the shares of the surviving of the surviving corporation for each share of electro Auto-Lite.
1969.64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.617,2030.917,"So for every dollar that a man in stocks would worth at Electric Auto-Lite, what's that dollar worth?"
1969.64,1,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,2030.917,2035.166,"As I guess with today's market, $2.00."
1969.64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2160.939,2165.927,"Mr. Jenner, haven't both Courts have found the material omission here or --"
1969.64,1,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,2165.927,2167.613,Would you forgive Your Honor and repeat that?
1969.64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.613,2172.745,Haven't both Courts have found the material omission here?
1969.64,1,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,2174.839,2175.498,No.
1969.64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2175.498,2177.448,Is that a question of fact or what?
1969.64,1,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,2177.448,2196.279,We think it's a question of fact and we believe because the Trial Court followed so called summary judgment procedure that we have never received a full trial on the issue or whether this difference and emphasis was in fact a material omission.
1969.64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2196.279,2197.585,Well that question isn't here.
1969.64,1,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,2198.862,2203.746,"No, we didn't cross petition if Your Honor please and we do think it's here."
1969.64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2215.994,2223.081,Arguments are usually limited to questions raised in the cert petition aren't they Mr. Jenner?
1969.64,1,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,2223.081,2225.101,Well yes they are and they certainly should be.
1969.64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2225.101,2227.325,"Well, are you arguing something not in a question decision?"
1969.64,1,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,2227.325,2230.132,I think not if Your Honor pleases.
1969.64,2,16984,arnold_i_shure,,3024.064,3036.326,"Mr. Chief Justice and Your Honors, the fairness as a matter of a fair ratio of exchange in the merger is not here."
