1964.73,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,60.402,"Number 73, United States, Appellant, versus Mississippi et al."
1964.73,0,15704,archibald_cox,,61.786,65.403,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,3423.185,3427.501,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3739.671,3751.921,"Well, Mr. Clark, I think your point would hold that your argument would be made against anyone suing the state whether it was the United States suing the state or anyone else."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,3751.921,3758.873,"Yes, Your Honor, for the point of the -- of making an accusation of wrong doing."
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3774.809,3778.733,Civil or any other -- any kind of a wrong?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,3778.733,3783.631,"Particularly, Your Honor, my mind really hasn't gone beyond the contrast of the case."
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3792.739,3804.495,"Well, then to the extent that there are any statutes or on the books now which purport to give federal courts jurisdiction of suits against states."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,3819.161,3823.665,"Well sir, it goes further than that."
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3886.327,3893.655,I don't see why your contention doesn't have then -- have to carry the saying that 1971 is unconstitutional.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,3893.655,3893.697,"No sir, I don't."
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3893.697,3901.475,Because it permits -- it permits joinder of the state and at least of its circumstances as a state.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,3901.475,3907.408,It permits in my opinion sir and this was a little bit later in my argument but I'll get to it now.
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3922.78,3931.727,But I don't see how that changes the -- the character or the thrust of your argument about the ability to make the state a party in a suit like this.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,3931.727,3936.294,There's no claim in that instance if Your Honor please that the State has done wrong.
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3959.213,3969.791,And you would say that the constitutional provisions purporting to extend the judicial power to suit against states and certain -- certain circumstance have to have these blocks to put on it.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,3975.827,3979.147,Suits against states where crimes are charged.
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3979.906,3983.597,Or violations of constitutional -- of the Constitution?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,3983.597,3984.448,"Yes, sir."
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3992.792,4001.342,So no state can constitutionally be sued where a violation of the constitutional right is alleged.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4001.342,4002.209,Yes sir.
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4011.693,4015.446,"That's just involved in suing the State isn't it, when you say this --"
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4015.446,4015.684,"Well, sir --"
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4015.684,4020.164,-- in the State of Mississippi and alleged that there has been a violation of the constitutional right?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4027.672,4048.162,"In its sovereign capacity not its governmental capacity and the distinction would be that the people who constitute the Government, can never so absent themselves from the State or from the area by death or by resignation or by any other force that they can defeat the right to correct the constitutional wrong."
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4292.214,4327.267,"Doesn't -- Mr. Clark, doesn't this section that you've just been talking about provide for two different situations, one that says that they may join the State with the offending officer and if prior to the institution of a proceeding such official has resigned or has been relieved to his office and no successor assume such office, the prosecution -- the proceeding may be instituted against the State."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4333.947,4334.349,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4334.349,4342.87,"One, where he is a law office where they can join the state with him and the other one where there is no officer and they can sue the state alone."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4342.87,4349.052,I agree with you too hastily because I did not know that you were going to explain your thought in the way that you subsequently did.
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4374.708,4378.032,"Well, I'm not -- I'm not talking about the constitutional concept."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4388.306,4389.907,Two different factual situations --
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4389.907,4389.944,Yes.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4389.944,4395.011,Mr. Chief Justice but not two different factual situations defined as you have defined them sir.
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4414.462,4418.303,"Yes, let's just -- let's just read it."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4455.06,4455.677,"Yes, sir."
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4455.677,4455.732,All right.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4455.732,4460.86,And stop there so I think you would have had an entirely concept and the rest of the statute could (Voice Overlap).
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4460.86,4461.451,"Yes, all right."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4481.463,4483.76,"Yes, sir."
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4483.76,4483.787,Now --
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4483.787,4484.092,"Mr. Chief Justice, the --"
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4484.092,4496.052,"Now, how -- how do you derive from that if the Congress hasn't set that the State may be joined with the offending officials?"
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4496.052,4501.99,It's the concept of the word join sir that we have our difference about.
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4542.394,4556.359,"Well, because -- because if there is no -- if there is no individual who can be sued because he is out of office then the Government can proceed solely against the State."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4561.71,4563.334,Yes.
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4563.334,4569.62,"I -- well, I just inquire of you if it doesn't have that plain meaning."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4569.62,4574.333,I wish we could -- I wish I had -- I could communicate but there's a difference between us and --
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4574.333,4578.079,But we won't argue that I had merely asked the question.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4578.079,4592.423,"This might be an appropriate time also, if the Court please, to discuss word deem.Of course this -- this has a completely different legal significance than the one we've been talking about."
1964.73,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4661.142,4668.173,(Inaudible)
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4668.173,4669.015,"Yes, sir."
1964.73,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4848.726,4884.559,"Mr. Clark, (Inaudible)"
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4884.559,4885.517,No sir.
1964.73,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4885.517,4887.605,(Inaudible)
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4887.605,4918.941,"Because the operation of the Fifteenth Amendment has been held by this Court to be self-executed when it came into effect, there were a number of states that had provisions in their franchise laws, every white male citizen that has certain qualifications is entitled to vote and this Court has held it on the day that that amendment came into effect, white disappeared."
1964.73,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4978.583,4981.979,(Inaudible)
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,4981.979,4984.622,"No, sir."
1964.73,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5002.547,5013.863,(Inaudible)
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5013.863,5016.301,The State cannot do that.
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5047.553,5058.713,When -- except for the owner's gift of property when -- when do you think the state ever takes any action in your defense?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5067.562,5068.264,Excuse me.
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5130.995,5138.742,Under the Fourteenth Amendment which forbids a state from doing something -- from discriminating for example.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5138.742,5142.622,Yes.
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5142.622,5143.978,That uses the word state.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5143.978,5144.085,"Yes, sir."
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5144.085,5145.215,It doesn't say state action.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5147.374,5148.715,That's right.
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5170.085,5172.224,Why is that the State?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5172.224,5173.444,"This is not the State, sir."
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5173.444,5177.475,"Well, then the Fourteenth Amendment then you wouldn't have enough cause of action of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5177.475,5186.554,"Yes, sir because they say under the Fourteenth Amendment that what this is, is state action; just like the Eleventh Amendment says the same thing."
1964.73,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5233.519,5247.139,Mr Clark (Inaudible)
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5247.139,5247.48,"No, sir."
1964.73,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5255.246,5265.573,"I believe that the statutes submit direct suits against the State or doesn't it, without depending on the individual."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5265.573,5269.762,But the thing that is being corrected is individual action.
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5271.967,5278.694,But the case that you've made parties on what Mr. Justice Goldberg said and they pay.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5278.694,5289.494,"To the extent that they -- that the State, qua state is said to be acting unconstitutionally or wrongfully."
1964.73,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5292.271,5294.822,Did you say you can't answer that?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5294.822,5295.852,"I do not know of it, sir."
1964.73,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5297.388,5310.475,"Your answer to this questions is that does -- it's under agency doctrines of respondeat superior and your point is that this case is not that, this is wrongdoing by individuals despite the correction of the State, isn't it?"
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5310.475,5311.325,Thank you sir.
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5354.661,5361.491,Is there any criminal punishment possible under this Act --
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5361.491,5361.508,19 --
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5361.508,5362.349,1971?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5362.349,5363.531,No sir.
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5374.133,5375.699,What does it provide?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5375.699,5387.537,It provides that anyone who deprives another with his constitutional rights is guilty of the crime.
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5387.537,5398.852,"I thought there was one that sounds familiar in the offense -- criminal offense to violate any of the civil rights statute, is that wrong?"
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5398.852,5400.954,I don't -- I'm not able to answer your question sir.
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5411.263,5418.097,What I'm hearing is the one that -- is that in that -- from the registrar and did not keep the record to the Court and then I'm guilty.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5418.097,5418.628,"Yes, sir."
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5418.628,5420.063,"We've done it before, haven't we?"
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5420.063,5420.758,Yes sir.
1964.73,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5469.244,5473.9,You're familiar with California -- United States against California?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5473.9,5476.111,There are some -- several of them so I hope I'm familiar with --
1964.73,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5476.111,5479.189,You distinguished the case?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5479.189,5480.482,Is this the tort suit?
1964.73,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5480.482,5481.325,"No, no."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5491.111,5502.264,"The thrust of what I'm saying here so would be that the point that I make pass sub silentio in the Court's opinion there that it didn't receive the necessary attention, number one."
1964.73,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5515.135,5520.676,"So you're stating there that the government explained -- the federal government explained in parallel, the property."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5520.676,5521.196,Yes sir.
1964.73,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5521.196,5523.361,That's what I distinguished to be permissible.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5523.361,5526.064,"For property -- it was a property action, yes sir."
1964.73,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5526.064,5531.926,That distinction you could rely -- you can present argument on but it was not sub silentio.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5545.192,5545.381,Yes sir.
1964.73,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5548.169,5550.846,"Well, the Attorney General can file a suit."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5550.846,5551.777,Yes sir.
1964.73,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5551.777,5552.771,It was argued.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5552.771,5555.35,Under inherent authority as opposed to statute.
1964.73,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5555.35,5570.794,"Well, I think subject to the evidence where it stated in the infringement of federal right of the Attorney General without any authorization and filed a suit to correct that wrong."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5587.53,5590.333,It would have to be on the property aspect.
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5603.59,5608.334,"Yes, if your -- if that ground is solid, that is a distinction."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5608.334,5610.505,Yes.
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5610.505,5634.421,"Mr. Clark, I didn't -- I don't quite remember your answer to Justice White when he asked you if you are arguing that Section 1971 is unconstitutional to the extent that it authorizes a proceeding instituted by the Attorney General against the State."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5635.68,5639.431,"Mr. Chief Justice, if your conception of join under that statute --"
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5639.431,5640.087,"No, no."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5653.366,5653.727,"No, sir."
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5661.567,5662.773,That can be done?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5662.773,5671.721,"Yes sir, because Mr. Chief Justice, the action asserted is not an action that says the State was wrong."
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5701.073,5716.219,"Well, if there is no individual against whom the action can be brought while he was in the office, and the proceeding may be instituted against the State, what relief may be given against the State?"
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5716.219,5729.681,"To require that the successors of that officer right the wrong that was done to the individual person who applied for registration, who was otherwise qualified under the state law, and was denied because of race or color."
1964.73,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5749.629,5755.753,But how can you distinguish the (Inaudible)
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5755.753,5758.054,Yes sir.
1964.73,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5758.054,5798.458,This is case where the suit is right brought in by the United States against the State of California by the Attorney General under the grounds of violation of the (Inaudible).
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5798.458,5805.403,"As far as the sovereign state was involved in that suit and I don't -- I‘m not familiar with the case, Mr. Justice Goldberg, but --"
1964.73,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5805.403,5818.155,United States against California (Inaudible) that certified the Government with the series of these cases.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5818.155,5818.717,Yes sir.
1964.73,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5818.717,5823.241,(Inaudible)
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5823.241,5825.535,Yes.
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5902.279,5939.005,"You maintain a -- you maintain an action against 10 registrars and they are enjoined, 10 other registrars may not be enjoined, but if you entered an injunction against the State of Mississippi and its agents and employees, I would suppose that all the registrars, at least those who know about the injunction and they're given the -- and their due process rights aren't violated would be bound just like the injunction in Louisiana case that forbids Louisiana in its agents and employees from doing so forth."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5939.005,5941.327,"Mr. Justice White, you're precisely right sir."
1964.73,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5949.485,5952.165,You suggested that this doesn't going to make any difference in terms of remedy.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,5957.509,5959.868,"The point -- well, let me explain in this instance."
1964.73,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6020.093,6022.029,How does the person become a registrar?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6023.7,6029.814,He is required -- this is another thing that we differ with the Government on an interpretation to Mississippi Law.
1964.73,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6049.915,6055.177,"It's one of the ex officio job of an elected official, a county elected official will serve for four years."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6056.188,6056.799,Yes.
1964.73,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6071.084,6073.836,How often does that happen as a matter of history in the facts?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6073.836,6075.249,There had been re-registrations.
1964.73,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6080.472,6086.562,And this is in the absolute discretion of the county officers -- county Board of Supervisors or --?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6086.562,6092.344,"You say absolute discretion sir, I don't -- I think that they have to find the --"
1964.73,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6092.344,6093.233,Some reason for it.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6093.233,6094.377,Some reason for it.
1964.73,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6101.449,6103.895,On a county -- within any given county.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6103.895,6107.017,"Yes, only they -- the Board of Supervisors functions only for the county."
1964.73,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6107.017,6108.508,How many counties are in Mississippi?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6108.508,6113.612,82.
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6479.568,6497.552,"What would be the effect or the remedy that could be shown that the Mississippi was -- the law said 21, it allowed all whites over 18 to vote but allowed no Negroes at that age?"
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6497.552,6498.191,Until they were 21.
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6498.191,6502.892,What effect would that have on the law as that should be held to be wrong?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6502.892,6519.223,"Absolutely none, Mr. Justice Black, in my conception because there are again, you would be allowing a man charged with the correct use of a statute to violate the statute and kill it, to kill it by his wrongful act."
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6519.223,6533.171,"Well, we've held that reference to some laws and you had to judge him by how they were administered, not by how they were written on the books and let me reference to the tax laws down in Tennessee some years ago."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6533.171,6533.623,I wasn't --
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6533.623,6533.635,So did the law --
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6533.635,6534.456,-- familiar with that case.
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6599.538,6613.694,"Aside from the effect of that is that material to the point we have to the dismissal of this case, the point you're now arguing as to what remedies and what can be the remedy?"
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6613.694,6614.195,"No, sir."
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6648.737,6651.765,On deciding precisely what?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6651.765,6662.528,"On deciding whether or not the Attorney General in this case has taken a constitutional shortcut, thus, he lacked the power."
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6698.633,6706.339,Your argument as you said in the beginning I gather that one point for a decision whether the Attorney General has a right to file this suit.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6706.339,6707.768,"Yes, precisely."
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6973.388,6981.356,(Voice Overlap) Fifteenth Amendment has made quite a change with reference to voting in election?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6981.356,6995.011,"To prohibitions Mr. Justice Black, against actions with regard to voting to saying, “No, you cannot”, no state shall, it does not fix qualifications for voters and this is the thrust of this case."
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6996.075,6998.13,He does not fit the qualifications for it?
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,6998.13,6998.487,No.
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6998.487,7001.592,But it does one thing which cannot be disputed here.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,7007.6,7011.528,It gives Congress the power to enforce the articles.
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7029.284,7036.625,"Well, it says there -- to pass laws appropriately, to do what the voters to be done there."
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,7036.625,7036.818,Yes sir.
1964.73,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7036.818,7046.539,And that's not the course here because the Congress hasn't passed a law particularly fixing the registration and qualification for voters.
1964.73,1,18682,charles_clark,,7046.539,7064.134,"Yes, and we would say also that this is not -- this another reason why inherent power can't come into play because here the Constitution has expressly said, Congress shall have the power to enforce this article and the Congress has acted and has enforced it and has enforced by enacting 1971."
1964.73,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7071.513,7073.633,Mr. Solicitor General.
1964.73,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7073.633,7080.081,"There is just two points, Mr. Chief Justice that I would like to touch upon very briefly."
1964.73,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7228.254,7237.522,"(Voice Overlap) the point is, you haven't cited the (Inaudible) that view?"
1964.73,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7237.522,7239.847,"No, I don't think that case is in here."
1964.73,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7244.574,7247.439,Are you getting any conflict on what was involved in that case?
1964.73,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7247.439,7251.375,"I thought it relied on a provision of the statute, if we may."
1964.73,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7252.794,7260.315,"Well, that's what we have (Inaudible)."
1964.73,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7260.315,7260.6,Yes.
1964.73,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7260.6,7263.248,"-- the regulation that encompass it, that's entirely fair --"
1964.73,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7263.248,7263.586,With it?
1964.73,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7263.586,7265.732,-- in trying to resolve this.
1964.73,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7265.732,7272.139,"And of course, and all of these provisions carried with them some surrender of sovereignty."
1964.73,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7285.573,7287.454,It's applying the statutes.
1964.73,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7287.454,7288.106,Yes.
1964.73,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7289.429,7294.394,They're right about the facts of the statute (Inaudible).
1964.73,2,15704,archibald_cox,,7294.394,7295.297,"Well, I think it does."
