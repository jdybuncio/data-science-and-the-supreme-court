1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,174.974,187.261,"Well, I would say that that order is illegal, null and void because the Court that issued it had no jurisdiction to issue it."

1983.82-1295,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,425.889,427.325,Isn't that your argument?
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,427.325,430.038,That kind of statute (Voice Overlap).
1983.82-1295,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,430.038,431.018,Maybe unconstitutional.

1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,530.228,542.121,"I think you would have to join the State of Florida, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because it is a Florida statute that is doing them the harm."
1983.82-1295,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,544.82,555.712,It takes a lot of our cases involving county officials where they have been defendants and charged with violating people's constitutional rights have involved them administering state statutes --

1983.82-1295,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,570.07,598.465,"Well, let's go to another case like primary case, Smith against Allwright was against two local county precinct judges and it involved the primary law of the State of Texas and nobody has ever questioned the jurisdiction until this day."
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,598.465,611.706,"Well, Justice Marshall, they didn't administer the --"
1983.82-1295,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,611.706,611.894,Because they said --

1983.82-1295,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,627.28,633.274,But it was the state law which was declared unconstitutional.

1983.82-1295,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,633.679,644.105,"In that case, and the Government not only was not a party, but when he came up here, the Attorney General didn't need more the defendant."

1983.82-1295,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,666.642,667.403,But they did in that case.
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,667.403,671.084,-- that this is true so that he can be called to come and defend it.
1983.82-1295,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,671.084,674.487,He was notified and he said he did not want to come.
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,674.487,674.787,Well --
1983.82-1295,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,674.787,677.117,And this Court says come.

1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,714.207,735.675,"Well, I -- I think also, Your Honor, this statement that no state statute or constitutional provision has been invalidated with the judgment below which is the second sentence in their brief is a statement that's very hard to defend."
1983.82-1295,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,737.126,746.18,"Your central point still doesn't turn on this subject, does it?"
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,746.18,762.244,The Court of Appeals and about the third line of its decision says that the lower court declared this constitution and statute unconstitutional and then they affirmed it.

1983.82-1295,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.764,1361.984,Who -- where do we suppose to pay?

1983.82-1295,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1436.766,1438.442,We have to do something with that finding.
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1438.442,1442.046,That's an erroneous statement by the District Court.

1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1723.405,1731.786,"Well, they had to prove some racial discrimination against them that prevented them from having an equal vote."
1983.82-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1740.645,1742.276,But we know what the voting was.
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1747.621,1749.34,The projected state of mind --
1983.82-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1749.34,1755.545,"Subjective, subjective, the actual motivation of any individual, does that make any difference in the outcome of the case?"
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1755.545,1758.035,"Well, I -- I would say that it did."
1983.82-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1772.676,1777.438,"Well, I understand it's your position that there was no adverse, no wrongful motivation."
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1777.716,1778.039,That is correct.
1983.82-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1778.039,1784.857,-- to understand what your legal theory is as respects what they had to prove in order to prevail.
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1784.857,1796.667,They had to prove that the State itself which -- what this system maintain it and operate.
1983.82-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.812,1800.566,And if they proved that --
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1800.566,1802.216,-- purposes in Escambia.
1983.82-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1802.216,1805.623,"-- and if they proved that, are they entitled to prevail?"
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1805.623,1808.236,Yes.
1983.82-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1808.236,1812.634,That means we don't have to examine the motivation of the county commissioners if I understand you.
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1812.634,1815.585,"Well, I think that -- I think that's a part of it."
1983.82-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1825.631,1825.635,Did I understand --
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1825.635,1826.421,(Voice overlap)
1983.82-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.421,1830.037,-- you to be conceding they don't have to prove any in Escambia either.
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1830.037,1831.503,Pardon?
1983.82-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1837.359,1841.661,It -- it seems to me you have given me two or three different answers to it.
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1848.336,1848.997,Yes.
1983.82-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1848.997,1849.791,They do have to prove that?
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1849.791,1851.029,Yes.
1983.82-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1851.029,1855.335,And how many commissioners do they have to prove with that kind of motivation?
1983.82-1295,0,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,1855.335,1880.437,"Well, I -- I would say they had to prove a majority of them and I think that this case, and I hope when the Court thinks about it really turns on the jurisdictional point that the State controlled everything and that the Escambians had nothing to say about it."
1983.82-1295,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1905.34,1908.739,Mr. Menefee.
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,1908.739,1911.794,"Mr. Chief justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-1295,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1986.883,1992.615,"When you say rejection, Mr. Menefee, rejection by whom?"
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,1992.615,1997.567,The county commission rejected the recommendations of the charter study commissions.
1983.82-1295,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1997.567,2006.844,And do you -- you say that the record supports to find that the reason for their -- for their rejection is recommendation was racially motivated?
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2006.844,2008.39,We believe that -- yes.
1983.82-1295,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2016.944,2020.285,May -- may I ask you the same question I asked your opponent?
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2020.285,2020.488,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1295,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2020.488,2025.624,How many people voted against the -- who participated in this decision from the commission?
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2025.624,2030.481,It's my understanding that both times it was a unanimous decision by the county commission.
1983.82-1295,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2030.481,2038.341,And it would have been sufficient to establish your case to prove that two people had the wrong kind of motivation?
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2038.341,2040.358,"Your Honor, I don't think it is --"
1983.82-1295,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2040.358,2047.697,What if one of them came in and frankly testified that he wanted to preserve White supremacy in the -- in the county.
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2048.503,2051.304,"I believe under existing case law, that's correct."
1983.82-1295,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.304,2052.123,That it would be enough?
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2052.123,2052.788,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1295,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.788,2056.784,Do you interpret the District Court having found anything more than that?
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2056.784,2057.824,More than one person?
1983.82-1295,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2057.824,2060.395,Yes.
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2060.395,2063.527,I don't believe the District Court is clear how many.
1983.82-1295,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2089.563,2099.543,"Well, you -- you contend, if I understand your brief correctly, that even if none of the five had the wrong kind of motive, that's still, the state practices were sufficient to condemn the plan."
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2100.427,2101.443,"Yes, sir, I believe so."
1983.82-1295,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2108.89,2119.392,"Well, very -- very frankly, I think it's important to know when we say there's an invidious purpose, whose purpose we're talking about and how much -- how many people we have --"
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2119.392,2119.398,These purposes how much --
1983.82-1295,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2119.398,2124.468,"-- I think the law is unclear and I'm trying to find out what the record in this case is and what the parties are contending, that's all."
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2124.468,2126.151,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1295,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2126.151,2127.236,Mr. Menefee --
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2127.236,2127.239,"Yes, ma'am."
1983.82-1295,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2127.239,2143.923,"-- if the District Court only found that the Commissioners failed to recommend the single-member district plan to the voters, why should the remedy by the Court be anything other than telling him to submit it to the voters?"
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2143.923,2148.394,It is a continued maintenance of the at-large election system.
1983.82-1295,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2156.601,2165.423,"Well, if the offense was simply not submitting it to the voters, I don't know why the remedy wouldn't flow from that."
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2165.423,2176.632,"Justice O'Connor, I think what it -- what it shows and putting -- in this long historical record that is in this case, and I don't believe has been in another case before this Court."
1983.82-1295,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2193.443,2197.531,What happened in the most recent election under the new plan?
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2198.751,2205.363,"Yes, in Fort -- a Black was elected for the first time in recorded history."
1983.82-1295,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2218.499,2226.347,Is the case now moot because of the withdrawal of the District Court order in your view?
1983.82-1295,1,34812,larry_t_menefee,,2226.347,2229.368,I believe the remedy issue is probably moot.
1983.82-1295,2,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,3522.707,3532.783,"In that one minute, I want to say that all of the matters that you have been referring to of discrimination were state action and not action by Escambia County."
1983.82-1295,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3532.783,3538.269,"Mr. Santurri, are you prepared?"
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3548.446,3558.577,"Mr. Chief Justice, I am prepared to -- to address the motion to dismiss."
1983.82-1295,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3603.454,3615.6,"But for the present majority, is it owes its office to the -- the fact that the Court imposed the single-member district plan, does it not?"
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3615.6,3620.43,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is a yes, but it's a qualified yes."
1983.82-1295,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3642.128,3642.808,On an at-large?
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3642.808,3664.271,"On at-large basis, yes, and -- and I might point this out to the Court that the -- all the incumbents ran on a platform that was constituted of or consisted of saying that they intended to maintain this lawsuit and all except for one was defeated."
1983.82-1295,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3691.196,3693.319,"To decide that position, must it not?"
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3693.319,3695.966,"That is -- that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, the majority must, but the board --"
1983.82-1295,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3695.966,3701.804,"So there is -- there is a position of the County Commissioners before the Court, now, today?"
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3701.804,3702.962,That is correct.
1983.82-1295,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3702.962,3705.556,And the position is to dismiss the appeal.
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3705.556,3707.535,"Yes, sir, to dismiss the appeal."
1983.82-1295,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3714.278,3726.703,"Well -- well what -- what you say will -- would make a great deal more sense to me if you're talking about an orthodox appeal where the county, say, had a money judgment against them or do we appeal from the District Court of the Eleventh Circuit?"
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3762.672,3763.944,"Justice Rehnquist, I think it is."
1983.82-1295,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3779.003,3782.405,If the case is moot?
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3782.405,3786.112,"As Mr. Menefee said, I hate to go into the -- to use that term mootness."
1983.82-1295,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3792.84,3806.926,"Well, I -- I think if you -- you're going to say it's moot, why, we would vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, direct the Court of Appeals to remand it to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the entire case."
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3810.784,3818.17,The -- what I would suggest is that the persons that attempting to maintain the suit do not have the requisite interest in this particular case.
1983.82-1295,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3818.17,3827.525,"Well I -- didn't the District Court -- aren't the individual -- the individual commissioners, all commissioners were parties (Voice overlap)"
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3827.525,3828.476,That is correct.
1983.82-1295,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3828.476,3833.352,"And it was maintained in their individual capacity, not just their official capacity."
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3838.822,3839.285,Justice --
1983.82-1295,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3839.285,3840.251,-- aren't they?
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3840.251,3840.821,Justice White --
1983.82-1295,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3840.821,3840.823,-- aren't they?
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3840.823,3842.077,-- that is correct.
1983.82-1295,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3842.829,3852.277,"All right, so apparently somebody like the district judge thought they had an interest in their individual capacity, wholly aside from their position as commissioners."
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3852.277,3872.517,"Well, I'm -- I'm bound by what the judge found and -- and what it is -- is in the record and as -- as you'd probably note in the supplemental brief as filed by the appellees, there was an excerpt from Judge Arnold's order and he stated that his only reason for keeping them in there was not for any liability that they face as far as costs, attorney's fees or any individual liability."
1983.82-1295,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3883.192,3891.989,"Well, hasn't he got a -- haven't that -- those two got a -- got some interests in having the injunction that was outstanding against them lifted?"
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3897.48,3898.734,"That is correct, however --"
1983.82-1295,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3898.734,3902.745,"Well, why is -- why -- why is the case moot then?"
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3908.317,3916.223,I do believe the -- the mootness issue was -- was addressed in the appellee's brief.
1983.82-1295,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3916.223,3928.475,"Well, you're -- you're not -- your -- your position as I understand, isn't that it's moot, it's that you are the party that said that one time you represent the party that sought the challenge to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit's judgment."
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3933.252,3934.083,That -- that is correct.
1983.82-1295,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3934.083,3935.011,That doesn't mean it's moot.
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3937.283,3939.809,"It's worth -- we're tired of the lawsuit, in other words, and we want to withdraw."
1983.82-1295,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3939.809,3943.638,"Well, all you want -- all you want is dismiss the appeal of this Court period."
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3943.638,3944.305,That's correct.
1983.82-1295,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3944.308,3946.511,And let stand everything that had happened below.
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3946.511,3947.236,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1295,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3947.236,3950.607,The thing is you don't to represent the two individual commissioners.
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3950.607,3952.327,I represent the Board of County Commissioners.
1983.82-1295,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3952.327,3957.192,"Yes, well and we have two individual commissioners who are parties in their own right."
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3957.192,3964.167,But we're saying that they do not have the requisite interest in this particular case to -- to force the county to -- to keep pursuing the appeal.
1983.82-1295,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3964.167,3971.159,"Well, to pass on the issue that you've raised, the Court would have to decide whether these two have any interest to preserve?"
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3971.159,3973.521,"I believe that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1295,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3973.521,3976.594,It would be a nice thing if -- if that's really an issue.
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,3991.385,3998.666,A remand may be the correct vehicle in order to -- there are some factual assertions have been made through the supplemental briefs and that may be (Inaudible)
1983.82-1295,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3998.666,4002.972,"And maybe the Court of Appeals couldn't solve it, it would have to be remand this to the District Court."
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,4002.972,4004.625,"That is correct, Justice White."
1983.82-1295,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4004.625,4009.111,"May I ask in your opinion, whom does Mr. Rhyne represent?"
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,4009.111,4023.844,"Justice Stevens, I believe that he has named Commissioner Dixon, Commissioner Kelson and he represents also certain former members of the -- the Board of County Commissioners."
1983.82-1295,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4023.844,4024.944,He certainly made it clear.
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,4028.367,4033.022,"I believe he did state their position, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1983.82-1295,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4033.022,4033.934,"Thank you, counsel."
1983.82-1295,3,43341,thomas_r_santurri,,4033.934,4034.405,"Thank you, Chief Justice, I appreciate this --"
1983.82-1295,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4034.405,4035.092,"Thank you, gentlemen."
