1959.23,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,21.114,"Number 23, United States of America, Petitioner, versus Durham Lumber Company, et al."
1959.23,0,27167,howard_a_heffron,,31.682,35.795,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.23,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,282.551,297.396,"Mr. Heffron may I ask you please two things; first, did -- do the North Carolina cases mentioned any trust in your view?"
1959.23,0,27167,howard_a_heffron,,297.396,298.118,"Yes, they do."
1959.23,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,298.118,299.478,Expressly mentioned the trust.
1959.23,0,27167,howard_a_heffron,,299.478,299.84,Yes.
1959.23,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,317.964,331.885,"And secondly, did -- as you read it, the Fourth Circuit's opinion make any mention of the requirement of the service of notice by the mechanic?"
1959.23,0,27167,howard_a_heffron,,331.885,344.49,"Yes, I believe the Fourth Circuit relied on the service of the notice by the mechanic as the act which gave right for their independent right to payment from the owner under North Carolina law."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,1940.509,1944.42,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1959.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2086.041,2092.553,"Well, Mr. Vann, do you have either of those circumstances in this case that you have just set out?"
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2092.553,2092.985,"Yes, if it --"
1959.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2092.985,2093.63,Which one?
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2093.63,2096.839,-- if it please the Court.
1959.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2123.385,2124.393,But when was it finished?
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2124.393,2127.547,"1954, when the contract was completed."
1959.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2127.547,2128.936,Yes.
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2128.936,2135.41,Notice was given by the respondents in January of 1955.
1959.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2141.655,2142.654,Prior to the -- prior to the --
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2142.654,2148.773,Prior to the filing but within the time allowed by the statute in our State.
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2161.521,2162.295,May I break in?
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2162.295,2162.667,"Yes, sir."
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2162.667,2167.956,"Before your notice in January 1955, could the owner has paid over to the bankrupt?"
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2167.956,2169.937,"No, sir."
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2284.318,2287.012,Is it --
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2292.458,2294.817,"Your Honor, I hardly -- know the laws in North Carolina."
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2294.817,2322.211,"-- they have a right -- they have a right [Laughter] -- they have a right to the mechanics' lien, as I understand it, the one which makes it unlawful to pay the -- for the owner to pay to the contractor the -- what he owes his, what he would owe it if he still owes something, if he owe something as -- as the contractor goes to sub-contractor."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2331.057,2333.167,"Yes, sir."
1959.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2372.298,2374.957,Who were the parties -- who were the parties in that case?
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2374.957,2386.901,"Schnepp versus Richardson involved amount due to a subcontractor and amount due to the owner, I mean to the -- to the prime contractor."
1959.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2386.901,2389.885,"Yes, but who were the parties to the case?"
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2389.885,2390.243,They were --
1959.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2390.243,2396.551,The owner and the -- and the subcontractor or the contractor and the subcontractor or was the Government in that thing?
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2396.551,2399.187,"The Government was not involved in that one, if Your Honors please."
1959.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2399.187,2400.372,Yes.
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2400.372,2428.523,"But the point I wanted -- in -- in answer to -- to Justice Black's question, upon such showing, the law required the owner to apply the unexpended contract price due the -- due the contractor to the payments of the amounts due the subcontractors and material men of whose claim the owner has received notice and here is the key."
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2451.043,2461.57,"Yes, but when you use -- when your North Carolina decision talks about supplanting that implies a power -- of higher supplanting."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2472.251,2475.851,"Well, he may well have had something there possibly."
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2485.324,2490.175,"Before that notice, the Government came in and said, â€œWe have a prior right."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2493.076,2493.595,"Well, that may --"
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2493.595,2494.579,Isn't that right?
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2494.579,2494.845,That's what the --
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2494.845,2495.537,That's the Government position.
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2495.537,2496.37,-- that's what -- that's their position.
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2496.37,2503.263,We have an interest in this fund to be and that fund to be at that time ran from the owner to the contractor.
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2503.263,2504.068,All right.
1959.23,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2548.209,2577.058,(Inaudible)
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2577.058,2578.174,That's correct.
1959.23,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2580.353,2599.214,"Well, then does not that mean or do I don't directly understand that the rights (Inaudible) are first acquired by means (Inaudible)"
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2599.214,2601.641,Correct.
1959.23,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2601.641,2614.027,"Now, then, If that's all, why was not the antecedent (Inaudible) take precedence over the subsequently acquired property."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2614.027,2617.509,We are perfectly willing for the Government to get what's left.
1959.23,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2617.509,2618.281,No.
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2648.687,2653.264,"Well, I would not agree to your conclusion in the matter."
1959.23,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2653.264,2659.707,(Inaudible)
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2659.707,2665.921,"Of course, we -- we argue first in -- in an answer to your question, Mr. Justice Whittaker."
1959.23,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2677.594,2679.31,(Inaudible)
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2679.31,2680.008,That's right.
1959.23,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2680.008,2681.039,(Inaudible)
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2681.039,2689.33,"Well, it - it had been given within the statutory period permitted to the -- to the mechanic and material supplied which is six months."
1959.23,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2689.33,2695.776,(Inaudible) filing of the tax lien with (Inaudible)
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2695.776,2697.495,"As a matter of record, yes."
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2747.526,2781.893,"Would you agree that the issue of the case is you don't like to go into priorities which is in the way was about but to be more specific, if the taxpayer had property or rights to property in existence at the time that the lien notice was given by the Government then that is valid and prevails over all other latent possessions of power under your state law, you would agree with that."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2781.893,2784.25,"I think it's a privilege, yes, sir."
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2784.25,2810.076,"And therefore, the real question is whether, whatever property may contain, whether the incidents created by North Carolina law both statutory in decision, whether under North Carolina law, there was any closed property and rights to property in the taxpayer contractor at the time the lien was attached, at the time the lien was given notice of."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2811.016,2812.68,"In the essence, yes, sir."
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2812.68,2836.49,"And so that's what the controversy really turns on whether that which whatever interest it maybe whether the contractor had an interest which, as a matter of federal law, is contained within the concept or the content of property or rights so far."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2836.49,2839.067,As decided by North Carolina and not by --
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2839.067,2850.834,"Well, but North Carolina can say something is property which -- which is outside the scope of what the -- this Court will ultimately say is contained under the term ""property"" in 6321."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2850.834,2851.414,"Well, I should hope it is."
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2851.414,2861.319,"What property is has to be determined by federal law, otherwise every State can give its own fancy notions of what constitutes property and raise havoc with this statute."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2861.319,2863.567,"Well, we've been doing it for 85 years."
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2867.729,2881.199,"That may intercede North Carolina litigants that the question of whether Uncle Sam has something to which he can hang on an assertion of a lien is here for the first time, as I understand it, isn't it?"
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2881.199,2881.568,All right.
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2892.064,2897.054,"Well, wouldn't he have that if you didn't, under any just lien statutes?"
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2897.424,2897.842,-- Yes.
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2897.842,2903.461,"-- there had been said that the statutory duty to pay, you would still have the lien, wouldn't it?"
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2903.461,2909.045,"He would but here, it's -- it's a direct statutory created right."
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2909.045,2910.485,"Well, so it is, so all the liens."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2910.485,2912.011,"Yes, Your Honor and --"
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2912.011,2927.603,"What -- what I understood your Court to hold was is because the statute says that on account of this lien, he cannot pay contractor that -- that somehow differentiates it from the usual lien statute, is it not?"
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2928.586,2932.528,He cannot pay the contractor until the subcontractors have been taken care of.
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2932.528,2935.928,"Well, I think -- I think all of them provide that."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2935.928,2936.96,I think most of them do.
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2938.217,2942.613,"So there's nothing different, is there, to that -- for the ordinary lien up to that point?"
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2942.613,2944.116,"Up to that point, no, sir."
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2944.116,2946.288,"Well, now what is it that comes after that? (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,2946.288,2958.639,What comes -- what comes after that has been so able pointed out in a very scholarly opinion by Judge Haynsworth in the Circuit Court of Appeals.
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2993.182,3015.628,"But is there anything in your law that in your judgment says this state law, in this State there shall never be a debt owing by an owner to -- to someone else until the subcontractors are paid?"
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3022.633,3026.489,"No, sir, there would have to be a debt that the debt is --"
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3026.489,3027.76,Debt to whom?
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3027.76,3031.791,It would be a debt to the -- to the contractor.
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3031.791,3033.219,To the contractor.
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3033.219,3038.031,Whoever was architect whoever was responsible up until the time the notice was given.
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3038.031,3038.505,Yes.
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3038.505,3047.719,"But after that, then he has -- then the debt is transferred in the -- and the responsibility is transferred to the material suppliers, laborers, and mechanics as the case maybe."
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3047.719,3056.632,Provided some -- something hasn't intervened in the meantime to make the debts give someone else a lien on that day.
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3056.632,3072.247,"Well, as I say, I thought it was one of the premises upon which I came into this Court that the right of the property would have been determined by the States how they are to be taxed to be determined by this Court under the federal jurisdiction."
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3087.272,3100.293,-- what does have to rewrite the statute after all if the statute is -- North Carolina provided that there should be a lien under these circumstances.
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3108.84,3128.671,"Well, because, if the best, if it please the Court, writes that our people have under the law to come along now and -- and say that they do not have those rights because of a prior -- because of a federal statute is in effect rewriting [Laughs] our statutes."
1959.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3128.671,3143.178,"Well, it's -- it's holding if it's held that the federal statute is the supreme law of the land and the lien has validly vested there, valid -- validly created which the State has to record."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3143.178,3144.135,That's it.
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3172.069,3176.466,"Mr. Vann, may I pursue the questions of Justice Black put."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3187.581,3188.197,It did.
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3188.197,3194.62,"At that moment, a right went from the owner to the contractor and the subcontractor wasn't in existence."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3194.62,3195.583,Correct.
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3195.583,3196.446,The purposes of the transaction.
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3196.446,3197.423,Correct.
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3197.423,3218.849,"Are you saying that that shows-in-action under that contract, namely, the avails of the work to be done by the contractor in money payment by the owner shifted that shows-in-action, shifted to the subcontractor as soon as the contractor made an arrangement with the subcontractor."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3233.322,3235.715,That's exactly what I'm saying.
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3235.715,3239.002,"That in a way, there's a kind of ovation there."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3239.002,3241.605,It may well be.
1959.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3241.605,3250.41,"Well, does the statute either say that or have -- have any of your cases -- state cases specifically held that?"
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3250.41,3259.115,"Our -- our decisions have held that, that it's a -- primary direct obligation to pay from the owner to the subcontractor."
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3259.115,3275.378,"Would you mind giving us -- the Chief Justice have asked you that too, would you mind giving us a specific North Carolina decision that you want us to look at out of which there arises legal situation such as I, in a blundering way, tried to sketch."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3275.378,3278.092,"Yes, sir, there are cited in the first part of --"
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3278.092,3279.089,"Now, could you turn?"
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3279.089,3280.924,"Yes, sir."
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3281.804,3284.634,"Wait a minute, just one second, in your brief?"
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3284.634,3285.89,"Yes, sir."
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3287.367,3290.897,"Yes -- I just wanted the page of your brief, where they are."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3290.897,3292.534,"Well, it's in the index."
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3292.534,3294.55,"All right, would you just give me the names, would you?"
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3294.55,3332.163,"All right, so Hildebrand versus Vanderbilt, 147 N.C. 639, Charlotte Pipe & Foundry versus Southern Aluminum, 172 North Carolina 704, Campbell versus Hall, 180 --"
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3333.102,3334.01,I didn't get that.
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3334.01,3335.837,Campbell versus Hall.
1959.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3335.837,3336.784,"Yes, I see it."
1959.23,1,17162,arthur_vann,,3336.784,3340.41,187 North Carolina at 464.
