2011.11-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.485,We will hear argument next in case 11-88 Mohamad v. The Palestinian Authority.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,6.42,8.856,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,32.721,36.939,We usually like -- we usually like to begin with the language of the statute.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,36.939,38.256,"That was my next sentence, Your Honor."
2011.11-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,38.256,38.808,Well then go ahead.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,38.808,39.391,Thank you.
2011.11-88,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,104.067,117.075,"I thought you said that Judge Edwards opinion was about politically motivated terrorists, not coming within the Alien Tort Statute."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,117.075,117.908,--No.
2011.11-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,156.868,157.502,Wait.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,162.087,164.489,"I think, Justice Scalia, I think--"
2011.11-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,164.489,169.943,I will bet you none of them -- none of them even read that opinion.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,169.943,174.847,"--Well, I think Judge Edwards' opinion was quite prominently read by the Congress then."
2011.11-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,193.825,201.914,"That is a strange phrase, honest services, as, you know, as a crime, deprivation -- deprivation of honest services."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,208.101,208.835,"Well, no, Justice Scalia--"
2011.11-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,208.835,210.437,It means an individual.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,210.437,221.911,"--I think it's a strange -- it's a very strange phrase in the context of a tort statute, because we know that Congress always provides for organizational liability, and it's never used to our knowledge, the word ""individual"" in a tort statute."
2011.11-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,223.595,226.129,Is that better for you or worse for you?
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,226.129,230.75,"Well, I think it's better for us in that it shows that Congress -- something is amiss."
2011.11-88,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,244.941,246.793,The problem is I don't even look there.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,256.749,258.718,"--No, it didn't."
2011.11-88,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,258.718,265.923,"And they appear to be using ""person"" in the organizational way that person is defined in the dictionary act and elsewhere."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,272.593,281.366,"No, Justice Sotomayor, for two reasons: One is because for reasons I will explain, the word person as it appears in the TVPA actually only applies to natural persons."
2011.11-88,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,286.337,293.091,Individuals legal representative or to any person who may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,300.161,303.38,--I think the argument -- I think the argument is that the word person somehow contrasts with individual.
2011.11-88,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,303.38,303.83,Yes.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,303.83,308.866,And as we have shown in our brief only natural people can bring wrongful death actions.
2011.11-88,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,323.276,327.162,"You know, it's obvious that individual doesn't usually mean what you want it to mean."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,361.568,365.37,We don't disagree with that's how the word gets into the statute.
2011.11-88,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,379.363,380.28,And it means what it means.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,380.28,391.604,"--And the problem with that theory, Justice Kagan, is it squarely is contradicted by the committee reports contemporaneous with the statutes that say we're using the word individual to make crystal clear that foreign states and their entities cannot be sued."
2011.11-88,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,392.856,397.408,"Well, then I looked at -- I have looked at -- I know I have to go through legislative history."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,459.332,466.336,"--Yes, pages 46 through 49 of our blue brief, Justice Breyer."
2011.11-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,499.942,503.344,Suppose I am a member of the House or of the Senate.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,550.441,551.608,"--Natural person, Justice Scalia."
2011.11-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,591.516,595.453,So they did this to -- they chose that word to avoid any residual ambiguity.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,605.159,610.646,"--Well, I respectfully submit they didn't think about that question, which is why I am standing here today."
2011.11-88,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,619.569,641.682,"There were witnesses who testified, were there not, Mr. Fisher, that the TVPA would take care of a type case that when the torturer shows up physically -- those were the words that used -- the torturer comes into the state, into the United States, is physically present in the United States."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,649.938,651.89,Those are statements to that affect.
2011.11-88,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,662.512,663.864,"But let's suppose that is true, Mr. Fisher."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,696.002,700.371,"Well, if the word ""individual"" could only mean natural person, I agree."
2011.11-88,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,713.28,718.932,"If you found no tort statute, you use the ""individual"" to include organizations."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,718.932,719.267,Right.
2011.11-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,726.621,742.048,"We have the additional problem, though, that your reading gives a different meaning to ""individual"" in two sentences that are right -- actually it's in the same sentence: an ""individual"" who does the torturing, subjects an ""individual"" to torture."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,751.137,751.905,--You don't.
2011.11-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,751.905,752.588,You don't.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,752.588,753.039,And I--
2011.11-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,753.039,760.175,"So ""individual"" in the one clause, you say means ""organization""; ""individual"" in the other necessarily does not."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,760.175,766.831,"--I don't think it's that they have different meanings, but you are certainly correct that they refer to different things."
2011.11-88,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,779.573,779.973,In the same sentence?
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,779.973,780.723,--Yes.
2011.11-88,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,781.175,782.791,In those statutes you sp--
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,782.791,783.191,Yes.
2011.11-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,886.442,888.377,Maybe the organizations opposed it.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,888.377,889.644,--Not--
2011.11-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,889.644,894.964,Maybe organizations opposed the extension of the legislation to themselves.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,903.27,909.624,"--That may -- in other cases, perhaps, but you don't find anything in this legislative history suggesting that organizations were--"
2011.11-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,909.624,912.743,"Yes, but you don't find lobbying in the legislative history."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,912.743,916.128,"--Well, I can't prove something that I don't have a piece of paper for."
2011.11-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,916.128,918.579,It's an explanation.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,926.585,938.477,"Justice Scalia, one would expect to have found over the four years this was debated and the hundreds of pages of legislative history some clue that that is what Congress was reacting to and thinking about."
2011.11-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.906,963.358,"This is the dog that did not bark, right?"
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,970.431,977.952,"--No, Justice Scalia, I agree that if the word ""individual"" can have no other meaning than that which my opponent suggests, then I lose."
2011.11-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,986.891,996.998,"But Congress, as you have indicated, Congress focused on the very question of whether organizations would be covered or not in the context of whether a State would be covered."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1018.679,1023.899,"I think, Chief Justice, that that is exactly the thought process that Congress went through."
2011.11-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1025.449,1026.618,But it's at least ambiguous.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1038.508,1039.158,--Exactly.
2011.11-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1039.892,1040.292,Really?
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1041.694,1043.427,And page 6 to 8 of our reply brief explains why that is so.
2011.11-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1046.848,1047.614,"Hah, hah."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1048.498,1049.731,--If you read--
2011.11-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1049.731,1053.585,"But you have been saying all along ""individual"" has a secondary meaning."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1053.585,1054.252,--It does.
2011.11-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1054.252,1057.337,So why would they have picked the secondary meaning of a word rather than try--
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1057.337,1062.041,"Because it's more precise word in international law discourse than the word ""person"" for the reason I described before."
2011.11-88,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1063.524,1064.81,How about non-state actors?
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1064.81,1066.01,--Pardon me?
2011.11-88,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1066.01,1067.01,Non-state actors.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1067.01,1070.295,"Well, except for -- Remember, there is a State action requirement in the statute that--"
2011.11-88,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1070.295,1073.08,Individuals and organizations.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1073.08,1093.493,"--I mean, maybe there's other ways that Congress could have done it, but the way Judge Edwards did it and the way that international law scholars and people having this conversation about whether people other than States ought to be liable under international law, was the term that they always used, and it's not just -- you don't just -- you know, we are not running a west law search looking for wherever we can find it."
2011.11-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1097.781,1106.803,"Mr. Fisher, it seems to me you misrepresent our jurisprudence when you insist that ""individual"" has to have only that meaning."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1119.96,1123.596,"There is obviously cases to that effect, but I'm--"
2011.11-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1123.596,1124.848,Many cases to that effect.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1124.848,1125.348,--I'm aware of other cases--
2011.11-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1125.348,1126.464,We say it all the time.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1126.464,1134.72,"--Well, I think, for example, Justice Scalia, of the jurisprudence where I had an argument in this Court about the second or successive petitioner rule under habeas law."
2011.11-88,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1175.547,1176.847,It doesn't really need an answer.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1189.122,1208.785,"--Well, if you find the statute at least somewhat ambiguous for the reasons I've described, then what Meyer and cases say is you assume if Congress didn't think about it, but they want an ordinary tort and agency principle, and the -- the -- in Title VII and many other cases, this Court has said, of course Congress doesn't think about all these things; and when they don't, and absent--"
2011.11-88,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1208.785,1209.835,Maybe they did.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1238.805,1239.557,--The--
2011.11-88,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1239.557,1245.041,"The -- I mean -- and you have Congressman Leach, and then you have the word ""individual""."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1245.041,1253.064,--The question Father Drinan was responding to was whether or not the TVPA ought to be extended to private entities that do not act under color of law.
2011.11-88,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1253.064,1254.064,But he's--
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1254.064,1254.599,And at the time--
2011.11-88,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1254.599,1256.933,--He's taking that -- he's taking that -- go ahead.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1256.933,1264.605,"--Yes, if you look at that quote, remember, that hearing was held before the Oslo Accords, before the PLO became in our view a state actor."
2011.11-88,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1279.532,1286.285,I -- I find it hard enough to parse the statute without having to parse Father Drinan's testimony.
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1287.037,1293.124,"Well, of course, I was just responding to Justice Breyer's question as to that context."
2011.11-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1368.44,1390.103,"--Well, the TVPA is an extraordinary step in terms of exposing liability, and it doesn't seem to me to be an odd idea that Congress would want to proceed carefully before establishing a situation where the -- the use of the American tribunal is as broad as it is under this situation."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1390.103,1393.238,"Well, I don't -- I don't disagree that it's unusual statute."
2011.11-88,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1407.196,1416.251,"Oh, the obvious thing that they said is look, just -- this is going to bring in suits against the Palestinian Authority."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1428.994,1436.582,"--With respect, Justice Breyer, I would just say if you look back at the legislative history, the only conversation that was had is should we reach non-state actors."
2011.11-88,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1452.694,1469.971,"Mr. Fisher, one case that you seem to have on your side; you don't have very many but you have this one, is -- is Clinton, which -- which does read ""individual"" in the way that you say, and does it in order to avoid an absurd result -- what the Court thought of as an absurd result."
2011.11-88,0,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,1474.873,1487.517,"I don't think -- if I could beg your indulgence for one moment -- I don't think I need to argue that, because I think that for all the reasons I have given there is enough ambiguity and there is good enough reasons why we would assume Congress meant the ordinary rule."
2011.11-88,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1549.221,1550.023,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-88,1,34416,laura_g_ferguson,,1556.927,1559.713,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-88,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1612.179,1616.982,Mr. -- Mr. Fisher ended by saying there's no reason Congress would draw this line.
2011.11-88,1,34416,laura_g_ferguson,,1625.588,1636.144,Congress was proceeding very cautiously and incrementally in enacting a statute with extraordinary territorial reach over executive branch opposition.
2011.11-88,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1649.871,1652.823,But the Chief Justice's question was why did Congress do that?
2011.11-88,1,34416,laura_g_ferguson,,1656.375,1687.912,"Congress was focused very much on the Filartiga case, where the Second Circuit had found that there was a norm prohibiting public officials from engaging in torture or extrajudicial killing; and Congress wanted to avoid the scenario where you have a torturer who comes to our shores; and Congress agreed with the Second Circuit in Filartiga that if the torturer comes here, he should not be able to escape accountability from his victim."
2011.11-88,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1717.015,1718.731,I don't understand that.
2011.11-88,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1718.731,1736.91,"How many judgments under -- I don't know whether it's Filartiga or Fabrigas -- that that pattern, where the individual torturer is found in a U.S. jurisdiction?"
2011.11-88,1,34416,laura_g_ferguson,,1736.91,1738.944,There have--
2011.11-88,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1738.944,1742.063,There have been many judgments; how many have collected?
2011.11-88,1,34416,laura_g_ferguson,,1742.063,1746.95,--Petitioners have identified--
2011.11-88,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1764.996,1773.452,"If Congress really wanted to have this, why wouldn't it include entity liability?"
2011.11-88,1,34416,laura_g_ferguson,,1780.021,1800.366,"The -- the situation Congress had in mind in enacting the TVPA was adjusting the norm against State-sponsored torture and extrajudicial killing, where the agent is -- is almost invariably acting on behalf of the State, and yet it didn't create an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to State sponsors of torture and extrajudicial killing."
2011.11-88,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1811.156,1814.758,Wouldn't that be the point that the immigration law takes care of it?
2011.11-88,1,34416,laura_g_ferguson,,1817.627,1822.448,The immigration laws were not as robust in 1991 as they perhaps are now.
2011.11-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1832.654,1836.874,But I'm not sure that the immigration officials conduct a thorough investigation.
2011.11-88,1,34416,laura_g_ferguson,,1845.396,1850.365,"--It's not a -- it's not a perfect screen, because of course, torturers don't announce themselves at the border as torturers."
2011.11-88,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1863.525,1870.095,I still don't understand your explanation of the reason why Congress would draw a distinction between an individual and an organization.
2011.11-88,1,34416,laura_g_ferguson,,1877.183,1882.087,The organization that Congress had foremost in mind was the State.
2011.11-88,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1917.843,1932.585,"So it's okay to keep out individuals who subject others to torture, but corporations, we want their money so they should invest here, because we're going to protect them from liability for people that they torture?"
2011.11-88,1,34416,laura_g_ferguson,,1932.585,1947.362,"--I think -- I think the question is whether there is a plausible reason why Congress would have taken this incremental approach, and focused first on those personally responsible versus extending liability more broadly under secondary liability theories."
2011.11-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1966.325,1969.46,"You don't have to prove it's an intelligent statute, could you?"
2011.11-88,1,34416,laura_g_ferguson,,1974.362,1975.114,It could be clearer--
2011.11-88,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1975.114,1977.164,Is it possible that it -- it's a stupid statute?
2011.11-88,1,34416,laura_g_ferguson,,1977.164,1977.8,--Yes.
2011.11-88,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1979.583,1981.002,It's also possible that it's not a stupid statute.
2011.11-88,1,34416,laura_g_ferguson,,2031.649,2063.42,"--I think that even the human rights supporters who were strong advocates of getting this legislation enacted understood that this was an incremental approach, that where there was some certainty within international law within this area of official torture carried out by public officials under color of State law, and it provided a cause of action for this Filartiga scenario, and even the human rights supporters understood that it was important to proceed cautiously and incrementally."
2011.11-88,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2081.715,2092.44,"But Miss Ferguson, your story makes it sound as though everybody was really focused on this question, and made a determination to proceed incrementally and not to include foreign nations."
2011.11-88,1,34416,laura_g_ferguson,,2112.253,2125.494,"Well, Representative Yaton was the sponsor of both the bill that was marked up where ""person"" was changed to ""individual"", and was also the sponsor of the bill that was ultimately enacted."
2011.11-88,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2314.181,2315.7,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-88,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2330.192,2332.409,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-88,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2352.806,2364.514,"Mr. Gannon, suppose two people are tortured, and one is an alien who has never been within 10,000 miles of the United States, and the other is a U.S. citizen."
2011.11-88,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2370.934,2374.135,The position of the United States is that the alien may be able to sue.
2011.11-88,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2420.78,2424.401,"No, but two victims of torture, you don't find that to be an incongruous result?"
2011.11-88,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2424.401,2433.34,"--Well, I think that is ultimately going to depend on what happens under this Court's ATS jurisprudence, and so it does seem that the Court--"
2011.11-88,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2433.34,2437.142,"I'm asking about your position, the position of the United States."
2011.11-88,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2437.142,2453.602,"--The position of the United States in the other case today is that the ATS does not include a categorical bar on corporate liability; and that -- that has no regard for the theory of liability, the locus of the acts, the citizenship of the parties and the character of the international law norm at issue."
2011.11-88,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2453.602,2455.87,But Mr. Rahim had never been naturalized.
2011.11-88,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2456.872,2477.869,"Well, in -- in this instance, then that would present a different question that this Court has not yet been presented with under the ATS, and ultimately, maybe an alien will be able to bring a suit under the ATS that he can't bring -- that a U.S. citizen could not bring under the TVPA, but that is a product of the fact that there are still two different statutes."
2011.11-88,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2486.559,2488.592,So what's the good reason--
2011.11-88,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2488.592,2489.861,"Well, I--"
2011.11-88,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2489.861,2500.0,"--for the U.S. to have limited liability to natural persons in the TVPA, but not in the ATS context?"
2011.11-88,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2500.0,2513.057,"--Well, I think that there are several reasons that Congress could have had in mind, although I think that if you read the legislative record, that Justice Kagan is probably correct, that most members of the Congress weren't thinking precisely about this question."
2011.11-88,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2534.723,2540.044,"But they were thinking about that in 1797, I mean -- you are saying in the later statute--"
2011.11-88,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2540.044,2540.91,"No, I think that in--"
2011.11-88,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2540.91,2545.196,--A more perceptive Congress in -- in 1797?
2011.11-88,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2545.196,2550.833,"--No, I think the difference is that the ATS has not even attempted to speak to this question, whereas the TVPA does."
2011.11-88,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2571.429,2572.296,That's why they are thinking of it.
2011.11-88,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2589.875,2590.743,--It's true.
2011.11-88,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2590.743,2596.546,"And if in fact it does fall under color of law there, they don't care about whether it's individual or person."
2011.11-88,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2598.263,2599.248,But the fact--
2011.11-88,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2599.248,2602.717,"The only one who thought about it was Congressman Leach, and that was four bills earlier."
2011.11-88,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2603.717,2613.256,"--No, but the reason they are not thinking about it is because the paradigm they were thinking about was the torturer who is found in the United States who is -- who is walking on the streets."
2011.11-88,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2794.84,2795.925,"Thank you, Mr. Gannon."
2011.11-88,3,30312,jeffrey_fisher,,2797.659,2802.179,"I can make four points, if I may, Your Honor."
2011.11-88,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3031.442,3032.975,"Thank you, counsel."
