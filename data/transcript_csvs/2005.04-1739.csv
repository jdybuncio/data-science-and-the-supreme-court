2005.04-1739,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,3.521,We'll hear argument next in Beard v. Banks.
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,6.376,15.117,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1739,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,74.921,76.348,"Mr. Rovelli, I... I forget."
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,79.286,81.064,--Less than 40.
2005.04-1739,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,81.064,82.141,Less than 40?
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,85.757,98.947,"Well, the duration of... of confinement at level 2 varies widely from one inmate to another because it is affected by their improvement."
2005.04-1739,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,98.947,101.969,But is there any average or any... is there... does the record tell us how... how long most of them have been there?
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,101.969,105.257,The record does not tell us how long most of them have been there.
2005.04-1739,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,120.619,122.213,Does that mean that 75 percent had not?
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,122.213,124.224,"At that time, yes."
2005.04-1739,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,124.224,129.183,And how long... do we know what the average period of incarceration in level 2 is?
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,131.704,136.664,"Well, realistically it's in between."
2005.04-1739,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,145.478,156.414,"I'm trying to understand whether typically they're there for a long period of time on the one hand, or are they there sort of on probation and are periodically reviewed and moved into another system?"
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,156.414,160.113,--They're... they're moved when their behavior improves.
2005.04-1739,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,165.139,165.939,I see.
2005.04-1739,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,165.939,171.525,"Were there any prisoners, since the inception to your program, that have been in there for the whole 2 years?"
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,171.525,174.297,Through today?
2005.04-1739,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,177.318,177.818,Yes.
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,177.818,179.329,Until the 2-year point.
2005.04-1739,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,183.872,201.844,"Are... do... is... is Pennsylvania alone or nearly alone in imposing this rule, or is this typical of the restraints imposed in... in this maximum restrictive confinement?"
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,201.844,213.191,There's a wide variation of privilege grants and withdrawals even at the highest levels of security.
2005.04-1739,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,235.779,243.176,Is this one of the most severe restrictions in the Nation with respect to reading material and photographs?
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,243.176,245.021,I'm sure that it is.
2005.04-1739,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,245.021,263.587,What is the reason that... that the State or the regulations allow paperbacks from the library and not current events?
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,270.984,275.933,"Well, there's... there is certainly a security component to it."
2005.04-1739,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.427,297.782,Can we explain that?
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,305.319,314.411,"Actually inmates, particularly the worst of the worst, are quite clever at using newspapers."
2005.04-1739,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,324.746,325.746,But you--
2005.04-1739,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,325.746,330.622,But a paperback version of War and Peace is less dangerous?
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,332.976,346.417,"The experience of prison officials is that, yes, it is, and... and actually it's very common in prison systems to distinguish, for example, between hardback books and paperbacks."
2005.04-1739,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,356.759,368.355,"--But if the concern is the safety concern, then you would have an equal concern with the Jewish Daily Forward, which is a newspaper format, or... and I don't know what the Watchtower comes out in these days."
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,368.355,369.005,Yes.
2005.04-1739,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,404.56,416.724,"--Well, that's why I thought your answer would have focused on that rather than the security concerns, is that you take away what it is they want the most because that's most likely to result in them conforming their behavior so they can get it back."
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,416.724,422.683,"Yes, and that is... is the primary purpose of the policy overall, and--"
2005.04-1739,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,422.683,425.715,So why... let's see.
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,434.957,435.39,--Actually--
2005.04-1739,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,435.39,437.051,One... one visit per month.
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,439.49,444.205,--Inmates at level 2 are not permitted to go to the prison library.
2005.04-1739,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,444.205,445.282,It's ordered.
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,445.282,447.804,They can order books from the library.
2005.04-1739,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,454.94,463.348,"Yes, what it says... that's what... it says, to review legal materials, one at a time may be let out of his cell and is escorted to a mini law library in hand."
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,480.227,482.665,Having--
2005.04-1739,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,482.665,484.342,Is there a security reason or is--
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,484.342,485.853,--There's definitely a security reason.
2005.04-1739,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,485.853,492.49,"--Is there a security reason when he's there in leg irons looking at the books, the law books, in the mini law library?"
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,492.49,512.484,"Allowing the... the inmate to request to go to the mini law library for an additional purpose or for a separate purpose to read periodicals puts increased demand on going there, and moving these inmates is a... a very demanding operation."
2005.04-1739,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,523.153,532.311,What does the... what does the inmate have to show in order to go to the law library?
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,555.926,556.37,Yes.
2005.04-1739,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,565.412,579.103,"Well, that would mean that the inmate could go and look at the legal newspapers, but not... not the Christian Science Monitor."
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,579.103,591.449,"--The Christian Science Monitor is not available to him in the... in the mini law library, and... and actually, if he wanted to subscribe, he could receive a... a legal periodical in his cell."
2005.04-1739,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,591.449,596.825,"So he could get Law Week, Legal Times, and--"
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,596.825,597.491,Subject--
2005.04-1739,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,597.491,598.252,--the National Law Journal.
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,599.597,607.078,"--Subject to the content restriction of religious and legal materials that would fit in one property box, he may."
2005.04-1739,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,607.078,619.257,"Now, on... on your theory of... of behavior modification, would it, nonetheless, be... be open to the State to say, no, you may not receive any more legal materials and you may not go to the library to look at them?"
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,634.542,635.059,Yes.
2005.04-1739,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,658.158,668.482,"Well, what would... I mean, you know, one of the arguments made on the other side is that if you accept the behavior modification theory as an adequate justification, the Turner categories essentially become incoherent."
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,698.979,719.14,"The inmate would still have unlimited access to counsel visits and can still visit the mini law library and do his own legal research, even if he's not allowed to subscribe to or... or keep legal materials, legal periodicals in his own cell."
2005.04-1739,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,719.14,727.287,"What if the... what if the inmate said, look, the... the lawyers who come to see us are... are great guys, but they're... they're overworked."
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,737.613,751.48,Ultimately any prisoner is... is free to challenge the adequacy of his ability to access the courts in a... in an as applied challenge to his own conditions.
2005.04-1739,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,751.48,757.456,"So you're... you're saying there... there's a separate value here, and that is the value of access to courts."
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,763.315,765.253,Definitely.
2005.04-1739,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,765.253,765.637,All right.
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,807.503,836.988,"Well, the marriage ban, Justice Souter, of course, is subject to Turner analysis as well, and I think that where Turner might bring up short a ban on marriage for these high security inmates is in the... the logical connection to the rehabilitative purpose in that there being so few inmates and marriage is going to be such an infrequent occasion, it's hard to see the marriage ban as influencing level 2 inmates generally to improve their behavior."
2005.04-1739,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,836.988,840.437,So you're saying there just is not a logical connection there within--
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,840.437,840.837,Yes.
2005.04-1739,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,840.837,841.531,--the meaning of the... of the case?
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,841.531,842.958,That... yes.
2005.04-1739,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,842.958,846.663,But there would be a logical connection for those who want to get married.
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,846.663,852.283,That... that implicates--
2005.04-1739,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,852.283,855.554,You're... you're saying it might not makes sense as a systemic policy--
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,855.554,856.004,--Yes.
2005.04-1739,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,856.004,856.648,--because it isn't a big enough problem.
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,866.474,881.424,"Well, you could say that about all... probably a range of things if you went so far as to query each inmate as to what it is that they value most or what it is they're most interested in doing--"
2005.04-1739,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,881.424,885.206,"You can, and on... on your analysis, why isn't that sufficient?"
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,885.206,896.226,--It would be an interesting program and I would defend it that you could query inmates on what is most valuable and then deprive them of it subject to--
2005.04-1739,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,896.226,898.897,"Okay, but how do we get around the marriage case then?"
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,898.897,910.993,"--Well, I... I don't think we need to get around the marriage case in the sense that, particularly as to high security inmates, prison officials have very wide discretion to fashion policies that serve the goals."
2005.04-1739,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,913.765,916.88,"So as to these, the... the marriage could be banned, in effect, you're saying."
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,916.88,936.28,"--It could be banned, but I do think that it would be subject to a... a pointed challenge on the logical connection, but in theory, it's... it is one of the instruments... a privilege that could be withdrawn for behavior modification purposes."
2005.04-1739,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,973.247,983.838,"But I thought there, there was a genuine security concern, which I think you pretty much said doesn't exist here when you consider what they can have in... in the cell."
2005.04-1739,0,34996,louis_j_rovelli,,983.838,992.897,"I think that... that in both Overton and this case, there were both behavior modification and security concerns."
2005.04-1739,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1075.3,1076.56,"Thank you, Mr. Rovelli."
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1089.335,1091.345,Thank you.
2005.04-1739,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1106.129,1107.734,Where do you draw the line?
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1123.369,1124.946,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1739,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1160.569,1168.799,But don't we... don't we have the same problem if we're... if we're dealing with First Amendment interests that we do when we're dealing with Eighth Amendment interests?
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1201.984,1208.026,"--Well, I... I think... I mean, I think there is... I don't think it's a boundless theory."
2005.04-1739,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1221.467,1222.395,"Oh, oh, I... I realize that."
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1269.769,1270.696,--But--
2005.04-1739,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1270.696,1273.218,And if that's what... I'll... I'll be quiet in a second.
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1288.686,1290.524,"--I... I don't think so, Justice Souter."
2005.04-1739,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1321.937,1325.552,"So... so but at some point, there's sort of a reasonableness limit then you're saying."
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1325.552,1327.146,"--There is a reasonableness limit, and we've... we've--"
2005.04-1739,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.146,1333.106,"Do... do you concede that just because a right is enumerated, it means it cannot be entirely taken away in prison?"
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1333.106,1333.866,--No.
2005.04-1739,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1334.483,1335.71,"I mean, like, you know, try the right to bear arms."
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1336.471,1337.021,--That's right.
2005.04-1739,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1361.925,1371.833,"Apart from those two, access to the courts and cruel and unusual punishment, then anything goes for this set of incorrigible prisoners?"
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1380.825,1390.9,"Well, I think it would be... Justice Ginsburg, I think it would be a rare case where an incentive program like this could be struck down as a... you know, as a facial matter, as... as this challenge is."
2005.04-1739,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1406.694,1412.238,"--But... but for this... for this group, while they're in that situation, essentially there's no First Amendment rights."
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1423.584,1433.909,"--Well, we do think that... that the State can go... can go quite far with respect to restricting First Amendment rights, but this Court still... I mean, under prong two, this Court does look to alternative means to exercise the right."
2005.04-1739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1448.21,1452.242,"Mr. Marcus, I was kind of interested in your calling this an incentive program."
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1457.102,1458.118,"--Oh, not at all."
2005.04-1739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1466.666,1469.02,"No, I mean, with respect to the prisoners in this population."
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1469.02,1481.023,"--There are incentive programs within each of those restricted units, and... and the prisoners that end up at the LTSU... the vast majority of them have already been through the SMU program and haven't made it and have failed that program."
2005.04-1739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.149,1493.796,"Well, I didn't understand that the... the prisoners in this particular part of the prison had any intermediate incentive."
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1500.183,1501.86,"Right, and that depends on their behavior."
2005.04-1739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1501.86,1502.46,There's no scoring.
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1506.82,1507.22,Well--
2005.04-1739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.22,1508.581,--not like most incentive programs I've heard about.
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1508.581,1512.863,"--Justice Stevens, they get a review after 90 days and then every 30 days thereafter."
2005.04-1739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1515.468,1519.666,And... and does the review correlate it in any way with these particular deprivations?
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1525.886,1536.805,"Well, the... the review correlates with their behavior, and to the extent they show a positive adjustment in their behavior, their... they graduate from level 2 to level 1 where they do have access to newspapers and magazines and then they can graduate all the way out."
2005.04-1739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1547.641,1555.455,Is there any evidence at all that the amount of reading that they do has any correlation to their opportunity for getting better assignments?
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1555.455,1559.321,--While they're in the LTSU?
2005.04-1739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.321,1559.687,Yes.
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1567.635,1569.645,"No, I don't think any such study is done."
2005.04-1739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1578.721,1585.108,So the legal issues would be precisely the same if the State denied totally any reading material to the prisoners.
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1586.118,1589.723,"Well, it would be a more difficult case to defend under the second--"
2005.04-1739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1589.723,1590.484,Why would it be more difficult?
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1590.484,1593.172,"--under the second prong of Turner because under the second prong of Turner, you look to alternative means."
2005.04-1739,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.916,1622.407,"I understood your argument to, in effect, contend that the behavior modification rationale will justify the program no matter what the balancing process is."
2005.04-1739,1,32074,jonathan_l_marcus,,1622.407,1624.085,"--No, that's... that's not our position."
2005.04-1739,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1649.872,1651.632,"Thank you, Mr. Marcus."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,1651.632,1657.852,Mr. Chief Justice--
2005.04-1739,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1657.852,1658.269,Mr. Krakoff.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,1658.269,1659.957,--may it please the Court--
2005.04-1739,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1759.999,1763.866,"Well... well, it seems to me that that's an as applied challenge."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,1782.515,1807.885,"I was... I was simply trying to point out... the... the Court had asked how long are inmates generally in the Long Term Segregation Unit, and... and the point that I made is that it's not unusual for inmates to remain on level 2 for periods in excess of 1 year."
2005.04-1739,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1807.885,1815.605,"Mr. Krakoff, what... I take it you wouldn't have any objection to terminating of television rights, for example."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,1821.159,1822.753,That is correct.
2005.04-1739,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1873.649,1878.525,What other alternatives would you have the prison administrators rely on?
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,1886.972,1887.85,--Okay.
2005.04-1739,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1900.863,1901.224,I'm sorry.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,1914.814,1930.532,"--Well, what their... their argument is essentially that this policy was basically a decision by default, not a decision that was reasoned by prison administrators."
2005.04-1739,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1936.736,1937.996,"Right, and I want you to tell me--"
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,1937.996,1939.09,And we have nothing left to take away.
2005.04-1739,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1939.09,1941.184,--I would like you to tell me what else they should have done.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,1942.528,1970.17,"It's wrong because there is no logical connection to taking something away under the facts of this case when taking away an entire litany of... or a very broad spectrum of things which... in the special management units, where these inmates came from, they had had magazines taken away on their first phase in the special management units."
2005.04-1739,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2007.725,2008.819,And none of that worked.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2009.48,2010.097,Absolutely.
2005.04-1739,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2022.588,2028.297,"So your answer to my question is there's nothing else they could have done, but they shouldn't have done this because this wasn't going to work either."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2028.297,2035.1,--My answer is that you can't deprive an inmate of his constitutional right of free speech--
2005.04-1739,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2035.1,2036.444,"No, but consistent--"
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2036.444,2037.261,--unless there's reason to do so.
2005.04-1739,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2037.261,2046.686,"--Consistently with your answer, it seems to me, you have to say they should give the TV back, they should give the magazines back because none of those worked either."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2049.801,2055.428,What they've done here is they've removed all of the vehicles to--
2005.04-1739,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2055.428,2055.895,No.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2064.835,2065.235,--That's right.
2005.04-1739,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2065.235,2077.099,"And if... if there is no efficacy and there is an infringement of what, at least for people on the outside, would be a protected right, then they have no justification for taking those rights away."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2088.696,2093.143,May I answer it this way?
2005.04-1739,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2097.343,2098.937,"I sure would like that, but--"
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2099.448,2101.458,I'll say no.
2005.04-1739,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2105.074,2105.557,But then why?
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2106.168,2114.648,--I've been reading Turner v. Safley and then more recently Overton because this is basic in my practice to represent prisoners.
2005.04-1739,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2134.809,2135.57,Right.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2143.373,2144.151,I think--
2005.04-1739,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2144.151,2148.749,"Why then do they not, on your theory, have to give TV and magazines back?"
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2148.749,2159.502,--I... I think that an institution can always make judgments about how extensive they want to allow inmates to--
2005.04-1739,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2159.502,2160.18,All right.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2180.673,2181.073,--No.
2005.04-1739,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2216.896,2223.183,"But... but... the whole rationale of your case... if I were you writing your brief, I would have this problem."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2236.79,2237.59,I've had other--
2005.04-1739,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2237.59,2242.749,And... and it seems to me it's the heart of your case and that it surfaces here in the answers you've attempted to give.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2242.749,2249.387,"--Obviously, this... this did matter enough to the prisoners to commence a lawsuit."
2005.04-1739,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2265.698,2274.339,"Well, but the whole basis of the suit is that it matters to the prisoner, and that's exactly why it's been taken away because there's nothing else left that we can do with these prisoners."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2274.339,2275.85,--But I see a distinction.
2005.04-1739,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2289.374,2291.479,What about changing other people's behavior?
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2321.215,2331.539,--They made the argument that this is part of an overarching deterrent program.
2005.04-1739,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2331.539,2332.55,"Well, I think it is."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2332.55,2358.42,"Well, but if you look... Justice Scalia, if... if one looks at the record carefully, you see that this policy which, by the way, applies to 40 inmates in one particular institution in a... in a prison system that has 23 adult institutions for men, that this policy is essentially a classified policy."
2005.04-1739,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2424.11,2435.957,"So let's say if... if the flaw is it doesn't deter other people because they don't know about it, then if they... if they broadcast it all over so everyone knows about it, then it's okay?"
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2435.957,2452.852,"--Well, I say that in order to make a deterrence argument, at least an argument that makes sense to me, that in order to deter somebody from doing something, they have to know about that policy and they have to know what the consequences are."
2005.04-1739,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2471.486,2474.007,But is there other... are there other bases?
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2489.802,2504.587,"--Yes, and... and I... I do want to say... and I don't know how to say it more... more clearly... I understand it, but I'm obviously not framing this in a way that is getting my point across."
2005.04-1739,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2545.491,2546.085,"--No, no."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2559.015,2559.315,Security.
2005.04-1739,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2559.315,2561.453,"--Yes, and they made a big case in this."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2564.058,2564.558,Exactly.
2005.04-1739,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2564.558,2565.485,And they made a major point.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2590.689,2607.317,"Well, my... my... I suppose my most straightforward answer would be that the Jewish Forward can burn as quickly as the New York Times, that the Christian Science Monitor--"
2005.04-1739,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2607.317,2612.693,"Well, then now you're giving... now you're making their situation worse because they tried to make your client's situation better."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2633.865,2639.074,"--I think it's a realistic... with all due respect, I think it's a realistic response."
2005.04-1739,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2643.773,2661.59,"I thought you were using that to say that the security concern doesn't hold up because of the papers that they're allowed to have in their cells can be used similarly for fires, similarly to do other bad things."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2661.59,2662.006,Right.
2005.04-1739,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2662.006,2675.28,"So I thought that's why you were using that, just to say that the... the security concern is dubious because the materials that they are allowed to have in their cells can... could achieve exactly the same end."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2675.28,2686.949,"Well, there are other things, Justice Ginsburg, that are routinely permitted in... in the cells and, in fact, that probably have to be in the cells that can be used."
2005.04-1739,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2699.223,2702.661,Do you know what kind of a fire you can make with the Sunday New York Times?
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2711.075,2711.669,--Well--
2005.04-1739,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2711.669,2713.496,--it seems to me a perfectly reasonable line.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2713.496,2718.623,--The... but it's not only... it's not only writing paper.
2005.04-1739,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2725.51,2734.668,"So if visitors... if there's a security issue with visitors to the prisoner, you're saying you can't prohibit visitors because if you allow the lawyers to come in, because they're visitors too?"
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2734.668,2736.856,"No, I think that would be a specious argument."
2005.04-1739,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2736.856,2743.742,"Well, but it wouldn't undermine the security rationale just because you have some exceptions where there are other countervailing interests that might outweigh the security concern."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2743.742,2763.903,"But if, in fact, their suggestion is that... if their suggestion is that the inmates are less likely to burn a Bible, for example, and assuming they're... they're Christians rather than somebody else who has the Bible, they're less likely to burn a... the Bible or some book of scriptures, that makes sense."
2005.04-1739,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2797.921,2798.848,May I ask you--
2005.04-1739,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2798.848,2799.348,All right.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2804.474,2804.858,Right.
2005.04-1739,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2804.858,2819.426,"--the Court says we resolve, when a prison regulation impinges on an inmate's constitutional rights, which is does here, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2846.739,2850.522,I want you to read the entire brief--
2005.04-1739,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2850.522,2852.183,"Well, I'll read the briefs."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2853.527,2853.954,--No.
2005.04-1739,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2930.648,2933.502,--May I ask you this question?
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2933.502,2933.902,--Yes.
2005.04-1739,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2933.902,2942.066,You said that the prison grapevine really doesn't tell the prisoners about this particular lack of access to public materials.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2948.621,2952.403,"They're actually, Your Honor--"
2005.04-1739,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2952.403,2963.571,"If that is generally known, it would seem to me that that itself would be sufficient incentive to try and avoid this program, whether or not you're going to be able to read the Christian Science Monitor or the New York Times."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2981.228,2986.504,"--I agree with that point, obviously."
2005.04-1739,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2997.006,2999.277,"Of course, I could say the same thing about going to jail, I mean, at all."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,2999.277,3000.371,--Well--
2005.04-1739,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3000.371,3002.976,"You know, I could say whether I'm there 23 hours or all or not--"
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,3002.976,3003.442,--Yes.
2005.04-1739,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3003.442,3006.33,--it's enough of an incentive that I... that I don't want to go to jail.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,3009.019,3020.782,"Yes, but I suggest that... that living in a cage and exercising in a case in... in seclusion, that's... that's a prison within a prison."
2005.04-1739,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3025.164,3040.943,"And once you're in that situation already, as these prisoners are, and they're still not conforming their behavior to the prison rules, you have a limited number of options for trying to get them to do that, and your response to my first line of questioning was that there's nothing else you can think of that they could do."
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,3040.943,3046.319,"--At some point, the options expire."
2005.04-1739,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3067.923,3071.261,So your response is they should just grin and bear it.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,3072.105,3081.014,"My... my response is that they have taken so much away from these inmates who are the most incorrigible, recalcitrant inmates in the system."
2005.04-1739,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3094.027,3095.454,I... may I interrupt you--
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,3095.454,3095.887,--Yes.
2005.04-1739,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3095.887,3096.304,--with this question?
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,3122.074,3122.835,It isn't.
2005.04-1739,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3135.931,3140.046,"Oh, I know that wasn't... that wasn't the claim that you made, but isn't that the argument that you're making?"
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,3140.046,3141.39,No.
2005.04-1739,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3220.605,3225.481,But... but the State's position is that it wants to avoid that ultimate deterrent.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,3240.265,3242.193,"--Well, I... I--"
2005.04-1739,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3242.193,3248.33,And it seems to me that... that your... your argument is... is at cross ends with its own purpose.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,3248.33,3255.55,"--Well, it... unless there are other questions, I think I've reached--"
2005.04-1739,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.55,3259.504,Just let me just ask one... one thing I am curious about.
2005.04-1739,2,31233,jere_krakoff,,3280.826,3298.131,"--The... the rules themselves say kind of in a preamble that... that confinement is for a minimum of 90 days, but that often it's... it's longer than that--"
2005.04-1739,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3298.131,3300.325,I'm not posing what the rules say.
