2000.00-157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.441,"We'll hear argument now in Nunber 00-157, United Dominion Industries, Inc. v. United States."
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,9.756,14.596,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,169.317,189.791,"Is the theory of the statute that development of these products usually takes longer than a three year period, and that what we're just trying to do is allow the company to have its loss carry back apply to those years in which it was engaging in research?"
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,193.281,215.908,"--I think the legislative history suggests that there was some concern that product liability suits and the like took time to arise, and that a product might be sold in a particular year, generate income, and then it wouldn't be for many years before the product liability suit arose."
2000.00-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,248.11,258.968,"I suppose it doesn't help us much because if I told you, well, that makes it sound very corporation specific, you would say, well, so are all other net operating losses when they're calculated."
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,269.986,272.081,Well--
2000.00-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,272.081,275.686,"You want to make it a better argument, huh?"
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,275.686,279.98,"--Well, I'll try, Justice Kennedy, if I can."
2000.00-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,290.272,304.344,"Would you respond, Mr. Fox, to the claim that what you're arguing for is a double deduction, and would you tell me in the first instance something that maybe I should have gotten from the briefs, but I just couldn't find it."
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,340.975,341.295,No.
2000.00-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,364.845,365.383,"Well, then--"
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,365.383,365.823,--incontrovertible.
2000.00-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,365.823,376.351,"--why aren't you asking for that same subtraction, as it were, to have the further benefit for the affiliated group?"
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,376.351,410.054,"The reason is that when you... when a single corporation or an affiliated group has a net operating loss, the total amount of that loss has not produced any tax benefit because you have had deductions that exceed income, and, yes, you've deducted them in the sense that you subtracted them, but now you come up with a negative number, and that negative number, which is all we're talking about here... the net operating loss... that in and of itself does not produce a tax benefit."
2000.00-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,426.879,430.275,What we're arguing about here is whether you go back three years or ten years.
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,430.275,431.673,"--Exactly, Justice Scalia."
2000.00-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,469.375,470.895,Mr. Fox--
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,470.895,471.418,All we're doing is--
2000.00-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.418,478.243,--I understand that there's no dispute at all about the amount involved.
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,538.246,580.305,"--The regulations have a mechanism for dealing with corporations that join a group and provide that in the case of a net operating loss, if a member of the group contributes to the net operating loss by itself having a loss, and in the carry back year, be it three years or ten years earlier, it was not a member of the group, a portion of the overall net operating loss can be allocated to that company and carried to a separate return year outside of the consolidated return."
2000.00-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,582.364,583.638,Can be or must be?
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,583.638,584.453,--Must be.
2000.00-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.478,665.986,You say the same problem exists under the three year carry back?
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,665.986,680.673,"Exactly, because any deductions that this corporation has for product liability are going to find their way into the net operating loss that can be carried back three years, and that would be before it was a member of the group."
2000.00-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,680.673,695.019,"Is this right... and tell me, if it's wrong, I'm not going to pursue it... but it seems to me the theory of this thing is that we have a company called Company A, and Company A has, let's say, a loss of two dollars over the year."
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,733.174,736.014,"Well, I would agree with you, but I think--"
2000.00-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,736.014,738.036,Is that what you... that's what you're reading in the statute--
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,738.036,738.153,--Yes.
2000.00-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,738.153,738.34,--All right.
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,774.223,783.673,"Theoretically, yes, Justice Breyer, but I think that is a... that the example which comes from the Respondent's brief is a very far fetched example."
2000.00-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,818.123,818.538,Okay.
2000.00-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.538,825.816,"But for that matter, it would apply within the three year period if it's just seeking a three year carry back, no?"
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,833.664,836.345,Well--
2000.00-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,836.345,845.104,Can't you purchase somebody with losses that will enable you to carry back what you otherwise wouldn't be able to carry back three years?
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,845.104,847.41,--That may not--
2000.00-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,847.41,850.403,"No, but then you're purchasing somebody with profits in Justice Breyer's example."
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,850.403,859.311,"--Might not work that way because if, first of all, if they were separately profitable, then they wouldn't be contributing any losses."
2000.00-157,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,873.651,884.379,Does Treasury Regulation 79(a) bear on the extent to which Justice Breyer's example could be calculated?
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,884.379,885.113,"Not really, not really."
2000.00-157,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,888.812,895.273,To what extent do we owe deference to the Government's position in this case?
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,895.273,898.678,I would say you owe no deference whatsoever.
2000.00-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,938.674,945.399,But would the Government have the authority to promulgate a regulation which reaches the result that the Chief seeks to reach here--
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,945.399,946.088,I believe it would.
2000.00-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,947.505,956.819,"--So, so then it follows from that, that the Government's position is consistent with the statute, if that's true."
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,956.819,960.014,"No, I think it is not consistent with the statute, Justice Kennedy."
2000.00-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,960.529,963.136,They can promulgate a regulation that's inconsistent with the statute?
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,963.136,975.132,"They could promulgate a regulation that would be consistent with this statute but their position, given the regulations as they exist today, is inconsistent with the statute, and I will tell you why."
2000.00-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1070.825,1076.429,"Mr. Fox, did the Government take the same position in the court of appeals that it takes here?"
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,1080.673,1098.608,"I'm a little confused as to what position the Government is taking in this case, but in the court of appeals they basically argued that the net operating loss you should look at was the negative or positive separate taxable income of a company."
2000.00-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1141.905,1144.181,"Where did they find it, Mr. Fox?"
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,1144.181,1148.152,"Justice Ginsburg, they found it in the regulation 79."
2000.00-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1148.152,1149.942,"I know, but had it been argued?"
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,1160.143,1176.733,"I don't recall it being in the Government's brief but the Government from time to time has put out technical advice memoranda and the like, and that argument had been raised by the Government, but I do not recall them arguing it specifically in the Fourth Circuit."
2000.00-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1176.733,1189.838,"If you lose, do we create any anomaly, or is there some... what I'm thinking of is that you have... the Government has, it seems to me, going for it the fact the language is pretty ambiguous."
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,1215.985,1234.773,"Well, I think from a policy standpoint if you go back and look at the 1918 legislative history, that certainly when Congress brought the consolidated return into being, they thought of the affiliated group as one single business."
2000.00-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1306.005,1307.633,"May I ask you a question, Mr. Fox?"
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,1335.232,1340.646,"If that corporation were a stand alone corporation, I would say yes it is."
2000.00-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.811,1373.967,Except... except in the case where you have a company that's acquired between three and ten years.
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,1408.174,1424.098,"It is theoretically possible, but I would say that if that highly unlikely scenario... I mean, you might have to face up to the possibility of going out and buying a tobacco company and you think, well, it'll throw off some product liability deductions, but you have no idea the extent of that."
2000.00-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1428.362,1435.62,"But Mr. Fox, isn't that the point of the Government's... the note it makes on page 41?"
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,1469.414,1475.59,"Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, that that is not really a function of consolidated returns."
2000.00-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1538.979,1552.164,Is your underlying rationale... and Justice Breyer asked you about policy questions... that there's really no reason to treat this affiliated group any differently than you would treat one corporation that had separate divisions?
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,1552.164,1554.609,"Yes, I think that is exactly the case."
2000.00-157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1674.482,1674.644,"Very well, Mr. Fox."
2000.00-157,0,22259,eric_r_fox,,1674.644,1675.223,Thank you.
2000.00-157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1675.223,1676.643,"Mr. Jones, we'll hear from you."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1676.643,1681.922,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-157,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1719.979,1721.146,"Mr. Jones, can I just ask one preliminary question?"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1728.289,1734.561,"Well, the taxpayer in the 172 context is plainly the individual corporation."
2000.00-157,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1739.983,1741.212,And each of the corporations--
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1741.212,1741.332,The only--
2000.00-157,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1741.332,1742.874,--is a taxpayer in your view?
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1742.874,1744.885,--Each of these corporations is a taxpayer.
2000.00-157,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1744.885,1746.361,Did they each file a return?
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1746.361,1756.276,The only way that they avoid filing a separate return is by electing under 1.1502 to file a consolidated return.
2000.00-157,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1763.116,1764.247,How many checks does the--
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1764.247,1764.356,--separate taxpayers.
2000.00-157,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1764.356,1769.204,"--when they file that return, how many people... how many different corporations give the Government money?"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1769.204,1772.516,"Well, each of them is severally liable, and so the answer--"
2000.00-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.516,1775.747,"The question is how many give them money, not whether they--"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1775.747,1776.242,"--Well, I don't know."
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1789.497,1790.498,--For the whole tax?
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1790.498,1790.831,"--Yes, sir."
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.831,1797.279,"I mean, you can get the whole thing out of any one of them, not just the aliquot portion attributable to that one."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1797.279,1797.454,That's correct.
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.361,1800.44,And indeed you wouldn't know what the aliquot portion would be.
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1807.339,1818.787,"--Well, that's... that's really... the entire thrust of their argument is that if you start in a consolidated... from a... let me answer the question with a little bit of background."
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1875.357,1880.956,"Before you go further, aren't there some exceptions from normal--"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1880.956,1881.093,--Yes.
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1881.093,1882.489,"--I mean, capital--"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1882.489,1884.967,There are some exceptions of items--
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1884.967,1885.902,--Charitable deductions?
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1887.881,1894.747,"--That's right, that under the regulations are treated as consolidated items and aren't part of the calculation of separate taxable income."
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.747,1901.229,So you can never really come up with a really genuine picture of what the individual--
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1901.229,1901.618,You don't--
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.618,1905.168,"--net operating loss, if there were such a thing, was."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1905.168,1908.624,--The term separate taxable income is not a perfect equivalent.
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1971.964,1973.478,You just used the term consolidated taxpayer--
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1973.478,1975.075,A consolidated return.
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1984.375,2001.821,"--Mr. Jones, your position that you're now announcing has been rejected, the position that you're taking on brief here is rejected by the Fourth Circuit, and they made it very clear that they weren't buying that, and they had an alternate position."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2038.717,2050.592,"I think that the Service has taken a consistent position in litigation, and as far as what happened in the negotiations between the parties, I mean, it's often the case that people try to work things out."
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2054.552,2066.518,"Well then in litigation, since the Fourth Circuit clearly rejected the position that you are pressing on brief, what is the consistent position that you're taking on litigation?"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2070.409,2086.399,"The consistent position that we're taking is that separate taxable income is a workable rule that applies in this context, and that's the point I was about to make which is that Section 1502 of the regs... I'm sorry, of the statute... doesn't tell the Secretary adopt rules that are perfectly equal."
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2090.422,2097.213,"Mr. Jones, I'm sorry to interrupt on this point again, but as I understand it that isn't the rationale that the Fourth Circuit went on."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2097.213,2100.337,--That's not the Fourth... the Fourth Circuit had a different perspective.
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2103.304,2108.758,"What I'm asking you first is, has the Government ever taken the position that the Fourth Circuit adopted?"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2108.758,2113.126,It's a complicated... the answer to that is very complicated.
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2137.215,2143.29,"But the Fourth Circuit, as I understand it, was not relying on the regulation that relates to separate return years."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2144.625,2146.302,They were--
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2146.302,2146.615,"--Yeah, they were."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2147.434,2147.558,--That's correct.
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2147.962,2153.006,But they weren't doing it in the limited sense of a separate return year.
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2158.005,2158.28,They were saying this is a rule--
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2158.28,2163.322,"--label separate return year, and they were saying, well, we could use this methodology across the board."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2164.212,2169.346,--They were saying this is an... I think what they were saying is this is an appropriate rule to apply by analogy.
2000.00-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2212.14,2215.754,"What resolution is that, and what reg is that?"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2219.185,2219.448,"Yes, sir."
2000.00-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2230.988,2239.616,But this is not the same thing as was pointed out in questions before as the thing you're analogizing it to.
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2242.235,2254.732,"The decision of the court of appeals said that the rationale of the reg 79 rule is a workable rule that would make sense if such a situation ever arose, and we don't disagree with that."
2000.00-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2276.896,2285.531,"But your colleague disputes, and the court of appeals happen to agree, that your reliance on 1502-12 simply solves this."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2285.531,2290.503,I'm not... I'm not sure what you mean.
2000.00-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2290.503,2296.398,"Well, you said this is control... as I understand your answer, this is controlled by 1502-12."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2296.398,2301.79,"No, Section 1502 gives us the authority to adopt reg 12."
2000.00-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2303.98,2303.98,Well--
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2303.98,2305.33,And Reg 12--
2000.00-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2305.33,2306.092,--Which is... which is--
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2306.092,2306.785,--provides a workable rule--
2000.00-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2306.785,2309.107,--Which defines separate taxable income.
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2309.107,2309.628,"--Yes, sir."
2000.00-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2309.628,2316.543,"But your opponent says that is not controlling, and the courts of appeals have not agreed with you on that."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2316.543,2323.474,"Well, if the... if the opponent agreed with us, we wouldn't of course be here."
2000.00-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2323.474,2325.764,But how about the courts of appeals?
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2325.764,2329.181,"We've won this in some courts, we've lost it in other courts."
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2337.802,2339.034,But the Fourth Circuit did--
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2339.034,2340.128,--We're saying that the analysis of the Fourth--
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2340.128,2347.793,"--Mr. Jones, the Fourth Circuit did explicitly disagree with your 1.1502-12 position that you--"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2347.793,2350.671,"--Yes, the Fourth Circuit thought that the rules were perfectly equivalent."
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2350.671,2360.212,--And it said... it said right in the... it's in 18A of the appendix to the cert petition that that was an incorrect position.
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2373.247,2395.292,"I have not argued... I have not suggested to the contrary, and what I've said is that what we... we agree with the Fourth Circuit that if a situation ever arose where this hypothetical distinction between separate taxable income and separate net operating loss ever came up, which it never has, the rule adopted by the Fourth Circuit might well be sensible."
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2395.292,2397.016,"Well, may I put this question to you, Mr. Jones?"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2417.096,2420.16,It is a proper resolution of this case.
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2444.716,2470.667,"--But if you don't... if we agree with the Fourth Circuit that the position you're taking is incorrect, so that's out of the picture... we're not going to just assume that we agree with the Fourth Circuit and the Sixth Circuit... there's no split on that, and then so we have to look for an alternative if we're going to use... and rule in your favor, and I'm asking you is the one that the Fourth Circuit took, the one that the Government would urge."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2470.667,2486.057,"--It is... it is the resolution of this case that we think is appropriate on the facts... on the hypothetical facts that the court used in fashioning that rule, but I would simply repeat myself in saying that it's up to the Secretary to fashion these legislative rules."
2000.00-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2486.057,2493.393,"All right, that's... accepting that, and you just point this out to me where I didn't know that the regs actually determined this."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2512.318,2513.198,"Yes, there is."
2000.00-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2513.198,2513.608,Which one?
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2513.608,2524.524,"Well, what it is is, it's the process of the calculations required by the regulations, and that is that you've deducted... you've taken the deduction of the product liability expenses at the separate affiliate level--"
2000.00-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2524.524,2525.018,Yes.
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2525.018,2527.974,"--They have not had losses, they have had profits."
2000.00-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2546.956,2549.54,And now the wording gets you there in the calculation.
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2553.498,2565.09,"The wording that controls this is the wording of Section 12 of the reg that says in determining the... separate income of each affiliate, the first thing you do is you apply the rules that govern the determination of income--"
2000.00-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2565.09,2565.23,Okay.
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2566.669,2567.157,--Okay.
2000.00-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2567.157,2577.14,"If I should, when I go through it, figure out that their reading is possible, then is there some good reading... reason why they aren't right?"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2587.575,2600.871,"Well, it's because Congress adopted in 172 a product liability loss... that provision which is not a subset of losses, it's a subset of the losses incurred by the company that incur the product liability expenses."
2000.00-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2602.812,2605.944,But why couldn't you say that with reference to any operating loss?
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2609.584,2617.497,--Most of the Code doesn't turn the character of the allowance on the character of the expense.
2000.00-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2625.271,2628.232,But... I'm sorry... I didn't--
2000.00-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2628.232,2630.025,"--Well, except I think it does."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2644.082,2644.261,The only--
2000.00-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2644.261,2644.795,--your response.
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2646.237,2654.541,"--Well, I probably don't understand your question, because what I thought you were saying is what's special about product liability expenses that they should be locused... focused--"
2000.00-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2654.541,2660.072,"And your answer was that the expense has to be related to the reason for which it was incurred, and I say, well, that's true of any expense."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2660.072,2662.677,--It has to be related to the taxpayer that incurred it.
2000.00-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2666.896,2669.048,"Well, I suppose that's also true with all deductions."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2675.628,2688.126,"That's right, but if, in a consolidated context, if you consolidate somebody's profit and somebody else's loss, you get a consolidated loss, hypothetically, which ordinarily you get a three year carry back for."
2000.00-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2697.692,2710.937,"I agree, but the fact that an entity that incurred the expense is different from the entity taking it... presents the same problem as with any other deduction."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2710.937,2721.842,"--It doesn't present a problem unless they're trying to get this special carry back, and they only get the special carry back when this special type of deduction causes a loss for the company that incurred this deduction."
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.842,2726.412,"Mr. Jones, what is the principal purpose of Part 12 of the regs?"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2727.177,2728.56,The purpose--
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2728.56,2730.817,--It isn't designed specifically for this situation.
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2734.938,2748.906,"--It is a very important provision, because so many of the provisions of the Code, or... not maybe so many... but many of the provisions of the Code, the ability of a company to use them turns on the specific facts of that company."
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2784.959,2811.694,"And do you think that... what I find persuasive in the taxpayer's case here is the fact that net operating loss is only... it's not defined in the regs, it's only defined in the statute, and it is defined to... in a way that would only apply to the consolidated return and not in a way that could apply to the separate returns."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2811.694,2824.424,"Well, consolidated net operating loss is only defined in that way, but the operating losses of the individual entities are defined both in the separate taxable income context which can be negative, the regulations--"
2000.00-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2824.424,2825.25,"Yes, but isn't that the point?"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2832.022,2839.391,"--There is no question that the Secretary can adopt... could adopt a rule that did that, but let me point out what would happen then."
2000.00-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2909.954,2922.22,"Do you have authority under 269 to disallow losses if the company is acquired for purposes of tax avoidance, or would--"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2922.22,2925.668,I think the statute says for the principal purpose of avoiding taxes.
2000.00-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2925.668,2933.902,"--So if I went out to acquire a corporation just to take advantage of this loss, you could invoke 269?"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2933.902,2942.593,"I would... we would have to litigate whether we... we would have to establish that was your principal purpose, and I suspect you'd say, well, you had a legitimate business purpose."
2000.00-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2942.593,2944.512,"Well, I... that was the assumption of Justice Breyer's question."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2946.015,2948.43,"We would have to litigate it, and we would be--"
2000.00-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2948.43,2948.541,But you're not powerless.
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2948.541,2951.242,--doing it in the face of taxpayers who were obviously planning--
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2951.242,2954.83,But that's the only horrible you've presented... that... I mean--
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2954.83,2955.622,"--Well, the other--"
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2955.622,2956.978,--the case where that is the principal purpose.
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2956.978,2958.416,--I don't mean to say it's a horrible--
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2958.416,2963.675,"And then you complain when we say there's a solution for that horrible by saying, well, but then we'd have to prove that it was the principal purpose."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2964.281,2964.739,--I think that the other--
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2964.739,2966.952,It's not a horrible unless that's the principal purpose.
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2966.952,2969.929,--The other horrible is that Congress didn't intend this to happen.
2000.00-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2977.899,2990.319,"To go back to the first horrible... could somebody just do it now, even if you win, by simply folding the acquired company into its company so there's just one entity rather than the consolidated one?"
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2990.319,2996.515,"No, that doesn't accomplish their objective, because then the acquiring company would be liable for all these product liability expenses."
2000.00-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3028.265,3028.414,There's nothing--
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3028.414,3029.413,--that is this situation.
2000.00-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3029.413,3029.553,--Mr. Jones.
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3036.217,3055.89,"But the question is whether the consolidated provisions permit it, and in Woolford Realty the Court said that the mind rebels against the notion that in allowing for consolidated returns Congress meant to provide for such a facile and obvious means of juggling tax attributes to avoid the payment of taxes."
2000.00-157,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3060.197,3069.124,"But Mr. Jones, you don't disagree with your opponent's hypothetical involving a company with two divisions... a computer division and a hot dog division, or something like that."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3069.124,3070.138,It's a single corporation.
2000.00-157,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3070.69,3075.605,"But it's that... also is sort of contrary to the basic purpose of deduction, it seems to me."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3075.605,3104.439,"No, because the... what Congress was concerned about was the company who was liable for the... whether the company that was liable for the product liability expenses had been fairly treated, and if that company is a single entity, then it has received the income in the past, it has paid taxes on that income, and then when the deductions come up ten years later because the expenses come up later, it's fair to let that company go back and get the monies that they've paid in taxes back ten years ago."
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3158.364,3168.512,Was it a hundred and eighty degrees off in Intermet to say a separate taxable income's character as positive or negative has no independent significance?
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3168.512,3181.673,"Yes, that was also well off the point, the locus of the income at the individual corporate level is often important... it's often critical... in determining the proper tax treatment of that item."
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3185.425,3198.229,"So it was also wrong when they said a member's product liability expenses affect the group's consolidated net operating loss, dollar for dollar, whether the member has a positive or negative separate taxable income."
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3198.229,3204.844,"--Well, actually what affects the income of the consolidated group is the positive taxable income that comes from that affiliate."
2000.00-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3204.844,3206.91,So that can--
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3206.91,3210.534,The positive taxable income goes over and reduces the losses of the other companies.
2000.00-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3214.669,3215.791,--What are the other examples you were about to give?
2000.00-157,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,3221.124,3222.888,--H Enterprises is a good example.
2000.00-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3458.493,3460.123,"--Thank you, Mr. Jones."
2000.00-157,2,22259,eric_r_fox,,3462.874,3478.059,"The Respondent takes the position that if the regulations do not address a particular provision, that any provision in the Code has to be applied on a separate company basis and not on a consolidated basis."
2000.00-157,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3592.289,3592.421,"Thank you, Mr. Fox."
