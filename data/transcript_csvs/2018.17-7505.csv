2018.17-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.28,"We'll hear argument next today in Case 17-7505, Madison versus Alabama. Mr. Stevenson."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,7.28,18.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: It's undisputed that Vernon Madison now sits on Alabama's death row, unable to fully orient to time and place."
2018.17-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,40.04,52.36,"Mr. Stevenson, I'm -- it's a question for both sides, but I'm having trouble with a firm grasp on exactly what issues are presented. Now just tell me if I've got this right: There are two."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,82.4,84.4,I -- I -- I think they're two related questions.
2018.17-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,110.44,111.08,Right.
2018.17-7505,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,111.08,116.0,Did you say must be memory loss plus? And what would the plus be?
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,116.0,133.08,"Well, the -- the examples that come to mind would be the kind of brain damage that is a result of an injury, where the brain is injured and incapable of actually producing memories or creating the kind of rational understanding that this Court has required. A second example would be something like a coma."
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,144.6,165.2,"Mr. Stevenson, part of the problem is the use of the word ""loss of memory."" And I -- in your briefs, you seem to go back and forth on this. Are you conceding that amnesia about the incident alone, where you can function in every other way in society, would you be incompetent then?"
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,165.2,165.6,No.
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,165.6,166.24,To be executed?
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,166.24,166.84,"Yes, that's right."
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,168.32,175.64,So your loss of memory isn't even what the cause of the loss of memory is.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,197.28,207.96,"That -- that's right. Would cause disorientation, cause an inability to understand their circumstances, have the kind of symptoms that we have here. Mr. Madison can't tell you the season of the year."
2018.17-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,214.44,214.88,What if he can --
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,214.88,221.04,I just want to understand your -- your answer to the -- to Justice Sotomayor's question.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,233.84,243.32,I -- I think it could. But I think the reason why I qualify it is because there aren't circumstances that I believe are consistent with what we've argued here.
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,243.32,246.68,"No, I think that's a -- a question that calls for a yes or no answer."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,257.56,266.44,I think it would render someone incompetent if the basis for that inability to remember is medical rather than something else.
2018.17-7505,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,267.92,277.2,"In your original question presented, you ask whether a person, a prisoner whose mental disability leaves him without memory --"
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,277.2,277.76,That's correct.
2018.17-7505,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,277.76,279.8,-- of his commission of the capital offense.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,293.2,293.88,I -- I'm just --
2018.17-7505,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,293.88,300.48,"But if there's mental disability that has given rise to this lack of memory, then it is?"
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,300.48,319.16,"Well, I guess what I'm conceding, Justice Kagan, is that we're arguing that more is required than someone saying I don't remember my crime, you can't execute me. The state has an interest in being able to impose punishment and to execute these kinds of sentences with something more than ""I don't remember."" We've never argued that."
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,319.16,322.28,"No, I don't understand -- I don't understand your answer."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,330.52,331.4,"Well, that's correct. That's --"
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,331.4,333.0,"By definition, it's a mental condition."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,333.0,335.2,"That -- well, that's my point, Justice Alito."
2018.17-7505,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,358.56,358.88,Right.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,380.16,380.8,"No, it is not."
2018.17-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,441.44,441.84,Right.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,450.72,451.08,Well --
2018.17-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,451.08,461.56,"You -- you're conceding that simply blacking out, you don't remember the crime, I don't know -- I don't know if that happens often or not, you remember everything else, you know the days of the month and all that --"
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,461.56,461.76,Yes.
2018.17-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,461.76,463.28,-- but you just can't remember the crime.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,469.16,469.88,Yeah.
2018.17-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,469.88,483.12,"But then I also understand the state, and we can ask them, but I think it is in their brief, to say that if, in fact, you meet the Ford standards, they don't care how you got there; if you got there because you have dementia, you still meet the Ford standards."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,483.12,493.64,"Well, but that's a very different position than what we argued below, because that was our argument, is that we can meet the Ford standards when you consider dementia as a legitimate basis for rendering someone incompetent."
2018.17-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,536.4,538.48,Now you don't care -- you don't care how they get there.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,547.08,549.76,It's the severity of the disability and the reliability of --
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,549.76,551.92,"Mr. Stevenson, that's the point."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,552.64,553.16,It's the severity --
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,553.16,563.12,-- let's take as given for the moment that the other side has conceded that severe dementia does qualify under Ford and Panetti.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,563.12,563.56,Yes.
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,563.56,579.84,"And I do -- I'm going to ask the other side where the Court addressed that issue, because I don't see it. They seem to be thinking that only delusions could qualify, not incompetence."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,585.2,586.0,Yes.
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,586.0,590.12,"What's the difference between mild dementia, moderate, and severe?"
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,590.12,590.76,Yes.
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,590.76,598.12,And where would the fact-finder settle in saying this person is incompetent or not incompetent?
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,598.12,598.4,Yes.
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,630.0,637.04,"It's very -- it's very easy -- it's very hard to be a lay person, but I understand that won't show up for Alzheimer's, for example."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,637.04,637.36,"Well, it --"
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,637.36,639.84,Until someone's died and they can open up the brain.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,639.84,640.76,With -- with some forms.
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,646.32,651.72,I'm -- I'm less worried about that because I am worried about something like Alzheimer's.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,651.72,652.12,Yeah.
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,652.12,653.12,Dementia's dementia.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,653.12,653.32,Yes.
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,653.72,655.04,So let's get to the definition.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,655.04,657.92,But I just -- I'm just using the criteria that the medical community gives to us.
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,746.76,776.72,"Well, Mr. Madison obviously has serious problems, serious physical problems and mental problems, but I'm quite confused by the arguments that you're making. Isn't it the case that in his order of April 29 Judge Smith found that Madison failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he does not rationally understand the punishment he is about to suffer and why he is about to suffer it?"
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,776.72,776.96,What --
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,776.96,786.2,"Did he not make that finding and is that not supported by the testimony of the defense expert, Dr. Goff?"
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,786.2,789.32,I don't think he -- I don't think he made that finding.
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,789.32,791.12,That's a direct quote from his order.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,791.12,795.8,"Yeah, what he did was actually cite Dr. Kirkland's testimony about that point."
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,815.48,823.32,"Well, I don't think you're accurately representing what Dr. Goff testified, but I don't want to argue about what the record shows and doesn't -- and doesn't show."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,823.32,827.24,"Well, Dr. Goff was very clear about the point that he did not remember the crime."
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,828.52,831.04,"Yes, he did not -- he did not remember the crime."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,832.56,832.8,Which --
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,832.8,836.88,"But he said he understands the sentence, specifically the meaning of the death sentence."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,853.88,858.48,"Well, he didn't -- I think what he said was ""I don't have any"" -- ""I don't think this applies to me."
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,872.64,878.24,"But this order was the order that came before us when this case was before us the last time, is that not right?"
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,878.24,878.84,That's right.
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,878.84,881.0,And that's what you're now contesting.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,888.92,889.84,"Well, actually, the order --"
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,889.84,896.84,"And the only thing that's happened since then, and what you've cited, are the -- the events concerning Kirkwood."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,896.84,897.56,"Well, that -- that --"
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,897.56,898.08,Is that right?
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,898.08,922.28,"No, we've actually contended that the court below should now recognize what the Eleventh Circuit recognized, which is that if you consider dementia, and you apply what we know about dementia to this circumstance, and to Ford and Panetti, you will have to conclude that this man is not competent to be executed. And what the trial court did on the argument of the state is say that we failed because we did not make a threshold showing of insanity."
2018.17-7505,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,969.64,974.8,Can I ask -- can I give you two versions of your argument and you tell me which one you're arguing?
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,974.8,975.08,Sure.
2018.17-7505,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,975.08,977.04,Or maybe you can tell me that there's no difference --
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,977.04,977.44,Sure.
2018.17-7505,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,977.44,984.2,"-- between the two. So one is just if you have severe dementia, you are incompetent to be executed."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1007.48,1009.52,"I -- I -- I think it's the latter, Justice Kagan."
2018.17-7505,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1044.88,1069.24,"So what -- what then -- as -- as probably you know, I think, that there are many, many, many prisoners on death row under threat of execution who are in their 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, possibly 80s, who have been there for 20, 30, 40 years perhaps."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1101.88,1106.84,"Yeah, if I can just first contextualize that problem before giving that answer."
2018.17-7505,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1148.04,1148.24,Right.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1149.2,1149.76,I take your point.
2018.17-7505,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1149.76,1150.6,-- Alzheimer's --
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1150.6,1151.08,Yeah.
2018.17-7505,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1151.48,1152.68,-- dementia of many kinds.
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1152.68,1153.76,-- I take your point.
2018.17-7505,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1153.76,1161.96,"All sorts of things. And so we could litigate each case, case by case, or you answer what I -- I mean --"
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1161.96,1178.48,"Yes, that's right. The rule I -- I would argue is that where someone has a disability that renders them incapable of orienting to time or place or rationally understanding the circumstances of their offense, they are incompetent."
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1211.68,1221.76,"When you back -- when you went back to the trial court, you emphasized the events concerning Kirkwood. What is his situation now?"
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1221.76,1224.08,Dr. Kirkland has been suspended.
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1229.6,1232.96,Did the grand jury refuse to return a true bill for him?
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1232.96,1237.36,"They did at one point. But he is still under investigation, still suspended."
2018.17-7505,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1237.36,1239.4,He's still under investigation by whom?
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1239.4,1240.72,By the State of Alabama.
2018.17-7505,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1313.56,1314.08,Now what do you do with the --
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1314.08,1315.04,Mr. Stevenson --
2018.17-7505,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1315.04,1331.56,"-- with the determination -- what do you do with the determination that, one, he knew that he was subject to execution for having killed a police officer?"
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1331.56,1335.12,I -- I'd -- I would deal with that the same way the Court dealt with that in Panetti.
2018.17-7505,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1431.48,1435.2,Have there been changes even since 2016? Is this continuing?
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1435.2,1440.56,"It is a degenerative disease and, yes, he continues to -- to decline."
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1467.92,1488.64,"Mr. Stevenson, the court below believed that Dr. Kirkland and Goff's evaluations were essentially similar. Do you agree with that assessment? If you don't, tell me how you relate that lack of similarity to the question of his reliability."
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1488.64,1489.48,"Yeah, I think --"
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1489.48,1492.44,And what do you think the trial court should have done --
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1492.44,1493.16,Sure.
2018.17-7505,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1493.16,1495.52,-- in order to deal with that?
2018.17-7505,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1495.52,1496.28,Yeah.
2018.17-7505,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1552.52,1560.08,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Govan."
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,1560.08,1565.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court granted certiorari on two questions."
2018.17-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1583.28,1602.92,"Can I go back to -- can I start there? It seems to me as I'm reading through some of the materials that you pointed to in your brief that, under the common law, there were different kinds of -- of defenses to murder, including lunacy."
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,1651.96,1652.16,"Well, Your Honor --"
2018.17-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1652.16,1671.48,I don't even know that we have to get there because your adversary has said that he thinks this folds into Ford and Panetti because it's not dementia qua dementia; it's a certain kind of dementia that doesn't put you in rational touch with your decision-making in your moment.
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,1676.12,1677.24,"Yes, Your Honor, for two points."
2018.17-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1687.04,1696.56,"No, they define ""lunacy"" as someone who can remember sometimes and not remember -- have his wits sometime and not have his wits other times."
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,1696.56,1702.4,"Well, Your Honor, our -- our view of the common law, and those sources, we're talking about something different."
2018.17-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1710.04,1744.8,"Well, if you don't think a demented person who today doesn't remember you as your son, who doesn't know where he or she is, who doesn't know to call -- to go to the bathroom in the pot right next to him -- you don't call that being out of your wits? It could be that maybe tomorrow they might for a few minutes remember, but at the moment that they're having that episode, are they within their wits?"
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,1744.8,1749.48,"Your Honor, we -- we have not -- there -- there could be -- again, dementia exists on a spectrum."
2018.17-7505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1759.24,1774.28,"Well, but you -- it is my understanding, I'll ask the same question I asked earlier of the two questions accurate, you -- you are arguing that simply because somebody doesn't remember the crime, that that doesn't help satisfy Ford and Panetti, right?"
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,1774.28,1775.12,"Correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-7505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1775.12,1785.16,"But you've conceded that if the person meets the Ford and Panetti standard by virtue of vascular dementia, that he meets the Ford and Panetti standard, right?"
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,1785.16,1797.12,"Yes, yes, if someone has vascular dementia or any other mental illness, if it precludes them from having a rational understanding of their punishment, and that they will die when they're executed, they would meet the Ford and Panetti standard."
2018.17-7505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1797.12,1817.44,"So -- so I understand your friend who have conceded that simply not remembering the crime is not enough. And you're arguing that if it's vascular dementia that affects you up to the point of Ford and Panetti, that that is enough. So are all we arguing about whether -- is whether Mr. Madison himself meets the Ford and Panetti standard?"
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,1817.44,1818.88,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2018.17-7505,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1826.92,1833.92,But this -- but this -- the decision we're now reviewing said the Supreme Court said must be insane.
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,1838.28,1840.72,"Yes, Your Honor, but that -- that doesn't change the scenario."
2018.17-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1890.8,1937.2,"Well, is there ever a place where the court makes clear that it understands that insanity is not a sine qua non, that dementia could do the trick in satisfying the Ford/Panetti standard? Is there ever a place where the court says, even though, you know, I understand that I'm not necessarily looking for delusions or schizophrenia or insanity and all the -- the ways that we -- that we saw it in Ford and Panetti, that if I find somebody who's experiencing the kind of dementia that would prevent him from having a rational understanding of the crime and punishment, that that's enough? Is there ever a place where the court makes clear that it knows that?"
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,1937.2,1938.96,"Well, yes, several parts, Your Honor."
2018.17-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1946.32,1947.6,But I don't think that that does it.
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,1957.28,1957.96,Absolutely.
2018.17-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1973.4,1973.52,Right.
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,1988.52,2005.0,"Because it specifically said in its conclusion on page 10 that it was considering all the testimony of Dr. Goff and that eventually made the final finding, which Justice Alito pointed to, that ""Madison has a rational understanding as required by Panetti that he is going to be executed."" And it's important also to note that there were --"
2018.17-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2005.0,2021.76,"But do you see what I mean, Mr. Govan? And I won't belabor this, but you can list all the evidence and think to yourself: I'm listing all the evidence, but I find all this evidence utterly irrelevant to the legal standard because I think delusions are required to satisfy Ford and Panetti."
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2021.76,2023.28,"Well, I understand, Your Honor."
2018.17-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2042.84,2043.4,I guess what you're saying is either way.
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2047.32,2047.8,"No, absolutely --"
2018.17-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2047.8,2059.56,"We can't -- we can't tell that he thought that delusions were required, and we can't tell that -- whether he thought that dementia could satisfy?"
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2059.56,2060.96,"No, that's not what we're saying at all."
2018.17-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2074.4,2074.76,I guess --
2018.17-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2074.76,2116.6,"What do you think? That is, what does the state think about the standard, which perhaps would be an addition to Ford or Panetti, which was mentioned, if the two -- and it's not exclusive, but if two things are true; one, he does not recall his crime; and, second, he has a severe inability to orient himself to time or place, which means the kinds of things that were described. Yes, I recognize you today; tomorrow I can't, not a clue, not a clue where anything is, though sometimes he answers the right questions."
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2141.48,2146.12,"Your Honor, the difference is -- is that, under Ford and Panetti, Madison has an understanding of what matters."
2018.17-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2146.12,2160.04,"No, no, I'm not saying -- I understand that the words I just used are different than Ford and Panetti, but a person in that circumstance either can be executed or not."
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2184.56,2186.04,And the specific words that they --
2018.17-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2186.04,2204.84,"The words are, one, he does not recall his crime, and, two, he has a severe inability to orient -- mental ability -- he has a severe inability to orient himself to time and place."
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2204.84,2206.76,"Well, I'll take the first one, Your Honor."
2018.17-7505,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2212.2,2215.56,And nobody's -- nobody's arguing that in this case.
2018.17-7505,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2217.68,2224.72,"Well, that was the question we -- the principal question that we granted, but, apparently, it's fallen out of the case."
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2224.72,2229.64,"Well, Your Honor, I think the reason it's fallen out is because there's such a clear lack of objective evidence for such a rule."
2018.17-7505,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2229.64,2233.0,But that isn't -- that isn't -- that -- that's not really my point.
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2249.0,2256.04,"Your Honor, because, in this case, the state would still have a strong interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime."
2018.17-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2260.44,2260.96,I'm sorry --
2018.17-7505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2260.96,2261.36,We're -- we're mix --
2018.17-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2261.36,2261.88,-- how about --
2018.17-7505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2261.88,2263.56,-- we're mixing up the questions.
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2283.04,2283.36,Yes.
2018.17-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2293.04,2293.44,All right.
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2392.96,2400.6,"Your Honor, because this case is different than the facts of Panetti. So, in Panetti, the problem was the inmate knew he was going to be executed, but he didn't understand why."
2018.17-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2426.08,2452.88,"So what if he can't understand or really follow through in his thinking what that means? I mean, he's just not rational in the way you and I understand it. I certainly don't think a demented person who has Alzheimer's and is put in a -- in an institution might have a moment of understanding one memory, and I think that they are rational."
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2465.72,2469.08,"Well, Your Honor, with respect, on the things that matter, he does understand."
2018.17-7505,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2481.48,2493.68,"Mr. Govan, can I ask you whether you think this is at all relevant? At the time of the conviction, over 30 years ago, Madison was competent."
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2506.44,2508.16,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-7505,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2508.16,2527.32,"So suppose he had come to that, the end of the trial, in the condition he now is in; that is, he can't see, he can barely walk, all of the other conditions that Mr. Stevenson brought out."
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2543.48,2544.56,"Judge, I don't know."
2018.17-7505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2569.52,2580.36,"Do you -- I mean, what is the significance? I -- I would have thought all we were concerned about is mental significance -- mental ability and understanding, the various things, blindness, inability to -- to walk."
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2584.52,2585.52,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-7505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2604.64,2609.28,What -- what is your view on the significance of the MRI evidence?
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2609.28,2614.84,"Your Honor, and that -- that kind of -- Mr. Madison's point on that is kind of missing, I guess, the point."
2018.17-7505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2651.84,2657.48,"But you -- you've already prevailed on that point at least with respect to your adversary's view, right?"
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2657.48,2657.88,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-7505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2657.88,2658.24,Okay.
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2682.12,2684.36,"Well, Your Honor, I think MRI evidence can help."
2018.17-7505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2693.4,2699.16,"Yeah, but there's no MRI evidence that's going to be looked at and you can say this shows that he doesn't remember the facts of the crime."
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2702.48,2703.28,That's correct.
2018.17-7505,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2758.56,2775.56,"So you would think that if he came before the trial court on a question of competence to stand trial with what his mental condition is now, his lack of orientation to time and place, that he would have been found competent to stand trial?"
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2775.56,2800.24,"Yes, Your Honor, I do, because, again, he would have what the -- the rational understanding that would be required in even the competency to stand trial setting, which is a rational understanding of the facts, the factual proceedings, and the ability to assist with counsel. And here, that's what Madison's expert said, that he did understand, quote, ""he has been able to understand the nature of the pending proceeding and he has an understanding of what he was tried for."" So, yes."
2018.17-7505,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2800.24,2822.16,"And -- and -- and what if what they meant by that was you can -- you can make him understand what is going on today, but then tomorrow he comes back and you have to do it all over again, and then tomorrow -- the next day comes back and you have to do it all over again? In other words, he -- you -- you can -- you can -- you can get him to understand something, but then he loses it."
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2832.84,2840.16,"Your Honor, that -- that might be a closer question, again, that you would determine on the factual circumstances in front of that particular court."
2018.17-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2949.16,2964.4,"But you don't disagree that Ford and Panetti, read properly, would not be limited to insanity, delusion, or severe dementia?"
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2964.4,2965.04,Of course not.
2018.17-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2967.6,2967.8,And --
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2967.8,2977.76,"And the thing is that in this case, the trial court did consider them and found that notwithstanding those conditions, the fact that he had these strokes and memory loss, he still had a rational understanding of his --"
2018.17-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2977.76,2978.2,"Well, that's --"
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,2978.2,2978.6,-- crime and punishment.
2018.17-7505,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2978.6,2986.64,-- interesting to me because I don't read anywhere in Kirkland where he did any analysis of rationality.
2018.17-7505,1,63033,thomas_r_govan_jr_,,3037.92,3041.6,"Just -- just two points in response to that, Your Honor."
2018.17-7505,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3086.2,3089.72,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stevenson, you have four minutes remaining."
2018.17-7505,2,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,3089.72,3090.12,Yes.
2018.17-7505,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3351.6,3352.6,"Thank you, counsel."
