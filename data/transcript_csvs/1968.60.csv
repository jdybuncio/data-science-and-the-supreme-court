1968.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,35.171,"Number 60, Dick Gregory et al., petitioners versus City of Chicago."
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,37.426,42.879,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.60,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,369.641,372.001,"Mr. Patner, was the mayor at home?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,372.001,374.743,"Your Honor, it does not appear in the record if he was."
1968.60,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,380.003,384.194,"Does it appear in the record, the purpose of picketing that block?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,384.194,385.401,It does not sir.
1968.60,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,411.076,414.657,Didn't you bring it home to the mayor down at the city hall?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,414.657,418.66,It may have been brought home to the mayor of city hall also.
1968.60,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,418.66,420.865,"Well, he was in the city hall, wasn't he?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,420.865,422.091,That does not appear in the record.
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,433.267,449.758,Is there any city ordinance in Chicago that makes a distinction with respect to parades and demonstrations in residential areas as compared with business areas or other types of areas?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,449.758,455.391,"Subsequent to this case Your Honor, the Illinois Legislature saw fit to pass such a statute."
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,458.703,460.628,What did the statute say?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,460.628,479.692,"The statute is referred to in our brief and it says under public policy that in respect to the peace and good order of communities that there shall be no demons -- I'm just paraphrasing, no demonstrations in what are known as residential neighborhoods."
1968.60,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,479.692,482.003,And what does -- is it printed?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,482.003,485.106,"Yes, sir."
1968.60,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,493.761,494.942,So there was no law.
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,494.942,497.306,There was none at the time of this case sir.
1968.60,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,497.306,504.145,"No state law attempting to bar parades of anytime, anywhere in the city of that county."
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,504.145,513.486,"Sir, the -- there was no ordinance or statute prohibiting residential picketing which is what I was mentioning to Mr. Justice Fortas."
1968.60,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,513.486,515.042,Was there any bar in any picketing?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,515.042,515.339,"No, sir."
1968.60,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,523.895,525.071,Was it granted?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,525.071,527.901,There was no request for a permit.
1968.60,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,530.202,532.193,"But how was it to be granted, the permit?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,532.193,539.043,"Oh, that appears Your Honor in the -- Mr. Justice in the reply brief, its --"
1968.60,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,539.043,540.092,In your reply brief?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,540.092,540.939,"Yes, sir."
1968.60,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,573.202,574.884,Now what were their charges?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,574.884,578.94,They were charged with to accounts of disorderly conduct.
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,705.607,711.018,How long the -- how long were they marching before they were arrested?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,711.018,717.194,They're marching all together about five and a half hours but somewhere over an hour in the community.
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,717.194,721.974,"Suppose they've wanted to do it all night, all night long."
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,738.949,739.568,A little earlier sir.
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,739.568,740.384,-- at night.
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,740.384,741.47,"Yes, sir."
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,741.47,751.826,"And suppose they had continued in about 2:00 in the morning as the police said -- had said, “Well, this is it."
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,769.099,769.935,What --
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,769.935,773.094,"In short, the question that this case present -- may present, I don't know."
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,790.267,802.539,"Your Honor, Mr. Justice the -- in this case because the marchers remain silent, the only danger of the riot would have been at the election of the residence who have come out and attacked them."
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,802.539,805.896,"Well, they did a certain amount of singing, didn't they?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,805.896,806.296,"Yes, sir."
1968.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,815.15,824.106,They have some agreement did they not with the police as to their conduct in what they would do and would not do?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,824.106,824.479,"Yes, sir."
1968.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,825.601,826.888,Is that observed?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,826.888,834.844,"Yes, it was observed exactly except for when that the three instances I mentioned when hoses were put in their way, they waited until they were removed."
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,857.709,859.382,Did you answer my question?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,859.382,860.454,"Oh, I'm sorry sir."
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,860.454,862.829,"I'm sorry, it's a tough one."
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,862.829,863.237,"Well, no."
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,869.127,891.021,"In other words, you don't think there's any limit at all provided that they don't make any noise except whatever noise may be necessarily incident to the sound of feet of marchers at 2:00 a.m. in residential area when women and children are asleep."
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,891.021,891.372,"Yes, sir."
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,891.902,892.615,I see.
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,892.615,918.542,"I think that's right but the Struthers case is not so different because there, the argument was made that ringing door bells in a community where people worked all night should be prohibited to Jehovah Witnesses and this Court said that that was not the reason to stop the kind of First Amendment activity that would be related to night or day or day or night depending on how people were in their activity."
1968.60,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,977.765,981.932,"Mr. Patner, how close is this to Fainer?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,981.932,982.525,I'm sorry sir.
1968.60,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,982.525,985.406,How close this case to Fainer?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,985.406,987.69,"Your Honor, the -- it's very close."
1968.60,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1030.68,1036.522,"Well, couldn't it be argued that they -- their presence they had -- did it?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1036.522,1044.729,"Their presence there Your Honor, if their presence invited violence, we may as well abolish the First Amendment."
1968.60,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1054.538,1055.44,But it's your position.
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1058.82,1061.401,I think you do not although I would prefer that you do.
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1127.191,1129.599,What do you mean getting rid of the man who made the threat?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1129.599,1131.266,"Well, he is the one who threatened him."
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1133.406,1137.181,I thought one doesn't violate his First Amendment rights or is that --
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1137.181,1137.648,"No, that's the --"
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1137.648,1142.778,-- that's sufficiently close -- that's sufficiently close to --
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1142.778,1143.023,"Yes, sir."
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1143.817,1144.374,-- provide?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1144.374,1145.284,It's not the words.
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1148.28,1151.124,"Well, he didn't do it, he just said it so far as finding --"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1151.124,1151.449,"Yes, sir."
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1154.754,1157.197,"That kind of (Inaudible), that kind of statement."
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1157.197,1160.942,"That kind of statement -- yes, I mean the activity that he is talking about."
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1168.595,1181.945,"Well, Mr. Gregory or somebody had said to the police, “If you don't remove those people who are obstructing our way, we're going to remove them ourselves.”"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1181.945,1184.359,And they took some -- I think then they'd have to take --
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1184.359,1186.166,That's all -- that's all he got in Fainer --
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1186.166,1186.286,That's all sir --
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1186.286,1187.45,-- you've got in Fainer.
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1187.45,1189.229,-- and no one has heard her.
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1196.245,1200.014,"No, I -- no, the police -- he said that and the policeman heard it and a lot of other people --"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1200.014,1200.987,And a lot of other people.
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1200.987,1201.444,In the case I have put you.
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1201.444,1208.927,I think that -- I think then that the police will have to -- have to arrest them with the hostility that we now have surrounding the circumstance --
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1208.927,1209.22,Will you remember the --
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1209.22,1210.3,-- because there were many factors.
1968.60,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1210.3,1212.457,Will you remember what's that?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1212.457,1215.241,In the next case?
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1363.766,1367.585,"Well, are you really saying -- I'd like to pursue this for a moment."
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1388.252,1388.756,"No, sir."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1629.221,1630.609,Which purpose?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1630.609,1647.685,"To control Your Honor the speaker who would invite violence directly by his own action not by his use of free speech, not by his own unpopularity but if he would threaten in some way."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1657.776,1677.309,May I ask you whether your objection to this conviction here is based on the fact that there was no law in the City of Chicago which they charged him with violence or that there was a law but it somehow is unconstitutional?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1677.309,1684.597,"Your Honor it's on the latter, it's that the disorderly conducts -- I mean as applied, it's the disorderly conduct ordinance which is unconstitutional."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1684.597,1685.15,Why?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1685.15,1686.06,Because it's vague.
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1705.768,1710.014,Well than what does that have to do with the constitutional point that you were saying?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1716.197,1722.965,"That's right, so that it was protected, and as such, he should not have been -- he -- neither he nor his followers should have been convicted."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1722.965,1726.157,Are you taking the position that the law is unconstitutional --
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1726.157,1726.49,"Yes, sir."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1726.49,1738.317,-- because the state has no power to stop people from marching by thousands or hundreds in any section of the city it wants to on its streets.
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1744.277,1744.611,The latter Your Honor.
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1744.611,1745.718,There's a big difference to me.
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1745.718,1746.146,"Yes, sir."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1782.241,1783.528,Got no relevance here?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1783.528,1784.265,"Yes, sir."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1789.754,1798.23,"So you mean that size of the crowd which is marching around in the city, well, you have said at night has nothing to do with it?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1798.23,1798.65,If they are --
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1798.65,1801.222,Or where they're marching?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1801.222,1803.32,Each of those things would be relevant.
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1818.841,1829.68,"Suppose they're just marching around and around the mayor's home and silent, perfectly silent but they're marching around and around his home all night."
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1833.612,1834.97,I think not sir.
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1834.97,1835.752,You think not?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1835.752,1836.322,I do sir.
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1836.322,1842.095,Suppose they were to march around the home of a justice of this Court because of -- in his decision?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1842.095,1842.596,"Well, there are --"
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1842.596,1845.926,"-- round and around all night, 500 of them."
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1845.926,1846.14,"Well there, are they --"
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1846.14,1849.789,"Is there a constitution, permits the state from stopping that?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1849.789,1855.629,"There I think Your Honor the -- there's a good case from New York that works that out, the Levener case which we've cited, L-E-V-E-N-E-R."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1855.629,1856.669,I should work it out.
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1867.043,1867.384,No.
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1875.045,1890.435,"Well then I understand it if you're saying if it was a narrow statute -- a statute narrowing the drum precisely hitting it, you do not claim that the state is without power to stop this marches of hundreds of people."
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1890.435,1890.707,"Yes, sir."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1896.073,1899.44,"Well, why would it have to be certain areas?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1902.538,1902.893,There --
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1902.893,1904.9,Why does it have to be certain areas?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1904.9,1916.802,"I think Your Honor that the -- if the legislation that you've outlined were to include for example the area along the park, that -- it would clearly be banned."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1916.802,1918.385,Why would it clearly be banned?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1918.385,1918.942,Because --
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1918.942,1920.301,Who owns the park?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1920.301,1921.15,The public.
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1921.15,1921.992,"Well, who owns it?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1923.301,1924.012,The Government.
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1924.012,1926.139,That's their -- the Government represents them.
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1926.139,1926.518,That's right sir.
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1926.518,1934.571,So you take the position that the state is without power to dedicate that park to the purposes it wishes to dedicate it to?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1934.571,1937.52,As long as they don't conflict with the First Amendment rights.
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1937.52,1949.283,"Well, but you would -- would you say the First Amendment permits them, utilizing the park for purposes other than speaking and marching around if they wish to?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1949.283,1949.67,I'm sorry.
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1964.67,1976.227,"Can become a forum but do you mean, the state creates the park and do you claim that the state is without power to say what it should be used for?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1976.227,1981.152,It's -- it's without power that could be is -- used in excess or arbitrarily.
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1982.152,1984.694,-- it is beyond my comprehension.
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,1995.255,2005.65,"Alright sir, in this way if we begin for example with Cox where the prohibition was to march under the court while the court had its business."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2025.349,2029.5,You mean if it was aimed to a certain demonstrator and not aimed at all?
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,2029.5,2030.131,No.
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2032.297,2033.606,It is not a problem of equal protection.
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,2033.606,2034.539,Not in that light sir.
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2034.539,2047.164,What you're saying then is that the state is without power to regulate its briefs so as to permit them to be used only for the purpose of legitimate troubling.
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,2047.164,2047.602,"Yes, sir."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2054.88,2056.967,"With it (Inaudible) against it, did they?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,2056.967,2058.063,Well it was --
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2058.063,2060.643,They didn't have it -- the state hadn't attempted to pass a law against them.
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,2060.643,2061.085,"No, sir."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2071.532,2088.851,"Do you mean that the state is without power to take a public highway which is necessary for the public good, an interstate highway that the state without power to prevent that from being marched up and down for a hundred miles by the people?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,2088.851,2099.294,"Well, if they stock -- if they marched in the road with high speed traffic, I think under then -- under the police power, that would be perfectly fair for the Government to prohibit it."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2100.094,2102.192,"You have to get a whole army to protect them, wouldn't you?"
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,2102.192,2102.445,"Yes, sir."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2112.07,2117.179,"Well, I'm not talking about what the state should do or what the Government should do."
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,2132.637,2133.346,"Oh, no."
1968.60,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2145.676,2164.182,"But here as I understand it, you are complaining that the state has no law against it, which can cover it unless you are far vague in uncertain statute which cannot be narrowly limited to the thing they want to protect."
1968.60,0,36488,marshall_patner,,2164.182,2169.5,"As now written and as construed, that's exactly my position sir."
1968.60,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2173.845,2184.961,Mr. Simon.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2184.961,2188.281,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2331.046,2333.808,"-- depending on the policeman's order, I guess."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2333.808,2334.832,I beg your pardon Mr. Justice Black.
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2334.832,2340.432,That's depending only on the policeman's order?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2340.432,2341.606,No.
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2343.124,2346.404,One of them has raised -- would be a law.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2346.404,2361.239,"Yes, there is a law Mr. Justice Black and we depend on it and we depend principally in this case upon the fact that the police commander acted in the face of an incipient riot to preserve order."
1968.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2361.239,2369.27,Was there any -- was there any violation of law before the police gave that order?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2369.27,2375.019,"In our opinion Your Honor, these facts have to be considered in their totality to understand the reason --"
1968.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2375.019,2377.386,"Oh, I didn't ask for that sir."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2387.14,2400.92,We have to contend Your Honor that the answer is no that the violation of the law occurred when the commander of police requested the marchers to desist in the face of an incipient riot situation and they refused.
1968.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2400.92,2401.729,"Yes, that's what thought."
1968.60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2401.729,2404.949,At least that's what -- at least that's what they were convicted for.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2404.949,2406.387,That's correct Mr. Justice White.
1968.60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.387,2420.674,And in fact the -- there might have been -- you don't contend then on this case that the city or the state is relying on any flat ban of marches in residential districts?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2420.674,2421.309,No.
1968.60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.87,2424.593,And some marches in residential districts are alright.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2424.593,2428.254,We do not depend on it but we seriously question the wisdom of residential.
1968.60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.254,2431.901,"Well, if that's -- there is no ordinance, I gather in Chicago."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2431.901,2435.59,Today there is a state statute in Illinois existing Mr. Justice White.
1968.60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.217,2442.764,And nor was any other statute or ordinance which ban much as at residential districts.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2442.764,2443.966,That's correct Mr. Justice White.
1968.60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.966,2445.616,So you must rely on --
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2445.616,2448.167,The disorderly conduct ordinance.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2448.167,2459.206,"Can you point to me in the record, any action at any time that the police officials took against these thousands of people?"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2459.206,2461.008,"Yes, Mr. Justice Black."
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2464.596,2465.337,Like what?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2465.337,2469.308,The police closed all the taverns in the immediate vicinity.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2486.576,2487.454,They removed -- wait a minute.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2490.824,2494.029,That's all what was in front of the march at that point Mr. Justice Black.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2494.029,2495.085,Did they remove any others?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2495.085,2496.952,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I apologize."
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2496.952,2499.246,Did they remove any others?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2499.246,2504.957,"Mr. Justice Black, the record shows that persons were standing in their doorway and the police --"
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2504.957,2516.733,Did they remove any others or the people that were chanting and yelling and committing acts of disorderly conduct?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2516.733,2518.428,They didn't arrest any person --
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2518.428,2518.855,Who were --
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2518.855,2519.526,-- Mr. Justice Marshall.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2519.526,2527.519,Who were disorderly and violating the ordinance against this only conduct --
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2527.519,2527.835,"Well, there is --"
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2527.835,2535.541,-- where any -- was one single man arrested for disorderly conduct on the other side?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2535.541,2537.192,"No, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2543.983,2547.119,"Well, is throwing of rocks disorderly conduct in Illinois?"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2547.119,2553.682,Certainly -- certainly the record shows that the police did everything they could to identify the person.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2553.682,2554.425,Did they arrest anybody?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2554.425,2555.701,"No, but the record points out --"
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2555.701,2556.106,They didn't even --
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2556.106,2560.916,-- they made every effort to identify them and the commander of police ordered that they be arrested --
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2560.916,2561.19,But they did they arrest --
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2561.19,2562.677,-- if they could be identified.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2562.677,2568.637,-- the one man that deliberately violated the rule by marching across --
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2568.637,2568.97,Mr. Justice Marshall --
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2568.97,2570.698,-- in front of everybody else.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2570.698,2574.351,"When he was asked to remove himself, he cooperated with the police."
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2574.351,2576.78,"Well, I thought you said you pushed him back."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2576.78,2580.097,"No, not in the instance where he was standing in front of the marchers."
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2580.097,2580.478,"Well, wasn't --"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2580.478,2581.171,"Mr. Justice Marshall, you're --"
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2581.171,2582.097,-- one pushed back.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2582.097,2583.326,You're alluding to --
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2583.326,2585.171,Was the one pushed back?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2585.171,2588.845,Several were thrown back when they would come through the police line.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2588.845,2594.2,Have they violated the disorderly conduct law by coming through the police lines?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2594.2,2596.079,"Well, that's not an issue in this case --"
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2596.079,2596.691,Were they?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2596.691,2596.879,-- Mr. Justice Marshall.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2596.879,2600.66,"-- well, if they were, weren't they for they were not arrested?"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2600.66,2608.572,"I think it is a -- judgment of the police whether that was disorderly conduct, whether they were trying to cross the street because they lived in the community."
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2622.576,2624.487,"So, it's up to the police?"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2624.487,2625.335,"No, I'm not saying it's up --"
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2625.335,2625.855,When two people --
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2625.855,2626.817,"-- to the police, it's up to --"
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2626.817,2635.344,"When two people are guilty of what you called disorderly conduct, it's up to the police to which side he shall arrest?"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2635.344,2642.219,"In an effort to maintain order Mr. Justice Marshall, the police have to make these determinations."
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2642.219,2642.511,"Well, I would assume --"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2642.511,2643.488,This was in the face --
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2643.488,2648.619,"-- that would be much easier to arrest the smaller group than the larger group, wouldn't it?"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2648.619,2653.049,"Mr. Justice Marshall, the record shows that this was no ordinary situation."
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2689.711,2694.704,But does the court have to convict?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2719.653,2727.598,"Only if they believe that the reasonable or only if they believe the order of the commander of police should have been obeyed by them, the way it was obeyed --"
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2727.598,2731.524,So they arrest them now for disobeying the order of the police?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2731.524,2732.951,"No, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2760.848,2761.62,But they say --
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2761.62,2761.873,-- to maintain the order.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2761.873,2765.389,-- anything went -- were they yelling snake when they were arrested --
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2765.389,2765.599,No.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2765.599,2766.765,-- or anything like that?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2766.765,2770.868,"No, they were yelling snake for approximately 45 minutes earlier."
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2770.868,2772.572,And they weren't arrested.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2772.572,2773.278,That's correct.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2773.278,2778.204,And the police were there and the system corroboration council was there.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2782.635,2795.626,"That's correct Mr. Justice Marshall and the reasonableness of that lies precisely in this, between 9:00 and 9:30 the records shows a sudden increase in the number of hostile threatening spectators."
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2843.965,2871.945,"Mr. Simon, apart from a -- what maybe a very reasonable response in the circumstances on a human basis, a problem that we have of course is a problem of law and is it Municipal Code of Chicago, Section 193-1, is that the one that's -- under which these petitioners were convicted?"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2871.945,2873.495,"Yes, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2873.596,2885.34,And would you turn to that and tell us the specific clause that is applicable here.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2885.34,2890.251,I appoint to the first two sections.
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2898.494,2902.239,"Alright, now, let me ask you."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2912.857,2913.519,Yes.
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2913.519,2914.312,Which one?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2914.312,2914.771,Yes.
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2917.854,2921.578,"Well, they made -- you don't say that they made improper noise?"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2921.578,2926.46,"Well, Mr. Justice Fortas, I have to answer the question in this manner."
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2953.822,2955.974,And that's the way they construe this section?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2955.974,2956.971,"Yes, and we contend --"
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2956.971,2957.505,And we don't know if its up --
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2957.505,2968.953,-- that what we we're reviewing in this Court is not this section but it's the decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois which interprets this section to mean those five things.
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2968.953,2999.751,"Well I -- when I look at this through -- as I must through the window of the First Amendment, I have a little problem because of the -- I could understand that that might -- the Supreme Court of Illinois might conceivably, I don't know whether it would be proper or not by conceivably advance that as a common law definition of breach of the peace if there is such thing."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3032.346,3034.162,It is indeed the gist of the petitioner's argument.
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3034.162,3044.692,"Now, can you look at -- looking -- forget it, for the moment about the -- what you say is the construction of the Supreme Court of Illinois."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3057.342,3057.517,"Well, Your Honor --"
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3057.517,3059.281,Because you said he is so charged.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3059.281,3060.148,"Your Honor, we did."
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3062.762,3070.112,"Well, would you tell me what there is in the record that supports any of those specific provisions in the code?"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3070.112,3075.981,"Well, let's repeat the recitation of calling the mayor snake in front of this home, in front of his neighbors."
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3075.981,3076.376,I see.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3079.283,3087.64,"I think all of these would be action tending toward -- to a diversion, constituted diversion tending to a breach of the peace."
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3087.64,3090.083,"Well, I see your approach to this and --"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3090.083,3090.445,No.
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3090.445,3093.315,"You can understand the problem that I'm raising, I'm sure."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3093.315,3094.163,I certainly can Mr. Justice Fortas.
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3094.163,3099.46,"Because on this record, it certainly at least arguable."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3099.46,3099.711,It is but --
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3099.711,3124.846,"And if you look at the specific provision of the language, the only provision that's applicable is the one that makes the crime for persons to collect in a body or crowd to the annoyance or disturbance of other persons and perhaps that -- if that would -- if that were the case here, I suppose you had agreed that that would present a very substantial constitutional --"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3124.846,3125.106,Only if the court --
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3125.106,3126.796,-- problem under the decisions of this Court.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3126.796,3148.684,Only if the Court were not to adhere to Winters versus New York where this Court said that the construction given to statute or ordinance by the highest reviewing court of its state is as much apart as if it were specifically written in and where the court said that a defendant is as chargeable with a subsequent judicial decision as he is by knowledge of the --
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3148.684,3151.42,"I'm lost, I am entirely -- I'm entirely familiar with that."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3153.259,3153.572,Yes.
1968.60,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3153.572,3158.353,-- but there is a problem here because of the way the statute is --
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3158.353,3159.925,"Well, that's the issue."
1968.60,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3162.441,3175.773,"Mr. Simon, the -- these five elements that you've catalog in answering my Brother Fortas' question, are those that appear on page 33 of your brief I guess, are they not?"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3186.723,3187.124,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1968.60,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3187.124,3187.967,-- is that right?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3187.967,3188.855,That's correct.
1968.60,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3188.855,3201.536,Was there any foreshadowing of this construction of the ordinance in any previous Supreme Court of Illinois cases?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3201.536,3207.667,"Not in the narrow construction which is applied here, no, nor in the specific language."
1968.60,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3238.59,3245.319,How about this case of Chicago against Joyce back in 1967.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3253.271,3255.976,"By foreshadowing Mr. Justice Stewart, no."
1968.60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.083,3289.369,"Well, do you --"
1968.60,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3289.369,3321.51,You're of course on sound ground so far as the decisions of this Court go in such cases as Winters and in Cox against New Hampshire that a construction in a very case in which the conviction is affirmed by the Supreme Court of Illinois is efficient to remove the vagueness from the statute but those decisions are always underneath somewhat and I wondered if there was any foreshadowing and you'd tell us that there was none.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3321.51,3322.432,Yes.
1968.60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3396.716,3407.88,"Well, absent to narrow construction -- narrowing construction by the Supreme Court of Illinois, would you still urge affirmance here?"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3407.88,3421.737,"Well, I'm fully aware of the previous decisions of this Court, construing disorderly conduct ordinances and I would be hard pressed to argue the naked language of the city ordinance without those decisions."
1968.60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3421.737,3445.636,"Would you argue that no matter how big your broad statute might be, the disorderly conduct statute might be, the conduct that Mr. Gregory engaged in was clearly within the statute that anybody would have recognized that this kind of conduct would have been covered by the statute even though there might be some other conduct that might be on the fringe and unrecognizable as --"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3445.636,3452.067,"Well, Mr. Justice White, certainly we wouldn't contend you could convict him in for an unconstitutional ordinance."
1968.60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3452.067,3463.753,"No, but I am asking, do you say that this conduct was so clearly violative of this general language as to be in the core of the statute."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3463.753,3464.274,"Yes, I'm sorry Mr. --"
1968.60,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3464.274,3468.358,You would have urged I suppose --
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3468.358,3471.818,To avoid a riot Mr. Justice White.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3509.904,3526.465,"Mr. Simon, what protection does a small minority group have in the community where the majority are opposed to and insofar as that minority is right of freedom of speech is concern under the rule you have just mentioned?"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3526.465,3534.451,"Their protection Mr. Justice Marshall is that, the police must make every reasonable effort to restrain the spectators."
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3534.451,3535.702,Like what?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3535.702,3537.232,"Well, as I recite it."
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3547.513,3557.997,"As of today, the same people that were convicted here will never be able to march in that area?"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3557.997,3561.172,"No, certainly not Mr. Justice Marshall."
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3571.152,3579.485,"Well, if tomorrow they march out there and the same size group shows up, they'll have to stop marching."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3579.485,3580.687,Absolutely no.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3585.033,3585.371,"Well, if the same size --"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3585.371,3587.674,"-- that the police have no advance notice, --"
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3587.674,3587.782,-- same size--
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3587.782,3591.814,-- the police have not had an opportunity to marshal adequate police there.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3591.814,3601.406,"If the same size group with the same rocks and eggs show up, the march is over."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3603.105,3605.38,That's not so Mr. Justice Marshall.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3606.831,3608.737,Only if we uphold this decision.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3608.737,3611.4,Only if there is a riot.
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3648.666,3654.35,"Well, it depends on who is the more disorderly and the more violent."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3661.671,3661.957,"Well, I don't --"
1968.60,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3661.957,3663.048,They win.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3663.048,3664.488,I don't think that that is a fair --
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3664.488,3665.328,"But if one, if one --"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3665.328,3669.775,-- fair characterization of the city's position Mr. Justice Marshall.
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3680.542,3699.838,"But the constitution Mr. Simon permits one group to march down the street, advocating its view, thus the constitution permit another group advocating the opposite view to march down the same street?"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3699.838,3701.742,In an effort to preserve order --
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3701.742,3709.967,I'm not talking -- I'd say there's a constitution to permit one to march to advocate his views and not permit the other one.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3709.967,3710.872,Yes.
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3714.63,3715.163,But isn't the Act --
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3715.163,3717.653,-- both sides to march and express their views.
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3717.653,3731.996,"Given the answer to that, that when you permit large groups to march down the street, others who are emotionally concerned on the other side are likely to march down the street --"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3731.996,3732.087,I think its --
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3732.087,3738.097,-- and don't you create situations at all the time that are likely to cause riots?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3738.097,3743.383,"Well, Mr. Justice Black, I don't know that they're likely to cause riots but they are certainly are dangerous situations."
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3743.383,3749.664,"Well, what -- why are they not if there are -- two are -- opposite one another injuring and stating opposite emotions (Voice Overlap) --"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3749.664,3757.943,We've always taken the position in Chicago that we have a right to make one group march in one street and another group march in another so they don't clench --
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3757.943,3761.75,"Oh, and like -- how can you regulate them like that if you can't regulate them?"
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3764.227,3767.825,"No, we usually let the one that's there first march on that street."
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3767.825,3771.353,Has Chicago yet passed any -- has Chicago or the state yet passed any law?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3771.353,3772.459,Yes.
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3772.459,3792.447,"I mean the kind of law that this Court has been admonishing must be passed in this field for years in narrowly drawn, nondiscriminatory statute acting on the assumption in the state does have a right to control marchers on its streets and demonstration."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3794.157,3799.178,The State Legislature has adopted a statute prohibiting residential marching.
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3799.978,3801.35,-- is that to all --
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3801.35,3801.556,Yes.
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3801.556,3802.673,-- nondiscriminatory?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3802.673,3803.626,Yes.
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3803.626,3804.684,It has done that.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3804.684,3805.236,Yes.
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3805.236,3821.33,"Well that -- to that extent, meets it seems that they are taking note of the fact that this Court in case after case have said, statutes must be narrowly drawn in this field to meet a particular situation hanging."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3821.33,3822.271,"And Mr. Justice Black, we --"
1968.60,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3822.271,3823.238,I'm glad to hear that.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3823.238,3831.457,We have amended our disorderly conduct ordinance to reflect this narrow construction of the State Supreme Court also.
1968.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3928.193,3931.236,Were they saying these things at the time they were arrested?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3931.236,3932.404,"No, Mr. -- no, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3932.404,3934.626,How long before that did they quit?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3934.626,3937.485,They quit at 8:30 and they were arrested at 9:30.
1968.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3937.485,3950.419,I understood you just say a little while ago then that there was no violation of law prior to the order of the commander to disperse.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3950.419,3952.629,That's our contention in this case Mr. Justice --
1968.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3952.629,3953.186,Alright.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3964.858,3971.348,"Precisely in the language of the Illinois Supreme Court, a breach of the peace was imminent."
1968.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3985.81,3993.3,Did these marchers have in mind what the Supreme Court might say in this case?
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,3993.3,3996.709,"In -- in the Winters' case, this Court pointed out that they are as chargeable --"
1968.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3996.709,4000.706,"No, I'm asking about the interpretation of your statute."
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,4000.706,4002.174,In -- indeed Your Honor.
1968.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4009.869,4019.468,I -- I thought you said to Mr. Justice Stewart that there was no pre-warning that this would be the interpretation of the statute by the Supreme Court.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,4019.468,4020.569,"Oh, no."
1968.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4024.982,4025.915,That's what I --
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,4025.915,4029.943,-- before the Supreme Court decision in the Gregory case had held that but we --
1968.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4029.943,4030.493,That's right.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,4031.652,4032.087,Yes.
1968.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4032.087,4032.325,That's all.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,4032.325,4033.15,That's correct.
1968.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4033.15,4034.202,Yes.
1968.60,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,4034.202,4049.607,"Mr. Justice Warren, the record shows that after legal consultation, the commander of police reluctantly placed them under arrest after all the facts and circumstances which have been pointed out in the argument."
1968.60,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4063.387,4068.164,"I see that you have -- yes, you go to the next case."
