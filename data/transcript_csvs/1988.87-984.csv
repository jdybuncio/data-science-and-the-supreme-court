1988.87-984,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.92,"We'll hear argument next on Number 87-984, Shell Oil Company versus the Iowa Department of Revenue."
1988.87-984,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,62.24,75.398,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether the State of Iowa may tax the income earned by Shell Oil Company in the extraction of oil and gas from the outer continental shelf."
1988.87-984,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,280.23,283.682,"Tell me again, Mr. Geller, how that computation was made."
1988.87-984,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,291.871,294.007,"--Not from sales, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-984,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,306.38,309.932,But I wouldn't think that was income in the ordinary sense.
1988.87-984,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,309.932,331.163,"--Well, it's not realized income for purposes of paying an income tax on it at that moment, but it is treated as a sales equivalent or income for a number of Federal purposes, as I said earlier, including the windfall profits tax and depletion allowances, and most importantly, figuring out the royalties it owes to the Federal Government, which is based not on any subsequent sales that may occur, but on the net wellhead value."
1988.87-984,1,27102,harry_m_griger,,1717.778,1734.007,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, my argument discusses three points as to why Iowa's apportioned tax is not in conflict with the Cuter Continental Shelf Lands Act."
1988.87-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2061.069,2067.806,"Excuse me, before you go on to the next point, isn't there a better explanation than it's just a superabundance of caution, to say it twice?"
1988.87-984,1,27102,harry_m_griger,,2097.858,2099.944,That is certainly one interpretation.
1988.87-984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.944,2101.479,I wouldn't consider that particularly redundant.
1988.87-984,1,27102,harry_m_griger,,2109.55,2112.684,That's certainly an interpretation.
1988.87-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.748,2150.627,"Suppose the State didn't use an apportionment formula, but they just arrived at the income earned in the State by just counting up the actual sales of oil and gas in Iowa, and figuring out what the income was from those sales."
1988.87-984,1,27102,harry_m_griger,,2177.86,2181.764,I'm not sure I understand the question.
1988.87-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2191.287,2192.203,Exactly.
1988.87-984,1,27102,harry_m_griger,,2192.203,2194.822,"No, because we would be taxing too much."
1988.87-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.541,2207.547,"Well, that's one reason why it wouldn't be good, but how about the statute?"
1988.87-984,1,27102,harry_m_griger,,2210.415,2215.532,We would be extraterritorially applying our tax laws--
1988.87-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2215.532,2218.734,You're just taxing sales made in Iowa.
1988.87-984,1,27102,harry_m_griger,,2218.734,2219.853,"--Sorry, Your Honor."
1988.87-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.761,2246.421,Even though everybody agrees that a large portion of the sales made in Iowa involved sales of outer continental shelf oil or [inaudible]?
1988.87-984,1,27102,harry_m_griger,,2246.421,2249.456,"No, I don't see the problem."
1988.87-984,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2275.071,2279.992,"If that's the case, you would think that a state voir would be right in this case."
1988.87-984,1,27102,harry_m_griger,,2279.992,2281.427,"I agree, your Honor."
1988.87-984,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2465.439,2468.474,"Thank you, Mr. Griger."
1988.87-984,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2470.174,2490.737,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, our position in this case is uncomplicated."
1988.87-984,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2582.747,2588.801,"Well, Mr. Wallace, I guess if the language is clear on its face, we don't get to the legislative history."
1988.87-984,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2588.801,2596.705,"If the language were clear on its face in support of Petitioner's claim, that is correct."
1988.87-984,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2627.176,2627.759,"Well, but it used broad language,"
1988.87-984,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2630.628,2650.505,"Yes, but this Court's decisions dealing with the subject of unitary taxation are all premised on the notion that the taxes are not being applied extraterritorially, to something outside the States's borders."
1988.87-984,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2861.608,2862.024,Mr. Wallace?
1988.87-984,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2869.528,2871.63,That is correct.
1988.87-984,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3000.849,3003.015,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1988.87-984,3,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3004.984,3007.668,"Just a few things, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-984,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3105.128,3119.221,"Do you think a gross receipts tax in Iowa on all sales, including sales of petroleum and including petroleum from the OCS, would be valid under the--"
1988.87-984,3,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3119.221,3119.438,Yes.
1988.87-984,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3134.797,3136.015,"Thank you, Mr. Geller."
