1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,49.696,53.003,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.31_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,150.045,154.156,"Let’s find that map, we got several exhibits here."
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,160.482,154.156,Yes sir.
1974.31_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,177.39,188.83,"Mr. Boggs, are the parties’ now in agreement as to the two errors that were mentioned in the Special Master’s report, the state of that level --"
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,188.83,193.016,"The 4200.2 against 4200.8 in the 396,000 (Voice Overlap)"
1974.31_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,193.016,193.484,That’s correct.
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,193.484,194.571,"25,000."
1974.31_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,200.667,202.552,So that’s out of the case at this point.
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,202.552,203.105,Yes sir.
1974.31_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,203.105,208.021,"Mr. Boggs, you say that we’re discussing the inner darker and (Voice Overlap)"
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,208.021,209.791,The middle.
1974.31_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,209.791,216.724,That’s assuming that all of the circumference of the Lake were claimed by the United States though (Voice Overlap).
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,216.724,228.466,"Your Honor, it’s correct that we’re discussing specifically those areas in which the United States is the upland owner across that middle land."
1974.31_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,589.548,598.921,"Well, it wasn’t what the Court was addressing itself to, the contention to parties that along the Missouri River, great big pieces of the bank would sluff off."
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,601.937,633.757,"Well, Your Honor, I think that that was -- that was certainly the aspect that was before them and the Court in dealing with that said that you have to if the falling off of the bank in that instance is a result of essentially a seasonal flood that that itself does not change the ordinary rule that despite the fact that the river may move rapidly."
1974.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,648.788,671.656,Before you do Mr. Boggs and may be you have answered this -- these concepts of accretion and reliction and on the other hand the revulsion are well known of course to the law of rivers where the river is a boundary or either state boundary or boundary of somebody’s property in prior property disputes.
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,674.876,698.034,"I believe of the Supreme Court cases that this may be the only one, there are certainly numerous state court cases which refer the Lakes and of course the same rules have been applied on an ocean which is yet a third situation such as Hughes versus Washington which this Court decided some six or seven years ago."
1974.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,708.678,709.631,Yes.
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,710.418,716.225,"Well, reliction is normally what’s being talked of with regard to a lake that is, the water rises and falls."
1974.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,726.595,728.115,Bonelli case involved --
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,728.115,731.397,That was Bonelli involved the Colorado River which (Voice Overlap).
1974.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,731.397,735.703,Are there any federal cases involving a lake?
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,740.317,751.321,I couldn’t say. I know that certainly that it’s my impression that the dunes on the Great Lake are built up (Voice Overlap).
1974.31_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,751.321,754.525,I remember against Washington involving the Pacific Ocean.
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,754.525,757.604,I can’t call a specific case to your attention at the moment.
1974.31_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,757.604,768.091,"And really, you’re typical regimen in accretion case in a river is quite different from what the evidence shows here about Great Salt Lake."
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,780.537,782.142,"Well, you may or may not get that cut off."
1974.31_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,798.01,810.626,"One case that has applied the Doctrine of Reliction to a lake I guess is the decision of the Supreme Court of Utah in the Hardy case, applying at the Great Salt Lake."
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,812.678,813.451,Right.
1974.31_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,850.725,866.271,"Well you said that because of Bonelli, you haven’t look further into this Hardy case but I would have got the source of federal common law if that be what governs -- is presumably be the decisions of other courts."
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,889.395,912.954,"Well Your Honor, we would submit and I believe in our brief before the Special Master argued that even at that time we said, if you want to consider Hardy that the “uniqueness” which is really the underlying supposition of the Utah argument is based upon this temporary and seasonal fluctuations."
1974.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,957.619,970.045,"So, you think the reliction -- it would be called reliction if suddenly, all the waters that runs in to the -- all the streams that run into the Great Salt Lake were diverted?"
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,970.045,971.0,"Well Your Honor, that would --"
1974.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.0,978.056,"And then, the lake just hasn’t any water running into it and it just dries up."
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,979.329,982.047,That would either be several things that would apply there.
1974.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.104,1019.731,Think about it now -- would it be a reliction or not?
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1019.731,1023.624,"Well, we would have to look at exactly what the circumstances are."
1974.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1071.009,1073.91,Utah has been a (Inaudible)
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1073.91,1089.447,"Well, as Utah notes however, they claim the water back before where it was in 1896 back to the meander line which was the first time that man started drawing those lines."
1974.31_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1141.826,1155.397,I realize that the presumption applies in the cases of accretion but do the cases support you in saying that there’s the same sort of presumption where you are arguing for reliction?
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1155.397,1161.613,"The case in that sense if there -- the question is, is there a specific lake case that would hold that?"
1974.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1350.423,1363.383,"And what happens when the -- if you’re right, when the bottom of the Salt Lake becomes uncovered, there’s a reliction -- then what happens when its covered for another 20 years?"
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1363.383,1370.177,"Well, just the same way when the river moves when the lake goes back up as it has in the present time."
1974.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1374.77,1379.347,"Well then you pay them back, what would’ve paid you in this case?"
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1379.347,1385.209,"Well Your Honor, it’s going to cover that in the section on equities toward the end but I’ll handle it right now."
1974.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1388.459,1391.324,You’re asking them to pay you for (Voice Overlap) so you owned it.
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1391.324,1393.061,"At the bottom, the real difficult (Voice Overlap)."
1974.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1393.061,1393.958,when it’s not covered.
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1393.958,1398.259,"At the bottom, the real difficult that the United States had over this case, I think is not a legal one."
1974.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.498,1405.836,It may be underwater for quite a while for all you know.
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1405.836,1409.044,"We don’t know, that’s exactly the point."
1974.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.348,1433.868,That’s alright but you have another condition in your deed.
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1437.144,1437.802,That’s correct.
1974.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.248,1439.847,That’s a big difference.
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1439.847,1448.834,"But Your Honor, the question of who owns it -- we submit cannot turn on what -- on the specific of what’s happened to the Lake since then --"
1974.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1448.834,1452.194,"Well, it is but you’re relying on reliction."
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1452.194,1456.946,We’re relying on reliction as to the question of what was passed by that deed in --
1974.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.946,1460.681,If that relicted more or you would be relying more.
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1460.681,1461.103,No Your Honor.
1974.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1623.587,1624.319,"Yes, I have a question."
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1624.319,1629.869,"Yes, certainly."
1974.31_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1629.869,1637.79,"Utah on its brief on page 96, suggested a change in the first paragraph of the decree."
1974.31_orig,0,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1648.516,1659.528,"Your Honor, it's my understanding from the other people concerned with this other litigation that we would not be greatly distressed with theirs."
1974.31_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1686.453,1687.608,Thank you.
1974.31_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.608,1700.545,"Well except for these differences that divide you, would it be feasible for you to agree as to on a decree?"
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,1744.067,1746.662,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.31_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1746.662,1759.469,"Before you proceed, let me suggest that if you gentlemen find some area of common ground, literally and figuratively, you’ll let us know promptly, won’t you?"
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,1759.469,1759.995,We will.
1974.31_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1770.938,1772.118,At least speaking for myself.
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,1778.188,1785.731,"Well, let me spend just one second at the beginning with respect to the words “such as”."
1974.31_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2021.658,2027.747,"Are these inlets -- these streams coming in, all from the mountains?"
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2027.747,2031.415,They are all from the mountains.
1974.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2052.589,2054.293,"The petitioner has a video to deal with it, didn’t it?"
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2054.293,2064.418,"Yes, as Mr. Arnold of the United States geological survey explained at some length and I think it summarized to the extent of the brief."
1974.31_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2403.101,2407.906,"Well, that was partly because there were such sharp changes within even in a 24-hour period."
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2407.906,2409.082,Yes.
1974.31_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2409.082,2426.014,"I noticed that if he makes the observation that on June 6, or the water level rose and fell ten times that the lake level for that day averaged a stable level."
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2437.633,2447.471,"Well, not necessarily, I think that those calculations were based on some exhibits that we prepared and introduced which were not necessarily the wind tide days."
1974.31_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2504.29,2517.931,"Well, I suppose the difference between May and October in one particular year could be a great deal difference than the difference between May 1960 and May 1970."
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2517.931,2521.964,"Yes, that’s true."
1974.31_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2635.462,2637.483,You have to hold that a little bit higher for us.
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2637.483,2643.87,Is a one year period of time.
1974.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2828.347,2830.565,May I ask about the Exhibit 6?
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2830.565,2831.387,Yes.
1974.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2831.387,2835.92,I think much of the land in dispute is now under water?
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2835.92,2839.772,All of the land in dispute practically was under water at the time of the hearings.
1974.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2839.772,2847.864,"Well now, what are those pictures -- those I think you said to us, show some that is not -- some exposed lands in dispute."
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2847.864,2858.028,This exhibit has 22 black and white pictures which show the land now in dispute.
1974.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2858.028,2859.213,Exposed lands?
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2859.213,2862.328,Yes.
1974.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2873.929,2875.391,And the hearing was when.
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2875.391,2877.025,February of 1973.
1974.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2877.025,2881.166,And were they still exposed in 1973?
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2881.166,2881.527,No.
1974.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2892.919,2898.315,Then looking at these we’re not looking at the situation as it was at the time of hearing?
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2898.315,2903.467,You will if you look at the colored pictures because they were taken three or four days before the hearing.
1974.31_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2913.779,2917.984,"Was that difference, seasonal or long run?"
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2917.984,2922.083,"Well, it was a seasonal."
1974.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2936.085,2944.44,"And the consequence of that as to the lands in dispute being under water is more than ever around the world, is that right on December 1?"
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2944.44,2945.21,"I think so, yes."
1974.31_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3117.736,3125.506,What’s your answer of the governments’ contention that there’s a presumption that a change in boundary occurred by reliction.
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,3125.506,3127.354,I think that’s wholly irrelevant.
1974.31_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3190.43,3192.059,Mud lake was drained.
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,3192.059,3197.419,It was drained for the purpose of permanent agricultural pursuit.
1974.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3316.463,3319.745,You said that the state owns the minerals beneath the bed.
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,3319.745,3320.909,Yes.
1974.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3320.909,3325.76,Wasn't there some reservation in the United States of minerals?
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,3327.298,3339.672,There was a reservation in the deed that the United States gave to the State of Utah -- the State of Utah does not claim that by virtue of any conveyance in the United States.
1974.31_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3353.598,3355.747,So the reservation then is beneath.
1974.31_orig,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,3355.747,3356.713,Would have no effect.
1974.31_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3403.15,3403.849,Do you have anything further.
1974.31_orig,2,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,3405.812,3406.766,"Yes, very briefly."
1974.31_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3535.653,3536.513,Thank you gentlemen.
