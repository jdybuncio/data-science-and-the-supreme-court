1986.86-5375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.075,"We will hear arguments next in No1 86-5375, Christopher Burger versus Ralph Kemp."
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,12.042,14.839,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-5375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,165.855,171.977,"When you say, he directed him, what do you mean by that, Mr. Nursey?"
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,171.977,176.288,"He... as Chris was starting to walk away, the co-indictee said, we have to get rid of the cab."
1986.86-5375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,180.006,183.426,Was he a superior officer or something like that?
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,183.426,185.159,He was an older person.
1986.86-5375,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,336.053,340.13,"By Chris, you mean the petitioner here, Mr. Burger?"
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,340.13,340.442,--Yes.
1986.86-5375,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,475.185,477.434,"Counsel... counsel, may I ask this question?"
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,477.434,477.777,--Yes.
1986.86-5375,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,477.777,486.04,"How did your client, Mr. Burger, get into the United States Army if his mental capacity was that of a 12-year-old child?"
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,486.04,495.817,"Justice Powell, at the time that he was enlisted into the Army, this was in the early years of the all-volunteer Army."
1986.86-5375,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,514.965,520.525,Did the jury at the sentencing hearing know the age of the defendant?
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,520.525,523.134,They knew that he was 17.
1986.86-5375,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,529.302,538.519,"Did counsel argue at that time, or has it been argued at anytime since, that it's unconstitutional to impose a death sentence on a minor?"
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,538.519,545.328,"The counsel at trial never made that argument, either at trial or on appeal."
1986.86-5375,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,580.471,581.111,So it's never been raised?
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,581.111,581.83,No.
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,585.281,588.296,Mr. Nursey?
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,588.296,589.373,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.373,594.028,How would this information have gotten to the jury?
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,620.799,621.485,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,669.794,670.747,--Are was sure about that?
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,680.913,684.537,There's nothing to indicate that.
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,740.843,745.184,"Well, he had talked to Chris about it for, what, about six hours in all?"
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,745.184,750.698,"--A total of about five, if the time records are to be accepted."
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,750.698,757.992,And was all of this information volunteered by your client?
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,761.459,762.818,This is very significant.
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,807.205,810.767,So we don't know that the lawyer knew all of this that you're telling us and didn't put it on?
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,810.767,812.75,He apparently didn't know.
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,954.07,955.1,How were they tried?
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,957.66,957.863,Okay.
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.81,980.73,"So both for the guilt phase and the penalty phase, your client came first?"
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,980.73,981.573,That's correct.
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1010.607,1012.295,"Well, you have to rely on that, don't you?"
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1031.803,1037.535,There are two different... two important factors about that.
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1091.888,1093.184,"Well, doesn't that cut against your argument?"
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1109.068,1116.612,"He put on the defense, to an extent, but he would have no credibility in this small town."
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1118.815,1119.221,He came first.
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1120.095,1129.263,"--But at the second trial... it came first, but that doesn't mean the community didn't know that's what the defenses were at the first trial."
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1129.263,1130.372,How could they know it?
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1130.372,1131.543,But certainly by the second trial.
1986.86-5375,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1192.224,1200.909,Is there any indication in the record that the prosecutor would have accepted a deal like that?
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1211.373,1217.307,I think the prosecutor would not have had any trouble accepting a deal for a 17-year-old.
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.739,1234.143,"Well, now wait, he had an eyewitness who was riding in the car."
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1234.143,1236.284,Up until the point where--
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.284,1236.626,Right.
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1236.626,1237.001,--Yes.
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1237.001,1237.47,That's right.
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1253.386,1254.979,I'm certainly not going to argue--
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1254.979,1256.635,With the fellow still in the trunk.
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1256.635,1260.009,"--I'm certainly not going to argue, Justice Scalia, that it's not a strong case."
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1260.493,1270.316,Do you think there was any chance that you'd take a plea bargain in order to get additional... additional evidence of whether they committed the crime or not?
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1270.316,1277.424,"--Most capital cases are plea bargained, and it generally doesn't have a whole lot to do with the strength of the case."
1986.86-5375,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1304.133,1308.35,"You say he couldn't have offered it, but he testified to the contrary, didn't he?"
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1322.033,1330.856,"--He made those conclusory statements in his testimony, that yes, I would have crucified Stevens had I had the opportunity to do so."
1986.86-5375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1402.235,1409.107,"Well, Mr. Nursey, we appoint counsel here on occasion for people who don't have counsel."
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1415.073,1423.711,--I'm not arguing that it's constitutionally required to have consultation with the client before the appointment of counsel is made.
1986.86-5375,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1441.874,1448.497,"But Mr. Nursey, do you think there's a flat rule against appointing two law partners to represent co-defendants in a case like this?"
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1448.497,1449.762,In a capital case--
1986.86-5375,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1449.762,1454.822,"I mean, are you asking us... maybe that's what you want us to do in this case, is hold there is a per se rule."
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1454.822,1461.32,"--I don't think the Court needs to go that far in this case, but yes, I believe there should be a flat rule against appointing law partners in a--"
1986.86-5375,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.32,1470.848,"Because if you don't have a flat rule, I don't know what good it would do to talk to this not very intelligent young man about whether he sees any problems of conflict of interest in appointing two law partners."
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1478.828,1482.42,"--They couldn't work together, because the interest was so divergent in the two cases."
1986.86-5375,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1489.059,1494.447,But isn't that potential almost always there where you have two accomplices in this kind of a transaction?
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1495.822,1499.008,"That potential is almost always there, but--"
1986.86-5375,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1499.008,1501.71,"--it's fairly obvious that one is going to say, the other was more to blame than I, or something like that."
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1501.71,1506.77,"--That potential is almost always there, but that doesn't actually occur in every case."
1986.86-5375,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1522.92,1540.491,But in fact what you're complaining about is that that defense was made which is precisely the defense that you claim a conflict of interest would induce not to be made; and that that defense was not made which a conflict of interest would have caused to be used instead.
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1540.491,1542.725,The fact--
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1542.725,1557.28,"That is to say, this lawyer relied on the fact that his client had not done as much as the other defendant, which you would think the conflict of interest, if that's what he was worried about, he wouldn't have made that argument."
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1561.997,1563.607,--He made... he made--
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.607,1566.184,--fellow came from a bad background and all of that.
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1566.184,1569.978,"--He made that argument, but he couldn't have made that argument with any credibility."
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1569.978,1573.024,I don't understand why you say that.
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1575.945,1587.067,"Because at the time of the second sentencing trial, of the 36 jurors that the record reflects responses for, 23 answered that they knew about this case."
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1600.045,1609.292,"You think it'd make a difference to the jury that they knew it was two partners in the same firm who were making inconsistent arguments, as opposed to two different lawyers?"
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1609.292,1610.417,"--Yes, I think--"
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1610.417,1611.744,Suppose they had known that--
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1611.744,1618.617,"--if they think it's two unrelated lawyers, they can sit there and judge out, now which one do we believe from the evidence we've heard."
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1618.617,1619.023,--Right.
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1619.023,1619.913,When there's two law partners--
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.913,1621.208,They'd still have to say one of them's lying.
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1621.208,1622.114,--Pardon?
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1622.114,1626.799,"I mean, they'd still have to conclude, one of them is wrong, or one of them is lying."
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1626.799,1626.955,That's right.
1986.86-5375,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1639.857,1649.275,"Yes, but insofar as your client is concerned, the only conclusion that is relevant is that one of them is lying, and that's the same conclusion that the jury would draw, whether they were partners from the same firm or not."
1986.86-5375,0,32175,joseph_m_nursey,,1649.275,1656.928,"I think if they knew that it was people who were related and working together, they'd look at as, the law firm is lying to us."
1986.86-5375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1797.012,1798.622,"Thank you, Mr. Nursey."
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,1800.355,1807.353,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-5375,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1924.416,1933.819,"Mr. Hill, is it... is it common for a state judge in your state to appoint law partners to represent codefendants?"
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,1933.819,1937.677,"--It is not uncommon, Your Honor."
1986.86-5375,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1937.677,1938.847,It is not uncommon?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,1938.847,1939.941,It is not uncommon.
1986.86-5375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.987,1992.077,"Well, it would have been... you say he tried to engage in plea negotiations after the... after the overturning of the first death sentence."
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,1992.077,1992.765,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-5375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.765,1996.716,But by that time the district attorney has the conviction in his pocket.
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,1996.716,1999.184,"Yes, he has the conviction in his pocket."
1986.86-5375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.948,2046.822,Were both death sentences reversed on appeal?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2046.822,2047.228,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-5375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.197,2053.679,So he could have offered his testimony on the penalty phase?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2054.804,2058.083,--He could have offered it.
1986.86-5375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2082.089,2088.117,xxx Burger's confession introduced against the other defendant?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2088.117,2089.195,"No, Your Honor, it was not."
1986.86-5375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2089.195,2090.633,So that's why he'd want it.
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2090.633,2102.174,"Stevens had also confessed in intricate detail to all the facts and circumstances of the crime, including the oral and anal sexual assault of this fellow soldier who they killed."
1986.86-5375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2103.596,2106.11,What was done during this nine-month period?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2106.11,2124.306,"Mr. Leaphart testified that after his reversal on appeal, and his billing records to the County reflect, he had further conferences with the mother, with Christopher Burger, and even as... Mr. Leaphart testified to and the record reflects that the jury was out for a period of time before returning the original sentence of death."
1986.86-5375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2180.55,2183.157,What is the answer to my... what did he do?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2183.157,2188.515,"He consulted again with his client, with his client's mother, and those were the only two individuals--"
1986.86-5375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2188.515,2193.012,And what else did he do during the nine-month period?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2193.012,2197.823,"--He consulted with his client, his client's mother, the only two individuals known to him."
1986.86-5375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2204.789,2211.802,Did he do any investigating at all of any kind or any fashion?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2213.552,2219.565,Mr. Leaphart testified that he was never given any information by his client or his client's mother on which to move.
1986.86-5375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2219.565,2220.814,Then your answer is nothing?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2220.814,2223.282,"No, Your Honor, that is not my answer."
1986.86-5375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2223.891,2225.969,[inaudible]
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2225.969,2229.513,--He reevaluated the case in consultation with his client.
1986.86-5375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2229.513,2230.184,Reevaluating.
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2230.919,2232.293,"No, Your Honor."
1986.86-5375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2247.896,2251.051,When did he find out he had an IQ of 12?

1986.86-5375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2254.003,2255.424,When?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2255.424,2257.705,"--I'm trying to answer the Court's question, Your Honor."
1986.86-5375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2257.705,2258.892,My answer is when.
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2259.923,2262.655,Prior to trial.
1986.86-5375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2266.888,2262.655,When?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2268.34,2271.933,"Prior to trial, Your Honor."
1986.86-5375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2339.187,2343.654,xxx seven months?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2347.824,2351.464,"Your Honor, I'll be honest with you, I cannot remember that specifically from the record."
1986.86-5375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2352.745,2353.603,That's perfectly all right.
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2355.415,2357.649,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-5375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2567.346,2568.251,"Mr. Hill, can I interrupt you for just a second?"
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2583.089,2584.308,"--Yes, Your Honor, he was."
1986.86-5375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2745.82,2747.913,"But did he use the words, ""anything good about you""?"
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2747.913,2749.397,"He said, anything good about you."
1986.86-5375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.712,2785.757,So your position is that Leaphart had all this information and elected not to use it.
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2788.944,2794.425,"Your Honor, the record reflects that what Mr. Leaphart had is the information I have been detailing to the Court."
1986.86-5375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2795.847,2803.313,"Well, did he have information that your opponent opened his argument... he spent about three or four minutes describing his very difficult background as a young man."
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2803.313,2803.954,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-5375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2803.954,2805.858,Was that information known to Leaphart?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2805.858,2806.686,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-5375,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2927.951,2928.872,"You say, testified."
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2930.169,2938.134,--Swore in the affidavit that Christopher Burger was a bright child; totally contrary to the representations made by counsel here today.
1986.86-5375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2955.44,2958.704,Would a jury conclude from that that he was nuts?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2958.704,2964.936,"Your Honor, it is not... it is not impossible that a jury could conclude that."
1986.86-5375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2964.936,2966.559,[inaudible]
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,2966.559,2983.225,"But it is also reasonable for Mr. Leaphart to have decided, if that testimony had been made available to him, which his testimony, unrefuted, was that he did not have it; but if it had been made available it would not have been unreasonable for Mr. Leapart to adhere to his original strategy."
1986.86-5375,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3012.167,3018.852,May I ask one other just... did his co-indictee also get the death penalty on the retrial?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,3018.852,3021.147,"Yes, Your Honor, he did, and he's presently under the death sentence."
1986.86-5375,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3021.147,3022.459,Is he still alive?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,3022.459,3023.709,"Yes, Your Honor, he is."
1986.86-5375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3257.489,3262.269,"Well, the Court of Appeals, did it say the instruction was erroneous or not?"
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,3262.269,3265.815,"Your Honor, this case was remanded to the Circuit Court."
1986.86-5375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3265.815,3266.144,Yes.
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,3266.144,3270.407,"The Circuit Court at that time had before it the decision in Franklin, not yet Rose v. Clark."
1986.86-5375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3280.997,3281.497,And you defend that?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,3281.497,3287.605,"Your Honor, I'll agree, that these facts... if this is not a harmless error case, Your Honor, there doesn't exist one."
1986.86-5375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3293.695,3294.757,There's no error at all?
1986.86-5375,1,44930,william_b_hill_jr,,3294.757,3295.741,"--Yes, that's right, Your Honor."
1986.86-5375,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3307.159,3307.909,"Thank you, Mr. Hill."
