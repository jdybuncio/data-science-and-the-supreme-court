1966.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4229.103,4240.215,"But there was nothing in your agreement with the District to the effect that the District will not permit any other railroad to use the tracking that's within the District, was there?"

1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4243.827,4244.099,No.
1966.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4244.099,4255.759,"Now the ICC nine years ago, an order authorizing these railroads -- these other railroads to build up to the District, is that right?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4255.759,4256.799,That's right.
1966.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4256.799,4258.627,What's happen in those nine years?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4261.396,4272.675,"Well, the short answer sir is that because of the applicants inability to negotiate a satisfactorily lease agreement between the six operating railroads in the Port District."
1966.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4310.567,4318.231,And what happen between 62 and 65 on the District Court in its order?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4318.231,4326.934,Various pleadings were filed before the Interstate Commerce Commission and the complaints and supplemental complaints filed before the three-judge District Court.
1966.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4332.508,4335.14,"So this is sort of part of course, isn't it?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4335.14,4337.255,"You might say that, yes, sir."
1966.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4337.255,4339.248,"For transport, isn't it?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4339.248,4340.863,"Yes, that's right."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4340.863,4347.887,"Well, if the -- is the support fully develop now in the sense that whatever plans they worked for it have now been --"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4347.887,4348.949,Not at all Your Honor.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4364.135,4369.177,"In other words, the project had to been contemplated in some 10% complete now."
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4369.177,4370.146,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4370.146,4372.305,And the thing was at 1957?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4372.305,4373.688,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4373.688,4377.942,Why should I -- I must confess it's a complete confusion.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4387.051,4388.388,"Well, that would be there contention."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4392.931,4396.246,Why -- why is ridiculous in terms of number of cars.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4398.799,4399.319,It's about -- right.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4399.319,4400.863,Everything comes in on Rock Island?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4400.863,4401.389,That's right.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4401.389,4405.88,And that's because you pick up any traffic of those roads as well as others directed to the port.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4405.88,4407.634,That's right.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4417.921,4435.504,The things are moving half of these could be involved that they have Michigan attempts not the only competition would be involved is that competition for carriage of the traffic from in this -- to or from an industry inside the Port to where it is that you pick up this simply traffic now?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4435.504,4436.462,It's about right.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4436.462,4438.913,"I mean, how many miles is that?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4438.913,4439.732,And that's why we say that --
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4439.732,4442.245,60 miles or -- 60 or?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4442.245,4444.11,--with just within the Chicago switching District.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4446.603,4449.993,Is that the only -- is that the only rate of constitution that you really thought about?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4449.993,4455.782,"As far as the New York Central is concerned because we operate to the west and to the southwest, of New York Central of east."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4455.782,4464.684,All -- all these paints all about is to do -- has the great privilege of carrying within the District at some rail head and also with --
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4464.684,4465.107,"Oh, no."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4486.504,4488.835,Because some of this at the same destination with --
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4488.835,4489.767,"Yes, sir."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4489.767,4506.562,"And right now, no one would choose to have sent -- to send some traffic to a destination you serve over some other railroad concerning the same destination because it has to be a switching charge with and delay --"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4506.562,4509.001,"That's generally correct Mr. Justice White, yes."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4509.001,4511.928,"So as long as you're in there, you got a --"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4511.928,4512.764,We that -- that --
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4512.764,4513.455,-- you got an operator --
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4513.455,4514.046,The railroad --
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4514.046,4514.772,-- you think you served.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4514.772,4523.437,-- the railroad that serves the industry is locally general controls the tracks and that's why we seek to keep these applicants out.
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4523.437,4535.653,What is the difference in these people by reasonable fact that is (Inaudible)?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4535.653,4537.281,"I'm sorry Mr. Chief Justice, I --"
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4537.281,4540.88,The six railroads want to come in.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4540.88,4541.214,Yes.
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4541.214,4549.766,"They can't come in hour and a half, they have to take your service (Inaudible) at the end of the District --"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4549.766,4551.079,"Yes, sir."
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4551.079,4555.622,What is that that cost you then?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4555.622,4559.449,This evidence on this subject was offered in great detail at the hearing.
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4591.186,4595.273,(Inaudible)
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4595.273,4599.154,Generally speaking that's correct.
1966.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4599.154,4608.726,(Inaudible)
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4608.726,4612.051,So -- some of amount we admit but --
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4612.051,4613.002,-- substantially --
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4613.002,4614.086,It's not substantial.
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4632.058,4636.995,And substantially (Inaudible) --
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4636.995,4638.066,We submit not.
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4638.066,4638.627,I beg your pardon?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4638.627,4646.76,We submit that it would not -- it wouldn't benefit the shipper because of this so-called terminal switching allowances are absorbed by the line whole carrier.
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4652.006,4654.384,May I ask you this one other question.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4664.64,4666.376,There are number of factors.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4693.219,4695.471,Is that true of all the ports?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4695.471,4696.709,I think by and large that's true.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4696.709,4701.982,"I mean, this isn't just a question of carrying a harbor not being able to compete against other ports --"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4701.982,4702.316,"Yes, sir."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4704.749,4706.328,Which -- which is right?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4706.328,4708.476,That it would affect all ports.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4708.476,4710.391,And the other ports have the same experience?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4710.391,4711.286,I think that's correct.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4711.286,4716.205,There may have been rosy predictions other ports and they haven't found it either is that what you think?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4716.205,4717.286,I think that maybe correct.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4717.756,4724.804,"Do you think -- well, how do you know then that this isn't Calumet Harbor its effort?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4757.224,4758.841,I submit that that's not the case here.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4769.128,4772.338,The trouble is that none of this -- in the record material is that --
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4772.338,4773.034,There's the trouble.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4779.799,4783.661,Didn't you ask to say -- didn't ask the ICC to take notice of the same thing?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4783.661,4784.597,Yes.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4784.597,4785.493,What they say to you?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4785.493,4788.143,They refuse to do it and we consider that as an abuse of discretion.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4788.143,4795.221,-- why should we second guess the ICC on the relevance or the significance of this kind of information that's been there business to deal with?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4795.221,4798.324,"We don't ask this Court, sir to take -- to second guess to the ICC."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4798.324,4801.05,Isn't that exactly what you ask the ICC?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4801.05,4802.076,"No, we're not."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4803.242,4805.995,Well then why shouldn't you ask them first?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4805.995,4807.624,We did asked the inters --
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4807.624,4809.771,So you are asking us the same as you ask them?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4809.771,4811.058,I won't agree with you sir.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4811.058,4811.799,You're asking us --
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4811.799,4812.205,We're asking this Court --
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4812.205,4813.435,-- and the Court of Appeals --
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4813.435,4818.552,-- we're asking this Court to determine whether or not the District Court below applied the proper standards of review correctly.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4818.552,4820.866,"Well, that's to affirm the Court of Appeals, don't you?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4820.866,4822.025,"The District Court, three-judge court --"
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4822.025,4823.64,This defining the District Court now?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4823.64,4824.183,That's right.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4824.183,4825.98,"And then you walk out here victory, you know."
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4826.973,4828.579,That's right.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4829.905,4830.42,You want one?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4830.42,4833.145,If I -- if I may correct my statement.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4839.319,4841.271,Further hearings on what?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4841.271,4844.918,On all issues before the Commerce Commission in the first place.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4844.918,4847.065,I see.
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4847.065,4861.118,May I ask one more question as you asked the (Inaudible)?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4861.118,4862.023,"Yes, sir."
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4905.075,4914.878,(Inaudible)
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4914.878,4916.2,That's true.
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4916.2,4917.738,(Inaudible)
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4917.738,4918.196,That's right.
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4924.821,4935.718,I just want to (Inaudible)?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4935.718,4940.331,"No, we don't contend that, Your Honor."
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4940.331,4946.781,(Inaudible)
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,4946.781,4949.666,"No, we don't contend that here."
1966.15,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5119.645,5126.211,"Mr. Desch, what's your conception to what would be the proper evidence the support finding of fact?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5126.211,5128.375,It's a very difficult question Your Honor.
1966.15,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5136.06,5138.453,I'm just wondering if there would be any right.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5138.453,5138.983,"Oh, I see."
1966.15,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5138.983,5140.834,To which you would say those proper evidences?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5140.834,5142.422,I think there would be --
1966.15,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5142.422,5142.826,But what?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5143.797,5164.613,"That the additional bonds had been sold by the Chicago Regional Port District and that they have additional revenues with which to construct the additional grain elevators, piers, back up warehouses, and transit sheds."
1966.15,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5167.205,5171.748,"Which if they have the traffic they might (Inaudible), is it not?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5171.748,5173.922,"That's quite possible, Your Honor."
1966.15,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5173.922,5186.55,If there's any indication (Inaudible)?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5186.55,5188.681,"I can answer to that only to this extent, Your Honor."
1966.15,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5224.213,5225.361,What page is that Mr. Desch?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5225.361,5230.78,That is page 55 of Rock Island brief --
1966.15,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5230.78,5231.239,Thank you.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5231.239,5242.228,"-- and it's ICC Exhibit number H2 and what it is, is a photograph of a Plaster Perez Model of what the developers of the port had in mind would be done in the future."
1966.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5269.423,5272.254,I suppose it's arguably counsel that --
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5272.254,5272.888,Sir?
1966.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5272.888,5289.883,"I suppose it's arguable and it hadn't been this nine-year delay, this railroad have been allowed to go ahead as the ICC order would have permitted that situation at Lake Calumet would have been improved."
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5303.34,5304.426,It's certainly arguable.
1966.15,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5354.244,5358.043,We have hardcore in this case Mr. Desch?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5358.043,5359.493,"Yes, sir."

1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5362.843,5373.62,"You've -- now, the ICC is a -- had a -- the interesting to this before the -- you file with this for the reconsiderations on its basis?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5374.035,5374.392,"Yes, it did."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5374.392,5374.999,That's what you do?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5374.999,5375.519,Certainly did.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5376.284,5379.36,"And what the --what the District Court, three-judge court --"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5379.36,5380.469,That's correct.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5380.469,5391.192,"Now, you're up here and each stage of the ICC look at your evidence, listen to all this and said it wasn't surmise then and this isn't surmise now apparently."
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5393.685,5396.892,I stand correct and they abuse their discretion in so holding.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5397.285,5403.786,And you want us to say that the ICC have to reappraised this particular evidence to say the ICC really doesn't want us to?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5403.786,5405.109,Not at all.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5407.66,5410.088,-- do know what they're talking about.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5410.088,5414.931,All we ask this Court to do is to find that the District Court was correct when it conceived --
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5414.931,5416.427,"In fact, they did know what you're talking about."
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5416.427,5424.96,When it can -- when it concluded that the crucial findings of the Commerce Commission were not supported by substantial evidence.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5424.996,5427.119,Because they really didn't know what they're talking about.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5427.119,5428.667,That's right.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5428.667,5434.734,Definitely know.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5434.734,5445.489,"Now, the appellants here they set up a straw man then when they accused us in the District Court of failing to accord the Commission's expertise its due."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5499.612,5508.809,"I know Mr. Desch you told us amicus that finding as the future was based purely on conjecture etcetera, etcetera."
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5520.323,5520.717,"Yes, sir."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5520.717,5526.187,And I think Mr. O'Brien mentioned the head of some very large terminal company --
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5526.187,5527.493,Terminal Company.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5529.334,5529.554,About what?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5529.554,5531.053,-- as to the future would hold.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5531.053,5537.078,"I know that what you said, but what other other evidence besides those two, is my question."
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5537.078,5537.433,That the --
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5537.433,5538.426,On the same nature?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5538.426,5549.742,That so many tons of years of shipping traffic head in prior years moved down the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway route in years.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5557.066,5559.781,Now anything else?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5559.781,5576.006,"Yes, sir."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5594.127,5594.524,Yes.

1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5621.549,5622.937,You ask this?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5622.937,5624.109,"No, I don't."
1966.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5705.751,5716.877,Was there any evidence to show or was there any findings to show that granting certificate to the other railroad would increase the transport?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5716.877,5719.315,No such findings Your Honor.
1966.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5719.315,5723.589,What you have is nine years later that has not increase in value?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5723.589,5723.89,That is --
1966.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5723.89,5727.334,There's not been increase was then not feasible?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5727.334,5728.061,That is correct.
1966.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5739.171,5741.543,Are we to take it that's not of any importance?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5754.747,5760.381,It is the position of the Rock Island that it would not and there are no findings that --
1966.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5760.381,5763.81,That physique that it would?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5763.81,5766.144,"I'm really not sure Your Honor, to be honest with you."
1966.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5766.144,5777.978,You say there is no finding at all or no indication from the Commission that other carriers would insist the traffic?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5779.417,5784.187,I've -- to be -- in my view of it.
1966.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5787.249,5791.822,If there -- if the evidence is to show them?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5791.822,5796.252,"Well of course, they contended at the hearing that all of the evidence offered tended to show that --"
1966.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5796.252,5798.596,That's all the evidence?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5809.094,5809.501,"No, sir."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5816.006,5826.404,"Oh, I gather that Mr. Posner made this argument that this is one of the basis -- one of the basis for the -- one of the means for the Commission action."
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5831.464,5834.304,They expected because of the estimates made by witnesses for the applicants.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5834.304,5835.49,Who expected this?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5835.49,5836.119,The Commission.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5836.353,5837.077,Did they say it so?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5837.077,5838.485,The Commission expected the traffic --
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5838.485,5839.472,Did they say so?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5839.472,5840.065,"Yes, sir."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5840.065,5846.362,But why isn't a finding then if it is not that -- that you mean competitive service to generate traffic?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5846.362,5848.575,It is -- it is not a finding to that effect --
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5848.575,5848.834,What is the (Voice Overlap)?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5848.834,5853.17,-- Mr. Justice White.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5853.17,5857.249,"What's this finding Mr. Desch, its page 1411 of the record?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5861.654,5862.409,Which one sir?
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5862.409,5869.813,"That's at 1411 is in fact one those did they found supported by substantial support in record, yes."
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5877.245,5877.644,"Yes, sir."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5878.375,5887.672,"Well, isn't that the kind of finding that Mr. Posner was addressing himself to?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5887.672,5889.233,"I can see that it is, yes."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5889.233,5899.011,"Now, why isn't that sufficient to support the ultimate conclusion?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5899.011,5904.307,Because that finding was not base upon substantial evidence in the view of the court below.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5904.514,5914.804,The only -- the thing that puzzles me is the earlier findings which deal with the past and then as I understand this finding at 1411.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5949.391,5953.935,"Well, there's one that is one implication that may arise from reading that finding."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5954.668,5954.877,Yes.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5954.877,5962.42,"But still remains that the issue here, the issue below, was that finding supported by substantial evidence."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5963.366,5971.664,But what you're saying anyway is -- whatever the evidence maybe it's in those findings beginning at 1409 up to 1411 which preceded?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5971.664,5972.397,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5972.397,5973.82,And you don't think those were not?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,5973.82,5974.327,That's right.
1966.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6072.618,6082.848,What did you state that the evidence might consume without (Inaudible)?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6082.848,6089.499,"Well, the -- the shippers at the port of course appeared and testified in favor of the applications."

1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6118.74,6120.386,"No, not at all."
1966.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6121.041,6130.134,How can you (Inaudible)?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6130.134,6149.74,"Well, all I can do, Your Honor is to refer to the Universal Camera case and the reviewing court must consider the record as a whole including the body of evidence supposed to the Commission's view and making its determination whether or not the findings of the agency are supported by substantial evidence."
1966.15,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6272.488,6274.048,(Inaudible)
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6274.048,6275.699,What?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6275.699,6292.932,The overwhelming failure of any of these estimates to materialize is not only traceable to the disappointing effect seaway had on great lake shipping in general but at least in part to the lack of materialization of any of the plans and hopes for the development of Lake Calumet.
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6304.365,6318.916,(Inaudible)

1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6328.079,6344.651,"-- it is my understanding, if that is correct Mr. Chief Justice the depth of the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Welland Canal and all those other streams and waterways that had to be open is now at 27 feet graph as I understand it."
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6353.061,6381.03,We've been asking this a few years ago in the (Inaudible)?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6381.03,6381.492,That's right.
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6387.511,6397.083,(Inaudible)
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6397.083,6404.85,I believe that the 27 feet of graph is now possible in the whole route of the St. Lawrence Seaway.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6404.85,6404.901,Could you --
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6404.901,6406.556,There's one --
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6406.556,6421.366,"-- just take me on this if not you're the only railroad in there, now if the company -- if the company grains (Inaudible), I suppose that there's one place -- when you put it that's on a railroad?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6421.366,6424.467,"Yes, sir."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6424.467,6441.792,"If the company is to compete for that company, once they put in there, could the railroads really historically have railroads subjected to sell their lands to competitors of their customers?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6441.792,6442.116,Not at all.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6442.116,6447.08,If you got 300 -- did you got 300 acres of ground up there that I supposed you sell to industry?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6447.08,6448.429,"That's quite correct, Your Honor."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6448.429,6457.911,And that you wouldn't have any reluctance at all to set up a competitor that one of your customers?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6457.911,6463.882,Anybody who ships traffic on railroads would be a good prospect for a location in our railroad.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6463.882,6474.609,But the -- the way it is that the ports could have land to sell that I can invest to for the lease in the industry?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6474.609,6474.944,"Yes, sir."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6476.584,6480.677,And that you're not the only source of land wherein industrial locations --
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6480.677,6481.891,That's right.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6481.891,6483.645,But you are one of them?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6483.645,6484.965,That is correct.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6484.965,6491.289,"And that if the other railroads never would be -- they came in here all -- that they would not the only land, would they?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6492.647,6495.69,They would just be granting railroad service to shippers.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6495.69,6504.132,And that only would the overall of the -- so that we need a regulating the industrial development is up to the Port District?
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6504.132,6506.385,In the sense and insofar as its real property is concerned --
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6506.385,6506.776,Yes.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6506.776,6509.057,"-- where it doesn't own the land, it doesn't control it."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6509.057,6521.775,"Well, I think it's on the area (Inaudible) one way would be used to state an evidence as to the future of this case would be the Port District would issue more bonds and build more terminals, and warehouses, and all of that."
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6521.775,6523.823,That's correct.
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6525.974,6528.991,Only you on the terminal have land for that purpose within --
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6528.991,6529.361,"Oh, no."
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6542.677,6554.904,"Have you taken judicial knowledge of the fact that it increase in the number of railroads, would increase the business traveling through that point?"
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6554.904,6557.539,I respectfully suggest Your Honor that you couldn't --
1966.15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6557.539,6559.419,(Inaudible)
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6559.419,6573.598,-- as I don't consider that that is a fact that it was so well established that it is common knowledge to a people who are consider experts in the railroad business.
1966.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6632.72,6648.952,What did they -- did you say that at the time that this contract was laid between the District and the appellants of for use of the rail facilities within the District.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6650.768,6651.382,That is correct.
1966.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6665.684,6665.799,Well --
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6665.799,6668.585,They've negotiated that contract over a five-year period.
1966.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6668.993,6682.679,That your contract provides that when a final contract was entered into Court of Appeals exhaustion with the appellants that you're contract will terminate?

1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6730.237,6734.404,We realized that the Port District had a right to some compensation for its tracks.

1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6752.606,6754.173,"Well, they contend it that they were."
1966.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6761.679,6766.261,And now you're complaining because they gave you interim contract.
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6774.646,6777.486,We're not complaining about our contract with the Port District.

1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6915.827,6918.125,On the finally approved not exclusive use again.
1966.15,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6918.798,6925.415,"And the Commission denied you an opportunity to excuse, to be heard, to make argument that you sending out."
1966.15,2,42588,theodore_e_desch,,6925.415,6931.334,That is correct Your Honor.
1966.15,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6931.334,6933.526,Mr. Posner.
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,6933.526,6938.11,We return to Mr. Justice Fortas' question for a moment.
1966.15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6954.5,6955.272,(Inaudible)
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,6955.272,6957.33,"Oh, excuse me."
1966.15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7035.58,7038.558,Emphasis is on the hereafter?
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7038.558,7039.695,"Well, I -- no."
1966.15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7042.761,7046.011,"Inferentially, they found what you said."
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7050.372,7055.172,"Further it down the paragraph, I think it is expressed because the Commission says to --"
1966.15,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,7055.172,7056.586,What page now?
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7056.586,7070.277,"310, which it said, it would be a detriment and hindrance to the full and complete development of Lake Calumet Harbor if it were limited to the service of the single railroad."
1966.15,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7070.507,7080.888,"If that -- did it say to that these are the facts had increased railroad services, to bring more business to the board?"
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7084.126,7086.929,I wouldn't -- I wouldn't put it quite that way.
1966.15,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7113.063,7125.753,Did you find anything in the -- that indicates that they have finally that in here additional rail service going to increase the amount of business to be divided up among the parties?
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7125.753,7128.265,"No, I don't think the Commission found that."
1966.15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7140.084,7146.658,"Mr. Posner, what about that last sentence that starting at the bottom of page 310?"
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7168.455,7181.024,It was certainly the Commission's belief that the Port would grow and would have addi -- and would attract more service so that these additional railroads would be --
1966.15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7181.024,7189.946,But then -- can it be read and -- I must say although I have this difficulty so often with the ICC thing to prove.
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7203.108,7217.579,"I think -- I think what the Commission is saying is, there will be more traffic in business but unless additional service is authorize now at the outset of this development."
1966.15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7219.806,7222.215,Lake Calumet?
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7222.215,7223.21,Yes.
1966.15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7223.21,7229.033,"Is the St. Lawrence, this is the only entrance, the only way to the St. Lawrence Seaway, I gather?"
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7229.033,7229.405,Right.
1966.15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7231.07,7236.596,And -- and Lake Calumet wants -- there's going to be more traffic moving on the seaways?
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7236.596,7236.916,Right.
1966.15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7236.916,7243.901,"Than there ever has been and if Calumet wants to carry its share, it better get some more railroads, is that what it says?"
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7243.901,7246.333,Yes.
1966.15,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7246.333,7250.19,So that it depends on -- how did they arrive in there premises?
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7250.19,7250.858,That's true.
1966.15,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7252.408,7256.775,"It doesn't depend on whether the railroads observed were going to increase, didn't it?"
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7256.775,7258.226,"Correct, yes."
1966.15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7271.685,7283.212,"You mean more than those that I have referred to earlier Mr. Posner, at 14 or is it 1409 to 1411 of the opinions still more than those?"
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7283.212,7287.4,That -- that is the Commission's finding but I'm referring to the testimony that --
1966.15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7287.4,7287.724,I see.
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7287.724,7288.666,-- that supports that finding.
1966.15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7288.666,7290.158,"Oh, the actual evidence."
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7290.158,7291.095,"Yes, the actual."
1966.15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7291.095,7291.391,Yes.
1966.15,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7291.391,7296.338,But the railroad said it has been adequate up today?
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7296.338,7297.633,The Commission is correct.
1966.15,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7298.255,7308.849,"Then that incidental one, the railroad service in not needed unless that is the future entity by reason of the port?"
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7308.849,7310.159,That's true.
1966.15,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7323.605,7324.905,They needed the railroads?
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7324.905,7325.439,Yes.
1966.15,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7325.439,7328.877,They need the railroads is only if they have increased of?
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7328.877,7335.31,"Well, needed the railroads to induce Great Lake shippers --"
1966.15,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7335.31,7336.912,Does it say that?
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7336.912,7342.392,That -- that is how I read the language of the Commission's opinion and it is certainly much supporting --
1966.15,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7342.392,7344.065,It's been nine years now.
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7345.887,7348.96,"Well, as I mention originally to be --"
1966.15,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7348.96,7350.917,"Well, that proves the conduct they taken --"
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7350.917,7352.287,To put it very concretely.
1966.15,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7379.23,7383.251,"Well, isn't that another way Mr. Posner of saying that no the port hasn't grown."
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7389.729,7390.397,That's correct.
1966.15,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7390.397,7391.034,That's what you're saying?
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7391.034,7391.917,Yes.
1966.15,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7391.917,7396.688,"So that's not what they based it on I guess, isn't it?"
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7396.688,7409.03,They did recognize that unless and stated that unless this additional service was authorized the Port might not fulfill its promise.
1966.15,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7414.4,7417.815,(Inaudible)
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7425.614,7426.699,That's correct.
1966.15,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7426.699,7431.924,-- terminal that where they would regularly (Inaudible) as to what kind of service?
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7431.924,7441.399,"Well, if you take it from the standpoint of the grain merchants say located in the Iowa, some place like that."
1966.15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7500.652,7501.892,1065 of the (Inaudible) --
1966.15,3,40232,richard_a_posner,,7501.892,7503.281,Yes.
1966.15,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7529.185,7530.083,Very well.
