1996.95-1605,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.076,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-1605, United States v. Miguel Gonzalez."
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,14.262,18.483,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1605,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,74.289,92.842,"Mr. Estrada, do you take the position that section 924(c) requires the separate sentence given for that violation to run before any other sentence, or could it be required after any other sentence?"
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,107.49,111.704,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, but let me back up."
1996.95-1605,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,120.32,123.853,And you don't take the position that it has to always be first?
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,123.853,129.797,"No, and in many circumstances it will not be able to be first."
1996.95-1605,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,129.797,130.205,Right.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,130.765,158.855,"In this case, for example, in order to give effect to both the statutory authority to make the drug sentences concurrent with the State terms and to the statutory mandate that the 924 sentence be consecutive, the Bureau of Prisons would have to run the Federal drug sentence first, concurrent with the State sentence, and to run the 924(c) sentence last, consecutive to both State and Federal sentences."
1996.95-1605,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,208.578,210.258,Do the States have to go along with that?
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,221.746,222.597,No.
1996.95-1605,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,222.597,224.927,Or is there some control on that discretion?
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,224.927,227.528,The State sentence is independent.
1996.95-1605,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,240.728,261.291,"My question was, does the Bureau of Prisons have discretion to say in a particular case to the State, we're going to allow all the Federal sentences to run first, and then you can do whatever you want, or, we're going to require that part of our sentence be served, then part of your sentence served, then the remaining part of ours, or can... is there... does... is there some supremacy principle where the Federal Government can direct this if the States object?"
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,261.291,265.075,"Not in those terms, Justice Kennedy."
1996.95-1605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.788,336.75,"Mr. Estrada, I can agree with your... with the Government's position that the statute as written does not compel the States to make their sentences nonconcurrent, but why is it not the case that, after you've had the Federal sentence imposed and then a State sentence is imposed and the State says, well, we're not bound by this Federal statute, we will have this run concurrently with the Federal sentence, why does not the Federal sentence at that point become in violation of the statute, because it is now a sentence that is being served concurrently with another sentence."
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,336.75,346.327,"That view might have some weight, Justice Scalia, if all there were to this statute would be the single clause, nor shall any sentence be made."
1996.95-1605,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,404.126,405.215,Then everything's going to turn on whose sentence is first.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,405.616,406.187,"Excuse me, Justice--"
1996.95-1605,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,406.187,409.62,Then everything... then the result is simply going to turn on whose sentence is first.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,428.219,430.913,"--There are two answers to that question, Justice Souter."
1996.95-1605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,478.154,482.436,So I guess you would say that the State could... let's... it imposes its sentence first.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,499.737,500.138,If that is--
1996.95-1605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,500.138,501.76,So the State could in effect frustrate this by--
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,501.76,504.821,--If that is a course that is allowed by State law--
1996.95-1605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,504.821,505.852,--By State law it would be all right.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,505.852,526.575,"--that is absolutely true, Justice Scalia, and the same would be true if he went back to the Governor of the State and told them, I have received an unduly long sentence, would you please exercise your discretion under State law to make my State sentence go away, and to thereby remove the predicate for the consecutive sentence in the Federal court."
1996.95-1605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,546.377,551.061,"Mr. Estrada, that's certainly a reasonable interpretation, but it's not what the statute says."
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,557.056,558.745,"--Oh, I think both, Justice Stevens."
1996.95-1605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,558.745,560.698,"Because it says... it's a flat prohibition, as Justice Scalia pointed out."
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,560.698,570.893,"Well, as I indicated to Justice Scalia, Justice Stevens, it is our view, and we think it's right--"
1996.95-1605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,570.893,571.735,That it should be read that way.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,571.735,572.396,--No.
1996.95-1605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,607.979,608.868,It doesn't say that.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,634.446,637.138,"--I have two answers to your question, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,653.637,659.332,"--Before you go to the second, and I want you to get there, what is it earlier in the statute that's inconsistent with that sentence?"
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,660.694,662.544,"--Well, there are two things, Justice Stevens."
1996.95-1605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,672.1,677.704,"Yes, but that doesn't cut any ice, because this last sentence clearly contemplates, not concurrent with State or Federal sentences."
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,677.704,683.668,"--Well, that's right as an instructions to the Federal court as to what they may order."
1996.95-1605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,683.668,684.298,Right.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,684.298,686.61,It doesn't really speak to the State courts as to what--
1996.95-1605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,686.61,689.963,"Well, and then the first part of the sentence it says, we're just talking about a sentence for Federal crimes."
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,693.585,696.946,"--No, but the... let me make two further points."
1996.95-1605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.946,698.588,"You have another point, I know, yes."
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,698.588,701.74,"Well, there was a second part to my first point--"
1996.95-1605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.74,702.809,He keeps thinking of more as we--
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,704.271,705.112,"--Excuse me, Justice Scalia, I'm sorry."
1996.95-1605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.112,705.631,"Well, you--"
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,710.186,710.486,Yes.
1996.95-1605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,710.486,711.107,--that preceded it.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,711.107,711.996,And I was getting to that--
1996.95-1605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,711.996,712.277,Yes.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,712.277,734.632,"--which is that the language that Justice Scalia read in isolation, which we concede would bear that reading, doesn't really have a subject, and it is part of a sentence that starts with, the court shall not, and in our view in that context it is most reasonable to read the court as the Federal court, as the subject that--"
1996.95-1605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,734.632,734.982,"I mean, and--"
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,734.982,737.214,--is implicit in the clause that uses the passive voice.
1996.95-1605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,737.214,741.755,"--I mean, anyway, most sentencing statutes are phrased in the passive voice or refer to the defendant."
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,743.976,746.6,"Well, that's right, and most sentence--"
1996.95-1605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,746.6,751.732,"And so I take it your point is, like all other sentencing statutes this is meant to talk about the obligation of the judge."
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,751.732,752.741,"--Of the general court, that is correct."
1996.95-1605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,752.741,754.443,But this one is phrased that way.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,761.988,763.851,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,785.334,790.678,What principle says that you must infer a subject for a sentence in the passive voice?
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,790.678,792.299,--Well--
1996.95-1605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,792.299,794.098,"Is that a principle of grammar, or something?"
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,799.784,800.192,--Well--
1996.95-1605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,800.192,801.063,You don't need a subject for it.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,801.063,802.826,--This case... excuse me.
1996.95-1605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.789,853.878,You still have the second point.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,857.942,858.763,--Yes.
1996.95-1605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,859.492,860.063,Yes.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,860.063,862.804,"I mean, you can put it that way, but I think--"
1996.95-1605,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,862.804,864.186,Some grammarians might disagree.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,864.186,876.802,"--Well, and I think... and I really will concede, Justice Stevens, that if all I had were an independent freestanding sentence that began with the term of imprisonment, this might raise a different question."
1996.95-1605,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,927.005,930.799,It seems to me that your argument here is really being generous to the defendant.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,967.934,977.208,"I agree that it is not a necessary component of our case that we show the premise of the question to be wrong, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1605,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,986.177,995.16,"Mr. Estrada, do you know of any Federal criminal sentencing statute that controls State courts without saying so?"
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1009.24,1030.393,"I think that you are right, Justice Ginsburg, in that to the extent Congress ever tries to control the processes of State courts applying State law and tell them what to do, that fairly interesting and maybe difficult federalism issues would come up that may call that as one of the principles."
1996.95-1605,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1084.338,1087.07,"Mr. Estrada, can I clarify one thing about this case?"
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1094.566,1095.347,"No, it was not."
1996.95-1605,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1098.678,1102.22,And the State had already imposed a sentence for that crime?
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1102.22,1103.472,"Yes, they had."
1996.95-1605,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1103.472,1104.722,Before the Federal court--
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1104.722,1106.044,That's correct.
1996.95-1605,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1106.044,1107.163,--tried the defendant for this.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1107.163,1107.794,That's correct.
1996.95-1605,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1107.794,1108.645,It had already occurred--
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1108.645,1109.627,By the time--
1996.95-1605,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1109.627,1125.455,--and in fact all the Federal Court of Appeals decisions dealing with this situation as I understand it have involved sentences by State courts that had already been imposed before the succeeding Federal prosecution under 924(c).
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1125.455,1129.879,"--I think that is right, and that would be the usual area in which our reading of--"
1996.95-1605,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1129.879,1140.285,"Yes, and so you're saying, in that circumstance, which was also the circumstance here, that the Federal court is governed in its sentencing and must make it run at least consecutively--"
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1140.285,1141.256,--That is right.
1996.95-1605,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1141.256,1142.626,--to the State sentence.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1142.626,1147.1,Our view is that the statute tells a Federal district court imposing sentence for a Federal offense--
1996.95-1605,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1147.1,1147.571,Yes.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1147.571,1149.562,--that it should make this sentence consecutive to--
1996.95-1605,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1149.562,1149.933,Yes.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1149.933,1150.714,--whatever else there is.
1996.95-1605,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1150.714,1151.014,Yes.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1192.181,1193.57,It would not--
1996.95-1605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1193.57,1196.282,--but it could happen in this case under State law.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1196.282,1198.683,--It would not happen under the guidelines.
1996.95-1605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1198.683,1211.231,"Oh, I know... under a statute, how could it happen, because the only provision that poses an extra 5 years mandatory for possession of a gun during a crime of violence is this very statute, isn't it?"
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1211.231,1212.223,"Well, no."
1996.95-1605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1236.34,1248.267,So you think that this statute means when a person is accused of that crime through violence... let's say it's an armed bank robbery with a gun... he gets 10 extra years for the gun?
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1248.267,1255.09,"Justice Breyer, the issue that you just posed was one of the questions that the Court had before it in the Busic case."
1996.95-1605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1283.249,1285.57,Including the firearm.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1286.902,1287.16,Mm-hmm.
1996.95-1605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1307.185,1307.925,Thank you.
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1307.925,1327.698,"And the relevant language that does that is at the top of page 2 in our brief, where Congress added a parenthetical that reads, including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crimes which provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device."
1996.95-1605,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1327.698,1333.392,"I didn't understand that that included the extra gun enhancement part, but it does."
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1334.431,1341.997,"It does, and that was one of the issues that the Court had before it in the Busic and Simpson cases."
1996.95-1605,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1341.997,1357.038,"Mr. Estrada, you answered some of the questions from Justice Scalia or Justice Stevens about the scope of the nor shall clause by saying it occurs in a sentence which is addressed to Federal sentences, and that provides the context."
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1394.091,1427.623,"You see, I think, Justice Souter, that I do not disagree with your statement up to the very last clause, which is that it is true that this is a statute that applies only to Federal sentencings, but one of the things it does is to instruct a Federal court as to how the sentence should be imposed and, by extension, the Federal Bureau of Prisons as to how the sentence should be administered, and it is to them that the instruction goes, this sentence shall not start before that other sentence has been concluded."
1996.95-1605,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1431.935,1433.738,"No, but your--"
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1433.738,1439.141,--takes that as a point of reference for Federal officials discharging their duties under Federal law.
1996.95-1605,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1439.141,1449.508,"--Oh, I grant you that, but I thought your answer to the question about the nor shall clause was not that it could not be addressed or effectively be enforced against a State court."
1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1466.779,1467.298,"Oh, I see."

1996.95-1605,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1591.001,1612.132,"Because I think as an empirical matter it will be the case in most of the cases that Congress may have contemplated that the sentences imposed later will correspond to later-occurring crimes, and it's not necessary to think that they crafted the entire sentencing structure of the Federal courts to fit the facts of a dual successive prosecution."

1996.95-1605,1,21875,edward_o_bustamante,,3237.167,3258.141,"That's true, Your Honor, if the court... but if 924(c)(1) is to be applied practically, then I think that what would happen, you'd have to have a prison time for 924(c)(1), and then for the remaining underlying offense the court still would have discretion to grant a downward departure to probation."
1996.95-1605,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3259.571,3268.607,"Well, just run it... if he doesn't want to, say run the 920... run the substantive Federal crime other than the 924(c) consecutively with the State crime."
1996.95-1605,1,21875,edward_o_bustamante,,3281.305,3286.849,"--Your Honor, I think the flaw is, Your Honor, is that clearly 924(c)(1) does require a prison sentence."
1996.95-1605,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3304.451,3309.062,"The supervised release would have to take... they'd have to split the supervised release from the first part, that's true."
1996.95-1605,1,21875,edward_o_bustamante,,3309.062,3309.333,--That's correct.
1996.95-1605,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3309.803,3310.454,But I guess you could do that.
1996.95-1605,1,21875,edward_o_bustamante,,3313.827,3324.102,"I think it would require some kind of downward departure for the underlying offense, Your Honor, but I can't imagine a court giving someone supervised release, they serve a supervised release for 4 years--"
1996.95-1605,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3324.102,3325.484,"No, no, I agree with that, absolutely."
1996.95-1605,1,21875,edward_o_bustamante,,3332.059,3332.637,--That's correct.
1996.95-1605,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3332.637,3333.599,But I think that would work.
1996.95-1605,1,21875,edward_o_bustamante,,3339.684,3345.367,"I guess, Your Honor, I guess the concern is... my time is up."
1996.95-1605,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3345.367,3346.488,"Thank you, Mr. Bustamante."
1996.95-1605,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3348.64,3351.922,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1605,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3354.438,3357.224,The case is submitted.
