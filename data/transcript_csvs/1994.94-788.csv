1994.94-788,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.528,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-788, the City of Milwaukee v. Cement Division, National Gypsum Company."
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,75.831,78.994,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-788,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,274.441,281.024,"Are you saying there's no Federal statute governing prejudgment interest, period, or prejudgment interest in admiralty cases?"
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,281.024,286.339,--There is no Federal statute governing prejudgment interest in admiralty cases.
1994.94-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,370.583,377.559,"Well, of course, that line... how far along in that 11-year period did the 96-4 percent judgment come?"
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,379.069,381.54,"That was 11 years after the accident, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,381.54,383.573,The first decision was 11 years--
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,383.573,385.543,The first... the decision was 10 years after the accident.
1994.94-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.064,389.526,--So at most 10 years.
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,394.278,396.189,"Well, the district court, which was--"
1994.94-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.189,407.087,You leap to the conclusion from the fact that the district court gave a 96-4 break that all during the period up until then the city thought it would have negligible liability.
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,420.966,437.767,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I think that's quintessentially the kind of issue that the district court is in a position to resolve, and were the district court to say, in the exercise of its discretion, you should have known all along that you might be held substantially liable, the district court could exercise its discretion and award prejudgment interest in some amount."
1994.94-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,445.092,446.292,Then what--
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,453.929,461.362,"The accident occurred on Christmas Eve, 1979, Justice Kennedy, and the interest was accumulating all that time."
1994.94-788,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,461.362,463.944,What was the base sum on which the interest was accumulating?
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,463.944,466.267,1.677 million.
1994.94-788,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,479.757,487.841,I'm still somewhat astounded that it can be almost two-and-a-half times the amount of the principal.
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,487.841,504.314,"--And needless to say, Justice Kennedy, we'd be delighted if it were a lower amount, but that's the amount the respondents are asking for, I assume calculating it at prime rate, which is of course a serious question whether that should be the rate, when it's a municipal government that's being asked for the interest, but respondents make that calculation."
1994.94-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,504.314,506.695,Did you challenge that as well?
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,506.695,510.997,"Well, we, in... the district court denied all prejudgment interest."
1994.94-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,516.65,523.946,"So in the district court you were just arguing straight up interest or no interest, not any question if interest, then the rate."
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,523.946,537.263,"We also argued about the rate in the district court, Justice Ginsburg, and it's our position that prime rate is completely inappropriate for a municipal government that can, after all, borrow in the market at less than half of prime rate, and that would continue to be our position."
1994.94-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,537.263,541.137,That issue would still be open to you if you--
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,541.137,541.437,That--
1994.94-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,541.437,543.517,--If the Seventh Circuit were to be affirmed--
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,543.517,565.344,"--If the Seventh Circuit were to be affirmed, the issue of rate would still be open, that's right, Justice Ginsburg, although the Seventh Circuit did seem to say that prime rate... the choice should be between prime rate and the short term borrowing rate of the city, so it made some remarks about the rate, but the issue of rate would, subject to those limits placed on it by the Seventh Circuit, be open on remand, that's right."
1994.94-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,565.344,578.44,--I guess I don't know why the amount should depend on what the city could borrow for as opposed to what the person to whom the city should have paid the money sooner would have been able to get for the money.
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,578.44,599.594,"Well, there again, Justice Scalia, that points to a problem that I think the district court is in a position to resolve, although I should say that our contention is the district... what we're asking this Court to do is simply to announce the principle that in a case where the plaintiff is predominantly at fault and the defendant had a reason to think it wasn't liable, the district court can exercise its discretion."
1994.94-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,633.388,635.448,How does it work out in the Jones Act?
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,648.869,655.851,"I... under the Jones Act, I believe, Justice Ginsburg, prejudgment interest is not available, I believe."
1994.94-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,671.572,681.838,"Is there any other comparative negligence analogy in the realm of admiralty where this question comes up, other than collision?"
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,681.838,690.526,"In personal injury cases as well, other than Jones Act cases, such as a personal injury arising out of a collision, the issue would come up."
1994.94-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,693.816,696.627,And how would it be resolved in that context?
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,696.627,698.49,I think that's the same question as the Court is faced with here.
1994.94-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,723.967,726.117,What are the cases in which the presumption is operative?
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,726.117,733.723,"I believe all admiralty... all admiralty cases, I believe, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-788,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,743.978,748.522,Did the plaintiff recover damages from any other defendant in this case other than the City of Milwaukee?
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,748.522,751.725,I believe not.
1994.94-788,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,758.61,762.201,"Mr. Strauss, I guess I'm just missing the basic logic of the position."
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,802.319,806.48,"Well, Justice Souter, we're not asking to be treated any differently from any tortfeasor."
1994.94-788,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,818.307,820.4,"And that... now, you correct me."
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,826.294,831.317,"That's an independent rule, Justice Souter, even in cases not involving contributory negligence."
1994.94-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,831.317,833.628,But wasn't that the difference between admiralty and common law?
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,833.628,833.908,Yes.
1994.94-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,833.908,836.31,"At admiralty it was, you just had the opposite rule."
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,836.31,838.891,"At admiralty you had the presumption in favor, that's right."
1994.94-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,845.026,848.869,"So let's take, then, in the admiralty setting, Justice Souter's question."
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,861.777,867.491,"--Well, I think the answer, Justice Ginsburg, is that prejudgment interest has had a separate status in our system."
1994.94-788,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,874.394,877.556,"Yes, but maybe the point of the question is, why should it?"
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,895.708,905.986,"--Justice Souter, I mean, I think the... if the sole objective of the system were to provide a plaintiff with full compensation, there would be no answer to your question."
1994.94-788,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,905.986,906.365,All right.
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,910.639,912.329,"Well, there are two things really, Justice Souter."
1994.94-788,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,917.533,924.527,"No, but that's just... if I'm selling you short, don't let me do it, but it seems to me you're saying, well, we just haven't done it."
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,924.527,933.041,"--Well, what it would mean in this case, saying that prejudgment interest must be awarded not as a matter of discretion but must be awarded, period--"
1994.94-788,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,933.041,942.038,"Not to be awarded without a good reason, and I'm saying what are the good reasons, and your first answer is, well, it's been treated differently, which is I think the equivalent of saying we just haven't."
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,942.038,948.032,"--Well, there really... okay, Justice Souter there are two questions, and I think I may have been confused over which you were asking."
1994.94-788,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,962.922,963.583,Okay.
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,963.583,970.669,"If the question is, given that there's discretion, why should it be exercised in a case like this, then there really are two points to be made."
1994.94-788,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1014.237,1022.832,But it's a major decision for any party in litigation in which there may be discretion exercised to award such interest.
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1045.846,1060.095,"Yes, that's right, Justice Souter, and it's why we don't contend for anything more than a degree of discretion in the district court when it decides, as it evidently did here, that the defendants have acted in a reasonable fashion, it can then withhold the award of prejudgment interest."
1994.94-788,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1060.095,1061.968,"Now, what's the... you had a second reason."
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1061.968,1081.96,"Well, the second reason is this history of using prejudgment interest to respond to equity-like considerations, the relative equities of the parties, considerations of fundamental fairness, which I think is best interpreted as reflecting the kinds of concerns that underlay both contributory negligence and different kinds of comparative fault rules."
1994.94-788,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1105.396,1109.229,Do you think historically the reason was the divided damages rule?
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1109.229,1109.977,"No, I don't--"
1994.94-788,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1109.977,1128.39,"Because it... interest... to the extent the divided damages rule produced an inequity, an economic inequity, prejudgment interest can distort that even further, but you don't think that's the reason for the solicitude over the years?"
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1128.39,1129.862,"--No, not at all, Justice Souter."
1994.94-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1146.161,1159.391,"I thought that they applied that, the exception only if a defendant had protracted the litigation, some notion of litigation misconduct, but not in this situation."
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1159.391,1171.49,"No, I think this principle that... mutual fault with a good faith dispute is the way they put it, meaning, I think, that the defendant had reason to think it would not be held liable at all, they've applied that principle as well."
1994.94-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1176.322,1183.645,Do you have cases to that effect outside when it was the old 50-50 rule?
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1183.645,1195.403,"Well, we have cases to that effect involving personal injury which was never subject to the 50-50 rule cited in our brief, a case called Ceja from the Fifth Circuit, another case called Pluyer from the Fifth Circuit, which was cited in our brief."
1994.94-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1199.597,1202.639,That's not a very long tradition that you're referring to.
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1203.851,1214.467,"--The tradition, Justice Scalia... the tradition is a tradition of discretion in the awarding of prejudgment interest, of not regarding prejudgment interest simply as an element of the plaintiff's compensation."
1994.94-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1214.467,1219.569,"Yes, but I... but what's important to me is why should the discretion be exercised in this case?"
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1262.638,1272.235,"If the... Justice Scalia, if the sole objective were to provide the plaintiff with full compensation, it would be very difficult to explain why prejudgment interest at some rate shouldn't be awarded."
1994.94-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1307.117,1327.08,"The only substantial series of cases that you show where this discretion was exercised are cases where it was exercised in order to again move in the direction of greater fairness, not taking account of the fact that the city couldn't settle."
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1337.126,1346.001,"--Justice Scalia, I don't want to deny that some courts of appeal used the rule that way, but it's not the case that discretion was only exercised to mitigate unfairness."
1994.94-788,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.662,1347.654,What else was it used for?
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1347.654,1366.276,"--Well, one of the cases we cite from this Court, The Scotland, Justice Bradley's opinion from 1884 or '5, upheld a denial of prejudgment interest, and Justice Bradley, explaining why he was upholding the denial, talked about how reasonable it was for the defendant in this case to pursue the position it was pursuing in the case."
1994.94-788,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1366.986,1368.528,Was that a case of 50 percent?
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1368.528,1371.95,"--It was not, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-788,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1377.564,1384.298,"How is it in this case that it took 10 years to get to trial, to get a trial court decision?"
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1384.298,1385.908,"--I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor."
1994.94-788,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1385.908,1390.71,How is it that it took 10 years in this case to get a trial court decision?
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1390.71,1397.376,"There are no findings on this point, Justice O'Connor, but so far as one can infer from the record, there were really, well, three things going on."
1994.94-788,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1428.136,1434.011,"Mr. Strauss, may I just go back and ask you another question about the case that you referred to in answering Justice Ginsburg?"
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1441.905,1444.657,"--Yes, it would."
1994.94-788,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1446.887,1447.128,Yes.
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1447.128,1447.659,"Yes, it would."
1994.94-788,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1447.659,1448.079,Okay.
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1448.079,1451.793,It was I believe a limitation of liability case.
1994.94-788,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1529.531,1537.459,What amount of discretion did the Seventh Circuit's opinion in this case leave to district courts in the future to deny prejudgment interest?
1994.94-788,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1537.459,1545.984,"None on the grounds of the plaintiff being predominantly at fault, or the defendant having a reasonable litigation position throughout the litigation."
1994.94-788,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1567.967,1568.818,"Very well, Mr. Strauss."
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,1569.499,1574.782,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-788,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1823.475,1851.294,"Mr. Stover, if you're not accepting that, and assuming that we've got some policy choices to make, can you tell us what percentage of cases as a general rule in admiralty involve mutual fault, so that if we were to rule, for example, that mutual fault was a reason to deny them, what percentage of cases would we be excluding from the general rule if we did that?"
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,1851.294,1858.868,"Well, Justice Souter, I can't... you have to look at it two ways, I would think."
1994.94-788,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1869.266,1873.448,How about the cases in which fault is ascribed to each party by the ultimate fact-finder?
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,1873.448,1881.854,--I would think well over 50 percent of collision cases involve mutual fault.
1994.94-788,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1881.854,1885.285,"In... that is, they are finally resolved."
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,1885.285,1886.517,They are finally resolved as--
1994.94-788,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1886.517,1894.171,"So that we would be excluding, on your view, more than half the cases from the operation of the rule, of the interest rule."
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,1894.171,1896.922,--Not under my view.
1994.94-788,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1896.922,1897.333,"No, no, no--"
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,1897.333,1898.375,I want interest awarded.
1994.94-788,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1898.375,1904.339,"--If we went Mr. Strauss' way, we would be excluding more than half the cases from the possibility of--"
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,1904.339,1907.381,"I would think so, oh yes, definitely--"
1994.94-788,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1907.381,1907.671,--Yes.
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,1907.671,1946.236,"--and as a matter of fact you would be doing even more, because you'd be sending signals and doing all sorts of things which I'll get to a little later, but I... the majority of collision cases, if we're going to restrict this to collision cases, the majority of collision cases involve mutual fault, just as I think almost a rule of thumb in the insurance industry, when you're talking about intersection accidents with automobiles, I think they think that virtually all of them have dual fault on them, and they approach them on a 90-10 basis even when it's a rear end accident, but--"
1994.94-788,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1946.236,1949.258,This wasn't that sort of a collision.
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,1950.229,1950.4,"--No, this wasn't."
1994.94-788,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2035.174,2039.388,"But there's always been a discretionary exception, hasn't there?"
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2039.388,2051.547,"There has been a discretionary exception, but other than in the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits, where they exercise it to include mutual fault, it has never in any of the other circuits included mutual fault."
1994.94-788,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2051.547,2053.366,How about The Scotland?
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2053.366,2096.335,"The Scotland I believe was the forerunner... I'm... if that steam navigation company case, they talked about prejudgment interest in it and said that it was to be awarded, but The Scotland and another case that's cited by the city, the Maggie Smith, involved limitation of liability and stipulations for value, or value bonds, which in those days were not required to contain interest and didn't, and so they said, you don't have to award it in these... under these circumstances."
1994.94-788,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2096.335,2102.51,"Well, but they do contain statements by the authors of the opinion that the award of prejudgment interest in admiralty is discretionary."
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2102.51,2113.386,But no courts have denied prejudgment interest except... or not awarded it except where their.
1994.94-788,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2150.79,2154.043,"Mr. Stover, what about... this one case keeps running through my mind."
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2184.924,2211.652,"I don't think so, Your Honor, but one of the basic reasons that that particular finding of the trial court was overturned was because 96 percent/4 percent is the exact ratio of the claimed damages, $6.5 million and a quarter of a million dollars, and that obviously is no grounds for apportioning fault under a true comparative negligence regime, and that's one of the reasons why it was turned over."
1994.94-788,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2211.652,2221.035,"No, but conceivably there could be a valid reason for that kind of an apportionment, and instead of it coming out even, it might have been the city's damages were just half of that amount, and then you'd have a lot of money involved."
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2221.035,2239.899,"Justice Stevens, to my way of thinking, and I think the correct way of thinking, is that prejudgment... is that mutual fault either is a reason or it is not a reason, but there's no halfway between."
1994.94-788,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2239.899,2251.126,"Well, logically what you say makes a lot of sense, but somehow or other it seems sort of strange to me to say somebody's 96 percent... assuming such a case, 96 or 99 percent fault, and they end up collecting a huge sum of money and getting prejudgment interest."
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2254.839,2256.909,But that's the true comparative negligence regime.
1994.94-788,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2256.909,2257.28,--Yes.
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2257.28,2268.717,"You take into account the equities between the parties, their stance, their fault, whatever, down to the point of accident, when you apportioned your negligence."
1994.94-788,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2321.372,2327.405,But it doesn't work very well when there is such a long delay in getting the issue resolved.
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2336.691,2347.969,"--Well, I can only quote, Justice O'Connor... not quote, but state what the Seventh Circuit said in the Amoco Cadiz decision, which is that delay isn't a reason not to award it."
1994.94-788,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2391.559,2395.29,"Who was the judge, just out of curiosity?"
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2395.29,2396.301,Judge Curran.
1994.94-788,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.301,2397.313,Was it?
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2397.313,2399.734,Judge Thomas Curran in Milwaukee.
1994.94-788,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2520.623,2525.565,Both the Fifth and the Eleventh Circuits have a very substantial amount of admiralty business.
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2525.565,2541.246,"--Yes, they do, Your Honor, but I would... Mr. Chief Justice, but I would think that if someone claimed that the Fifth Circuit overshadowed the Second Circuit today in the admiralty field that would cause consternation in the ranks."
1994.94-788,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2541.246,2544.348,"Well, they do in numbers of cases decided--"
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2544.348,2544.668,They probably do.
1994.94-788,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2544.668,2545.389,--I'm told.
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2545.389,2546.849,They may now.
1994.94-788,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2610.851,2612.713,He came from the Eighth Circuit.
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2615.475,2615.976,"Oh, did he?"
1994.94-788,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2635.327,2645.595,"Other than saying that the law of the two circuits would be displaced, as opposed to a substantial number of others, would there be any other adverse effects from the rule that the petitioner--"
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2645.595,2650.197,Adverse effects from a rule that they want?
1994.94-788,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2650.197,2651.409,--is espousing?
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2651.409,2668.889,"I would believe there would be if the rule that they want were adopted by this Court, which is that the Court has discretion to deny prejudgment interest or not to award prejudgment interest in mutual fault cases if it wants to."
1994.94-788,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2699.109,2705.061,"I take it the district court under the proposed rule would have, of course, more discretion than the court of appeals on the same subject."
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2705.061,2712.908,"I would think so, yes, but how would you measure an abuse of discretion?"
1994.94-788,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.207,2722.734,"It would be hard to figure out what to settle for, if you didn't... a lot would depend on whether the district judge chose to give prejudgment interest or not."
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2722.734,2723.415,"Yes, sir."
1994.94-788,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2731.722,2746.241,"Presumably a settlement itself would make the litigation itself and the amount payable become due much earlier, so that prejudgment interest would be a smaller factor than if you tried to assess it after trial and appeal."
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2746.241,2771.207,"--By the same token, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that leaving open the question as to prejudgment interest, leaving it up to the discretion of the trial judge, would encourage a party, particularly a party which had incurred lesser damages, to gamble, to roll the dice."
1994.94-788,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2844.244,2855.053,The rule does... that the city advocates does give the district court some insulation against the shock produced by the court of appeals reallocating the fault that he assessed.
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2855.053,2903.172,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I don't think the Seventh Circuit is the only one that has ever stepped in and reassessed a fault and even said what it is instead of sending it back, and off-hand I can't cite you the authority, but I remember going through this at the time of the appeal, and they weren't the first who ever did that, but they followed the clearly erroneous rule, and on the face of it the 96-4 apportionment, which was in exact proportion to the damage occurred, claimed to be incurred by the parties, was not exactly cricket for that sort of thing."
1994.94-788,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2903.172,2904.935,I was wondering how they got that percentage.
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2908.846,2909.697,"Well, there was--"
1994.94-788,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2909.697,2913.82,"So in other words, a pox on both of you, go bear your own loss, essentially."
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2913.82,2915.67,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-788,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2918.102,2921.985,It's a sophisticated application of the old divided damage rule.
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,2922.226,2955.157,"--Well, it seems to me that this Court has before it a true comparative negligence regime, and if you are considering true comparative negligence, then when you compare the negligence and reach a final conclusion as to it, it should be final, and however the outcome after that in damages one party probably is going to recover something from the other."
1994.94-788,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3007.771,3026.345,"Would it be, in your view, a permissible special circumstance if the trial... finder of fact thought that the prevailing party for its share of the responsibility was guilty of wilful and wanton misconduct that in other contexts were adjusted by punitive damages?"
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,3026.345,3036.769,"Well, Justice Stevens, I think if one party is guilty of wanton and wilful misconduct in your comparison of negligence you take that into account."
1994.94-788,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3036.769,3043.194,But even though what they did only contributed... was only the causal factor for half of the damages?
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,3058.706,3080.338,"Well, if that's your hypothetical, Justice Stevens, I would say that it should not be considered, but I don't think that would be a proper hypothetical, because I can't imagine a trial court faced with wanton and wilful misconduct on the part of one party and ordinary negligence on the part of the other party not taking that into account in apportioning the fault."
1994.94-788,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3175.14,3188.019,"Mr. Stover, how does that differ from the holding of the Seventh Circuit that mutual fault of the parties in a collision case does not constitute a circumstance justifying denial of prejudgment interest."
1994.94-788,1,28184,harney_b_stover_jr,,3195.913,3246.577,"Well, personally, if the Court will say that, and says I'm right, the Seventh Circuit is right, I wouldn't want any more, but I would just think that as a matter of policy, since this Court is considering prejudgment interest in a mutual fault case and this Court has a history of developing a philosophy to award prejudgment interest unless it's precluded by something in admiralty, by special or peculiar circumstances, of course where there's a statutory prohibition against it, where there's a longstanding legal principle against it, but in other cases this Court has been developing a history of awarding prejudgment interest, so this might be a likely case to fix some parameters, not specific or anything, but some general parameters for the award."
1994.94-788,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3251.329,3252.741,"Thank you, Mr. Stover."
1994.94-788,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3255.203,3256.335,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-788,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3299.722,3306.687,"Well, as I read what he says, the posture was that the defendant tried to put up the money into the court, and the court wouldn't have it."
1994.94-788,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3306.687,3314.641,"The issue was limitation of liability, and the defendants... what Justice Bradley is saying, I think, is that the defendant tried to pursue this in good faith."
1994.94-788,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3314.641,3315.412,Proffer the money and the court wouldn't allow it.
1994.94-788,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3315.412,3315.743,Right.
1994.94-788,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3315.743,3321.136,"Well, I can see a possible reason for... and the plaintiff refused it."
1994.94-788,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3321.136,3338.057,"There is a certain coherence to the idea that we should have a nondiscretionary regime in which prejudgment interest is simply awarded as a matter of course no matter what, in order to make the plaintiff whole and take away any windfall from the defendant."
1994.94-788,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3391.082,3392.604,"Thank you, Mr. Strauss."
