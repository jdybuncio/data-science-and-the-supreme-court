1978.77-1254,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.539,"We'll hear arguments first this morning and the 1254 Vance, the Secretarial State against Bradley."
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,14.904,18.485,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1254,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,133.498,142.266,"Mr. Solicitor General, what is the present retirement age for a General Officer in the military service, do you, if you know?"
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,142.266,145.697,I am unable to furnish that information if the Court please.
1978.77-1254,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,145.697,146.374,It is something less [Voice Overlap]
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,146.374,150.85,There is the compulsory retirement age and it is less than 70.
1978.77-1254,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,168.716,169.823,At a given age?
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,169.823,171.238,At a given age.
1978.77-1254,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.572,267.191,"Does that mean that if the, this Court were to affirm the judgment of the District Court, there would simply be no retirement age for Foreign Service officers?"
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,267.191,269.424,It would appear that would follow.
1978.77-1254,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,270.013,278.526,We certainly couldn’t substitute a 70 out of the air I take it if there is no congressional 70-year old requirement at the present time?
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,278.526,280.305,"Well, that certainly is so."
1978.77-1254,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,303.788,306.307,"This was in the settlement conference, I take it?"
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,306.307,306.969,Pardon me?
1978.77-1254,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,306.969,309.474,This was in the settlement conference I take it {Voice Overlap]
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,309.474,309.624,Oh!
1978.77-1254,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,352.355,357.614,"Your sister on the other side, Mrs. --"
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,357.614,358.041,Hostetler --
1978.77-1254,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,358.041,362.944,"-- disagrees with that, isn't it, at least in the brief disagrees with that conclusion?"
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,362.944,364.507,That's they would have indefinite service?
1978.77-1254,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,364.507,367.876,Yes as I read it her briefs --
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,367.876,384.258,"I believe, I believe, I recall that, but it would seem logically to me that as Mr. Justice Rehnquist has suggested that we couldn't pull age 70 out of the air and impose it."
1978.77-1254,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,557.777,563.857,"Mr. Solicitor General, did I miss, is AID discussed here at all?"
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,563.857,572.75,"Yes, if the Court please, the Agency for International Development is involved in the Foreign Service retirement Act."
1978.77-1254,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,581.979,583.007,The age also.
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,583.007,584.303,"Yes, if the Court please."
1978.77-1254,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,584.303,592.886,That includes only -- at least many of the staff jobs or secretarial jobs and jobs like that doesn't it?
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,592.886,603.255,It now includes them as well as the Foreign Service officers and persons with officer grade or reserve officer grade as well.
1978.77-1254,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,741.468,744.123,Mr. Solicitor General that wasn't an equal protection case?
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,744.123,769.902,"It was not an equal protection case, but it's illustrative we submit here in showing that the failure of proof to show that a scheme works, it doesn't destroy a determination that it's rational and doesn't therefore require the court to invalidate it and that seems to be what happened here."
1978.77-1254,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1015.266,1041.109,"A good many things have happened both in the world and in our country since 1924, haven't they, both in terms of where a civil service employees might be employed, and that is where they might be located in their employment and also on terms of, it's almost like air conditioning and fast transportation and communication and so on?"
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1041.109,1052.482,"That's exactly so and in fact the location of hardship posts change, but there are still hardship posts."
1978.77-1254,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1081.355,1086.157,We would have consular officers in those colonies [Inaudible] wouldn't we?
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1086.157,1110.02,"To the extent that there was commerce and intercourse with those nations to justify it, but with those colonies to justify it, but just as what might have been a hardship posts in 1924 when representative Roger spoke, isn't now, so there are new posts, which may even be -- present more hardships."
1978.77-1254,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1111.147,1121.271,In any event Mr. Solicitor General are those considerations which we are entitled to take into account or those considerations for the Congress?
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1121.271,1126.547,"Mr. Chief Justice, you anticipated my very next remark."
1978.77-1254,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1163.119,1171.775,"Mr. Solicitor General, can I pursue this remark as you are really raising, really a quite a fundamental point that I'm not sure the court has ever squarely addressed."
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1202.853,1212.509,"I would have to concede the possibility that it might, but I think unless it was manifestly unconstitutional --"
1978.77-1254,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1212.509,1225.128,"Well, as soon as you have conceded that then aren't we just confined to looking at rationality as of today because if it's totally irrational, well then of course it's bad, whenever that the rationality arises, if I understand you correctly?"
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1225.128,1238.936,"Well, I think if there is any question whether its still bears a rational relationship, we must then indulge the Congress' right to make that determination."
1978.77-1254,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1255.738,1259.845,"Well, I understand it, but let me just be sure, I catch your position clearly in mind."
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1266.386,1298.628,"Well, I think I would have to conclude that, but I would say that, it would have to be manifestly so and the Congress and it -- the Court would have to conclude that its rationality could not be maintained on any basis at all, such as the Court said in McGowan versus Maryland, we would have to particularly in a case like this where we're using where we don't have a fundamental right involved in order to we have a suspect class."
1978.77-1254,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1298.628,1325.112,"In that analysis Mr. Solicitor General made by the Court in the consideration of the case, whether the court – should the court take into account that Congress is indicating a very great alertness in recent years to age discrimination, gender discrimination and other such factors."
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1325.112,1325.741,Oh!
1978.77-1254,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1382.969,1412.628,"General McCree following up on my brother Stevens question, if we are to consider rationality or irrationality as of the present day, are we then entitled to take into consideration subsequent legislation by Congress such as the up and out promotional system, which was not a part of the enactment in 1924, but certainly if you put it in the matrix of the present day as a part of the Foreign Service Law in determining rationality."
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1412.628,1445.29,"Thank you for the question and I would certainly say yes, the Court should take that into consideration and that was the second justification that was offered to the three-judge court that this implemented the up or out program that the Foreign Service uses and that also would indicate that it still had that it still bore a rational relationship to a legitimate aim or a legitimate objective."
1978.77-1254,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1445.29,1449.768,"General McCree, let's back up a little bit."
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1464.092,1471.204,"That would be a significant change, but there might be other factors, factors other than just being stationed at a hardship post."
1978.77-1254,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1480.035,1489.419,"I didn't see the statistics of the number of people that changed their talents for employment purposes, you are now asking (Inaudible)"
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1489.419,1495.703,That is so; we would suggest that perhaps the differences within the United States.
1978.77-1254,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1495.703,1502.369,I mean they move whole departments of civil service employees to Mississippi last year.
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1502.369,1519.728,"I would certainly agree with the Court that that is a phenomenon of our current lifestyle, but I would suggest that being moved from one continent to another or being subject to removal is a more traumatic upheaval --"
1978.77-1254,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1519.728,1524.49,I'm saying they don't move the ones when they are moved to another one --
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1524.49,1603.545,"If that were if those where the circumstances attendant to all posts, the news recently has had a sensational story and a very tragic story that included the death of a member of the Congress, investigating a situation in Guyana, one of the recently emerged nations in South America, with Congressmen Ryan and Shaw, was Richard Dwyer who was aged 47, he was under the mandatory retirement age considerably and he was the Deputy Chief of Mission in Georgetown and his duties required him to accompany persons to a dangerous site and he had we presume the vigor of a person 47 years old and was subjected to this risk of his life and so we would submit that the day of the hardship post, the day of the extraordinary risk, the day of the exposure to more than ordinary civil servants' experience has not passed."
1978.77-1254,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1603.545,1610.341,"Was terrorism, vulnerability to terrorism doesn't have much to do with chronological age, does it?"
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1610.341,1645.191,"It does not and the Court reminds me that at the last Olympia there was a terrorist incident, but we suggest that, that is further evidence that there is a rational relationship of having persons with the physical vigor and stamina to be able to rise to these problems which can occur any place because one would hardly call Munich a hardship post in terms of the creature comforts that it affords."
1978.77-1254,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1652.001,1653.805,Very well Mr. Solicitor General.
1978.77-1254,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1653.805,1661.131,Thank you.
1978.77-1254,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1661.131,1668.033,Mrs. Hostetler.
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,1668.033,1671.474,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1978.77-1254,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1698.568,1705.493,Do you think that court was in any better position to make that evaluation than we are now?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,1705.493,1717.106,"Well, they are certainly within the prerogative of this Court to review the record and to determine whether the court below was mistaken and -- but think that is --"
1978.77-1254,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1717.106,1727.242,What I am trying to get out is whether -- or the review here is any different from the “review” made by that court?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,1727.242,1741.078,"No, but I submit that the facts will show, if this Court looks at those facts, that there is in fact no rational basis for the statute at issue and Mr. Justice Burger you inquired about the armed forces."
1978.77-1254,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1878.509,1887.175,"Well, Ms. Zona F. Hostetler, what then is the state of the law if this Court affirms the judgment of the District Court?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,1896.237,1903.92,"No, the court's order below has been stayed and so at a present time they are still required to retire at age 60."
1978.77-1254,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1903.92,1915.821,"Well, I presume that we affirmed it, we would dissolve the stay so that if it were affirmed and the litigation came to a close, would they be required by law to require --"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,1915.821,1930.838,"I don't believe so because the court below very clearly said in its opinion that the Foreign Service could not retire employees before the age of 70, that they have -- or entitled to work until age 70, but Court's opinion below does not say that they may work after 70."
1978.77-1254,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1930.838,1947.842,"Well, but is the right of a civil service employee to work or not to work in the face of a congressional proscription or mandatory retirement dependent on the opinion of a three-judge District Court?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,1947.842,1949.679,If it is affirmed by the Supreme Court.
1978.77-1254,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1949.679,1954.258,"But this was a, this is a constitutional law attack at least as it survived originally."
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,1954.258,1955.753,That's right.
1978.77-1254,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1955.753,1962.967,"There were some statutory issues, but now it's purely based upon the so called equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment."
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,1975.439,1976.335,Well there.
1978.77-1254,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1976.335,1986.981,"And if they are equivalent then where does the age 70 come into, come into the picture now that Congress has repealed that with respect to Foreign Service -- with Civil Service employees?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,1986.981,1999.436,"Well, there are civil service employees who are required to retire before age -- that are still mandatorily required to retire, a law enforcement personnel for example, air traffic controllers for example."
1978.77-1254,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.927,2053.726,What does the Secretary of State do when a member of the Foreign Service “reaches the age 70?”
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2066.731,2083.134,"Well, we have ten years until some one reaches 70 and I would suppose that in that period of time the State Department will decide what it wants to ask Congress to do in light of the fact that a provision of the statute has been declared unconstitutional."
1978.77-1254,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2088.11,2101.702,Usually there is some other statute that could well be held to be governing and it's the comparison between people governed by the other statute and the people governed by the statute held unconstitutional is struck down.
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2106.915,2112.598,"Well, there would be no automatic reversion to the civil service statute because the civil service statute simply doesn't apply --"
1978.77-1254,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2112.598,2112.871,It's gone.
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2112.871,2115.745,-- to Foreign Service employees.
1978.77-1254,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2126.033,2130.722,"It won't if this provision, it won't remain if it's invalidated, if the --"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2130.722,2136.376,That's correct and then there would be no provision in the Foreign Service act as to Foreign Service employees.
1978.77-1254,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2136.376,2137.996,For retirement at any age?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2137.996,2145.66,There would be retirement at any age unless Congress chooses to impose another mandatory retirement age over 70.
1978.77-1254,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2160.056,2166.032,Whether that age as such as constitutional or whether that age compared to civil service employees is unconstitutional?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2166.032,2169.473,"Well, there is two ways to look at the classification in this case."
1978.77-1254,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2196.95,2198.365,With some exceptions?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2198.365,2198.692,With some exceptions --
1978.77-1254,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2198.692,2200.563,People above amassadorial rank --
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2200.563,2201.077,That's right.
1978.77-1254,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2202.292,2204.797,But you have made no equal protection attack upon that?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2204.797,2205.227,"No, I have not."
1978.77-1254,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2205.227,2206.638,That based upon that differentiation.
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2206.638,2208.808,We have not in this case that's correct.
1978.77-1254,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2208.808,2223.146,"Did I correctly understand your observation about air traffic controllers, for example, as one example you gave that, this within the power for Congress to fix a low age for --"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2223.146,2224.016,Absolutely.
1978.77-1254,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2253.274,2259.0,"Mrs. Hostetler, this prompts me to ask you rather basic question about the theory of your case."
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2277.738,2279.187,We rely on both.
1978.77-1254,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2279.187,2288.91,"In other words, you contend then that if all government employees had to retire at age 60, the statute would still be unconstitutional?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2292.349,2300.989,"No, if all employees had to retire at age 60, we would still contend that the statute was unconstitutional."
1978.77-1254,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2311.33,2316.822,"Let's say if everything is exactly the same, but just everybody has to retire at age 60, would you still say this statute is?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2316.822,2323.397,"Yes, because societal patterns, societal norm today is to allow people to work until age 70."
1978.77-1254,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2334.087,2338.365,If you are right on this we don't even have to look at the comparison with the civil service?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2338.365,2339.071,I beg your pardon.
1978.77-1254,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2339.071,2341.662,"On this theory, we don't even have to look at what happens to civil service?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2341.662,2346.53,That's correct you don not have to look at the civil service.
1978.77-1254,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2386.325,2388.3,Mrs. Hostetler --
1978.77-1254,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2388.3,2396.36,"You have used the phrase societal norms and accepted by society, who sets those norms?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2400.071,2407.479,"Well, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act amendments that were recently passed --"
1978.77-1254,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2407.479,2407.962,I didn't miss that --
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2407.962,2417.708,"-- now mean as a result of those amendments, that if the Foreign Service employees can be retired at age 60 they will be virtually the only white collar workers in the whole country."
1978.77-1254,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2417.708,2426.941,"Now my question goes to Who, Who, what entity, what is the source of determining that something is a societal norm?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2426.941,2427.579,"Well, we have to look at the --"
1978.77-1254,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2427.579,2429.098,"Are you talking about an act of Congress, that describes it?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2429.098,2436.625,"No, we have to look at actual facts and data in society, many of which is reflected in this record."
1978.77-1254,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2474.412,2486.318,"Mrs. Hostetler, supposing that Congress were to say that because of the high rate of unemployment, no person should hold any government job for more than 30 years."
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2486.318,2490.854,"That's perfectly, alright, I do not see that any constitutional infirmity to that."
1978.77-1254,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2513.983,2515.023,Do you have on --
1978.77-1254,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2515.023,2519.867,I remind that the Peace Corps if far from civil service as you can get?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2519.867,2522.51,That's correct but a turn there.
1978.77-1254,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2522.51,2524.068,"We are talking about civil service now, aren't we?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2524.068,2540.218,"And the armed forces also have a term of years, All I'm suggesting Mr. Justice Marshal is that I don't see a constitutional infirmity in an agency or government imposing term of years on government employment."
1978.77-1254,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2540.218,2542.758,Isn't there a justification for an up and out policy?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2542.758,2544.183,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1978.77-1254,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2544.183,2557.385,Isn't there a justification then for an up and out policy that if you haven't made a certain level in the service by a certain age then you must get out?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2557.385,2583.304,"Well, that's the kind of a system that we have in the foreign service is not linked to age so much but year-after-year, every year employees in the Foreign Service are evaluated and they are ranked ordered in their classes, those in the bottom percentages of their classes, which varies, it has range from 7-10% are selected out."
1978.77-1254,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2583.304,2584.879,You don't attack that?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2584.879,2589.801,"No we are not attacking the selection out all, no, in fact."
1978.77-1254,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2589.801,2591.364,Are you going to get to Murgia?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2591.364,2592.937,[Attempt to Laughter] Sure.
1978.77-1254,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2592.937,2597.186,You may get there (Inaudible)
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2597.186,2599.693,Its running.
1978.77-1254,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2613.752,2616.95,Mrs. Hostetler right I know you are going to talk more about Murgia.
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2651.667,2652.586,"Not at all, the government --"
1978.77-1254,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2652.586,2653.431,Why not?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2653.431,2661.569,The government may impose different terms of employment to any number of categories so long as each term is constitutionally in balance.
1978.77-1254,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2661.569,2675.637,"So there is no justification in terms of difference in employment, say there are secretaries with the same rate of speech, same skills, work the same number of hours in the same working conditions and all the rest but one group is paid $25 a week more than the other, is there a constitutional violation?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2675.637,2694.451,"Well, there might be if the conditions were precisely the same and it's hard for me to imagine that working conditions in two different agencies would be precisely the same and that their talents and requirements of the workforce in each agency -- in the respective agencies would be precisely the same."
1978.77-1254,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2694.451,2704.438,"They could have different salary scales, different promotion policies, different vacation schedules, would those things violate a constitutional duty of the United States Government to treat all employees equally?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2704.438,2705.138,"No, we are not --"
1978.77-1254,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2705.138,2708.192,If not then why is there any constitutional issue here at all?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2708.192,2719.426,We are not here claiming that Foreign Service employees must be treated exactly the same as Civil Service Employees.
1978.77-1254,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2742.601,2752.093,"Yes, but you must start as I understand your theory, you must start from the premise that the United States Government has a duty to treat like employees equally."
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2769.553,2787.657,"Well, if there were two employees in the Foreign Service, a man and a woman let us say, performing exact the same work, yes, it would be unconstitutional for the government to say, we are going to pay the man more or we are going to give him a greater vacation benefit."
1978.77-1254,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2787.657,2790.027,"Let's say they are both women, say they are both women, don't introduce another element?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2790.027,2808.513,"Alright, [Attempt to Laughter] both women and let's suppose a government, the agency was being arbitrary in choosing to favor one woman over the other, but in most instances Mr. Justice Stevens I must say the government will offer some rational explanation for the distinction and treatment."
1978.77-1254,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2814.044,2821.667,"Just the previous question, I take it as it is based on the proposition that the government can't offer any explanation."
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2823.877,2825.255,If the government could offer.
1978.77-1254,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2825.255,2828.959,Does it then give rise to a constitutional question?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2828.959,2829.992,I'm -- I guess I misunderstood.
1978.77-1254,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2829.992,2841.756,"If the two women or two men doing the same work and are not paid the same, what provision of the constitution requires the Court order the government to pay them the same?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2841.756,2852.386,"Well, that would be equal protection law suit and that will the same the claim certainly."
1978.77-1254,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2875.176,2880.873,"The government showed that legislative history instead, didn't they?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2880.873,2890.597,"Well, I'm not sure that whether what it showed constitutes legislative history, they showed legislative statements and --"
1978.77-1254,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2890.597,2896.636,"Well, the colloquy of Solicitor General, does that come under legislative history?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2896.636,2901.172,"Well, that was a legislative history of 1924 Act, not the legislative history --"
1978.77-1254,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2901.172,2902.581,That's what I'm talking about?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,2902.581,2910.977,"No right, but that wasn't enacted years before the 1946 Act and it's just not relevant."
1978.77-1254,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3053.297,3062.376,"Because Oliver Randall Home stayed here until his 90s, but that doesn't prove we can alter it, does it?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,3062.376,3066.325,Probably not. [Attempt to Laughter]
1978.77-1254,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3107.274,3128.098,"Do you think that Congress has entitled to take into recount the importance of attracting, bright, abled the younger people in and take into account the further fact that must they move people up and out of their senior levels?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,3133.91,3137.945,Well that's the point I was just beginning to make Mr. Justice Burger.
1978.77-1254,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3295.719,3313.656,"Don't you think that the mandatory retirement provision may have some domino effect on the willingness to or choice of voluntary retirement at age 55, that is if people didn't know they were going to have to retire at 60, they may or might not voluntarily retire at age 55?"
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,3313.656,3317.16,"Well, they have no doubt thus have some effect on that."
1978.77-1254,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3344.443,3349.118,I hope you are not forgetting Mr. Justice Marshal's question about Murgia or do you feel you have dealt with that enough?
1978.77-1254,1,46699,zona_f_hostetler,,3349.118,3351.36,No. [Attempt to Laughter]
1978.77-1254,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3409.281,3409.979,Thank you.
