1994.94-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.867,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-367, George W. Heintz v. Darlene Jenkins."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,46.051,49.634,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court:"
1994.94-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,108.332,114.366,"Well, Congress certainly did drop the exception that used to be in there for lawyers, didn't it?"
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,114.366,116.036,"Yes, it did, Your Honor."
1994.94-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,117.408,136.13,And that certainly points in the direction of at least opening the question as to whether the definition of debt collector extends to lawyers who regularly collect or attempt to collect debts owed to another.
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,136.13,138.493,"I think there is no question, Your Honor."
1994.94-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,138.493,145.386,And the language literally can cover that kind of an attorney.
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,145.386,156.545,"Your Honor, I do... the petitioner does not agree that the language, when read in light of the entire statute, could be interpreted as the Court has suggested its interpretation."
1994.94-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,158.676,172.705,"On looking at the definition of debt collector, and if you look at that in light of Congress' repeal of any exception for lawyers, it does seem to me that a lawyer could be a debt collector."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,183.59,189.975,"--Your Honor, the definition, taken in the context of the statute, is ambiguous."
1994.94-367,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,248.506,266.705,"Isn't the ambiguity, though, answered by the terms that were repealed, because prior to the amendment the statute didn't merely have a general exception for lawyers, the exception read, any attorney at law collecting a debt as an attorney on behalf of."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,295.784,296.495,"--No, it does not."
1994.94-367,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,320.531,325.184,"Well, that is to say they took on a lot of clients who had debts, and they specialized in debt collection."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,325.184,328.857,They performed--
1994.94-367,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,328.857,330.419,"They were still representing clients, weren't they?"
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,330.419,333.601,"--They were... yes, they were still representing clients, but the activities--"
1994.94-367,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,333.601,338.644,So they were doing just what the exception says would not bring them subject to the act.
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,338.644,362.949,"--They were representing clients, but in order to understand the meaning of the term ""debt collector"" within that statute, given its ambiguity, one has to examine the purposes for which the exceptions were removed, and the purpose and the congressional intention in removing the statute was to subject attorneys, when they engaged in the same activities as lay debt collectors, to the same rules."
1994.94-367,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,362.949,368.264,"Well, if that were the case, I don't know why it was necessary, because the exception read,"
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,393.069,398.813,"Your Honor, it is clear from the legislative history concerning this amendment."
1994.94-367,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,398.813,406.128,"Well, how about... and I don't want to cut you off from getting into that, but how about a... just a comment on the text of the exception itself."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,416.445,423.119,"At the time the exception was enacted with the original enactment of the act, attorneys--"
1994.94-367,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,423.119,425.611,"Okay, but isn't that what the text says?"
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,425.611,426.983,--That is what the text says.
1994.94-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,426.983,427.294,Okay.
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,444.924,446.246,You--
1994.94-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.246,447.207,When are you going to pay the debt?
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,450.738,453.442,--No.
1994.94-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,453.442,454.602,I'm trying to help you here.
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,484.912,497.661,"That was the purpose, was to include attorneys when they were acting as a debt collector, when they were engaging in the kinds of activities that were forbidden by the act--"
1994.94-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.661,499.792,You don't want to say when they were acting as a debt collector.
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,504.745,506.685,--I will accept the Court's statement.
1994.94-367,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,506.685,511.91,"But if you say that, you've got to explain why the text read the way it did, and I haven't heard that explanation yet."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,511.91,524.726,The text read the way it did when it was originally enacted because at that time attorneys had not invaded the debt collection business as they did in the years intervening.
1994.94-367,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,524.726,539.368,"That explains why they later perhaps wanted to broaden the coverage of the act, but it doesn't explain why they seemed, in the exception, to want to limit the exception by that phrase, which I assume has some meaning, ""as an attorney""."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,543.369,559.601,"Your Honor, at the time of the original enactment, inasmuch as Congress was exempting attorneys, Congress was not concerned with the types of activities attorneys were engaged in at that time."
1994.94-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.998,583.765,"I assume they put that language in, or I assume you think they put that language in, to exclude the situation where a fellow who has a law degree is employed by a collection agency."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,608.922,610.412,"Right, for a client."
1994.94-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,610.412,611.013,Yes.
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,616.617,618.219,Not by reason of its language.
1994.94-367,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,618.219,631.826,"And you want in... if I understand it, your exception is an exception for lawyers who are acting in the exercise of their peculiar functions as attorneys, as distinct from the functions that any debt collector could perform."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,631.826,632.447,That is correct.
1994.94-367,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,641.052,645.157,I think you've just repealed the repealer.
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,645.157,648.279,"--No, Your Honor, we are not asking that."
1994.94-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.725,680.299,"If I understand it, there are three situations:"
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,734.225,736.987,I believe that the... I believe--
1994.94-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,736.987,737.668,Did I go too fast?
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,737.668,738.968,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.94-367,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.131,741.829,Is that what you're saying?
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,741.829,746.043,--The statute as originally enacted would have exempted situations 2 and 3.
1994.94-367,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,761.223,781.967,"Well, would you explain example 2, maybe, because I thought in example 2 there was a lawyer-client relationship, and yet the lawyer was not acting in any function, or performing any function peculiar to lawyers, so the relationship seems to be an empty one, because he's doing the same things, and only those things, that he was doing under example 1, isn't that correct?"
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,794.683,797.007,No.
1994.94-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,815.11,820.954,"How about just writing a letter, which many perfectly legitimate collection lawyers do?"
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,827.257,843.009,"Since that letter could be written by a person who does not possess a law license, that could be covered, and that lawyer, in that act, would fall within the purview of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, according to our interpretation of that act."
1994.94-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,843.009,851.476,"So it's only when you file a lawsuit, under your view, on behalf of a client, that a lawyer is exempt?"
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,851.476,859.771,"The... yes, and when you perform other functions that are incidental and necessary--"
1994.94-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,859.771,861.072,What would those be?
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,861.072,862.093,--to the prosecution of that lawsuit.
1994.94-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,862.093,867.216,"What would those be, like taking a deposition, request for admissions, that sort of thing?"
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,867.216,872.538,Correspondence with opposing counsel that is aimed at bringing the case towards a conclusion.
1994.94-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,872.538,885.738,"Why should correspondence with opposing counsel be not covered, but a letter to the potential defendant covered?"
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,885.738,904.742,"The reason is that in representing a client in a case, only a lawyer can perform the functions of dealing with other counsel that can move the case forward to resolution."
1994.94-367,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,918.95,919.621,"Well, the--"
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,935.482,941.026,Unless it is a function that is peculiar to the practice of law by reason of the license--
1994.94-367,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,941.026,942.596,"Well, do you draw the complaint line?"
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,942.596,943.107,--Yes.
1994.94-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,943.107,970.204,"Well, section 1692c(b) allows communication with the attorney for the debtor... I mean, expressly allows it... so it seems to me the statute contemplates that yes, lawyers, when acting as debt collectors, can communicate with the debtor's attorney."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,970.204,972.416,"They certainly can, Your Honor."
1994.94-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,972.416,974.807,"I mean, by express provision in the statute, so--"
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,974.807,975.398,They can.
1994.94-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,975.398,978.229,--I don't think that's part of the chamber of horrors.
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,980.61,991.436,"No, I do not... it is not our position that a debt collector cannot correspond with counsel for a debtor, not at all, but that correspondence has to--"
1994.94-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,991.436,992.458,That's not your argument.
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,992.458,995.229,"--No, it is not, Your Honor, part of our argument."
1994.94-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,995.229,997.54,Okay.
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1016.524,1020.677,"Your Honor, I am not familiar with those statutes, and I--"
1994.94-367,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1020.677,1028.121,"Well, let's assume that under State practice, a demand letter must precede the filing of the lawsuit."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1033.022,1037.416,--If the law required an attorney to--
1994.94-367,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1037.416,1040.16,"No, the law doesn't... the law just requires a demand letter."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1040.16,1047.484,"--Then if that demand letter were to violate the statutory prohibitions of the act, then it would be within the act."
1994.94-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1047.484,1059.802,It would be helpful to me if you could go back to Justice O'Connor's question and list what would be in this chamber of horrors.
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1085.09,1094.776,"Your Honor, the good faith exception that you have just mentioned has been very narrowly construed by the lower courts."
1994.94-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1127.238,1127.999,"Well, that's what I wanted to know."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1127.999,1129.001,--as interpreted by those courts.
1994.94-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1129.001,1129.361,All right.
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1132.183,1132.894,That might be.
1994.94-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1132.894,1153.916,"What it says is, a debt collector may not be held liable if the violation was not intentional, and resulted from a bona fide error, so if in fact the client comes and says, A, B, and C is true, the lawyer thinks that's probably right, puts him on the stand, the jury disbelieves him, the lawyer would not be liable, as long as the lawyer was in good faith."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1157.568,1162.353,"As good faith has been described, that would solve that problem."
1994.94-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1162.353,1164.363,Then what other problems are in the chamber?
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1164.363,1182.516,"Under 1962c(c) of the act, a debtor can express the desire to no longer be contacted, and that can bring about a cessation of any contacts with that debt collector by anybody... excuse me, debtor by anybody."
1994.94-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1182.516,1189.792,But it says you can communicate to... where the creditor intends to invoke a specified remedy.
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1194.915,1199.908,"That would permit that, Your Honor."
1994.94-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1199.908,1200.369,What?
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1200.369,1201.579,That would be permitted.
1994.94-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1201.579,1203.399,"Oh, then that would get rid of that horror."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1204.231,1221.181,"The verification and disclosure provisions would be applicable to pleadings, to complaints, and to virtually all documents that constituted communications that would be sent."
1994.94-367,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1221.181,1223.244,And what harm does that cause?
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1223.244,1226.406,"Your Honor, may I return to your prior question for a second?"
1994.94-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1257.378,1263.752,"Well, but there's an exception with the express permission of a court of competent jurisdiction."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1263.752,1270.585,"That would still require, Your Honor, an attorney to apply to a court if it occurred at a deposition."
1994.94-367,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1270.585,1271.717,"For a deposition order, yes."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1274.528,1287.927,"It is very unusual, Your Honor, in the normal litigation context, for a deponent party to determine that that party no longer wishes to be communicated with."
1994.94-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1287.927,1293.051,"Don't you think an ordinary notice of deposition, pursuant to the rules, would imply the permission of the court?"
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1293.051,1306.669,"I'm not sure that that would imply, necessarily, the permission of the court, because very often, such notices may be sent unilaterally."
1994.94-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1306.669,1321.689,"I realize you don't need a court approval to notice someone's deposition, but the rules provide for the notice, and it seems to me one could argue that is enough to show that the court... court approval under this statute."
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1321.689,1331.125,The rules do provide a framework in which the parties may conduct discovery.
1994.94-367,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1357.795,1368.431,"Mr. Spellmire, what do we make of the express exceptions that Congress did put in, at least one?"
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1389.035,1403.714,"Your Honor, I believe a fair interpretation of that particular exception indicates the intention of Congress that the act not apply to matters that occur in the litigation context."
1994.94-367,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1404.776,1408.806,But it says only one function.
1994.94-367,0,26116,george_w_spellmire,,1418.534,1452.605,"--Pursuant to their intention, and their congressional purpose in this law, they didn't need any further exemption, because attorneys from their view, Congress' view, were not within the ambit of this act when they were engaged in litigation and... engaged in litigation, so it is consistent, really, with the congressional purpose and intent that this law... that this act not discuss legal activities following the initiation of a suit."
1994.94-367,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1518.742,1520.642,"Very well, Mr. Spellmire."
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1522.745,1526.036,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.521,1613.595,What was that--
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1613.595,1615.454,"1692a(6)(D), Your Honor."
1994.94-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1615.454,1616.886,--Would you say that again?
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1616.886,1625.261,1692a(6)(D) is the exemption for persons attempting to serve legal process.
1994.94-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.261,1628.353,1692a(6)(D)?
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1628.353,1628.962,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1636.608,1639.891,"Can I ask, are these different provisions in your paper somewhere?"
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1639.891,1640.84,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1640.84,1642.663,Where were you reading from?
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1645.985,1650.888,"They are cited in the appendix to the certiorari petition, in the joint appendix."
1994.94-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1650.888,1658.731,"Also, petition for certiorari appendix 24, 25, 26, 27."
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1658.731,1659.833,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1673.731,1678.015,And that's one that is not included in the appendix to the cert petition is it?
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1678.015,1682.728,I believe that some others were in the joint appendix.
1994.94-367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1711.788,1725.829,"Yes, as long as you're there, 1692c(b), which prohibits communications with third parties, it says that without the prior consent of the consumer--"
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1760.861,1768.175,"--Your Honor, if any deponent refuses to appear for a deposition, or refuses to answer questions--"
1994.94-367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1768.175,1774.06,"No, no, but you can't even notice the deposition, under the statute, without the express permission of the court."
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1774.06,1786.557,"--I would believe, Your Honor, that express permission could be construed to encompass a rule or order of general applicability authorizing with specificity a particular activity, such as noticing a deposition."
1994.94-367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1786.557,1787.849,"Well, I think the point is somewhat in doubt."
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1787.849,1789.669,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1994.94-367,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1789.669,1791.101,I think the point is somewhat in doubt.
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1791.101,1804.099,"In any event, if there... if there is a question as to a matter, nothing prevents the collection lawyer from applying by motion to the court for permission to take the deposition."
1994.94-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1804.099,1811.986,"But then you would have to acknowledge that this would require a change in normal litigation practice for a collection lawyer, that most lawyers wouldn't have to do this."
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1811.986,1814.387,"Actually, I don't believe that's correct."
1994.94-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1820.861,1823.943,"Well, but suppose it is over a certain amount."
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1823.943,1832.82,"In that case, it might, if it is construed as Justice Kennedy suggested, require the permission of a court upon application in a motion."
1994.94-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1848.018,1859.457,"But if you've got $2,600 at issue, you would have to... unlike most lawyers, you'd have to go to court... if you read the statute literally, you'd have to go to court and get permission to take a deposition."
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1859.457,1860.996,"That might be required, Your Honor."
1994.94-367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1860.996,1863.457,That isn't what it says.
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1902.143,1903.174,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-367,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1904.655,1906.397,So I think you're misreading it.
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1907.306,1909.71,--The restriction would apply only to third party witness--
1994.94-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1909.71,1917.274,"And even then, express permission may simply... is not necessarily the same as specific permission, individualized permission."
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1917.274,1918.853,--That is correct.
1994.94-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.853,1919.955,"As long as it's express, you could say."
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1940.761,1942.851,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.954,1953.48,"If I'm not a litigator, and generally just give business advice, do a little litigation sometimes."
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1961.475,1972.652,"--That is correct, Your Honor, but while there might be some debate as to very marginal situations, that's not the reality Congress was dealing with when it repealed the attorney exemption."
1994.94-367,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1987.942,1991.495,"In any event, he's not in any tougher position than the nonlawyer."
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,1991.495,1992.583,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-367,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1992.583,2009.226,"What about... wasn't it the ABA that took the position in this case that if we read the statute the way you're suggesting, then we're driving clients to the most incompetent, most inexperienced lawyers, because they won't be debt collectors because they're not regularly engaged in the collection of debts?"
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2009.226,2016.37,"They would be, Your Honor, if the lawyer then begins to regularly enforce consumer debts."
1994.94-367,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2016.37,2018.162,So it's like a dog is allowed one free bite?
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2019.021,2023.965,"In many respects, the statute does embody that principle."
1994.94-367,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2089.766,2090.879,--On billboards.
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2091.79,2093.409,--That's correct.
1994.94-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2108.951,2125.55,"Mr. Edelman, what if I'm a lawyer who represents a bank, and the bank, say, has a number of floor plan arrangements with automobile dealers, and so in March I sue one dealer for half-a-million dollars for defaulting on a floor plan arrangement."
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2138.27,2141.943,"No, Your Honor, because the statute only applies to the collection of consumer debt."
1994.94-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2148.267,2154.589,And a consumer debt is something incurred by someone who plans to make use of the thing themselves?
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2154.589,2162.566,"--It basically... Your Honor, it basically tracks the definitions found in the other titles of the Consumer Credit Protection Act."
1994.94-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2180.378,2185.18,"Well, what if the corporation buys a lot of products to consume them in its manufacturing process?"
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2185.18,2187.691,That is not considered to be a consumer debt.
1994.94-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2187.691,2188.983,"That's not a ""consumer debt""?"
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2188.983,2193.826,"Only debts owed by natural... or allegedly owed by natural persons would be covered, Your Honor."
1994.94-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2193.826,2201.77,"Well, what if Howard Hughes, doing business in his own name, buys a million dollars' worth of stuff, they use them to make airplanes?"
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2201.77,2205.113,"That would not be covered, Your Honor."
1994.94-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2244.088,2245.38,"How does this work, though?"
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2247.411,2248.873,"That is correct, they are covered."
1994.94-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2248.873,2253.686,"So they can be a lot of money, and suppose that the person collects home mortgages, i.e., he brings lawsuits."
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2257.028,2258.097,"Yes, Your Honor, and in fact--"
1994.94-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2258.097,2258.438,All right.
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2288.559,2289.651,"--Not really, Your Honor."
1994.94-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2289.651,2290.292,Why not?
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2290.292,2294.744,"1692c(c), which is the ceasing communication provision--"
1994.94-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2294.744,2295.085,Right.
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2295.085,2301.61,--contains an express exemption for telling the consumer that we're going to invoke specified remedies.
1994.94-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2301.61,2301.94,That's right.
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2303.119,2303.95,And you sue.
1994.94-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2303.95,2310.405,"Now what the lawyer wants to do is, he wants to go and talk at the deposition to the borrower."
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2310.405,2312.265,There is nothing which would prevent that.
1994.94-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.265,2314.846,What about the words that
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2328.698,2331.699,"I would construe the remedy, Your Honor, as including--"
1994.94-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2331.699,2333.81,That's what we're... so that's what we would have to do.
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2348.8,2351.541,--The legislative history indicates precisely that.
1994.94-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2364.25,2371.304,"But there is no specific thing that talks about the communications that go on during a lawsuit, I take it?"
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2371.304,2371.844,"--That is correct, but--"
1994.94-367,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2371.844,2373.505,So we'd have to imply that.
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2373.505,2384.264,"--I don't think it's too much of an implication to say that notification that one is going to invoke a specified remedy would include, for example, notifying the consumer's deposition."
1994.94-367,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.174,2584.845,He should have inserted 3 months earlier.
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2584.845,2599.204,"--Well, I think the Court has consistently made a difference, a distinction, between legislative history which predates the enactment of a statute, and something which... this wasn't even spoken to Congress on the floor of the House."
1994.94-367,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.839,2611.361,Do you suppose he could have been prosecuted under a 1001?
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2613.732,2617.366,I won't comment on that.
1994.94-367,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2765.384,2790.152,"What is your answer specifically to the argument that this will chill full adversarial zeal, the best representation of the client, because the attorney will be intimidated by the prospect of liability, so will hold back arguments that might be tenable, but that ultimately fail?"
1994.94-367,1,20803,daniel_a_edelman,,2790.152,2807.283,"Your Honor, insofar as the issue before the Court is concerned, namely, adding charges to debts which are not expressly authorized, Congress intentionally, and with application to both lawyers and other debt collectors, imposed a strict standard."
1994.94-367,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3002.28,3003.981,"Thank you, Mr. Edelman."
1994.94-367,2,26116,george_w_spellmire,,3006.892,3013.978,"Within the act, there are no provisions which deal with the regulation of lawyers in litigation."
1994.94-367,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3061.91,3068.903,"When you say, his supplemental report, was this something other than just his own individual doing?"
1994.94-367,2,26116,george_w_spellmire,,3068.903,3072.796,"Your Honor, he was the sole sponsor of the act."
1994.94-367,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3083.302,3090.327,"You mean, he was the sponsor of the amendment which took the attorney exemption out?"
1994.94-367,2,26116,george_w_spellmire,,3090.327,3090.958,That is correct.
1994.94-367,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3090.958,3091.619,Yes.
1994.94-367,2,26116,george_w_spellmire,,3098.142,3100.114,Thank you.
