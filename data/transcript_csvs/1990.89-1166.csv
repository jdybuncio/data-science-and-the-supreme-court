1990.89-1166,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.006,"We'll hear next in No. 89-1166, International Union v. Ring Screw Works."
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,97.055,106.47,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1166,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,167.735,170.306,"There are literally 3,500 pages?"
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,170.306,170.977,--35 pages.
1990.89-1166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,321.035,331.654,"Mr. Gold, if suit is brought, do you consider the grievance, by reason of the bringing of the suit, to still be an unresolved grievance?"
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,331.654,354.078,I... I regard it as being an unresolved grievance until the Court speaks and determines whether the grievance is properly grounded in the contract or whether the employer's action was consistent with the contract and does not constitute a breach of the contract.
1990.89-1166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,354.078,356.882,When does the no-strike clause allow a strike to occur?
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,356.882,366.116,The no-strike clause allows a strike to occur at the completion of the fourth step.
1990.89-1166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.116,366.617,Uh-huh.
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,366.617,369.108,"So, it does--"
1990.89-1166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.108,375.813,Where is the no-strike clause in--
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,375.813,399.31,"--Look at the... page 34, the no-strike clause, which is section 7 on page 34 of the joint appendix, the buff-colored book says, until all negotiations, there shall be no strikes, et cetera."
1990.89-1166,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,399.31,400.261,"--Where is that on the page, Mr. Gold?"
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,400.261,406.287,"It is at the bottom of the page, section 7, the union will not cause or permit its members to strike."
1990.89-1166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.646,446.985,"The purpose of the strike being to force the company to do what the law may permit it to do, what it may have a contractual right to do."
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,451.489,452.14,Correct.
1990.89-1166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.14,461.416,And you're saying there can be a strike to prevent the company from doing what the court will say or is being asked to say it has a contractual right to do.
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,463.438,463.808,That's right.
1990.89-1166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,463.808,465.811,--where... where there's a lockout.
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,477.682,485.778,To the extent that there is anything inappropriate... I mean your sense of inappropriate... this is not in the lawsuit.
1990.89-1166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,504.872,510.686,"--Well, what if this suit goes forward and the ruling is against the union?"
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,514.45,535.092,--I take it that the question there and the answer that we would suggest as well is the same as was assumed in Buffalo Forge in--
1990.89-1166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,535.092,537.143,"Mr. Gold, you can give a yes or no answer."
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,537.143,549.091,--We think the strike... we think that a continuation of a strike or a lock-out after the judicial decision would be enjoinable.
1990.89-1166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,549.091,560.819,"And so in effect you think the contract says, we don't have arbitrators, but we have agreed that the Court will stand on issues with arbitrators?"
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,560.819,561.199,That's right.
1990.89-1166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,562.872,564.471,"Well, that isn't what the contract says."
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,564.471,567.163,"--Well, the contract says nothing on that."
1990.89-1166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.163,567.713,"Well, that's what I say."
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,568.474,614.526,"What if it... what we say in terms of... first of all there was no strike here, so we're not dealing with the question in this particular case of the interplay between the right to get a judicial determination on the meaning of the contract and whether the contract is more than a collection of words which have no purpose when the push comes to the shove and whether a union or an employer can go down both options at the same time."
1990.89-1166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,646.648,653.822,"--Well, what is your position as to whether or not a lawsuit in a strike could proceed concurrently?"
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,660.908,675.619,"Let me treat with the problem, as we see it, because it explains my answer."
1990.89-1166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,682.074,682.775,Can?
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,682.775,683.957,Concur.
1990.89-1166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,828.433,833.708,"Mr. Gold, is this an unusual form of... of collective bargaining agreement provision--"
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,833.708,842.785,"It is a minority form of collective bargaining agreement, but it is, seems to me to be a variation of your risk question."
1990.89-1166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,845.686,848.367,--It doesn't stick out like a sore thumb.
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,848.367,850.428,--It does not become... 10 percent... It's a relatively--
1990.89-1166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,850.428,850.558,Uh-huh.
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,850.558,852.719,--small group--
1990.89-1166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,852.719,852.799,Right.
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,852.799,857.884,"--of contracts, but it is not sui generis."
1990.89-1166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,858.174,858.455,Right.
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,858.455,859.236,--extraordinary.
1990.89-1166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.202,869.466,"Well, what is the more standard... what is the more common... how does the more common one read?"
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,869.466,884.696,"The more common form of agreement is, or most common form of agreement is one that provides for final and binding arbitration and the court has set all the rules on what that means."
1990.89-1166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.696,886.609,Explicitly eliminates--
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,886.609,887.17,Right.
1990.89-1166,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,887.17,887.818,--judicial--
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,887.818,899.395,It both eliminates the right for self-help and judicial determination of the meaning of the agreement.
1990.89-1166,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,926.557,931.13,"--Well, isn't there also a right of judicial review of the arbitrary--"
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,931.13,939.415,"Right, and in addition, it is fairer to save than rather than eliminating judicial enforcement."
1990.89-1166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,960.132,966.527,--But the grounds for a court to... not to accept the arbitral award are very narrow.
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,966.527,966.554,--Very narrow.
1990.89-1166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,976.39,998.055,"Well, is this case... is it very significant because I would suppose that if the parties are... do you think the union would ever have agreed to a provision in this particular contract that economic weapons are the only way to resolve an unsettled agreement?"
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,998.055,1008.383,"No, I think that the greatest reason for doubting the inference that the court of appeals drew is the one you just stated."
1990.89-1166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1033.8,1040.085,"Well, I suppose if you had thought that the union would have said yes if the employer said, and by the way you can't sue."
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1041.568,1055.469,"--Well, I... I think so and one of the... one of the important functions this determine... this Court's ruling will have is to give the ground rules against which the parties will negotiate."
1990.89-1166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1055.469,1071.83,"--The Evans contract in that respect is I guess somewhat better for the employer's position because at page 53 of the Appendix it says, unresolved grievance, except arbitration decisions, shall be handled as is set forth in the no-strike clause."
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1071.83,1082.096,"Yeah, and the question there is why are these two contracts which... which were entered into by the same parties at the same time different?"
1990.89-1166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1360.884,1367.268,"And if there's no meeting of the minds as some general, Federal common law of the work place?"
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1367.268,1372.452,--To the extent that the parties provide for... arbitration.
1990.89-1166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1372.912,1373.603,"Well, no, no."
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1373.603,1375.313,--Do you mean as to what--
1990.89-1166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1375.313,1378.426,This is at... at the judicial review stage?
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1378.426,1384.46,--But it... are you asking about the substance or about this question of whether the contract is enforceable?
1990.89-1166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1385.471,1396.317,What... what is the substantive law to which the Congress... to which the Court looks in these cases where the contract isn't clear?
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1405.364,1406.355,--Yes.
1990.89-1166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1435.145,1438.207,"Well, of course, those... that was in the context of arbitration."
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1438.207,1442.409,--But... it is--
1990.89-1166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1442.409,1447.424,"And... and in others, fact has been with the good faith duty of representation."
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1455.158,1460.251,"--Well, there would not be a Federal common law in that regard."
1990.89-1166,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1536.812,1544.168,"Your position, Mr. Gold, would certainly bring a lot more cases into... labor contractors into Federal court."
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1544.168,1549.1,--It would bring cases of this kind into Federal court.
1990.89-1166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1582.065,1583.527,And in the State court.
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1583.527,1584.846,--and in the State courts and that--
1990.89-1166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.846,1586.279,301 cases can go in the State court?
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1586.279,1588.6,"--Yeah, and that Congress made the determination."
1990.89-1166,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1642.206,1647.96,"Mr. Gold, I suppose your case or the case, really comes down to a battle of presumptions, doesn't it?"
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1647.96,1649.111,"Yes, absolutely."
1990.89-1166,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1649.111,1657.917,You... you take the position that there is access to judicial relief unless the contract expressly provides otherwise.
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1664.542,1664.922,Right.
1990.89-1166,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1666.093,1666.474,And there we are.
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1666.474,1677.473,"--Yes, and we believe that the lessons of 301 in particular is that our presumption is the one grounded in Federal law."
1990.89-1166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.473,1690.55,"Well, the... I suppose if there weren't a no-strike clause and no provision for either grievances or arbitration, it would be perfectly clear that you sue in 301."
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1690.55,1691.381,Absolutely.
1990.89-1166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1691.381,1695.815,"Not because of some presumption, because that's what the law says."
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1695.815,1697.966,"Well, but the law continues to--"
1990.89-1166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1697.966,1698.166,And the--
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1698.166,1699.158,--to say that.
1990.89-1166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1699.158,1700.357,"--Well, of course it does."
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1700.357,1700.557,In--
1990.89-1166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1700.557,1703.93,"You think, you think this case is just like the one I just posed?"
1990.89-1166,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1703.93,1704.33,--Absolutely.
1990.89-1166,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1704.33,1707.413,"Thank you, Mr. Gold."
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,1709.386,1715.811,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1166,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1764.677,1772.52,What... what is the reason that an employer or a union would prefer this kind of a contract to a contract for binding arbitration?
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,1772.52,1790.453,"I would say to the Court the only comprehensive article on the issue, that of Professor Feller, who was the successful counsel who argued before this Court the Trilogy in the Vaca case, who was general counsel to the United Steelworkers, and he said that the reason the parties--"
1990.89-1166,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1790.453,1791.975,"Well, he didn't quite prevail in Vaca."
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,1791.975,1794.396,--To some extent.
1990.89-1166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.14,1839.728,"Excuse me, that... that brings into question if... if everything in the contract is not enforceable in court and all you've agreed to is to go to arbitration if you agree to go to arbitration, and if you don't agree to arbitration either side is free not to comply with the contract, the union to strike and the employer to lock out."
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,1842.18,1842.971,--Your Honor--
1990.89-1166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1842.971,1849.231,It seems to me it's an illusory contract if it is... if it is utterly nonbinding in the court.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,1872.182,1879.956,"--Your Honor, I submit that the agreement does call... call for the resolution of the grievance and that that should be binding."
1990.89-1166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.948,1899.419,We have agreed then to try to agree.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,1899.419,1899.92,--That's right.
1990.89-1166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1899.92,1902.492,"But if we can't agree, we've agreed to nothing."
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,1902.492,1902.642,"No, Your Honor--"
1990.89-1166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1902.642,1904.705,I think that's a classic illusory contract.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,1904.705,1933.404,"--I don't concur with the Court that we agree to nothing, because if the union chooses to strike in support of the grievance, that pressures both parties to come back to the negotiating table and resolve it and that the fact that they choose that kind of method for compelling negotiation and indeed compelling resolution indicates the importance with which they attach to resolution of the... of the grievance in the first place."
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.366,1994.737,"Of course, they made that decision assuming they had the right to sue."
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2003.352,2008.064,"--Well, Your Honor, again we come back to a presumption that's correct."
1990.89-1166,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2032.751,2048.192,"But ordinarily when an employer enters into an agreement that sets forth, you know, 35 pages and signed as a contract, don't both parties intend... well, unless they say otherwise there's going to be some sort of right of judicial enforcement?"
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2048.192,2055.164,There is... and I think the principle of Lincoln Mills here is very important... I think the critical starting point in case.
1990.89-1166,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2117.357,2127.033,"So is your answer that when an employer and a union enter into a contract, they don't intend that it shall be or that anyone shall have a right of judicial enforcement?"
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2127.033,2127.804,Your Honor--
1990.89-1166,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2127.804,2131.787,You can answer that yes or no and then explain your answer.

1990.89-1166,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2167.604,2180.071,"You can say that about lots of contracts, that it's just the contracting parties agreeing on the rules of the game, whether it's a construction contract or the way a particular sports league shall be run and that sort of thing."
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2190.089,2196.764,"--Yes, and I think the 301 law is, Your Honor, that if there is no grievance process, that the parties can go in court to enforce."
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2235.092,2244.115,"But, Mr. Page, are you in effect arguing... I just want to be sure I understand... that the no-strike clause really shouldn't have been put where it is, but it should have been step 5 of the grievance procedure."
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2244.115,2244.566,"Yes, Your Honor, I think it--"
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.566,2248.71,"Well, then 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 we don't agree will either go on strike or lock you out."
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2248.71,2251.001,"--Yes, Your Honor, and as--"
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2251.001,2259.086,"Because you certainly admit that if you had put in a provision that said at the end of the procedure, the parties can either resort to economic weapons or to litigation."
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2260.828,2261.499,--That's right.
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2261.499,2262.168,Yeah.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2262.168,2262.458,That's right.
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.458,2265.48,But what you're saying in effect the strike is part of the grievance procedure.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2265.48,2276.849,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that's indicated particularly strongly in the Evans case where it indicates in the grievance procedure that unresolved grievances shall be resolved pursuant to article 16, I think paragraph 7."
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2285.056,2286.488,It doesn't do it explicitly at all.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2286.488,2297.876,"No, but article 16 in the Groves contract again says that... that the grievance procedure will fulfilled by both parties before the strike lockout method comes into play."
1990.89-1166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2297.876,2306.102,"Mr. Page, here... here the issue has been raised by the unions filing suit."
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2344.777,2345.647,That's correct.
1990.89-1166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.647,2347.84,So the contract is really worthless.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2347.84,2348.398,"Well,--"
1990.89-1166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2348.398,2350.441,What's the use of having the contract?
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2350.441,2357.287,"--The contract isn't worthless, because the... the method does achieve a result to that issue."
1990.89-1166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2358.618,2360.43,It's the same result that would exist without a contract.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2363.663,2371.377,"--Well, yes but, I mean, does a union strike for that purpose when the contract clearly delineates what the wage rate is?"
1990.89-1166,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2404.108,2408.652,What if the company refuses to go through the grievance steps that are outlined?
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2412.385,2436.0,"Yes, because those... as this Court has developed the law of section 301 and what the Court has said that in the Vaca case that if the employer repudiates the agreement... in other words, doesn't play the rules it agreed to play by... if the union doesn't render unfair... renders unfair representation, in fact, doesn't live up to its duty to represent its employees, a 301 claim will lie despite finality."
1990.89-1166,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2449.651,2456.767,"Of course, there's nothing in this contract that expressly says you will have the right to go to court to enforce the grievance procedure."
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2463.382,2469.056,"Your Honor, this Court has developed 301."
1990.89-1166,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2486.258,2495.725,"Why can't you say here that when the employer discharges for cause, and it isn't a correct interpretation of cause, he's not playing by the rules that he agreed to live up to?"
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2495.725,2510.065,"Because, Your Honor, between... because the contract has established a dispute resolution process and inherent... when the employer said... gave up his... his right to discharge at will and said, I'll only discharge for cause."
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2542.157,2548.322,"But isn't it true that they're generally speaking there in terms of final adjustment by the methods set forth in the contract, rather than a strike?"
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2554.516,2568.647,"No, Your Honor, what Lincoln Mills said and I think it's... I should say I think it's been repeated subsequently by this Court... what Lincoln Mills says is that industrial peace is achieved when the parties live up to the agreement that they bargained."
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2570.539,2577.963,"And to decide where they've lived up to the substantive terms of the agreement, it's more peaceful to go out on strike than it is to have a judge decide whether the contract was broken?"
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2582.759,2593.204,The strike certainly I would concur that the perception of being resolved by an arbitrator is more peaceful than... than a strike.
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2613.619,2617.78,But the real point here is the parties did not choose a method of final... final adjustment.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2622.896,2623.527,Your Honor--
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2623.527,2628.983,They're methods of arguing and negotiating and fighting it out by... without having a finality to any of it.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2628.983,2635.826,--I would first say that strikes are recognized by this Court as legitimate means to resolve differences.
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2635.826,2640.44,"Yes, but they're not legitimate means of getting final adjustment of a dispute."

1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2652.889,2653.748,--Sure.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2653.748,2655.09,--can result in strike.
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2661.585,2665.198,By going on strike.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2665.198,2665.586,--Yes.
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2680.505,2682.748,Let me ask you just another question.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2693.036,2693.747,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2693.747,2697.49,Because you could do that in the future if you're unhappy... say we decide against you.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2703.125,2703.504,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2709.574,2710.158,Sure.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2711.974,2715.662,So we come down to what is the presumption when silence exists.
1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2715.662,2715.812,Right.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2715.812,2746.162,"And I submit that if the rule of this Court in Lincoln Mills that we're going to develop the law of 301 consistent with the policy of the statute, then the policy... the preemptive policy of the statute is that final adjustment by means chosen by the parties that, that to the... as this Court decides this case to the... if the substantive rule to be consistent with the policy of Taft-Hartley is that the presumption of finality should attach."
1990.89-1166,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2771.429,2778.525,"Well, you don't really think that, that the... a strike or a lockout is going to settle what the contract means?"

1990.89-1166,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2783.961,2784.729,Right or wrong?

1990.89-1166,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2786.832,2795.087,You think a strike or a lockout... whoever wins is going... that is going to decide what the contract meant?

1990.89-1166,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2815.971,2817.733,This method for settling... for doing what?
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2818.973,2819.164,--Yes.
1990.89-1166,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2819.164,2822.456,Or just trying who... finding out who's the strongest?
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2822.456,2839.73,"This method for interpreting the contract and the way the strike and the lockout plays into that is that perhaps these parties over the bargaining history realize that if they put that kind of element as their last step in the procedure, that neither party will ever get to it and will put pressure on the parties to resolve it at a lesser step."
1990.89-1166,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2849.934,2855.448,"Mr. Page, the court of appeals wasn't very enthusiastic about the result of breach, was it?"
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2855.448,2856.9,"No, it wasn't, Your Honor."
1990.89-1166,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2858.4,2860.972,It goes back to the Fortune case as precedent--
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2860.972,2861.412,--Yes.
1990.89-1166,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2861.412,2863.913,--which was written by Judge George Edwards--
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2863.913,2864.524,I believe--
1990.89-1166,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2864.524,2870.839,--who I would have assumed would be sensitive to union and employer problems.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2870.839,2872.912,"--Given a his history in Detroit, that would be correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1166,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2872.912,2879.856,But clearly the Sixth Circuit said that were we writing on a clean slate we would have decided otherwise.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2879.856,2881.559,"We might have decided otherwise, I believe."
1990.89-1166,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2881.559,2883.149,Any explanation for that?
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,2883.149,2891.873,"Well, there it's... no, except... I mean they certainly were indicating that perhaps a preference, a preference to write the other way."
1990.89-1166,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2987.096,3008.351,What is the... what is the contract in the... provide for grievances and there was no strike clause and I suppose you would say that then you could sue under 301?
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,3008.351,3009.453,"Yes, Your Honor, that's... I believe that's Smith v.--"
1990.89-1166,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3009.453,3010.784,Even though they could also strike.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,3010.784,3014.715,"--Yes, they could also strike."
1990.89-1166,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3014.715,3018.248,So you can't say that just because they can strike there's no contract?
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,3018.248,3020.611,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1166,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3025.777,3026.745,All right.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,3026.745,3029.049,And that's the policy that they should live up to.

1990.89-1166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.052,3095.717,But I can give that provision meaning without leading to these... what seems to me extraordinary results that you end up agreeing on nothing to all.

1990.89-1166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.908,3099.509,Just agreeing to your promise to negotiate.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,3099.509,3121.395,"--Well, I think that's... if they don't... the alternative to promising to negotiate is to call for arbitration and, again, the courts, while favoring arbitration... I think the Carbon Fuel case said it best is... while arbitration might color the interpretation of a contract, it will never result in the court imposing it on the parties."

1990.89-1166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3144.152,3146.145,It could be a very simple notice provision.
1990.89-1166,1,43194,terence_v_page,,3146.145,3147.507,It could be a shorter step.
