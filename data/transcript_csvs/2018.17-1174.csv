2018.17-1174,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.56,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 17-1174, Nieves versus Bartlett. Mr. Borghesan."
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,10.56,32.4,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case shows why retaliatory arrest claims should be governed by the well-grounded common-law rule that the existence of probable cause would protect against liability for enforcing the criminal law. First, these -- the determining causation in these claims is especially difficult for the reasons the Court recognized in Lozman."
2018.17-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,72.28,91.32,"So why doesn't qualified immunity take care of that? If -- if -- if, in fact, speech by its nature is disruptive or otherwise interferes with the actions of a police officer, that would give them qualified immunity, whether there was probable cause or not."
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,91.32,102.8,"I don't believe that's the way that qualified immunity works, because, if the speech is protected, then the question is, well, was it clearly established that you couldn't retaliate against someone for their protected speech."
2018.17-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,105.08,134.48,"Well, no, my point is that one of your arguments has been that almost all arrests involve speech, that in some form or another, speech is implicated in the incident of arrest. But if it's truly integrated in this -- in the incident of arrest, something like, I'm going to blow up the President, that's going to give you probable cause, but, more importantly, it's going to give you qualified immunity."
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,134.48,135.48,"Well, in the -- I think in the --"
2018.17-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,135.48,140.04,"Here, the problem is that it wasn't implicated as a reason for arrest."
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,149.44,149.6,Well --
2018.17-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,149.6,152.52,"So this is the unusual case, not the normal case."
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,152.52,171.44,"Well, I think the way the Ninth Circuit applies qualified immunity, I actually think this is correct, is if the -- it's a question of fact as to whether the officer actually was legitimately considering the speech in deciding whether to arrest or whether the officer was not and simply was acting based on animus."
2018.17-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,171.44,172.6,If Police Officer Wright --
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,172.6,173.76,So I don't think except in the --
2018.17-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,173.76,195.52,"-- if Police Officer Wright wasn't present when Officer Nieves had his interaction with -- with the defendant, Respondent here, how could he have been animated by animus?"
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,195.52,203.44,"Well, all the other speech that Mr. Bartlett was engaged in in the interaction with Mr. -- with Officer Weight, and the -- he was --"
2018.17-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,203.44,203.84,Weight.
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,206.04,212.24,"Yes, Officer Weight, and he was challenging Officer Weight's authority to do what he was doing."
2018.17-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,219.36,224.0,"But the question is, is animus on the part of what White --"
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,224.0,225.08,"I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?"
2018.17-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,225.08,234.8,The question I thought Justice Sotomayor was asking was what is the -- what is the animus that -- with which White is charged?
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,234.8,241.56,"So there are two theories of animus, and these were briefed in the -- in the -- in the district court and at the Ninth Circuit."
2018.17-1174,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,271.48,286.68,"Why is this any more complex than racial discrimination? Meaning, in almost all situations involving racial discrimination or allegations thereof, it's complex."
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,331.16,340.84,"Well, to answer your -- your last point first, Justice Sotomayor, Section 1983 created -- created an action at law for violation of federal rights."
2018.17-1174,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,383.96,394.28,"So this -- this is a difficult issue, which we've heard a couple of times now already, because there are a range of cases."
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,487.56,501.04,"Well, I think the probable cause element actually does a good job of capturing the subset of these claims when there actually is a First Amendment violation. And you have two -- two of the cases we cite in our brief survive summary judgment."
2018.17-1174,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,513.96,541.88,"But -- but I think what Justice Alito is suggesting is that in the second category of cases -- and you can think of it as the journalist case or you can think of it as a case where an individual police officer, you know, decides to arrest for jaywalking somebody wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt or, alternatively, a Make America Great Again cap or something like that, you know, that -- that -- that there might be probable cause."
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,557.12,567.4,"I think -- so, with the jaywalking cases, and I'd start by pointing out that at least in Alaska and probably the vast majority of states you can't arrest someone for jaywalking."
2018.17-1174,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,569.72,580.08,"You know, they're driving and they have a bumper sticker that the police officer doesn't like and he pulls them over when he wouldn't otherwise pull them over because the person had failed to signal a turn."
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,580.08,593.72,"And if you look through the cases that are cited by the parties in amici, the case of I pulled someone over and they had a Hillary 2016 bumper sticker and that's the alleged basis for the retaliation, you don't see them."
2018.17-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,604.88,606.28,"Well, we saw the case --"
2018.17-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,606.28,616.92,Let me clarify two things about your position. Would you -- we have Lozman on one side.
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,638.28,639.64,"That is our position, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.17-1174,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,639.64,642.92,And then one other thing about your position.
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,658.08,687.32,"I think, in that respect, the Court's rule should recognize that police officers arrest based on the course of conduct and they aren't legal technicians. So I think that, at a minimum, the Court's rule should -- the probable cause element should apply for the stated crime of arrest or the crimes charged or crimes closely related to those crimes. And whether it has to go further to address a situation like the Court was dealing with in Lozman, I don't think this case presents that question."
2018.17-1174,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,687.32,718.16,"What do you think of efforts to reach a compromise between the two cases that Justice Alito raised? See, we saw in Lozman a case where, I think in the courtroom, someone said, well, surely there's some statute he violated. Now that doesn't sound like a good case for your side."
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,859.6,869.84,"Well, I think some of those rules or suggestions that you gave, Justice Breyer, I think would be very difficult for courts to administer."
2018.17-1174,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,960.28,981.04,"You -- you base that in part on the practical and policy concerns that you started with, that you raise, and Justice Alito also points out, but the Ninth Circuit has had experience for a number of years with a rule that has allowed suits like this to proceed, and, at least based on the briefing, it doesn't show any massive problem, or correct me if I'm wrong about that."
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,981.04,989.12,"Well, I think -- I think the data is a little bit noisy because, until recently, you had qualified immunity that would bar a lot of these claims."
2018.17-1174,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,999.96,1008.04,"Well, why wouldn't -- explain to me on the qualified immunity -- Justice Sotomayor had raised that too -- why -- why doesn't that solve the issue?"
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,1008.04,1021.84,"Well, I think qualified immunity works in the subset of cases -- and I think it's a narrow subset -- where it's not clearly established that the person's speech was protected, but in the -- I think that's going to be a subset of cases."
2018.17-1174,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1021.84,1022.16,Right.
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,1029.6,1030.32,It's at least --
2018.17-1174,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1030.32,1042.64,"-- I would have expected, if there were the problems that you articulate, and I understand why you articulate them, and maybe they will come about as a result of a decision from this Court in more numbers, but there hasn't been a huge problem."
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,1042.64,1043.56,"Well, I think they will."
2018.17-1174,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1072.0,1085.28,"Am I correct that the Ninth Circuit -- well, I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but just very quickly, the Ninth Circuit has developed its own special qualified immunity rule for use in this particular situation?"
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,1085.28,1087.88,I think it's more of a rule of summary judgment.
2018.17-1174,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1088.48,1090.64,Summary -- it's own summary judgment rule.
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,1090.64,1091.6,It's own summary judgment rule.
2018.17-1174,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1091.6,1095.48,And it doesn't seem to be really consistent with our summary judgment --
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,1095.48,1095.84,It doesn't --
2018.17-1174,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1095.84,1096.44,-- cases.
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,1096.44,1098.08,"I apologize, Justice Alito."
2018.17-1174,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1098.08,1099.36,"No, is that correct or not?"
2018.17-1174,0,63057,dario_borghesan,,1099.36,1099.76,That's correct.
2018.17-1174,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1116.68,1127.08,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall."
2018.17-1174,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1127.08,1130.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Two points."
2018.17-1174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1154.36,1163.12,"Well, Mr. Wall, I mean, in the Fourth Amendment context, for example, the fact that there's a probable cause requirement is a function of the substance of the Fourth Amendment."
2018.17-1174,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1184.52,1203.64,"So the plaintiff made exactly the same argument to this Court in Hartman, Justice Kagan, and the Court rejected it, I think for the reason that although, of course, what you're trying to get at is, was the officer's motivation the speech or the unlawful conduct, the probable cause evidence is the best way to get at that across the range of cases."
2018.17-1174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1203.64,1208.68,"But, as I read Hartman, Hartman was very dependent on two factors, neither of which is here."
2018.17-1174,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1246.16,1267.08,"So let me take them in turn, and I -- I think it -- it -- that isn't sort of fair to the other parts of Hartman because it did rely on other things that I think do apply equally here. But just for those two, yes, the fact that you had multiple actors in Hartman and one of them was absolutely immune did make the causal inquiry difficult, but I don't think that we should understand Hartman as just a case about prosecutors."
2018.17-1174,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1302.76,1302.96,Well --
2018.17-1174,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1302.96,1303.84,Where you have an arrest --
2018.17-1174,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1303.84,1304.68,Go ahead.
2018.17-1174,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1304.68,1311.16,"-- that's supported by probable cause, I think that's a very good reason to think that's why the officer was doing what he was doing."
2018.17-1174,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1311.16,1311.76,Right.
2018.17-1174,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1387.64,1390.08,"So those are two very different things, Justice Breyer."
2018.17-1174,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1403.36,1406.36,Objective evidence that it was a pretext.
2018.17-1174,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1406.36,1424.4,"That's right, but if a case like this one, if facts like these get you to the jury, right, you come in with a statement and you say the officer indicated, because of his statement, which isn't captured on video, but you just allege it and you have to take it as true, if that gets you to a jury, I don't think that's actually going to do anything. But the second -- the second thing you point to was different, right? That's the Devenpeck rule."
2018.17-1174,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1488.16,1489.24,"But that's the point, isn't it?"
2018.17-1174,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1489.24,1497.96,"Whenever there's -- whenever there's probable cause and there's a First Amendment allegation, what's really being complained about is discriminatory arrest."
2018.17-1174,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1518.12,1525.44,"So I -- I don't -- so the common law didn't have a rule, and the Court in Hartman didn't look there."
2018.17-1174,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1541.04,1541.16,Yeah.
2018.17-1174,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1543.56,1548.64,"That's right, but I don't think that really is going to track the cases that the Court's worried about on anybody's view."
2018.17-1174,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1569.0,1570.0,"Mr. Wall, how do we --"
2018.17-1174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1570.0,1574.04,"Can we go back to what you said about Devenpeck, Mr. Wall? Because I'm just not sure I understood it."
2018.17-1174,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1574.04,1574.52,Right.
2018.17-1174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1574.52,1582.0,"You said you think that the government has the right view, which is that the Devenpeck rule should apply here, but -- there was a ""but"" at the end of the sentence."
2018.17-1174,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1582.0,1582.4,Yes.
2018.17-1174,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1582.4,1583.68,"And what was the ""but""?"
2018.17-1174,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1583.68,1649.48,"I think the ""but"" is that if the Court wants to draw limits on these to try to get at cases where the officers or the prosecutors are just kind of inventing probable cause after the fact to paper over an arrest that was problematic, you could limit the probable cause inquiry to the -- some reasonable time frame after the arrest. Now I don't think you can do just the arrest because, you know, you get back to the station house, you consult with the prosecutors, and it turns out the statute's different than the statute you thought, so it's not waving the weapon, it's reckless endangerment, but everybody knows it's the same course of conduct. But you could set some timeline on it like that, and we suggested in our brief as a -- as a fallback from Devenpeck that where you have criminal charges, it's the charges identified up to and through the criminal complaint, or, in the absence of charges, it's the first stage in the civil litigation when the defendants say, look, you haven't shown a lack of probable cause, there was probable cause for these offenses, and their response to the motion to dismiss, you could limit it there so you wouldn't end up with the Lozman-type situation where you have parties casting about at -- at trial."
2018.17-1174,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1649.48,1696.0,"Mr. Wall, the Lohman -- Lozman kind of situation, at least based on the cert petitions that we see, is not so uncommon: small municipalities where people are supporting one police chief over a different one or someone who has alleged that the police department in that municipality is corrupt, and all of a sudden they're getting a slew of, you know, 25 to 50 building code, jaywalking, crossing a yellow light, every misdemeanor, every violation humanly possible. Your rule would insulate that behavior."
2018.17-1174,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1738.96,1741.84,"May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2018.17-1174,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1741.84,1742.2,Sure.
2018.17-1174,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1742.2,1746.0,"So three very quick points. The claims are common, but they are not often meritorious."
2018.17-1174,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1764.68,1773.08,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wilson."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,1773.08,1798.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Lozman versus City of Riviera, this Court rejected petitioners' absolute rule requiring proof of a lack of probable cause in all First Amendment retaliation cases. As the Court did in Lozman, the Court should reject the rule here for three primary reasons. First, it would bar meritorious First Amendment cases, retaliation cases, regardless of the evidence that proves supporting those cases."
2018.17-1174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1820.08,1830.48,Can you clarify what is the First Amendment conduct that -- in which Bartlett engaged --
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,1830.48,1831.68,Yes.
2018.17-1174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1831.68,1837.12,-- with respect to both officers? What was the speech element?
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,1837.12,1843.56,"With respect to Officer Nieves, Mr. Bartlett questioned why Officer Nieves wanted to speak with him."
2018.17-1174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1850.28,1858.32,"So the -- the speech is the right -- the expression interest is the right not to speak, is that it?"
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,1858.32,1859.56,That was part of it.
2018.17-1174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1866.16,1868.52,"And how -- how about the other officer, Weight?"
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,1868.52,1894.88,"In reference to Officer Weight, Officer -- or, excuse me, Mr. Bartlett approached and expressed his opinion that Officer Weight did not have the right to speak with the minor who had accompanied him to this party without his parent being present. And that angered Officer Weight, and -- and then led to the situation where about this time Officer Nieves arrives, and then you have the video, what's left of the video picking up at that particular junction."
2018.17-1174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1894.88,1902.28,"I'm interested in the third point you made, I think it was, or maybe it was the second one, that there are other mechanisms for screening out the meritless cases."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,1903.04,1903.44,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1903.44,1905.36,Was that Point 2 or 3 there?
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,1905.36,1907.6,That was my last point that I can go to.
2018.17-1174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1907.6,1908.2,Okay.
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,1923.44,1924.24,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1924.24,1934.44,And that -- doesn't that refute your claim that -- that those doctrines would rule out the rather trivial cases?
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,1934.44,1938.68,In terms of --
2018.17-1174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1938.68,1948.52,Did your client say anything that was of social importance? This is just -- he's not protesting some social issue or making some important point.
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,1954.0,1980.6,"Your Honor, my -- my client was expressing his disagreement with how the officer was conducting his -- his -- his investigation, what he was doing there. In City of Houston versus Hill, this Court identified the right to criticize a police officer as one of the distinguishing features between a police state and a -- and a free country. And so I would certainly submit to the Court that that is an extremely important interest."
2018.17-1174,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1980.6,2000.04,"But, Mr. Wilson, I think, you know, it's obvious what the paradigm case is that gives a problem to this side, but it's also obvious what the paradigm case is that gives a problem to you, and it's the one that Justice Alito mentioned earlier on. It's an encounter between a police officer and a citizen that goes south."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2045.04,2058.24,"If the speech is in any way -- if there's any question whether or not the police officer has a right to take that speech into account, then the plaintiffs are going to lose those cases on the basis of qualified immunity. And there's been a number of those cases."
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2076.84,2077.64,"Well, aren't those --"
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2077.64,2078.36,-- as a police officer --
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2078.36,2084.76,"-- aren't those -- I don't mean to interrupt your answer, but aren't those going to be factual issues in dispute that won't be resolved until trial?"
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2084.76,2094.24,"I don't -- in a lot of the cases, the -- the speech that was engaged in doesn't particularly seem to be in dispute. In Fogel versus Collins, the speech wasn't in dispute."
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2094.24,2095.4,"Well, it's a question of motive, right?"
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2095.4,2097.36,"Well, there's two different things."
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2097.36,2099.68,A question of animus or intent.
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2099.68,2102.48,You -- you have issues where there's the speech is a question.
2018.17-1174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2139.64,2174.76,"Well, yeah, let's assume that case where it's all videotapes, and it's really high-quality video and you've got sound too, and what it shows is that the individual who's ultimately arrested is arguing with other people, and they're calling each other names and they're waving their arms, and the police officer arrives, and in the course of this encounter, the person who's arrested says some insulting things to the police officer, and then some period of time goes by, maybe it's 30 seconds, maybe it's two minutes, maybe it's three minutes, the person is arrested."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2197.88,2198.16,Certainly.
2018.17-1174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2198.16,2199.4,-- maybe you think it shouldn't be.
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2199.4,2202.36,"I think it can be weeded out and would be weeded out, Justice Alito."
2018.17-1174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2202.36,2202.84,Okay.
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2203.24,2227.12,"Simply because an arrest -- a potential arrestee is rude or says offensive things does not establish that the officer retaliated against that arrestee for that conduct. And -- and whenever you have the interaction between the citizen documented, then, if there isn't any evidence that shows that the -- the officer retaliated, you can be rude, you can say the things that you want to, but that doesn't mean that the officer retaliated against you."
2018.17-1174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2227.12,2228.12,But what if --
2018.17-1174,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2228.12,2240.92,"Well, what does that mean? What kind of evidence do you need? Do you need the -- the -- the person who is bringing the suit to say the officer said that he was arresting me because of something I said? Is that what you're looking for?"
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2240.92,2244.52,I don't think that -- that that's what you necessarily need.
2018.17-1174,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2257.84,2259.36,But that just sounds like a jury question.
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2262.44,2265.76,I -- I don't believe that you would be sending every one of these cases to the jury.
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2278.08,2280.72,"Well, but they're not all going to be documented."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2289.76,2293.32,"There's never going to be any situation where everything is documented, Chief Justice."
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2293.32,2306.44,"But 29,000 -- if I got the number right -- 29,000 arrests every day, maybe I'm wrong, but I would anticipate that only the tiniest percentage of those are going to be documented, by which you mean on film, right?"
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2306.44,2311.0,"I mean audio, video, other means to document the interaction that took place."
2018.17-1174,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2313.68,2316.0,The problem that I -- I have the same problem.
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2380.56,2403.68,"Your Honor, I think it's telling in the State of Alaska, and this case in particular, the State of Alaska is not the cutting edge of technology. And yet, in the State of Alaska, the evidence was, the testimony from Lieutenant Piscoya, who was the supervisor of both of the officers involved in this case, 95 percent of the interactions between police officers and citizens are recorded in the State of Alaska."
2018.17-1174,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.68,2424.16,"Well, that has nothing to do with it, really, because, in some different state, the state of Oshkosh -- I don't know -- in a different state, there are a lot of people who do say rude things about police officers in their hearing. And there are police officers who do sometimes arrest them."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2446.64,2448.44,I'm not telling you there isn't going to be cases like that.
2018.17-1174,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2448.44,2450.64,"No, but you're saying there aren't many."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2454.92,2468.96,"I think that the experience in the Ninth Circuit disproves the concern that the Court has expressed there. And I would just go back to a case, Tower versus Glover, that I think is very telling. It -- you want to talk about something that's easy to say."
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2473.04,2474.16,"I'm sorry, that what?"
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2474.16,2476.48,"That the sky is falling, the hysterics."
2018.17-1174,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2492.0,2493.64,That isn't quite the argument.
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2521.44,2521.76,Certainly.
2018.17-1174,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2535.72,2536.76,"Well, that's not --"
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2536.76,2539.64,That's a very -- maybe this is strong -- that's a very cavalier assertion.
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2562.04,2564.2,That's fair enough as a general concern.
2018.17-1174,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2620.36,2635.56,"But you said that an officer merely needs to enforce the law. But the problem, I think, is that, in a lot of interactions that lead to an arrest, there's going to be something critical said, potentially, of the police before the arrest is made."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2635.56,2636.6,"That's certainly a potential, yes."
2018.17-1174,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2636.6,2644.16,"Common sense, common understanding tells us that, that people say things critical in a hot situation, right?"
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2644.16,2645.04,That's correct.
2018.17-1174,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2645.04,2655.12,"And so all of those cases, if it's more than rude and offensive, but rude and offensive with something critical of the police, will go to a jury."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2655.76,2656.92,Absolutely not.
2018.17-1174,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2656.92,2657.44,Why not?
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2657.44,2664.12,Because a -- a potential suspect's obnoxious behavior does not form the basis of intent by the police -- even --
2018.17-1174,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2664.12,2679.6,"I understand obnoxious, but obnoxious -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- obnoxious with something critical or skeptical of the police, which leads to the claim that I was arrested because I expressed my view of the police."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2679.6,2683.48,It's not going to get to the jury because it's not evidence of the officer's intent.
2018.17-1174,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2691.52,2711.52,"Do you mind putting -- suppose you -- well, then the word that there has to be objective evidence that the -- even though there was probable cause, there still has to be defeat the probable cause, if there is objective evidence that the probable cause was a pretext for the arrest. That's the Rehnquist."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2755.08,2782.4,"Well, I think that the -- the opinion that was written by Justice Ginsburg in Reichle, and the situation where you have on-the-spot safety issues, that those generally would resolve in summary judgment because the truth, again, in our opinion, the truth comes out. And the truth, as a trial attorney, one thing I would like to emphasize to this Court is the truth is a much more stubborn and powerful thing than I think this Court gives it credit for in many of its decisions."
2018.17-1174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2806.64,2808.32,This is involving safety.
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2857.68,2871.28,"If the evidence is compelling enough to do so, I would say yes. But you have to bear in mind here, I've heard the saying that, you know, these are easy to make and hard to defend. I would add some qualifications to that as a trial attorney."
2018.17-1174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2882.4,2885.68,But evidence means a trial.
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2885.68,2890.08,"Well, I think you need to have it at summary judgment to defeat a summary judgment evidence."
2018.17-1174,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2900.2,2925.68,"Well, what would take -- this -- this category of case has been called ""contempt of cop,"" as distinguished from a journalist who wrote something critical of the government. And -- and, so in all of these encounters, there'll -- the -- there'll be rude behavior to the police officer and there'll be an arrest for whatever."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,2939.76,2944.52,Let me -- let me start with the first point that's going to take care of a significant number of these cases.
2018.17-1174,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2998.64,2999.16,Why do the damages --
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2999.16,3001.04,Just to take your -- your first example --
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3001.04,3001.2,Yes.
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3001.2,3008.88,"-- you say, well, you have to try them and get a conviction, I mean, the -- the officer's entitled to take the action he does on the basis of probable cause."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3022.24,3022.6,Sure.
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3029.36,3029.44,Why?
2018.17-1174,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3029.44,3029.72,Why?
2018.17-1174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3029.72,3029.92,Why?
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3029.92,3032.4,"Because, as a practical matter, number one, you don't see them."
2018.17-1174,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3039.32,3050.08,"But, theoretically, the person, even if they are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted, could say I never would have been arrested in the first place but for the retaliatory motive."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3050.08,3051.52,"Under Heck versus Humphrey, your damages --"
2018.17-1174,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3051.52,3053.08,Is that correct or not?
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3053.08,3055.76,"I apologize, Your Honor, if you could restate the question for me."
2018.17-1174,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3055.76,3062.44,"The person in your example who is arrested, then prosecuted, and convicted, you said that claim would never go forward."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3076.36,3082.6,"People can say what they want to say, but the fact of the matter is, in those circumstances, there's no damage."
2018.17-1174,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3092.56,3109.96,"You -- you also said earlier that this Ninth Circuit experience on summary judgment had shown that this was not a huge problem, which I think is a -- a good point for you, but, as Justice Alito pointed out, hasn't the Ninth Circuit watered down the summary judgment standard in some ways to achieve that result?"
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3109.96,3130.24,"Your Honor, what I -- what I would describe the Ninth Circuit as doing is vigorously applying this Court's Mt. Healthy test and -- and -- and applying that in a summary judgment context. And there's really, I don't think, any intellectual distinction between what the Ninth Circuit is doing and this Court's Mt. Healthy test, except it's focused on applying it in a summary judgment context."
2018.17-1174,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3149.68,3158.6,"Mr. -- Mr. Wilson, I'm wondering what you make of Mr. Wall's proposal. Or maybe he wouldn't call it a proposal; maybe he would call it a fallback position."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3176.8,3207.28,"Our belief is the best rule is that evidence of probable cause is one of the factors that the court should be looking at in this area, and in many instances, it very well may be a dispositive factor. But, in many instances, it may not be and it isn't, because the -- the probative force of probable cause really varies depending on the severity of the offense. I don't think that anybody's going to succeed in a First Amendment retaliation case because the officer arrested them because there was probable cause to believe they committed a homicide."
2018.17-1174,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3209.28,3221.44,"So why don't we go back to the rule or why don't you advocate the rule that you set forth in your brief, that a probable cause requirement applies to felonies but not misdemeanors?"
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3221.44,3233.2,"I -- I think the -- we're -- we are comfortable with that rule with one slight clarification, and that is that I think the use of the word ""serious offenses"" is a more apt description."
2018.17-1174,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3238.28,3241.48,So you're thinking there are some misdemeanors that are fairly serious?
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3241.48,3243.4,I -- I could imagine some that might be.
2018.17-1174,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3243.76,3245.44,So I see -- I take your point.
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3245.44,3252.92,"But -- but, certainly, petty offenses -- and where this -- this issue arises is not in murder investigations."
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3283.44,3286.84,Is -- is disorderly conduct always a petty offense?
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3286.84,3291.72,"I think, in most instance, it is, but there's some -- I could envision some that it may not be."
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3293.0,3296.44,So it's not enough to just look at what the charge is?
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3296.44,3330.12,"I think that, again, what we're proposing is -- is that the court view probable cause in light -- as a significant factor but not necessarily a controlling factor in whether or not you can state a First Amendment retaliation case. And that allows the court to stay focused on the truth, loyal to the wording of Section 1983, and at the same time get to the bottom of these cases in an efficient manner. And I want to talk, just if I could real -- real briefly, about the common law. And I'll make one other point before I get there."
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3364.2,3367.52,And what law is -- is Congress supposed to change?
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3367.52,3370.32,The Section 1983.
2018.17-1174,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3382.08,3387.64,"The Congress argument -- the Congress argument can cut both ways, of course."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3399.96,3404.4,"Well, it gets us that far because the starting point is what does the statute say."
2018.17-1174,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3404.4,3411.04,"Well, the starting point is precedent, what the statute says and what -- the precedent says we look at the common law."
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3422.32,3422.76,Sure.
2018.17-1174,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3451.48,3455.44,I think the Petitioners say that that was because there was no right to arrest at all.
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3455.44,3457.2,But they're wrong about that.
2018.17-1174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3491.84,3515.64,"What approach have we taken in prior cases involving the necessary elements of proof in the 1983 action? Have we said that we will import the common law rule as of 1871 entirely, or has that been a consideration in our decision-making?"
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3515.64,3525.88,"Justice Alito, it's been a consideration in that the Court does not -- not necessarily just impart them in whole, but it can adopt various things as it sees in light of the intent of Section 1983."
2018.17-1174,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3525.88,3532.36,So do you think we should do that here? Or I thought you were arguing a minute ago that we should just adopt whatever the common law rule was.
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3532.36,3540.12,"My point was is if you go to the common law, our position is you start with the statute, the statute says we prevail in this case."
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3580.6,3581.92,You can touch briefly on it.
2018.17-1174,2,63058,zane_d_wilson,,3581.92,3584.12,I'll just say the typical case.
2018.17-1174,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3610.28,3612.64,"Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Borghesan."
2018.17-1174,3,63057,dario_borghesan,,3612.64,3618.24,Thank you.
2018.17-1174,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3712.36,3713.88,"Thank you, counsel."
