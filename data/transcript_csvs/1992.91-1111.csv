1992.91-1111,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,30.602,"We'll hear argument next in 91-1111, Hartford Fire Insurance Company v. California consolidated with Merrett Underwriting Agency v. California."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,33.304,36.256,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1111,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.003,146.726,"What, then, do you do with the language in Royal Drug Company, Mr. Shapiro, about when you conspire or agree with someone who's not protected the exempt party loses the exemption?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,146.726,160.736,"Royal Drug, Your Honor, was talking about the business of insurance requirement, which concededly is satisfied here, and the reason that it wasn't satisfied there was that there was an agreement between an insurance company and somebody outside of the insurance industry."
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.692,173.978,"Well, excuse me, it isn't enough to be within the business of insurance."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,177.263,177.996,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,177.996,178.782,--Isn't that right?
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,178.782,179.282,Both courts--
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.282,186.185,"And that is certainly not conceded that the foreign insurers, or the reinsurers generally, are within the business of insurance regulated by the State."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,186.185,204.747,"--Both courts below found that all domestic defendants, including the reinsurers, were regulated under State law, and the Justice Department agrees that these regulated entities that are acting within the business of insurance don't lose their immunity simply because they enter into discussions or agreements with foreign reinsurers."
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.388,220.375,"It isn't whether your client is regulated, it's whether the business of reinsurance is regulated, isn't it?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,229.464,229.78,Yes.
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,230.197,238.653,"So... so the question is whether the business of reinsurance is, number 1, part of the business of insurance, which I assume it is, and number 2, regulated by the States."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,238.653,242.105,--It is indeed regulated by the States in two respects.
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,269.005,280.98,"The forms-developmentprocess cannot compel a reinsurer to reinsure something that he doesn't want to reinsure or that he's agreed with others not to reinsure, can it?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,300.727,309.416,"Well, as a matter of fact, 98 percent of the commercial general liability policies today are written on occurrence forms."
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.076,355.695,"This is general law, not peculiarly insurance regulation, right?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,355.695,359.413,"Oh, no, sir, they are specifically focused on the insurance industry."
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.868,394.051,But these laws do not cover the foreign reinsurers.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,394.051,395.653,They do cover the foreign reinsurers.
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,395.653,408.728,"Well, do you say, then, that CA 9 was wrong in holding that your clients conspired with some companies, some foreign companies that were not subject to regulation?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,408.728,409.011,Yes.
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,413.197,422.303,"Well, all right, suppose... suppose that it was true that your clients conspired with foreign companies that were not subject to State regulation."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,422.303,423.486,Yes.
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.486,425.169,"Now, what is your position on that?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,425.169,426.805,We would still be entitled to McCarran Act--
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,426.805,427.138,Because--
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,427.138,433.458,--Because our behavior was regulated and our conduct was entirely within the business of insurance.
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,438.826,450.567,"--Well, how is it... why is it, then, that if you're... that you wouldn't be entitled to this immunity if you conspired with somebody outside the insurance industry?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,450.567,455.619,"--Your Honor, because that is not deemed the business of insurance under the Royal Drug case."
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,455.619,456.804,"Well, I know, but what's the reason?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,462.606,464.158,"No, Your Honor, that isn't the--"
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,464.158,465.108,"What's the reason, then?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,465.108,472.064,--The reason is that this statute was focused on the insurance industry as such and not on other industries.
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,475.016,483.086,"You still haven't told me why, if your clients conspired with people outside the insurance industry, you would not have McCarran immunity."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,483.086,488.656,"Well, because their own conduct is regulated by the States."
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,500.047,506.951,"I thought you said that if your clients conspired with someone outside the insurance industry, you wouldn't have McCarran immunity?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,506.951,508.42,"Well, later in the Pireno case--"
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,508.42,509.187,"Is that right, or not?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,509.187,510.439,"--It's not strictly correct, because--"
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,510.439,511.689,"Well, did you say that, or not?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,511.689,521.294,"--I may have said Royal Drug looked in that direction, but there is a later case from this Court, the Pireno case, that said that that is merely one factor that the Court considers."
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,522.746,525.199,"Well, so Royal Drug looks in the direction."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,532.435,532.818,--Because--
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,532.818,533.468,What's the reason?
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,533.468,539.256,"--The reason is that Congress was focusing in on insurance and reinsurance, the spreading of risk."
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,547.109,548.026,I don't--
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,548.026,548.478,--Are squarely--
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,548.478,558.084,"--You might... I think you're just not answering the question, and I don't want to waste your time by insisting that you do, so go right ahead, Mr. Shapiro."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,558.084,568.439,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the point is the Justice Department agrees with us that you don't lose your immunity just because you have entered into an agreement with somebody that isn't regulated."
1992.91-1111,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,585.067,591.488,"Here's the statement from Royal Drug, Mr. Shapiro, and it's obviously one sentence out of a long opinion."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,602.16,617.919,"Yes, Your Honor, and they... what... in context they are talking about persons that are not within the insurance business, they are talking about pharmacies, and in the subsequent case, in Pireno, this Court drew back on that statement and said that it doesn't matter."
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,716.016,717.616,May I ask you a question just on that?
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,727.973,728.556,--That's--
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,728.556,729.739,That's not... what?
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,729.739,731.758,--The foreign companies are accused of that.
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.758,733.274,I guess that's... yes.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,733.274,733.724,Yes.
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,733.724,736.46,"Now, that would... would you say that's a boycott within... or not?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,736.46,742.864,"No, we take the position that that is not, it's simply insisting on mutually acceptable terms of coverage--"
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,742.864,743.649,But they could--
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,743.649,744.249,--For the customers.
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,744.249,753.004,"--But they won't write them even if they're not reinsuring the insurance they don't want to... the... you know, the kind they don't want."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,759.741,763.526,"Your Honor, I think if you read the complaints in context they're not saying that."
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,767.245,769.013,That's what 87A says--
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,769.013,769.363,Well--
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,769.363,770.13,--As I read it.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,770.13,781.988,"--I mean, if you read the whole thing in context, I believe they are saying that we will only write reinsurance with you, particular company, if you are willing to write on acceptable terms."
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,781.988,786.94,"If they had alleged further we won't do business with you if you do this kind of business, that would be a boycott."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,789.625,796.361,"That's not what's alleged here, and they declined to defend, or to argue here that there is some absolute refusal to deal."
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,798.778,804.848,"Well, if the refusal to deal, unless you, the insurance company, only writes that kind of insurance."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,804.848,805.3,"Yes, if you want--"
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,805.3,808.05,"Is that a conditional or an absolute refusal, as you described it?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,808.05,816.037,"--Well, if all they are saying is, we will underwrite any insurance that you proffer as long as it has the following terms--"
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,816.037,818.989,And as long as you don't write a different kind of insurance--
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,818.989,821.291,"--That's what's not alleged here, the latter."
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.291,823.726,"--But you agree if that were alleged, that would be a boycott."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,823.726,825.26,I agree it would be a closer question.
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,829.646,831.665,You agree that you ought to concede it's a boycott.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,834.617,839.585,--I agree it would be a much more difficult case for us to defend.
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,840.854,848.441,"There was an agreement to enter into whatever kind of a boycott this was, conditional or not."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,848.441,860.831,"--There was an agreement, but it... for purposes of this motion that's conceded, but it isn't a boycott... that's our whole submission... but the parties may agree upon acceptable trade terms and insist that others comply with them."
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,897.302,901.437,So the Justice Department has just got it wrong.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,901.437,903.705,"The Justice Department has this issue wrong, yes."
1992.91-1111,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,903.705,904.005,Yes.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,904.005,909.942,And particularly on the forms-developmentclaims that our clients are accused of participating in.
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1000.1,1017.712,"Excuse me, Mr. Shapiro, I can understand why an insurance company has an interest in getting the reinsurer to agree that he will insure this kind of insurance and will insure this kind of a form."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1033.923,1036.474,The rationale is the solvency rationale.
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1058.872,1060.622,"Oh, I see... I see."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1063.39,1072.596,The boycott exception was focused on something completely different than agreements of this kind that can promote solvency and rationale underwriting of risks.
1992.91-1111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1084.653,1094.961,"Well, are you saying... is the thrust of your submission at this point that it's not a boycott because there was a legitimate reason for the action?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1094.961,1095.645,"--No, Your Honor."
1992.91-1111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1108.019,1115.209,But that would be true whether or not the primary insurers had a legitimate interest in the solvency of the reinsurers.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1115.209,1122.112,"Yes, it's generically true if it is a general, uniform, nondiscriminatory agreement on terms and coverage."
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1147.125,1162.653,"May I ask you, Mr. Shapiro, under your solvency point, are you arguing that if Hartford and Allstate agreed with the reinsurers that we will not do business with you because we're concerned about your solvency if you reinsure companies that write the kind of insurance we don't want written?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1162.653,1166.771,"We're not arguing that position, Justice Stevens."
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1173.425,1179.245,"No, we won't deal with you if you deal with competitors who write the insurance that we don't want to write."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1179.245,1183.114,"--We're not defending that, because here something different is being asserted."
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.736,1191.219,Right.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1191.219,1198.456,"And the reinsurers and the insurers both agreed as to that, as to the standardized advisory forms that they both used in their business."
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.61,1215.335,"Well, I read paragraph 64 and that sequence of events as indicating that Hartford and Allstate went to the reinsurers and said we want to get you to stop reinsuring this other kind of insurance, and in effect we won't do business with you unless you--"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1215.335,1216.468,"Oh, Your Honor, that isn't--"
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1216.468,1217.62,--I'm misreading the complaint.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1217.62,1217.97,--Yes.
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.617,1248.806,"At this meeting, Hartford and General Rate agreed to either coerce ISO to adopt their demands or, failing that, derail the entire ISO-CGL forms process."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1248.806,1254.508,What plaintiffs mean by coerce is simply that the insurers and the reinsurers agree that certain coverages are unacceptable to them.
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1255.226,1257.543,Without any impact on third parties.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1257.543,1260.864,"--Well, there always is an impact on third parties, but that is--"
1992.91-1111,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1260.864,1263.566,"I mean, I don't mean by people who buy insurance, but with competitors."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1263.566,1281.777,"--Every agreement among insurance companies as to terms and coverages is going to have an impact on somebody that wants to do business on different terms, and Congress well understood that there would be anticompetitive effects from these agreements, but it said because they may potentially serve other societal interests, it's as a jurisdictional matter."
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1289.431,1303.374,"Mr. Shapiro, I assume that the reason the contention was not even made that the United States insurers coerced the reinsurers to not handling certain types of coverage is that on its face it would be laughable."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1303.374,1304.157,--It would be laughable.
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.157,1308.427,Because if you can't go to Lloyd's... you're going to boycott Lloyd's of London for reinsurance.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1308.427,1309.094,It would be preposterous.
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1309.094,1310.194,You would not be able to reinsure anywhere.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1310.71,1312.012,It would be preposterous.
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.666,1321.534,"--The coercion would go in the other direction, if anything."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1321.534,1326.236,And there isn't any coercion alleged among the reinsurers and the insurers.
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.263,1424.779,"Excuse me, doesn't--"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1424.779,1427.897,--That's just an exercise in rhetorical characterization.
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1427.897,1430.933,--I guess I've confused some of the positions here.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1439.17,1442.372,"It doesn't address that, but we understand the plaintiffs not to dispute that from--"
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1442.372,1449.542,"Yes, but I think the Justice Department might well say that the reinsurers are in the business of insurance but they're not regulated by the States--"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1449.542,1450.242,--It's possible that--
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.242,1451.311,--And therefore can't do that.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1451.311,1455.096,"--I don't think they would take the position it's a boycott, though, if we overcome the regulation hurdle."
1992.91-1111,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1458.648,1463.035,"Maybe not a boycott, but I understood that they would say that's a violation of the antitrust laws."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1463.035,1468.17,"--They would take the position... well, they left open in a footnote the question whether reinsurers are regulated."
1992.91-1111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1478.795,1482.263,But it does seem to me that there is a difference.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1497.507,1498.209,--Your Honor--
1992.91-1111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1498.209,1519.955,"If the reinsurers all agree that they're going to issue only certain forms... certain... of insurance, that's not a boycott, but if the primary insurer is involved, then the primary insurer is forcing certain standards on its competitors, and that's a boycott."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1519.955,1525.792,"--Justice Kennedy, the reason it can't be twisted into a boycott is that the agreement that's alleged is uniform."
1992.91-1111,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1596.705,1605.394,"Well, Mr. Shapiro, I know you've gone over this already, but I'm still not sure."
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1630.443,1639.299,"Yes, Your Honor, there is alleged an agreement between primaries and reinsurers that would change general coverage terms in these forms that ISO had submitted to the States."
1992.91-1111,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1640.032,1641.582,Those are the allegations.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1641.582,1644.867,"--Those are... but these forms, by the way, are advisory forms."
1992.91-1111,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1648.752,1669.582,"Well, if those are the allegations, does that not fit what was said in Barry, that there was pressure brought on ISO and the uncooperative other primary insurers to change their conduct by enlisting reinsurers and so forth?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1669.582,1671.332,--I think Barry is fundamentally different.
1992.91-1111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1700.166,1712.039,"Is it wrong to say that the reinsurers under the allegations of the complaint, together with some of the primary insurers, were trying to change the market practices of their competitors?"
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1712.039,1713.075,That isn't alleged.
1992.91-1111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1715.591,1716.793,You can't get that out of the allegations.
1992.91-1111,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1716.793,1717.56,--I don't think so.

1992.91-1111,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2826.943,2827.543,Yes.
1992.91-1111,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2827.543,2831.845,So the consumer is left at the mercies of insurers plus State--
