2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.403,"We'll hear argument next in Number 00-763, Sharon Pollard v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours."
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,21.177,26.172,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,64.233,70.921,"What about the terms of the legislation itself, rather than what members of Congress might have said about it?"
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,70.921,72.035,--All right.
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,104.274,107.989,This is on page 2 of the blue brief?
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,107.989,108.527,"--It's page 1, Your Honor."
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,108.527,109.475,Page 1.
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,110.013,113.356,It starts on page 1 and goes over onto page 2.
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,136.102,137.216,Where is this?
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,137.216,137.588,--Page 2.
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,137.588,138.142,Page 2.
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,138.142,146.504,"Where it says, Exclusions from Compensatory Damages."
2000.00-763,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,176.68,185.391,"But, Ms. Caldwell, the status quo that you're talking about is the status quo created by courts, because at no point did the statute use the words front pay."
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,185.391,186.794,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.00-763,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,186.794,188.363,It did use the words back pay.
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,188.363,190.509,It did use the word back pay.
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,219.654,224.362,"Well, then it goes on to say, or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate."
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,224.362,225.31,--That's correct.
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,225.765,235.053,"So the question boils down here to whether or not so called front pay is equitable relief, doesn't it, as opposed to damages?"
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,235.053,240.626,"--The central question for this Court is, what was the intent of Congress?"
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,240.626,245.827,"We look to the intent of Congress, I suppose, by looking at the laws that it wrote."
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,245.827,246.57,That's right.
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,268.118,275.549,Do you think a court of equity has ever traditionally awarded damages in the sense of front pay?
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,298.377,325.332,"It does sound like straight legal relief, Your Honor, but if you look at specific performance, which is a form of equity, and if the relief that would normally be required of the person, which would be injunctive in nature, is not available for whatever reason, such as the land no longer exists on the market, then relief can be given, which would be equitable, and yet be monetary in nature."
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,325.332,335.158,"I thought there was a doctrine where contracts for personal services were not specifically enforceable, Longley against Wagner."
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,335.158,336.644,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.00-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,357.449,370.164,"When you speak of front pay, do you mean an award calculated as it was in the Chief Justice's hypothetical?"
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,385.191,392.167,"Not at all, Your Honor, and that's one of the central problems of the concept of front pay as a purely legal remedy."
2000.00-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,392.167,392.333,--All right.
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,404.965,407.277,Front pay is much more fluid.
2000.00-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,437.619,437.957,Okay.
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,442.82,456.772,"Some courts have fashioned it as, we'll give the company two years to find an appropriate position for this plaintiff, given the training, experience, background."
2000.00-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,463.625,464.08,All right.
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,476.795,508.374,"Often it comes right back to the court, and in the Sixth Circuit case of Shore v. Federal Express, which went up on appeal twice to the Sixth Circuit... and it's one of the leading cases from the Sixth Circuit in which the Sixth Circuit recognizes front pay as equitable... the plaintiff was held by the judge not to be required to go back to that employment because of the hostile environment, the painful situation she would find herself in."
2000.00-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,508.374,511.718,This is after something like the two year period has passed?
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,511.718,529.551,"Well, what he did was he fashioned the remedy, saying that she would never again find a job equivalent in pay to what she had Federal Express, and each year Federal Express is required to pay her the difference between what she earned and what she would have earned."
2000.00-763,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,529.551,547.012,"Okay. But that... I just don't see how when the front pay so called becomes that extensive, I don't see how you distinguish it from an award of lost future earnings not attributable to loss of earning capacity, which is a recognized form of damages at law."
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,547.012,549.408,The hallmark really is the discretion of the court.
2000.00-763,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,549.408,574.133,"Ms. Caldwell, you're describing this as the typical substitute for reinstatement, but you did say that front pay covers a wide range, and at least one area that it covers is a person qualifies for the promotion or for the job, doesn't get it because of discrimination."
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,630.481,641.544,"Well, front pay applies to both instances, and normally this is one of the reasons why it should remain with the court rather than with a jury."
2000.00-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,641.544,646.002,"Ms. Caldwell, would you tell me how it works so far as the jury's concerned."
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,685.095,687.901,"If I prevail, that's not the way it would work, Your Honor."
2000.00-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,687.901,688.644,How does it work?
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,688.644,689.924,The way it would work--
2000.00-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,689.924,704.802,"Just as... for the preface, because it would seem to me that the employer would want the jury to know that they shouldn't worry about future pay and future earnings, and there should be some instruction to that effect."
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,704.802,713.619,"--There should be an instruction to that effect, but there are certain future pecuniary amounts that the jury would be instructed on."
2000.00-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,713.619,713.785,And what are those?
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,713.785,728.934,"And those would be such things as future medicals, moving expenses, those sorts of items, which are clearly within the confines of what Congress allowed in enacting this legislation."
2000.00-763,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.934,734.879,"Ms. Caldwell, can I call your attention to the text of the statute again which you cited us to?"
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,788.544,797.916,It does not function the same as a sum certain that a jury would find as to future losses.
2000.00-763,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.565,817.334,"Well, do you deny that if you have legal ability to get your future earnings, you cannot ask a court of equity to give you your future earnings without jury trial and everything else that goes with it?"
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,817.334,822.248,--It would certainly thwart the intent of Congress to provide make whole relief.
2000.00-763,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.248,822.414,I don't understand that.
2000.00-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,822.414,827.715,What do you call this... is there a universe of compensatory and punitive damages?
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,832.529,833.848,Equitable relief.
2000.00-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,833.848,835.789,No.
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,838.472,849.718,"Well, damages are a portion or a type of equitable relief which have been fashioned and made available under Title VII."
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,849.718,858.618,"Well, that's just contrary to the most fundamental understanding of the difference between equity and law."
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,865.51,885.861,"And the difficulty here... and perhaps I'm not expressing it clearly enough... is that when a court reaches the issue of front pay, the court is normally joining it with some form of injunctive relief that's certainly not within the provenance of a jury."
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,885.861,892.631,"Well, under the new law as written, you can get compensatory damages."
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,892.631,896.513,You can get compensatory damages under the Act.
2000.00-763,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,924.172,933.87,"It used to be, because under your theory, it was equitable relief, and it was... and the same money was not available through the law."
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,942.748,951.581,We have legislative history which makes clear that all the persons who expressed any statement on the new Act--
2000.00-763,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,951.581,953.15,"You're not looking at me, are you?"
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,953.15,959.587,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, I am."
2000.00-763,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,959.587,977.586,"Are you saying, Ms. Caldwell, essentially that front pay is post judgment back pay, that is, that they are identical animals, and Congress characterized back pay as equitable?"
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,977.586,978.951,Absolutely.
2000.00-763,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,978.951,984.235,"And front pay, since it is of the same character, is as much equitable."
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,984.235,986.181,Is equitable.
2000.00-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,988.526,989.929,Does the jury award back pay?
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,989.929,995.297,--Historically the jury did not award back pay.
2000.00-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,996.699,1002.644,Then it seems to me back pay and front pay ought to be treated the same under 1981a-(b)(2).
2000.00-763,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1002.644,1005.904,Are you sure that that's the right answer?
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,1011.023,1020.932,"Well, that is... I believe Justice Kennedy asked a question of practicality in terms of how it has been working in the court systems."
2000.00-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1022.623,1022.623,"Well, you mean the courts are violating the statute?"
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,1022.623,1023.904,--Sir?
2000.00-763,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1023.904,1025.967,The courts are violating the statute?
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,1034.472,1037.239,I believe it should not work that way.
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1065.68,1075.301,What about someone who has been discriminated against and wants damages but does not want reinstatement?
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,1075.301,1092.595,"If you look at 706(g) itself, that allows an award of back pay and other equitable relief regardless of reinstatement."
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1092.595,1100.602,So... but you're saying that the court must always first deal with reinstatement before it gets to back pay or--
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,1100.602,1102.105,Before it gets to front pay.
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1102.105,1102.848,--To front pay.
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,1111.559,1116.594,The converse is equally difficult.
2000.00-763,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1139.34,1152.965,"Isn't it true that the original characterization of back pay as equitable, that that was done way back in '64, because there was frankly distrust in how southern juries would deal with Title VII?"
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,1152.965,1153.829,Absolutely.
2000.00-763,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1153.829,1171.579,"So Congress created this thing that they call back pay, which one might characterize as compensatory whether it was called back pay, and then the court said, well, front pay is the same, is post judgment back pay, so the courts put it under the same heading."
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,1171.579,1182.248,"And keep in mind that front pay did not... that term was not coined until 1977, some five years after the 1972 amendment."
2000.00-763,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.248,1190.133,You said in response to an earlier question of Justice Ginsburg that the statute... or you agreed that the statute characterizes front pay as equitable.
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,1191.991,1194.674,I didn't mean to say that.
2000.00-763,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1194.674,1196.16,It doesn't call it equitable.
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,1210.528,1217.048,"It does not, but the original 706(g) as enacted in 1972 certainly does that."
2000.00-763,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1217.214,1218.784,It would have to be equitable.
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,1220.642,1221.135,--That's right.
2000.00-763,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1221.135,1223.819,And that's what Congress was trying to prevent in '64.
2000.00-763,0,33786,kathleen_l_caldwell,,1223.819,1236.617,And this Court certainly was well aware of it in the Albemarle Paper v. Moody case in which the Court strongly expressed the need for make whole relief to prevent discrimination.
2000.00-763,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1240.615,1242.273,"Thank you, Ms. Caldwell."
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1244.297,1252.842,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1283.966,1289.334,"Not relief that used to be authorized, but relief that is authorized."
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1289.334,1290.487,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1301.261,1303.573,As equitable relief.
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1303.573,1308.57,--As affirmative action or other equitable relief.
2000.00-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1309.229,1313.028,"Well, let's leave affirmative action aside."
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1322.975,1327.062,"Well, I don't think it has to be characterized as other equitable relief."
2000.00-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1341.634,1346.631,"Well, there was certainly compensatory damages provided."
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1346.631,1347.124,--Yes.
2000.00-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1361.408,1363.637,"It didn't say, the relief that was available."
2000.00-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1363.637,1365.411,"It says, the relief that is available."
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1365.411,1366.776,"--That is available, that is authorized."
2000.00-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1366.776,1368.634,"I mean, you're being circular."
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1376.185,1381.015,I think our arguments are equally circular when Congress--
2000.00-763,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1381.015,1383.327,"Well, the statute simply doesn't make that choice."
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1386.754,1391.378,"--It says authorized, and there are two factors there to consider."
2000.00-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1414.578,1416.436,You think authorized... you agree with Justice Souter.
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1418.626,1418.998,No.
2000.00-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1430.598,1430.681,All right.
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1430.681,1430.881,--and they're not divisible--
2000.00-763,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.881,1432.539,--Let me ask the question in another way.
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1439.847,1440.424,--Yes.
2000.00-763,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1442.198,1443.313,Tell me if there was a--
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1443.313,1444.593,"In fact, we know from the statute--"
2000.00-763,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1444.593,1445.419,"--No, go ahead."
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1445.708,1448.763,--We know from the statute that it didn't intend to subtract anything.
2000.00-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1515.143,1520.632,"It's much closer to traditional damages, front pay."
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1520.632,1524.802,--It's no closer to traditional damages than back pay.
2000.00-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1530.625,1531.49,"Well, no."
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1535.288,1536.608,--Well--
2000.00-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1536.608,1548.662,"Are you suggesting that, you know, if I am terminated before the time for my performance of services contract expires, that I can't get damages?"
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1548.662,1549.983,"--No, Your Honor."
2000.00-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1578.468,1580.576,It specifically named back pay.
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1594.815,1610.297,"Yes, it does, Your Honor, but it also mentions back pay as an illustration in a statute that allows the court to order such affirmative action, including reinstatement and in a statute that also allows it to award other equitable relief."
2000.00-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1610.297,1614.505,"Well, but that may have been referring back to reinstatement or hiring of employees."
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1616.363,1618.015,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1618.303,1620.244,With or without back pay.
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1620.244,1624.33,--There's never been a question that the back pay under title VII is equitable relief.
2000.00-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1646.622,1657.767,Do you think that Congress can eliminate the right to jury trial by simply denominating relief in the '64 Act as equitable relief?
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1657.767,1658.139,"No, Your Honor."
2000.00-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1658.139,1659.996,"I mean, it seems like a simple remedy."
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1667.221,1667.898,"No, Your Honor."
2000.00-763,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1673.199,1682.72,"What happens with back pay, a) under the statute as you interpret it, and b) as a matter of practice insofar as the jury's function is concerned?"
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1683.873,1685.609,--Back pay is a matter for the court.
2000.00-763,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1693.533,1696.012,"As a matter of practice, do juries ever do back pay?"
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1696.012,1708.272,"To the extent that juries might in some cases do back pay, which I'm not specifically aware of, I would assume that they're doing that in an advisory capacity, which the court is allowed to ask the jury to do."
2000.00-763,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1708.272,1713.102,And do you view that as consistent with our opinion in Chauffeurs Union?
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1713.102,1715.597,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-763,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.74,1752.09,In that sense--
2000.00-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1752.09,1754.341,"--But that's true of damages, too."
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1758.222,1763.962,Damages would apply even in a tort case where the--
2000.00-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1763.962,1768.049,"But in a contract case, a contract for personal services--"
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1768.049,1769.246,--Yes.
2000.00-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.052,1784.107,--I don't see how that would affect the right to jury trial.
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1784.107,1799.301,"--Well, Your Honor suggested in your concurring opinion in Albemarle Paper that the discretionary nature was relevant to the question of whether it's equitable relief or whether it's legal relief, and we would agree with that."
2000.00-763,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1804.169,1821.713,"Even if you were to lose on that point and even if it should be determined that it was subject to a jury trial, you might very well be correct about this case as to what Congress intended to exclude from the cap by the reference to the word other."
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1826.832,1830.797,"That it said other relief, but it excluded all relief authorized under 706(g), not just equitable relief."
2000.00-763,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1830.797,1834.762,"It doesn't count toward the... what is it... 300,000, whatever the cap is."
2000.00-763,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1834.762,1852.224,"It is true that in (b)(2), Congress did not limit the relief that's excluded to equitable relief, and if you think that 706(g) authorizes more than... relief that's more than equitable relief, then, yes, that would be true, Your Honor."
2000.00-763,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1852.224,1853.997,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
2000.00-763,2,40285,raymond_m_ripple,,1855.855,1864.334,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-763,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1948.918,1952.261,Just as back pay is past loss of earnings.
2000.00-763,2,40285,raymond_m_ripple,,1952.261,1953.83,That's generally true.
2000.00-763,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1953.83,1955.854,So you can't distinguish the two.
2000.00-763,2,40285,raymond_m_ripple,,1968.113,1970.425,"As far as that goes, that's correct."
2000.00-763,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2039.156,2043.16,"But it means, according to the Government, the same thing as back pay."
2000.00-763,2,40285,raymond_m_ripple,,2043.16,2047.618,"Again, as I said before, I don't think it does exactly at all."
2000.00-763,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2055.232,2058.103,It's for loss of wages.
2000.00-763,2,40285,raymond_m_ripple,,2081.404,2082.13,As to which?
2000.00-763,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2082.551,2088.074,"As to both, as to back pay and front pay are both discretionary with the judge."
2000.00-763,2,40285,raymond_m_ripple,,2088.074,2096.246,"I agree that as to back pay, based on the statute, the court had discretion."
2000.00-763,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2098.477,2107.105,"I think that's what all the courts have said, courts of appeals have said, about front pay since they modeled it on back pay, that it was discretionary."
2000.00-763,2,40285,raymond_m_ripple,,2107.105,2111.935,"Whether they modeled it on back pay, I think... I would take exception to that."
2000.00-763,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2139.882,2161.347,"Mr. Ripple, am I not right in thinking that front pay was first developed in the context of seniority systems where someone was denied the promotion, and Title VII preserves seniority systems, so that person was kept on the job at the lower level, paid at the higher rate."
