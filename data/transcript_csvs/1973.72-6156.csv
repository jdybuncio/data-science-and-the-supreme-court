1973.72-6156,0,32683,john_wilson_reed,,39.728,44.367,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-6156,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,496.861,510.79,"Are you suggesting that in a heated exchange of that kind, people undertake to dissect in parts and analyze these things as we are doing up here now properly here?"
1973.72-6156,0,32683,john_wilson_reed,,510.79,522.081,"It’s not completely clear to me that it was a heated exchange and secondly, I was saying the context of a citizen to a police officer, I do expect that sort of consideration."
1973.72-6156,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,558.519,561.413,Do you think that makes it tolerable and acceptable then?
1973.72-6156,0,32683,john_wilson_reed,,561.413,565.146,"I think if it’s an impulsive expression of anger, yes."
1973.72-6156,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,626.195,634.876,"Chaplinsky situation fraught to its attention, wasn’t that an expression in anger?"

1973.72-6156,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,636.164,638.108,Was that an excuse there?
1973.72-6156,0,32683,john_wilson_reed,,638.108,642.1,"Well, I’d like to consider Chaplinsky that’s right along that line."
1973.72-6156,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,685.339,691.239,"Wasn’t that tied to a construction given, I think by the Georgia Court at an earlier date?"
1973.72-6156,0,32683,john_wilson_reed,,691.239,709.606,"Right, but as I understand the Court’s opinion, it was used as an example of the fact that the Georgia Courts had been applying the ordinance there to situations that did not involve fighting words and at that case was cited as an example in which a jury issue was raised by that utterance."
1973.72-6156,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,745.17,751.348,Do you think the word racketeer is redundant in the city in the metropolitan area? [Laughter]
1973.72-6156,0,32683,john_wilson_reed,,751.348,755.138,I didn’t fully understand that.

1973.72-6156,1,41358,servando_c_garcia_iii,,1788.096,1792.959,The exception for fighting words and the exception for words that’s put forth in Chaplinsky.
1973.72-6156,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1792.959,1798.927,That’s for fighting words that is tend to incite to an immediate breach of peace.
1973.72-6156,1,41358,servando_c_garcia_iii,,1798.927,1817.939,"Mr. Justice Brennan, in Chaplinsky, it states the way I read it – I am trying to get an exact cite on it."
1973.72-6156,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1817.939,1820.282,"You mean the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous?"
1973.72-6156,1,41358,servando_c_garcia_iii,,1820.282,1827.417,"That’s correct, the lewd, included in this category of the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous and the insulting or fighting words."
1973.72-6156,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1827.417,1830.212,And you say that’s what Chaplinsky stands for?
1973.72-6156,1,41358,servando_c_garcia_iii,,1830.212,1833.923,That’s the interpretation that was given to -- that I give to Chaplinsky.
1973.72-6156,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1833.923,1838.771,"Gooding did not give that interpretation to it, does it?"
1973.72-6156,1,41358,servando_c_garcia_iii,,1838.771,1840.248,"In the Gooding case, I think—"
1973.72-6156,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1840.248,1841.905,"Well it did, did it?"
1973.72-6156,1,41358,servando_c_garcia_iii,,1858.733,1859.549,"That is a correct wording, Your Honor."
1973.72-6156,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1859.549,1860.166,Alright.
1973.72-6156,1,41358,servando_c_garcia_iii,,1871.075,1872.702,That’s not the contention of the City of New Orleans.

1973.72-6156,1,41358,servando_c_garcia_iii,,1877.201,1886.045,"As I stated in the case of Cantwell and Chaplinsky, the words that were uttered by the majority opinion of this Court."
1973.72-6156,2,32683,john_wilson_reed,,2646.172,2649.326,"Unless the Court has any questions Your Honor, I have nothing further to say."
