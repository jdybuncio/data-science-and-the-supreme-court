1976.75-636,0,40580,robert_d_shuler,,92.423,97.554,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-636,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,411.063,415.345,"Where -- what page is that, the Title VII issue?"
1976.75-636,0,40580,robert_d_shuler,,415.345,424.274,"Your Honor that is in volume one of the Appendix, page 195."
1976.75-636,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,424.274,431.656,Thank you.
1976.75-636,0,40580,robert_d_shuler,,431.656,437.647,The very first person listed there is a man name J F Johnson of Hayward California Terminal.
1976.75-636,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,449.327,456.917,"So what -- then what -- it begins on page 191, didn’t it or not?"
1976.75-636,0,40580,robert_d_shuler,,456.917,462.727,Page 199 -- 191 Your Honor is the first list that was submitted at the trial.
1976.75-636,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,462.727,463.005,Yes.
1976.75-636,0,40580,robert_d_shuler,,463.005,466.267,Of persons for whom individual relief was sought.
1976.75-636,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,466.267,466.529,I see.
1976.75-636,0,40580,robert_d_shuler,,466.529,467.825,Apart from class relief.
1976.75-636,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,467.825,472.061,"But Jackson is 196, not 195?"
1976.75-636,0,40580,robert_d_shuler,,472.061,478.14,Well Your Honor the -- I was asked about what appeared on page 191 and that was the first list --
1976.75-636,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,478.14,478.381,Yes.
1976.75-636,0,40580,robert_d_shuler,,478.381,482.29,-- that was submitted at the trial of those for whom individual relief was sought.
1976.75-636,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,685.165,704.095,"Before you proceed to that, I want to be sure I understand that the Court of Appeals' order that the seniority be given even though that seniority might have the beginning of employment might have antedated the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."
1976.75-636,0,40580,robert_d_shuler,,704.095,706.237,The -- you mean --
1976.75-636,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,706.237,710.314,Let’s say somebody was hired in 1960.
1976.75-636,0,40580,robert_d_shuler,,712.849,716.046,"That is correct, his full seniority to antedate the --"
1976.75-636,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,716.046,720.95,Is that issue still in the case?
1976.75-636,0,40580,robert_d_shuler,,720.95,723.898,"Yes, I believe it is Your Honor."
1976.75-636,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,740.172,741.667,To the effective date of this act.
1976.75-636,0,40580,robert_d_shuler,,741.667,749.136,To the effective date of the act for one class and to later dates for the two other classes on Appendixes B and C.
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1015.479,1018.991,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please."
1976.75-636,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1181.18,1190.13,"Well, they weren’t horrible so far as the federal law went -- putting aside to Section 1981, prior to 1964, were they?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1190.13,1193.055,"Prior to 1964, of course, they couldn’t have violated the Act."
1976.75-636,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1193.055,1198.345,"And whether they (Voice Overlap) in some people’s opinion, but they were certainly were not illegal, were they?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1198.345,1203.967,And this of course is not a 1981 case and they were not illegal.
1976.75-636,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1254.665,1256.887,"And they were on -- they were all in the city units, were they?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1256.887,1257.493,Yes they were.
1976.75-636,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1257.493,1258.729,Yes.
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1258.729,1267.937,Some may have been in the mechanics unit but at least they worked in the City and they didn’t work on the road and there were very few people who did work on the road.
1976.75-636,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1269.148,1274.099,"There were few minority people, if any, who worked on the road is what you --"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1274.099,1274.641,That’s correct.
1976.75-636,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1274.641,1274.857,Yes.
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1274.857,1280.871,They were two or three but minimal amount.
1976.75-636,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1280.871,1285.945,"How many do you say -- did you just tell us, had claims of actual discrimination in your view?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1285.945,1288.696,"Well, counsel referred to those two pages in the record."
1976.75-636,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1288.696,1288.913,Yes.
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1288.913,1295.775,The first was a list of some 20 or 30 people who they claim were individual discriminitees.
1976.75-636,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1322.135,1322.464,Yes.
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1322.464,1324.952,-- and they all were victims of discrimination.
1976.75-636,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1324.952,1331.787,"And they were all even in the Government's view, they were all employees of this employer, weren’t they?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1331.787,1332.474,Yes.
1976.75-636,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1332.474,1341.854,"None of them was the -- there’s no plaintiffs here who claim discrimination in that they were not hired at all, are they?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1341.854,1348.125,"We’re -- in this case, at this stage we’re talking about putative transferees and not about (Voice Overlap)."
1976.75-636,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1348.125,1351.435,And all of the employees of this dependent employer?
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1351.435,1377.198,"Now, the area of -- the period from 1965 to -- on was a period of merger of some of a great number of other freight lines, T.I.M.E.-D.C. was coming from a little one down in Texas to a big one that went nationwide and they were taking on other people’s rights and other people’s employees and so it was not a period of hiring from the outside."
1976.75-636,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1402.391,1406.041,Do you say that the (Voice Overlap) -- higher percentage on the roads?
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1406.041,1408.741,"A very little higher percentage on the road, very few people came on."
1976.75-636,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1408.741,1409.722,But didn’t effect it at all?
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1409.722,1416.506,"Three or four people Mr. Justice Marshall very, very few, but they weren’t hiring on the road then as far as this record shows --"
1976.75-636,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1416.506,1420.812,"But in all of this period you’re talking about, that number didn’t increase?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1420.812,1424.052,Perhaps two to three but minimally.
1976.75-636,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1577.67,1581.067,"You said ahead of other people, you mean, ahead of any new hiring?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1581.067,1583.696,"No, only his amendment Mr. Justice Brennan."
1976.75-636,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1585.752,1586.344,I see.
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1586.344,1588.272,And we think this was error.
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.004,1652.644,Oh!
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1664.995,1668.902,"Under the Court of Appeals, if a man became the city man in 1950?"
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1668.902,1669.935,Yes.
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1669.935,1672.337,He would have 1950 road seniority.
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.337,1672.63,I see.
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1672.63,1673.899,And while he would go to the next --
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1673.899,1675.72,As effective as of the date he actually -- (Voice Overlap) there was a vacancy that --
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1675.72,1681.378,"He would go -- next vacancy on the road, that’s correct, but then when you set that in the context of the contract where --"
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1681.378,1681.656,I got it.
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1681.656,1685.722,-- where runs are up for grabs every six months or every year --
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1685.722,1686.062,Yes.
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1686.062,1687.909,-- he would go to the top of the road list --
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.909,1689.969,Exactly.
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1689.969,1695.265,-- under the Court of Appeals' opinion although there is no evidence at all that he was a victim.
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1695.265,1705.002,"Well, yes, but -- the top -- the 30 that the District Court identified as having been discriminated against would be in that position under the District Court's --"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1705.002,1705.821,However the District Court --
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1705.821,1706.657,Although they -- that --
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1706.657,1709.536,-- specially found when they’d applied or when they had found that the --
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1709.536,1709.766,"Yes, but the District --"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1709.766,1717.686,-- the EEOC charge or when they adopted to go to the road and this -- the District Court did what was done in the Franks case here.
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.814,1723.313,Now you went back to --
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1723.313,1724.719,-- the first time he went in the city.
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1724.719,1727.228,"He want back to 65, did he, and --"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1727.228,1727.859,Only to 65.
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1727.859,1729.64,"For the 30, for the 30."
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1729.64,1730.157,Yes sir.
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.813,1735.38,"No farther back than 60%, that was it?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1735.38,1736.356,That’s correct.
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.356,1739.523,And the other -- the probable ones back to 71 or something?
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1739.523,1740.867,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1743.595,1752.003,"And how about this large group that would go in ahead of others of white cities, what seniority would they have?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1752.003,1752.96,They would have seniority --
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1752.96,1753.569,As of that date?
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1753.569,1758.36,"-- of the date they went into the -- as they go into, but of course they block whites from going in, now --"
1976.75-636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1758.36,1764.84,Then the Court -- the Court of Appeals in effect just said all of them are going to have the same seniority.
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1764.84,1767.449,That’s correct.
1976.75-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.449,1769.193,"Mr. Wells, is that right?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1769.193,1770.446,His principle.
1976.75-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1770.446,1770.486,Isn’t it?
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.486,1772.119,The rule would be the same --
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1772.119,1780.333,The principle that they indicated was that what the District Court had done in focusing on individuals was error.
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.491,1801.898,"Yes, who gets a -- under the Court of Appeals' view, who would get the first crack at the first opening?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1801.898,1803.34,I’m not sure they’re clear about that.
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.852,1807.146,"Well, wouldn’t it -- would that depend on (Voice Overlap)"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1807.146,1809.443,I have to go back to the District Court to find out.
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1809.443,1812.805,Would that depend on their unit seniority or do you know?
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1812.805,1824.868,"Well, I’d -- the Court of Appeals says the whole works will get all the seniority that they had in the city provided only that they were qualified."
1976.75-636,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1824.868,1830.616,I understand that but who gets the -- who occupies the first positions that open up?
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1830.616,1833.164,Court of Appeals didn’t tell us that.
1976.75-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1834.401,1838.569,"Mr. Wells, before you go on, could you just clarify something for me?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1843.597,1844.654,"Only that, yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1844.654,1848.154,"And they maybe different dates of course, it could be different proofs for different --"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1848.154,1848.6,Yes.
1976.75-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1848.6,1858.981,"Now under the District Court analysis, I want to get the difference between the two as best as I can. What was the test the District Court applied to determine whether or not an individual was a “victim?”"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1861.082,1862.975,He didn’t talk in terms of his test.
1976.75-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1895.97,1898.609,"Well, let me change the question just a little bit then I don’t mean to interrupt but --"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1898.609,1899.132,Sure.
1976.75-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1899.132,1902.556,You disagree with the District -- the Court of Appeals' approach of qualification.
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1907.359,1920.985,I think that the test is 40 years of experience under the Labor Act which this Court has said is the model on which Title VII was drafted.
1976.75-636,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1942.631,1950.576,"Would be correct to summarize by, they should show in addition to qualification either a specific application or specific reason for not applying at a given time?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,1950.576,1960.384,Yes indeed as a matter of fact following generally what the Court said in McDonald-Douglas here or what 40 years of experience before the NLRB has indicated.
1976.75-636,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2096.204,2098.198,"Had to be have -- there has to be a vacancy, doesn’t it?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,2098.198,2109.607,"Well, I can conceive of the situation where there is gross showing that -- of a discrimination where there may not even have to be a vacancy."
1976.75-636,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2113.093,2114.768,You mean he could bump someone else?
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,2114.768,2116.228,No.
1976.75-636,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2135.11,2138.241,"What seniority would he take with him, none?"
1976.75-636,1,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,2138.241,2144.661,He would take the seniority that he would’ve had had there been no unlawful discrimination.
1976.75-636,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2165.499,2167.641,Very well Mr. Wells.
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2172.73,2178.388,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-636,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2221.683,2227.026,If Mr. Shuler wishes to file a reply brief we will leave that entirely up to him.
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2227.026,2227.963,We have no objection.
1976.75-636,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2227.963,2230.294,But he -- how is that to lead?
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2230.294,2231.341,The --
1976.75-636,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2231.341,2235.42,Your parties to this case are not parties to the next companion case?
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2235.42,2250.85,"That is correct, Your Honor but the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had filed an amicus brief in the Rodriguez case in the Court of Appeals stating views that in some respects differ a little from the views we’ve now stated in the brief we’ve filed."
1976.75-636,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2250.85,2252.006,Filed with us?
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2252.006,2256.268,"Yes, we have filed one here, a joint, a joint brief in this case."
1976.75-636,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2264.892,2266.02,(Voice Overlap) is this the one?
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2266.02,2270.954,That is correct.
1976.75-636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2302.303,2324.575,"Mr. Wallace, suppose -- I suppose if there were 400 parties to the suit or were in the class and it was shown in the evidence that only 200 had been hired or there’d only been 200 vacancies in the period, would all 400 be entitled to some relief?"
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2324.575,2336.776,"Well, under the Dis -- the Court of Appeals' judgment here, when a vacancy occurs it’s to be filled --"
1976.75-636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.776,2337.505,I understand that.
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2337.505,2348.731,"-- by a member of the class and in that sense all 400 would be entitled to the opportunity to fill each vacancy as it comes along, but only one can fill each vacancy as it arises."
1976.75-636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2348.731,2363.173,"Well, I understand, but what if there could only have been 200 acts of discrimination in the relevant period and that’s in short, no more than 200 people could’ve been excluded from a transfer or a hiring when it come to race?"
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2363.173,2369.833,"Well, all members of the class would still be presumptively and entitled to relief under this --"
1976.75-636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2369.833,2371.238,"Why, why is that?"
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2371.238,2373.641,"Well, I suppose the short answer --"
1976.75-636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.641,2375.364,"I know that’s your position, I have to disagree (Voice Overlap)."
1976.75-636,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2375.364,2376.205,(Voice Overlap) holding or what?
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2376.205,2385.326,The short answer is that you can’t tell whether the other 200 of the 400 would’ve opted to make the transfer.
1976.75-636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2385.326,2387.69,"I know, but there were only 200 vacancy -- I’m posting only to the 200 vacancies?"
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2387.69,2388.343,Yes.
1976.75-636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.547,2419.908,"Well, I understand that and that would make a lot of sense if you had 400 vacancies, that if there had been 400 possible acts of discrimination in them in a relevant period?"
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2419.908,2424.576,"But you see, they only needed 200 possible acts of discrimination against the class of 400."
1976.75-636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2424.576,2425.261,Why?
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2425.261,2427.971,Presumably because 200 of them wouldn’t have transferred anyway.
1976.75-636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.971,2429.355,Why?
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2429.355,2431.426,"Well, that’s the experience that we have."
1976.75-636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.504,2434.93,I know but you got to give them (Voice Overlap)
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2434.93,2440.948,"Well, it’s theoretically but they don’t actually all get the relief and they don’t -- only all opt for the relief."
1976.75-636,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2440.948,2441.477,Well doesn’t that suggest --
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2441.477,2444.051,They’re only presumptively entitled.
1976.75-636,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2450.067,2459.213,Doesn't your answer to Justice White’s question suggests at least some arguable difficulty with your definition of a class of 400?
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2459.213,2489.569,"Well, it’s a difficulty that I think what the Court put behind it in the Franks case in talking about the stages of trial or the class action in this context where pattern and practice was established in Franks and then you go back to see whether individuals who are part of the class discriminated against can be shown not to be entitled to relief because they were not actual victims of discrimination."
1976.75-636,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2495.632,2512.772,"But weren’t these people here -- the people in Franks had all made some either effort to obtain employment or had been discouraged by a refusal to employ, you don’t have that limited a criterion here, do you?"
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2512.772,2525.358,We do not have a situation where the Court of Appeals has required prior applications from the class discriminated against here for several reasons.
1976.75-636,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2583.903,2592.248,"But after 1965 they knew it was a violation of Federal Law for the company to follow that policy, but did follow it?"
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2592.248,2602.509,"Well, they might have known that if they had wanted to take on law enforcement responsibilities of that kind on their own."
1976.75-636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.578,2623.792,"Mr. Wallace, do I understand that the Court of Appeals on remand would have permitted proof by the company that certain people were not discrim -- in fact discriminated against?"
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2623.792,2626.722,That is our understanding of the Court of Appeals' opinion.
1976.75-636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2626.722,2632.021,"So there’s just a question of burden of proof on discrimination, on actual discrimination?"
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2632.021,2642.348,"The -- what the Court of Appeals has upheld here is the establishment of a prima facie case of disc -- of a pattern and practice of discrimination against the class discrimination, yes."
1976.75-636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2642.348,2652.916,So that once -- so the Government doesn’t have to take on the job approving individual discriminations but the company can get out of liability of a certain people by proving they weren’t discriminated.
1976.75-636,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2652.916,2659.96,That is our position and in this respect the Court of Appeals anticipated this Court’s decision in Franks.
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,5610.743,5615.611,Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please.
1976.75-636,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5804.922,5817.529,"Does this record show, Mr. Wells, individual complaints by a Negro driver, city drivers that they had applied for transfer and were met by this block?"
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,5817.529,5839.253,"There are some who say they opted to go on the road who testified that these options were indicated pre-1965, at a point when it was not unlawful under this statute."
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5839.253,5842.588,"Mr. Wells, let’s be realistic."
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,5863.267,5865.45,"I do, Your Honor and for long --"
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5865.45,5867.347,"Well, what do you argue, going back on your own contract?"
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,5867.347,5869.292,Long prior to the --
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5869.292,5873.952,"Are you going back -- your contract says seniority, doesn’t it?"
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,5873.952,5875.835,"I misunderstood your question, Your Honor."
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5875.835,5879.583,Your union contract says seniority on the line.
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,5879.583,5888.606,Our union contract Mr. Justice Marshall says that seniority begins from the date of coming in to the bargaining unit.
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5897.817,5898.214,I didn’t say that.
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,5898.214,5904.267,"So his seniority starts white, black, brown or whatever when he comes in that unit."
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5904.267,5921.56,"I said, if he comes in with seniority back to when he first applied, would the white man that is thereby interfered with, comes to his union which is your union, what would you say, too bad?"
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,5921.56,5936.664,"I would say that this black man coming and showing that he was discriminated against because of his race in entry into that unit, should unlawfully discriminated against."
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5938.82,5940.274,Which union?
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,5940.274,5941.655,Any Teamster Union.
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5941.655,5941.98,What?
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,5941.98,5942.746,Any Teamster Union.
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5942.746,5945.648,"He’s in one, he’s in the local, isn’t he?"
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,5945.648,5946.304,Pardon?
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5946.304,5948.821,Isn’t he in the city local?
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,5948.821,5963.345,"Some place in Los Angeles, there are separate locals, in Dallas it’s the same local and it varies but any Teamster Union will support white or black in getting his seniority from the date he comes to work in that unit."
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5963.345,5964.948,Over the white man.
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,5964.948,5977.443,"He will come and he will get his seniority as “X” date as to when he applied or when a job was open for him and when he was discriminated against and until there comes a time, if I may answer, if Your Honor please."
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5994.591,5996.627,So the Negro won’t get it?
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,5996.627,5999.028,It depends on when he was discriminated against.
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6004.479,6006.701,"Well, that’s not in your contract."
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,6006.701,6008.919,"Yes sir, that’s exactly the contract."
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6008.919,6010.293,Where is that in the contract?
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,6010.293,6012.697,The -- Article 38 of the contract.
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6012.697,6014.702,"But, when, if you’ll understand my question."
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,6014.702,6015.186,"Oh, I’m sorry sir."
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6015.186,6019.359,Where in the contract did you see about somebody who were discriminated against because of race.
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,6019.359,6027.4,"In article 38, may I find it, I believe it is in the third volume, Mr. Previant(ph) is looking for it now but there is a specific --"
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6027.4,6030.424,"We’ll find it, go ahead, go ahead, we will find it."
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,6030.424,6035.668,Here we are on page 816.
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6043.986,6049.089,"Well, I do not see anything there about seniority as waived."
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,6049.089,6050.017,Alright.
1976.75-636,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6072.276,6073.624,I’d rather take your word for it.
1976.75-636,3,35226,l_n_d_wells_jr,,6073.624,6074.581,Thank you Your Honor.
1976.75-636,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,6271.551,6274.985,May I make a brief comment with respect to that.
