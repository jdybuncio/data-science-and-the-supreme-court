2004.03-1423,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,15.0,We'll now hear argument in the case of Muehler against Mena.
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,16.387,19.423,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1423,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,28.695,32.064,"May I ask one preliminary question, Mr. Phillips?"
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,37.401,42.789,"Well, we do believe that a qualified immunity issue is bound up with the underlying merits."
2004.03-1423,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,45.155,47.572,But it wasn't... it wasn't in the questions--
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,47.572,49.025,--This Court--
2004.03-1423,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,49.025,50.425,--on which we granted cert?
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,50.425,65.802,"--This Court in Procunier treated the qualified immunity issue as part and parcel of the underlying merits of the case and... and, in fact, skipped over the question of what 1983 meant in order to address the qualified immunity issue."
2004.03-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,66.404,66.904,How... how--
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,66.904,68.07,--the Court could do the same thing here.
2004.03-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,68.07,69.189,--How do we do it?
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,110.164,110.599,Right.
2004.03-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,110.599,112.916,The jury said it was.
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,114.635,115.785,"Well, I mean, this... this--"
2004.03-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,115.785,116.168,--in that situation?
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,118.303,122.924,"--Well, in the first instance, it's reasonably clear to me that you're not bound by the jury's determination here."
2004.03-1423,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,123.974,128.644,We... don't we have to give any weight at all to the jury finding there or--
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,128.644,134.214,"--With respect to the historical facts of the case, who did what to whom, of course, you have... that... that's subject to clearly erroneous review."
2004.03-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,140.368,142.134,"Well, a lot of it may depend on the--"
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,142.134,142.718,--and law that this Court has decided as de novo.
2004.03-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,142.718,159.58,--on the music as to handcuffing and what did they say and what was the atmosphere and what was the garage really like and how risky was it that there be gang members in the outhouses and... and all kinds of stuff that you might sense from the testimony.
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,159.58,173.089,"It... it seems to me that... Justice Breyer, that the answer to all of those questions go to the core of what it means to exercise unquestioned command of the situation, which is a pure legal standard that this Court adopted a quarter of a century ago in Michigan v. Summers."
2004.03-1423,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,204.708,205.893,--Have you responded to my initial question?
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,208.695,210.378,"No, Justice O'Connor."
2004.03-1423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,256.493,259.778,"Well, what is the... what is the function of a jury in this case?"
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,295.718,297.836,I... I'm not saying that that would be true in all cases.
2004.03-1423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,308.526,314.948,"Well, we don't know the fact... what facts were found because all we have is in the jury verdict that this was excessive force."
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,316.182,318.75,"--But that's just a conclusion of law, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-1423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,322.019,322.736,But it's like was--
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,322.736,323.302,--by the respondent's brief.
2004.03-1423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,323.302,324.003,--the defendant negligent.
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,339.913,342.365,"Well, we know precisely what they did."
2004.03-1423,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,351.721,356.859,Wasn't there a fact issue as to whether she was handcuffed for... even for a short period after the search had been completed?
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,356.859,366.547,"I don't think there is a factual question like that because I don't think that question was presented to the jury, and it was certainly not the basis on which the Ninth Circuit affirmed the jury's verdict in this case."
2004.03-1423,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,401.554,407.391,"But if... but if it made a difference as a matter of law, what... what should we assume about that extra 15 minutes?"
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,414.378,424.669,"I think if the jury had been asked to make that finding, that you... and... and the jury determined that there... that it was unreasonable, then I think you'd have to conclude that the 15 minutes were, in fact... that it did, in fact, go beyond 15 minutes."
2004.03-1423,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,457.824,476.888,"Now, in doing it as a matter of law here, should we give consideration to the fact that in this case, if... if I remember correctly, one of the officers testified that had they followed normal protocol, once they had, I think his phrase was, secured the building, the... the main building--"
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,476.888,478.671,"Well, the... all of the grounds actually."
2004.03-1423,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,478.671,480.09,--Is that the whole compound?
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,480.09,480.54,Yes.
2004.03-1423,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,480.54,487.009,"That... that they would have... they would have taken off the immediate restraints, and he wasn't sure why they didn't."
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,495.432,506.138,"I think if this Court could determine that, as a matter of course, the... the standard operating procedures in a particular way, that might certainly inform the Court's Fourth Amendment analysis."
2004.03-1423,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,596.631,597.015,Okay.
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,624.834,635.023,"I'm... I'm quite comfortable with the way the Court analyzed it in Michigan v. Summers, that the officer is not required to evaluate the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the seizure."
2004.03-1423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,641.677,644.696,"But in the facts there, there were no handcuffs."
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,647.931,660.407,"--I understand that, and... but my... my position is that handcuffs don't materially affect the detention under these circumstances other than to assure what the Court said, which is unquestioned command of the situation."
2004.03-1423,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,660.407,668.061,"So... I mean, I don't... would... would you say handcuffs are per se lawful for... for purposes of applying Summers?"
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,668.061,674.667,"Yes, but it's important to put that in context because Summers is a narrow exception to the... not an exception."
2004.03-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.383,708.854,"Well, it doesn't... why is contraband magical?"
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,718.21,719.976,Justice Scalia--
2004.03-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.976,721.245,--from letting people wander around?
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,721.245,721.678,--absolutely.
2004.03-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.678,725.297,"Which is the case with contraband, but would be the case for many other reasons as well."
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,725.297,727.713,I think the important point here is that we're talking about guns.
2004.03-1423,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,735.569,739.038,But would you be happy then with a holding that says just what you said?
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,797.993,804.13,"Well, it... it could have been a basis for the jury's verdict if they had, in fact, put the issue of whether or not they were detained--"
2004.03-1423,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,804.13,810.384,"But, Mr.... Mr.... but may I point out that the judge's instructions did put that issue to the jury at page 203."
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,821.109,821.559,--Right.
2004.03-1423,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,848.842,851.544,I wonder why the judge gave this instruction then.
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,851.544,855.765,"Because... because what he's... well, you know, it's a reasonable instruction."
2004.03-1423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,855.765,860.65,"--And why... why there was... there was a special verdict of sorts, not a detailed one."
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,867.256,867.89,Yes.
2004.03-1423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,867.89,883.182,"--One question concerns whether the force was excessive, and the other one is, do you find that she was detained for a longer period than reasonable?"
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,897.342,898.242,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-1423,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,900.044,920.79,"Well, it seems to me that the judge is asking the jury in these questions, one is whether there was a... a detention, was force greater than was reasonable under the circumstances, and whether the duration was longer than reasonable under the circumstances."
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,920.79,921.14,--Right.
2004.03-1423,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.315,969.121,"And you're saying the... the mere fact it... it went to the jury, even went to the jury without your objecting to it, does not mean we have to listen to what the jury said."
2004.03-1423,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,969.938,970.307,Right.
2004.03-1423,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,992.669,993.019,You might save your time.
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1005.81,1007.996,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1423,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1052.441,1056.327,Then this case should not have gone to the jury on the basis of what you said--
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1056.327,1057.093,We--
2004.03-1423,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1057.093,1066.083,--because you... you just said that this... the handcuffs... the circumstances... the circumstances here were reasonable as a matter of law.
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1066.083,1068.301,"--Justice Ginsburg, that's correct."
2004.03-1423,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1101.439,1105.493,"Well... well, has the... the objection to the instruction been preserved here?"
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1105.493,1110.628,Perhaps an argument could be made that it's fairly included within the questions presented.
2004.03-1423,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1122.035,1132.393,"But on the... on the question whether they preserved the issue, I... I took it, implicit in what you said a minute ago, that yes, they did not object to the submission of the question."
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1137.762,1138.797,--That's correct.
2004.03-1423,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1138.797,1146.218,"But they... they had moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence, and that's enough to preserve the issue?"
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1146.218,1147.737,I think that's true.
2004.03-1423,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1162.346,1174.82,"When you... is your objection that the jury wasn't given enough guidance on excessive force, or is it that the... that the ultimate issue of excessive force is not a jury issue?"
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1174.82,1182.326,"We would concede, I think, Justice Scalia, that the issue should go to the jury where there are disputed issues of historical fact."
2004.03-1423,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.093,1194.133,"Well, but is... is excessive force an issue of historical fact any more than... than unreasonable search or unreasonable seizure is an issue of historical fact?"
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1194.133,1195.217,"--Well, there are certain--"
2004.03-1423,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1195.217,1202.637,"I mean, it's an historical fact how long you held the person, whether the person was in handcuffs, but the ultimate question was, you know, is this force excessive."
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1210.243,1213.362,"--Justice Scalia, those facts may be disputed in a particular case."
2004.03-1423,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1219.166,1220.535,So when--
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1220.535,1221.418,--or no we didn't use handcuffs.
2004.03-1423,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1221.418,1229.289,"--when you know all those facts, you're willing to send it to the jury to say, given all of these facts, it's up to you to decide whether unreasonable force was used or not."
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1229.289,1230.107,We believe that it is--
2004.03-1423,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.107,1230.924,It's not a matter of law.
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1230.924,1235.192,"--a mixed question of fact and law, and once the historical facts are established, it is essentially--"
2004.03-1423,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.192,1239.429,Why... why any more so... why any... any more so than... than whether it's an unreasonable seizure?
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1239.429,1253.006,"--Well, we would submit that it is no different from the question whether officers had probable cause or reasonable suspicion on any given set of historical facts which this Court held in Ornelas was a question subject to de novo review, over your dissent, admittedly."
2004.03-1423,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1264.278,1277.704,"Are... are you saying that the only basis on... on which the jury could have ruled for the homeowner here, the... the respondent, is that she was handcuffed for too long?"
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1277.704,1280.839,We believe that that certainly is the primary issue that was at stake.
2004.03-1423,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1281.523,1282.106,"Well, I think you have to say that."
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1302.068,1313.475,"--I think that the handcuffing was the key factor at trial, and I think that the best evidence of that, quite frankly, is that respondent in her proposed instructions referred only to handcuffing in her excessive force instruction."
2004.03-1423,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1316.643,1317.093,"No, no."
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1322.981,1329.77,"I think that that's true, but I think that the instruction didn't really provide any guidance on excessive force specifically."
2004.03-1423,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1339.943,1346.696,"Well, then it seems to me it was the plaintiff's obligation to submit a clarifying instruction and to bring this... the denial of that instruction here."
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1346.696,1356.737,"Well, there were objections to the instruction below, and all I can say is that perhaps an argument could be made... and perhaps Mr. Phillips will make the argument on rebuttal... that it is fairly included within the questions presented."
2004.03-1423,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1356.737,1378.651,"I don't know how you can... you can say that the only thing that was before the jury was the handcuff when the... there was evidence that she was treated very roughly in... in the first instance, she was woken from her sleep, she wasn't told that they were police, she thought they were robbers, and she feared for her life."
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1383.988,1390.058,"Justice Ginsburg, it was the primary issue before the jury, and to be sure, there were other issues."
2004.03-1423,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1414.257,1417.109,But... but may I just ask a sort of very basic question?
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1434.754,1439.474,Assuming that that instruction is correct... and that might very well be a valid instruction--
2004.03-1423,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1439.474,1439.974,"Well, if you think was correct."
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1439.974,1442.176,--It may very well be a correct instruction--
2004.03-1423,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1442.176,1442.66,All right.
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1442.66,1445.045,--with regard to a challenge to the manner of the detention itself.
2004.03-1423,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1450.699,1452.299,Then it's not a question of law.
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1461.488,1463.59,"--It is a mixed question of law and fact, and the jury's job is--"
2004.03-1423,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1463.59,1464.907,It's a mixed question?
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1464.907,1469.093,--The jury's job is to... to resolve the underlying factual issues and then--
2004.03-1423,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.093,1476.664,"Well, I understand the historical fact, but I'm... I'm questioning you about the conclusions that you draw from the unreasonableness, degrading, and so forth."
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1480.818,1486.639,--We believe that that actually is ultimately a judge issue in the same way that the issue of whether or not probable--
2004.03-1423,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.639,1487.705,So this instruction should not have been given.
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1487.705,1488.505,--That's correct--
2004.03-1423,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1488.505,1501.482,"I thought your position was that it... it may be submitted to the jury, but that it may be reviewed as a question of law simply because that's the way we are able to set standards for later cases."
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1501.482,1504.767,"--I think that's exactly right, and I think that that is the teaching of Ornelas."
2004.03-1423,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1590.522,1594.908,How long did it take them to find out whether the... these other dangerous people were there?
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1594.908,1597.21,To find out whether?
2004.03-1423,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1597.21,1600.914,Whether the people they were afraid of were... were on the premises?
2004.03-1423,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1600.914,1608.251,"Well, you know, I don't know that they ever actually made a... a determination other than that Mr. Romero was not on the premises."
2004.03-1423,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1613.472,1614.722,Thank you.
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1619.309,1622.578,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1686.801,1695.506,Do you find that the... that the... do you define the end of the search as before they started videotaping everything they had done?
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1695.506,1697.808,"Well, they were videotaping during the course of the search."
2004.03-1423,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1754.311,1755.763,Where... where is that testimony?
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1755.763,1758.799,--The testimony... Officer Brill's testimony?
2004.03-1423,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1830.061,1831.078,But not from these premises.
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1831.078,1831.478,--No.
2004.03-1423,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1843.285,1851.557,"But the... the... I thought that this poorhouse, or whatever it was called... that the warrant covered weapons that were there."
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1851.557,1851.941,--Yes.
2004.03-1423,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1851.941,1853.076,That they were looking for weapons.
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1853.076,1854.276,They were looking for a gun.
2004.03-1423,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1854.276,1858.545,"They were not looking for a gun at Romero's mother's house, were they?"
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1858.545,1859.363,"Well, I think the--"
2004.03-1423,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1859.363,1861.013,"Did they have a warrant, a search warrant?"
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1861.013,1865.984,"--I think the warrant covered... I think they were looking for the gun wherever it was found, and... and the... I believe the warrant--"
2004.03-1423,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1865.984,1869.853,"Well, this was a... this was a pretty extensive search warrant that they had."
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1869.853,1870.455,--Yes.
2004.03-1423,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1870.455,1875.09,"Did they have something like that, the same kind of warrant for the--"
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1875.09,1883.612,"Well, it's the same warrant I believe, Your Honor, in terms of... we don't have... there's not a lot of information in the record about--"
2004.03-1423,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1883.612,1892.366,"--Well, wasn't... I thought that this warrant referred to a particular address, a particular house, not... not any house where one might find Romero."
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1892.366,1892.918,"--No, no, no."
2004.03-1423,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1896.336,1898.872,"Well, was the other house his mother's house?"
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1898.872,1899.472,Yes.
2004.03-1423,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1923.837,1942.9,"Then that would make it even more curious if the place where the dangerous man was wasn't searched extensively and... and the mother... nobody was put in handcuffs, and yet for this... they knew pretty soon that Romero wasn't on the premises."
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1942.9,1943.983,"Well, they knew right away."
2004.03-1423,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1943.983,1944.551,Yes.
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,1953.439,1973.003,"I think that that explains one of the reasons why the jury imposed punitive damages here because they... they knew that at 8:45, at the time that Officer Muehler said that the search was over and all the officers were out of the house and... and everything was done, that Mr. Romero was cited and released for marijuana possession."
2004.03-1423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1986.078,1989.429,"You might be able to keep your verdict, I... I think."
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2099.352,2099.686,Yes.
2004.03-1423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2105.173,2107.006,"Yes, but then we can't really reach the issue."
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2108.775,2111.41,--And in fact... and I... I think that would be the appropriate thing to do.
2004.03-1423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2111.41,2117.58,"Well, but then suppose that the reason that this case is here is because of the implications--"
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2117.58,2118.063,Right.
2004.03-1423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2118.063,2120.265,--of the Ninth Circuit's analysis--
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2120.265,2120.732,Right.
2004.03-1423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2120.732,2125.651,--not necessarily the extra 30 minutes because I see your point on the extra 30 minutes.
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2125.651,2131.471,"I think... I think that there... I would divide my response to that, Justice Breyer, into two parts really."
2004.03-1423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.255,2157.838,"Well, we could say is their opinion... that's their opinion."
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2159.474,2159.84,Right.
2004.03-1423,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2164.378,2181.923,"If... if two of the reasons that the Ninth Circuit gave are in our view incorrect, why wouldn't we reverse and remand for them to do it without... to make the judgment without taking those two factors into account?"
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2181.923,2184.875,"Well, I think what... first of all, it's a separate alternative holding."
2004.03-1423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2233.289,2233.789,Well--
2004.03-1423,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2233.789,2234.289,I don't--
2004.03-1423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2234.289,2235.224,"--well, it does seem to me that--"
2004.03-1423,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.224,2236.307,--Excuse me.
2004.03-1423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2236.307,2247.365,--It... it does seem... seem to me that the Ninth Circuit's opinion is questionable on... on this key point of when she had to be released.
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2253.852,2254.369,Well--
2004.03-1423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2254.369,2257.488,I think that is critical to its holding.
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2257.488,2257.988,--Well--
2004.03-1423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2257.988,2270.029,And that implies that they have a... a duty at the outset to determine whether... what her status is rather than to go around looking for guns and... and to secure the premises.
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2271.981,2274.85,"--Well, I would have a different position on that."
2004.03-1423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2288.625,2289.692,The... the first ground being?
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2291.061,2292.494,Detained beyond the... the length of the search.
2004.03-1423,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2410.8,2411.85,--Medium... medium rain.
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2411.85,2417.788,"Well, actually at... at joint appendix number 183, Officer Allegra, who was one of the entry team, said it was pouring."
2004.03-1423,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.835,2473.774,"They can't have a flat rule that while you're conducting a search, you... you can restrain anybody that you find assuming the search is for a crime that... that involves violence."
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2473.774,2475.376,"--Well, I think that the--"
2004.03-1423,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2475.376,2477.594,"I don't want to have to make that call all the time, you know."
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2477.594,2480.13,"--Well, but... but officers do make that call all the time."
2004.03-1423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2500.794,2501.41,That's true.
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2556.98,2557.43,--I... I understand that.
2004.03-1423,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2595.338,2596.605,Did they search that room?
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2596.605,2597.305,--Yes.
2004.03-1423,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2610.098,2612.081,Did they... did they search the individuals too to make sure--
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2612.081,2612.448,Yes.
2004.03-1423,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2612.448,2613.3,--I assume they did.
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2613.3,2613.65,"Oh, yes."
2004.03-1423,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2633.279,2638.265,How did the qualified immunity question get resolved here?
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2638.265,2640.467,"--Well, the--"
2004.03-1423,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2640.467,2643.919,And what... what role did that play in all of this?
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2643.919,2650.306,"--Well, at the... at the district court level, the... the district court heard a rule 59."
2004.03-1423,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2712.881,2714.748,Is it clear that it was 30?
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2714.748,2722.271,"--Well, I think in viewing the light most favorable to the verdict, I think the Court has to assume that... that the jury could have found an hour."
2004.03-1423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2779.441,2783.743,--Doesn't that just go to the point that it's not clearly established at least?
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2783.743,2784.779,"--Well, no."
2004.03-1423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2819.0,2821.868,"Well, but that was ill individual, a single individual--"
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2821.868,2822.47,Well--
2004.03-1423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2822.47,2823.104,"--unclothed, et cetera--"
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2823.104,2823.537,--No.
2004.03-1423,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2947.818,2957.407,And what do we do if we think the Ninth Circuit was off base in... in whether Mena could be questioned about her immigration status?
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2957.407,2959.176,"--Well, I... I think that--"
2004.03-1423,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2959.176,2962.478,That seemed to be an important part of the Ninth Circuit's rule.
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2962.478,2964.747,"--Well, it's certainly... it's certainly an alternative ground."
2004.03-1423,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2978.404,2981.439,It might be useful to say they were wrong in--
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2981.439,2982.724,"Well, that... you... you could say that."
2004.03-1423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2999.836,3010.359,"--What... what will do if we thought the Ninth Circuit was egregiously wrong on that and that its opinion was, to use the most polite word, disingenuous when it talked about a garage?"
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3016.262,3017.131,"Well, I mean--"
2004.03-1423,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3017.131,3021.849,"I mean, I... I thought this woman was standing in... by some grease rack or something and she was--"
2004.03-1423,2,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3021.849,3043.965,"--She wasn't standing by a grease rack, but she was made to sit initially by an open door because the door had basically been obliterated on a very cold, rainy February morning where she was very cold, and after... and had been taken through the... the pouring rain in bare feet and with only a T-shirt and was left there for at least 20 or so minutes without being given a coat or shoes."
2004.03-1423,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3275.531,3277.181,"Thank you, Mr. Hoffman."
2004.03-1423,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3280.332,3281.684,"Thank you, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-1423,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3364.588,3365.471,So... so do we have the tape here?
2004.03-1423,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3365.471,3366.707,I assume you have the tape.
2004.03-1423,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3372.409,3380.198,"But there was no... there was no objection to that question going to the jury, was the duration unreasonable."
2004.03-1423,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3380.198,3393.875,"--Of course not, Justice Ginsburg, because the issue before the jury was whether or not the... we had an affirmative duty to make an evaluation in the middle of the search as to whether or not she posed a... a threat."
2004.03-1423,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3394.375,3394.891,But the jury--
2004.03-1423,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3394.891,3398.993,"--their theory of the case, and that's what the Ninth Circuit said, is yes, we do have that affirmative obligation."
2004.03-1423,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3398.993,3404.563,"--But the jury answered the... just the general question, was the duration unreasonable, and the jury said yes."
2004.03-1423,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3404.563,3405.498,Not of the search.
2004.03-1423,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3406.565,3407.848,Yes.
2004.03-1423,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3407.848,3409.034,"Yes, of her detention."
2004.03-1423,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3414.354,3422.358,"So if the district court got it right and the Ninth Circuit wrote a poor opinion, why should we upset the judgment in the case?"
2004.03-1423,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3442.588,3450.961,"Well, the... the court of appeals' obligation here was to evaluate our argument that we should... we were entitled to judgment as a matter of law."
2004.03-1423,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3500.877,3501.61,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
