1978.77-6248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,44.365,We'll hear arguments next in Hunter against Dean.
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,46.324,47.223,Yes sir.
1978.77-6248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,107.116,109.446,"Did she say, “She think so,” that she thought so, or did she what?"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,109.446,124.264,"Well, she said, “Yes, sir,” but I don't think I'm mischaracterizing it to put it that way, I think that this is a -- I think this whole episode has to be viewed as a typical one and that is when a defendant is appearing for pronouncement of sentence."
1978.77-6248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,126.528,128.014,Well she certainly didn't use those words?
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,128.014,129.238,"No sir, she didn't."
1978.77-6248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,144.149,149.415,Has any explanation ever been tendered to the court why this was not done why this (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,149.415,157.108,"No, sir, there was no explanation was ever tendered but I don't believe that -- but of course, it's not a dispute that they did not pay the fine or --"
1978.77-6248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,157.108,163.281,"No, but, has there ever been any explanation from her about her representation to the court."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,163.281,178.088,"No sir, they had -- subsequently, ten months after this sentence was -- I mean ten weeks after the sentence was passed and it became apparent that her hopes or expectation of whatever they were, were not going to come to pass."
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,222.695,222.998,Mr. Bonner.
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,222.998,223.875,But in --
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,223.875,225.881,Mr. Bonner may I ask you a question about the fines.
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,238.497,239.009,Yes sir.
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,239.009,251.561,"Is it fair to infer from that that if the defendant had paid the fine, had been put on probation and served it without any wrong doing, that the expiration, the period of probation, the fine would have been repaid to her?"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,251.561,253.436,"No sir, that's not correct."
1978.77-6248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.014,315.525,What if she had been sentenced to pay the fine in installments which she was concededly able to pay at the time and she with the sentence was imposed.
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,325.073,328.857,"Your Honor, that obviously is a question that arises out of this but it's not our case."
1978.77-6248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,328.857,329.634,What's your answer to that?
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,329.634,330.595,It's not our case.
1978.77-6248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,330.595,331.633,"No, what's your answer to that."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,331.633,348.415,"Well, I think -- I don't think there's any doubt that having been afforded a fair opportunity to pay the fine in installments that her probation could be revoked if she failed to do it."
1978.77-6248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,391.29,407.157,"But doesn't that suggest that there is a point in time at which the court has to make it's decision and the factors that go into the constitutionality of it's decision, it has to be judge as of that point in time rather than four months later or six months later?"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,407.157,410.993,"I'm not sure if I fully understand what you mean Your Honor, if you --"
1978.77-6248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,410.993,416.625,"Well, suppose -- supposing in this case that the trial judge was assured by her."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,442.174,442.99,"Yes sir, I think."
1978.77-6248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,489.216,492.277,Right at the time of the sentence.
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,492.277,492.885,I'm sorry.
1978.77-6248,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,492.885,494.769,Right at the time sentence is imposed.
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,507.496,515.629,"Yes sir, that would be perfectly appropriate because obviously, if we did anything else, we would immunize Jacque Hunter possibly from any punishment and that's not our claim."
1978.77-6248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,515.693,529.476,But then the record would have to show some -- also some finding or some consideration of whether she could pay in installments.
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,529.476,537.055,"Well, I suppose a proper inquiry would involve that Your Honor."
1978.77-6248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,547.155,550.855,"What if he says, “I'm thinking that $500.00 fine, can you pay it?”"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,560.459,563.381,"I think you've got the same case we got here, we've got an equal protection problem."
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,616.24,622.905,"Mr. Bonner, I don't understand on how you can give us the answer you did to both Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,636.287,638.849,"She would have the same equal protection claim, yes sir."
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,638.849,646.031,"But then, to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you said that if he had one that's a rich defendant who can pay a thousand dollars and a poor defendant who can't pay anything, he can't put –-"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,646.031,646.606,Well now --
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,646.606,647.535,Lets -- I don't understand the difference that is.
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,647.535,664.924,"Well, you're hitting what -- I suppose we're talking about -- were are not -- if you've got a -- if a judge is faced with two comparably situated codefendants, one is rich and one is poor, there's no requirement that he impose the same sentences."
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.61,669.404,But the only reason the poor one goes to jail is she can't raise any money.
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,669.404,670.398,"Well, it's a question."
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,707.752,713.061,Why is it very simple if the only reason the person goes to prison is because the person is an indigent?
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,713.061,715.838,"Well, the --"
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,715.838,716.149,Would you say that's an (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,716.149,727.399,"I think that illustrates, I think that illustrates how poverty has to be -- how it can be considered, how it has to be considered in molding whatever the appropriate punishment is."
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,727.399,729.164,"Well, isn't not just what the judge did here."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,734.119,734.956,Well --
1978.77-6248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,734.956,752.064,"Suppose the judge says to both parties a thousand dollars or a thousand days and one of them is a Mr. Onasis who just died, and others are sharecropper, you don't have any problem?"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,752.064,752.921,"No sir, obviously, you've got a problem."
1978.77-6248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,752.921,753.356,You don't have any problem?
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,753.356,755.465,"You've got the same problem that we've got here, I think in that situation."
1978.77-6248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,755.465,756.897,"Well, you do have a problem."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,756.897,758.084,But what -- you were talking --
1978.77-6248,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,758.084,760.234,"Why didn't you bring that case, the one that my Brother Steven is talking about."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,760.234,774.662,"Well, we're talking about the question of degrees, I think in the hypothetical that you post, we've got a judge who's looking to a codefendants, he wants to punish him, say comparably, and I don't think anybody can come in and claim, “Hey, wait a minute now."
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,797.711,801.818,"But here, he obviously tried to treat these two people equally?"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,803.424,808.285,"Well, in a way he did, but again, the thousand dollar fine for Onasis and --"
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,808.285,811.186,"Well, but let's keep it to the 165 then."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,825.424,826.502,"Well, no, Your Honor."
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,830.208,831.689,But you said he did --
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,831.689,834.11,"Well, I suppose we get back to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question."
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,834.11,835.529,"Yes, you do."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,835.529,846.084,"There may be a point when she is exposed to jail because for indigence, you know, talking about, not the gray area, the black or white where she willfully fails to get a job and the make the payments."
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,846.084,854.869,"Well, let's assume its all was non-willful, let's leave willful cases, put them all on one side, just the inability to pay, can that ever justify a jail sentence?"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,855.958,860.098,"Yes sir, it can, if it's treated as a neutral fact, if it goes --"
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.098,861.971,Wasn't it treated as a neutral here?
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,861.971,863.119,"No sir, it wasn't."
1978.77-6248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,867.886,874.936,"Well, if it can be in ingredient, then inevitably, it can sometimes be the controlling condition."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,874.936,877.219,"Yes sir, I think sometimes it can be."
1978.77-6248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,897.771,901.7,"Well, since, we're dealing with hypotheticals and you've just mention the rich."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,939.67,939.741,Yes.
1978.77-6248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,939.741,941.601,Do you find something wrong with that?
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,941.601,946.074,"No sir, that obviously is a common situation, there is something quite right with that."
1978.77-6248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.156,1025.702,"Well, what if the judge had determined that this person couldn't have paid any fine and installments or otherwise and faced by debt to it."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1040.387,1042.505,"No sir, we wouldn't be here."
1978.77-6248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1042.505,1043.894,"Well, why wouldn't you?"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1043.894,1045.034,Well --
1978.77-6248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1045.034,1046.169,Why wouldn't you require --
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1046.169,1046.814,The problem --
1978.77-6248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.814,1050.394,-- to say instead of an automatic two years --
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1050.394,1060.449,"We would have not no way of saying that two-year sentence wasn't inappropriate punishment, we'd have no launching pad here, you know, to bring us here."
1978.77-6248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1109.443,1119.844,"Well, no part of your argument is that there's hardly any relationship between two years of jail and a $165.00 in terms of serving the state's penological interest?"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1119.844,1121.521,Well --
1978.77-6248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1123.541,1126.756,"Well, is there anything -- are you arguing that or not?"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1126.756,1129.327,"I'm sorry, that -- no, it's not a relativity argument."
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1182.372,1184.177,"Mr. Bonner, can I go back for one second."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1184.177,1184.28,Yes sir.
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1184.28,1194.438,"To the question I started with about the proviso on the statute about money being paid back, you said it's not normally the case that the fined is refundable, is it ever the case under your --"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1194.438,1197.818,"As far as I know Your Honor, that statute controls and it's never refundable."
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.818,1201.945,"Its never -- the proviso just is -- it's just really meaningless, isn't it?"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1201.945,1205.929,"Well, it means that once the money is paid in it sticks."
1978.77-6248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1206.328,1207.51,Even though you end up getting imprisoned for imposition?
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1207.51,1208.545,Even though you end up --
1978.77-6248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1209.093,1210.341,"You don't get the fine back, that's all."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1210.341,1213.735,"One year -- I mean, two years less one day, and if you paid the whole fine and put the --"
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1213.735,1220.923,"But the proviso is that it won't be revoked if probation is revoked -- I mean, it won't be refunded if probation is revoked."
1978.77-6248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1220.923,1221.255,Right.
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1221.255,1227.754,Which gives rise to the suggestion that it would be refunded if probation was not revoked?
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1227.754,1227.791,That's not – that's just simply our attempt --
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1227.791,1229.225,But they --
1978.77-6248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1230.059,1233.33,That inference is just not fact as otherwise.
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1233.33,1235.225,"If you browse through the Georgia Code, you can come up --"
1978.77-6248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1235.225,1242.882,"Well, the other possibility is that they were just saying that we can punish you not only by a fine but by imprisonment?"
1978.77-6248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1249.941,1250.735,Right.
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1251.203,1253.891,"Yeah, I think it's the head off that argument exactly."
1978.77-6248,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1414.448,1425.894,"Mr. Bonner, if you prevail here, is it likely that Georgia will enact strictly with legislation, and impose and call for mandatories prison sentence?"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1425.894,1430.785,"There has been some movement in that direction, Your Honor, but I don't think that's any chance at all."
1978.77-6248,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1459.421,1463.622,"Well, sometimes, one can win a case and loose a lot more in the long run."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1463.622,1467.629,"I don't believe here, Your Honor, that there is some risk of that."
1978.77-6248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1478.546,1480.929,What are you asking for --
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1480.929,1486.37,"We're asking basically Your Honor, that she'd be given an opportunity to pay that fine in installments, in reasonable installments."
1978.77-6248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1502.297,1506.657,"Do you suggest that we can, at this stage, determine the terms of the --"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1506.657,1512.703,"No sir, this is a -- this again is something that a trial judge is going -- you know, would have to look at."
1978.77-6248,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1520.913,1529.881,Is there any theoretical difference between paying it at once or paying it in installments as far as the legal theory is concerned?
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1529.881,1532.362,"You mean, this penological theory or something?"
1978.77-6248,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1532.362,1537.719,"Well, the legal theory --"
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1537.719,1542.649,I see no problem with the fine and all as a penalty.
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1577.682,1579.232,"Let me ask one more question, I'm sorry."
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1586.656,1592.301,"Your Honor, I didn't draft that petition, but I think the prayer was for release out right."
1978.77-6248,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1592.301,1597.118,Is there anything in the record to indicate that your client could pay $25.00 immediately even?
1978.77-6248,0,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1597.118,1598.258,No sir.
1978.77-6248,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1632.202,1633.908,Mr. Parker.
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,1633.908,1637.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-6248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1789.547,1791.406,I missed what you just said?
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,1792.723,1799.171,"In other words, Your Honor, the attorney, a different attorney who represented at the habeas corpus hearing could have there roughly understand and had her testified -–"
1978.77-6248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1799.171,1803.277,Instead just relied on the record in the trial court?
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,1803.277,1805.81,"Yes sir, he just -- more or less argued the law."
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1831.935,1835.718,But how did – how does the point get up as she couldn't pay it.
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,1838.674,1841.847,"Well, she remained incarcerated as a result for failure to pay."
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1853.43,1859.634,"And under Georgia law at that stage, the judge could have altered the sentence?"
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,1859.634,1860.531,"Yes sir, he could have."
1978.77-6248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1907.933,1916.604,"You understand this attack by your brother to be solely under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, not under the Due Process Clause?"
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,1916.604,1917.808,I understand that Your Honor.
1978.77-6248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1917.808,1920.877,Perhaps that you should be the one to talk but that's my understanding too.
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,1920.877,1925.535,"Yes sir, I understand this Equal Protection Clause and nothing more."
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.535,1929.713,"Mr. Parker, just taking short of any relevance to the problem."
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,1929.713,1937.348,"Your Honor, it certainly has relevance, but we certainly believe as to the Georgia Supreme Court that the facts of the case distinguish it primarily because that's --"
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.348,1940.666,"Well, I think there we had a Texas statute, do we not, that (Voice Overlap)"
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,1940.666,1941.241,There was --
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1941.241,1945.293,"-- whatever the statute but we had an attack on a statute there I think, isn't it?"
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,1945.293,1955.711,"Yes sir, in both -- that case and also Williams versus Illinois, there were statutory provisions and question which authorizes specific sentence in that case."
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2078.782,2082.716,Why do Georgia have legal aid?
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2082.716,2083.348,Sir?
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2083.348,2086.803,Why does Georgia provide legal aid?
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2086.803,2092.757,"Well, Your Honor, the Georgia provides legal aid in order to provide the assistance of counsel at trail level with --"
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2092.757,2096.509,I recognized that there is a group that needs it.
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2096.509,2102.678,"Yes sir, there is a recognition to that need."
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.665,2254.359,"So I take it your submission is that 30 days or $30.00 is always a good sentence and if the indigent -- and if a person is indigent can't pay the $30,00, 30 days is always null."
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2254.359,2256.632,"No sir, that's is not our position at all."
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2257.128,2257.593,What is it?
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2259.269,2270.345,"Well, our position Your Honor is that, it is permissible for a judge to convict, to impose probation and to provide as a condition of that probation that a fine be paid."
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2270.345,2271.347,In a lump sum?
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2271.347,2276.414,In a lump sum.
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2276.414,2283.33,So that you need to pay in lump sum or you have the specified time in jail?
1978.77-6248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2283.33,2285.879,Regardless of the amount?
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2285.879,2292.037,"Well, Your Honor, there's certainly limitations on what a judge could do and in fact the Georgia Supreme Court's opinion --"
1978.77-6248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2292.037,2294.573,"Well, the statutory limitations in Georgia obviously?"
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2294.573,2297.671,"Yes sir, and due process limitations is set forth by this Court's decision."
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2297.671,2302.836,"Well here the -- the maximum was the statutory, what was it -- well, it was within the statutory?"
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2302.836,2303.398,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.398,2303.789,Yes.
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2303.789,2306.14,The judge could have fined her up to $2000.00.
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.14,2308.649,And if -- and the jail?
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2308.649,2316.82,"Well, the statute provides that a fine may be imposed as a condition of probation, provides that the fine can be up to $2000.00."
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2316.82,2323.236,"Well, it -- yeah, but then how much probation is revoked then what happens?"
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2323.236,2328.211,"Well, if probation is revoked then the defendant would be required, would get credit for the time spent on probation."
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2328.211,2330.075,I know but what's the jail sentence?
1978.77-6248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2330.075,2331.116,Maximum.
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2331.116,2332.583,"Well, the max -- well --"
1978.77-6248,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2332.583,2332.674,Under Georgia law for this offense?
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2332.674,2332.99,What --
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2334.563,2335.566,And this case is (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.566,2337.13,"Two years, that's what I'm asking."
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2337.13,2340.524,The crime for which she was indicted carry the one to 20-year sentence.
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.854,2347.014,"Right, so as well within the statutory limits of the jail sentence?"
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2347.014,2347.867,Yes sir.
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.867,2348.485,And --
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2348.485,2349.136,And there you --
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2349.136,2369.842,"You would say that -- you would say the judge could say to the defendant, either pay the fine, you violated probation, now either pay the fine in a lump sum or go to jail and the defendant says, “I will -- I just cant pay it in a lump sum.”"
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2369.842,2371.719,"Well, at that point Your Honor, I think it is --"
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.719,2373.483,I can pay it in installments.
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2373.483,2378.036,"At that point, I think it is a matter for the court's discretion."
1978.77-6248,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2378.036,2384.372,"But it would not violate the Constitution you say if the judge said “Awfully sorry, but either lump sum or nothing.”"
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2384.372,2397.837,We contend that it does not violate the constitution for the judge in the exercise of his sentence in discretion to impose a lump sum payment upon an individual in the condition of their probation upon them being able to pay that fine.
1978.77-6248,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2397.837,2401.243,Could the judge have sentenced to ask simply the 20-year period?
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2401.243,2402.112,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2476.225,2479.681,He didn't think she could pay?
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2479.681,2480.505,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2482.466,2483.908,Why did she say it?
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2483.908,2495.42,What -- she didn't say it in response to the amount that was given but she said she could pay a fine without to the amount and there's no indication that counsel was there looking his duty --
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2495.42,2498.14,She had said she thought or couldn't pay?
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2498.14,2499.196,"Yes sir, she said she could pay --"
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2499.196,2502.007,"That's a lot of difference in saying, “I will pay.”"
1978.77-6248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2502.007,2502.238,"Well, didn't she --"
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2502.238,2502.741,Or “I can't pay.”
1978.77-6248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2502.741,2503.88,Didn't she say categorically --
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2503.88,2507.412,Unless she got cousins that are different from my cousins.
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2507.412,2508.149,"Well, yeah."
1978.77-6248,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2508.149,2520.122,"Didn't she say categorically, yes, she could pay, and then when the judge took a further step, the judge said, “How are you going to pay it?” and then she said, “My cousin will pay it."""
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2520.122,2525.216,"That is right Mr. Chief Justice, she -- the judge did not simply rely upon her assertion that she could pay."
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2526.547,2529.254,"You don't know what the judge relied on, do you?"
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2529.504,2531.252,"No sir, I know what's on the record."
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2531.252,2533.382,"Well quote to me, what did he say in the record?"
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2533.382,2534.109,That --
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2534.109,2534.533,That he relied on that?
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2534.533,2539.789,"He said -- to be verbatim, he said “Jacquelyn, how can you pay a fine?”"
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2540.901,2544.691,"No, the statement was you said relying on that."
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2544.691,2545.299,"Well, I apologize for any presumption."
1978.77-6248,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2545.299,2549.308,(Voice Overlap) -- you can assume that.
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2552.382,2554.125,"Yes sir, that is true."
1978.77-6248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2730.489,2737.916,"General Parker, did you say earlier that the petitioner here is actually out on her won recognizance during the pendency of the proceeding?"
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2737.916,2748.612,"Yes sir, she was granted a personal recognizance bond of some type but the U.S. District Court from the middle district of Georgia, and I believe that occurred after a federal habeas petition was filed."
1978.77-6248,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2753.656,2755.328,"So, she's till out right now then?"
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2755.328,2758.52,"Yes sir, as far as I know, she is."
1978.77-6248,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2758.52,2765.484,How much time had she served before she was released on that first offense.
1978.77-6248,1,25910,g_stephen_parker,,2765.484,2773.828,"The guilty plea was entered on December 13, the habeas corpus hearing was on February --"
