2006.05-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,7.165,We'll hear argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,8.186,11.319,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-669,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,71.747,71.998,What--
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,71.998,72.398,--denotes--
2006.05-669,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,72.398,93.553,"--May I ask you, on that point... I understand what you're saying, and I've looked at your authority, but, right in the provision itself, there is a verbal distinction made between actions for money damages, and what, at the end of the provision, they refer to as 1-year supplementary rule."
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,119.249,121.29,"--Well, in fact, the... it refers to"
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.782,144.664,I think your point has to be that there are administrative proceedings that are not actions.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,144.664,146.096,--That is absolutely correct.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,149.399,149.91,Right.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,149.91,152.49,And they also wouldn't be money... damages actions.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,166.75,173.956,You contend that what commenced the action here was the order demanding payment.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,173.956,175.195,That is correct.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.676,184.962,"That's a very weird commencement of an action, where what then follows is what is referred to as an ""appeal"", within the agency."
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,184.962,200.523,"--For historical reasons, the denominations are quite strange, but for Grisa, quoted... on subsections 1702 and 1724, quoted on pages 5 and 6 of our reply brief, specifically state that the order to pay commences the proceedings."
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,201.494,202.454,Which says that?
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,202.454,204.537,--It's on page 5-6 of our brief.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.667,207.569,What page of your brief?
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,207.569,208.938,--5 and 6 of the reply brief.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,208.938,210.59,Of the reply.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,210.59,211.231,Yes.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,226.472,227.244,I'm not finding it.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,228.185,230.418,"--Page 6 of the reply, Your Honor, very top."
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,253.242,260.317,"Why is... why doesn't it make much more sense... as I understand the proceeding, this order doesn't come out of the blue."
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,274.137,274.577,That--
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,274.577,278.408,"And then, after considering the response, the order issues."
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,299.461,304.847,"--In fact, that process, which isn't even mentioned in the regulations, doesn't have any legal operative effect."
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.574,317.864,"Well, it doesn't--"
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,317.864,318.415,--first document--
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.415,324.159,"--waive it, but it can't issue the order without having issued the letter first, giving--"
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,324.159,324.539,--I--
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.539,327.732,--giving the party an opportunity to say why this amount isn't owed.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,327.732,334.045,"--Well, in fact, there's nothing in the regulations... and I think the Solicitor General would concede... that actually requires this informal process."
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.8,344.641,Is there anything that requires the order?
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,344.641,348.805,The... anything that requires the Secretary to proceed by order?
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,348.805,349.345,Yes.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,349.345,352.297,That is the Secretary's traditional way of doing things--
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.297,352.577,Well--
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,352.577,352.968,"--yes, but--"
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.968,354.81,"--So, you could say the same for the other."
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,354.81,358.421,"--Oh, but it... but there is no liability if the order fails to issue."
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.048,372.231,You don't... you don't... but you don't respond to the order; you take an appeal from the order.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,372.231,373.212,--That's correct.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.42,375.593,It seems to me crazy to call that order a complaint.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,393.995,405.025,"--Well, Justice Scalia, it is the first document, which is recognized in the regulations, which provides the lessor of the notice of claims against it, the first one that's required by the regulations in order to commence the proceedings."
2006.05-669,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,405.025,405.245,You mean--
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,405.245,406.033,It's recognized--
2006.05-669,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,406.033,408.116,--the regulations don't refer to the initial letter?
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,408.116,408.617,--No.
2006.05-669,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,412.819,417.143,"So, they literally could start, absolutely out of the blue, by issuing the order?"
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,417.143,418.255,--I think that's correct.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,424.67,424.86,I doubt whether--
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,424.86,425.501,--informal process--
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.501,426.069,--that would--
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,426.069,426.66,--can't be a complaint.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,426.66,429.893,--I doubt whether that would conform with the Administrative Procedure Act.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,432.484,433.235,Well--
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,433.235,436.798,--it seems to me you have to give the individual an opportunity to reply.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,436.798,441.55,"--Well, that is perhaps why the agency tries this... to do the informal process."
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,455.349,456.25,Of course you can ignore it.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,459.343,460.484,--Right.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.484,463.156,"--I mean, a formal complaint, in which case you'll be found liable."
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,463.807,464.157,That's the--
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.157,467.159,--the fact that you don't have to respond have to do with anything?
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,467.159,468.311,--The legal consequences.
2006.05-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,482.949,485.982,"And it's also, I assume, true that the demand letter would not toll a statute."
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,485.982,489.973,"--No, we don't believe a demand letter would toll a statute, because it's not required by--"
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.973,490.483,"Well, you--"
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,490.483,491.124,--by law.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.124,493.045,--you'd win in this case even if it did.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,509.976,510.687,"Oh, I certainly hope--"
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,510.687,510.917,Right.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,510.917,511.388,--hope not.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,511.388,511.869,Yes.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,511.869,523.647,"But, in fact, Section 2415(f), which is on page 4 and 5 of the appendix to our brief, makes it clear that whether something is denominated a complaint or not does not determine whether or not it's covered by the limitations period."
2006.05-669,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,555.457,565.044,"Mr. Lamken, the point has been made that there are many indications that what Congress had in mind was ordinary civil action in a court."
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,599.535,606.13,"--Well, starting at 28 U.S.C., why it's there, it, in fact, applies both to administrative agency actions and actions in courts."
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,641.804,651.661,"Well, 2415(a), (i), we... you, you cannot possibly say that that only applies to judicial actions, can you?"
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,651.661,652.062,"--Oh, no."
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,652.522,652.86,Yes.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,652.86,653.971,--actually completely--
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,653.971,654.172,And that's in--
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,654.172,654.562,--superfluous.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,654.562,655.834,--and that's in title 28.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,655.834,658.136,"And that's in... yes, that's in title 28, as well."
2006.05-669,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,685.982,691.668,It's not the typical term used in agency proceedings to designate the responding party.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,691.668,706.138,"--Well, you can talk about the 85 years ago... to discuss the person who might be liable for damages in--"
2006.05-669,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,706.138,707.406,And the content--
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,707.406,707.757,--an adversary--
2006.05-669,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,707.757,713.6,"--the content of the tolling provision, as well, seems geared... seems geared to a civil lawsuit."
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,719.684,724.018,--That's certainly right.
2006.05-669,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,773.791,776.093,"That wasn't part of the original statute, was it?"
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,776.093,779.565,"--No, that was added about 16 years later, Your Honor."
2006.05-669,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,796.414,810.764,"I thought that (i) was added because it's... for a very specific reason, that there was a debate between the Department of Justice and... I forgot the other agency--"
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,810.764,811.415,"The Comptroller, Your Honor."
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,811.415,811.855,Yes.
2006.05-669,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,811.855,815.138,--yes... about whether an offset would be subject to the time limit.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,815.138,817.439,That's exactly right.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,823.373,823.633,What--
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,823.633,824.915,--sort of administrative proceeding.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.13,849.281,"--They could have said... if the other interpretation of 2415(a), as not applying to administrative proceedings, were correct, they could have said the provisions of this section do not apply to administrative proceedings--"
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,849.281,850.07,That's--
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,850.07,853.433,--which would have... which would have handled the offset--
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,853.433,854.224,--Yes.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,854.765,856.287,--but would have been well beyond the offset.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,856.395,856.876,--That's exactly right.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.876,866.293,"--that they only focus on the offset certainly suggests that when you're not talking about offset, it does apply to administrative proceedings."
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,866.293,869.054,"I could not have said it better, and I will not attempt to."
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,917.196,918.325,I can believe that they do--
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,918.325,918.596,--in perpetuity.
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.596,920.258,--I can... I can believe that they do that.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,921.658,922.839,"Well, Justice--"
2006.05-669,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,922.839,924.158,--By mistake.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,927.523,929.103,"--I think that's exactly right, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,985.37,986.332,Mr. Lamken--
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,986.332,986.672,--Yes.
2006.05-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.672,989.905,--could we go back to Section (i) for a second more?
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1006.074,1017.412,"Well, if Congress had decided the Comptroller General is right, and had done that in subsection (i), it would have written subsection (i) the way Justice Scalia proposed, which is to say this doesn't apply to administrative claims at all."
2006.05-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1040.127,1040.828,Does the--
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1040.828,1041.118,--got it's--
2006.05-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1041.118,1046.791,--legislative history tell us how detailed the congressional examination of the particular issue was?
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1046.791,1050.973,"--Well, indeed, the legislative history mentions... and there is a battle of letters between--"
2006.05-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1050.973,1051.734,That's about all--
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1051.734,1055.798,--the Office of Legal Counsel and the Comptroller on this issue.
2006.05-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.82,1061.211,--Okay.
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1061.211,1064.854,"--an exception that applies only to one context, and that's administrative offsets."
2006.05-669,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1072.809,1084.216,"Isn't the most likely answer that they just... they saw a small problem, and they rendered a decision on the small problem, and they didn't think about it any further than that?"
2006.05-669,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1084.216,1092.003,"Well, I have a hard time psychoanalyzing Congress, because it's sort of a corporate body, and I can't tell what Member of Congress is saying what."
2006.05-669,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.302,1122.711,Thank you.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1128.227,1130.608,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1188.888,1190.368,It often does.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1206.349,1207.438,Well--
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.438,1217.506,"So, the question is, How... you know, how absurd is it not to read it to apply to administrative proceedings in this case?"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1229.815,1244.783,"--Well, the structure of the law here is that in those instances where Congress does authorize administrative recovery, it ordinarily provides a context-specific administrative limitations period, such as in the Contract Disputes Act, which governs almost all of the contract claims the Government can pursue administratively."
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1286.972,1287.911,Wait.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1287.911,1288.171,--at that point--
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1288.171,1288.472,Excuse me.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1290.462,1291.964,"--No, I... agreed."
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1295.067,1295.347,Oh.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1295.347,1296.126,--which is not a good--
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1296.126,1297.578,Which is not what we're talking about here.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1297.578,1303.312,"--No, but... well, we are, because the structure of the law here is that Section 2415(a), as we see it, governs court suits."
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1329.859,1334.484,"As late as 1978, the Justice Department didn't think that way, did it?"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1334.484,1336.083,"No, the Justice Department--"
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1336.083,1341.837,"The opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, in '78, was exactly what the Petitioner here would urge."
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1341.837,1348.541,"--No, the OLC opinion was limited, by both its terms and its reasoning, to administrative offsets, not to administrative adjudications."
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1402.749,1411.234,But... excuse me... how could OLC possibly think that it applied to administrative offsets if it didn't apply to administrative proceedings?
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1430.534,1440.242,"No, the position of OLC was limited to administrative offsets, and it did not... the important thing is, OLC opinion did not interpret the statutory term ""action"", or, frankly, any other statutory term."
2006.05-669,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1455.844,1464.248,"Well, on that theory, then, there was... there was no time issue with respect to the right to offset, then, in the OLC's position."
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1464.248,1473.204,"--No, the OLC's view is that if the Government was time-barred from obtaining a judgment under Section 2415(a), then it would be time-barred from obtaining a prejudgment attachment."
2006.05-669,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1473.204,1487.263,"No, but I thought your... in answer to Justice Scalia, you said what was essential to the... to OLC's position was that the offset is like a prejudgment attachment, and, in effect, it's an attachment without process."
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1516.143,1517.092,Well--
2006.05-669,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1517.092,1518.284,What's wrong with that logic?
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1518.284,1522.508,--I think what's wrong with the logic is what was wrong with the logic of the OLC opinion.
2006.05-669,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1523.539,1524.218,You put me--
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1524.218,1524.799,--reasoning of the OLC opinion--
2006.05-669,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1524.799,1525.239,"--in good company, but--"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1525.239,1534.556,--but what OLC really did say... and Comptroller General and Congress promptly disagreed... was that... it didn't see a problem... OLC didn't see a problem with procedurally imposing an administrative offset.
2006.05-669,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1542.933,1543.523,"--No, but if it was--"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1543.523,1544.184,"--OLC opinion, which--"
2006.05-669,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1544.184,1544.804,--a prejudgment--
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1544.804,1545.155,--I agree was--
2006.05-669,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1545.155,1554.661,"--It was a prejudgment attachment in aid of what could be accomplished administratively by, ultimately, an administrative judgment."
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1554.661,1556.363,"--No, the... I guess it was another point."
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1561.336,1561.716,Do we have--
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1561.716,1561.927,In the context of--
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1561.927,1562.598,"--that opinion, by the way?"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1566.161,1566.759,"--It was unpublished, and--"
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1566.759,1567.901,Does anybody give it to us?
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1567.901,1569.721,--Petitioners offered to lodge it with the Court--
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1569.721,1571.644,"Yes, I know they did offer, but nobody did it."
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1571.644,1573.044,--I'll... we'll do it this afternoon.
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1573.044,1573.565,Good.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1574.506,1583.983,"The point's just... the OLC reasoning was admittedly somewhat odd, but that was the context in which Congress was responding to."
2006.05-669,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1683.178,1689.412,Would the... at the time that 4515... is that the--
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1689.412,1690.714,It's 2415.
2006.05-669,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1690.714,1691.155,--20-- I'm sorry.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1698.601,1705.597,"The ones that we have found were... I'm not 100-percent sure, but the ones that we... that we have found and cited in our brief do appear to be enacted after that time."
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1749.906,1755.569,"How about the initial letter that, in the agency practice, precedes the order?"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1757.329,1757.679,--Right.
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1768.077,1768.969,An issue letter.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1768.969,1769.279,Yes.
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1779.965,1782.467,"--Sounds to me like a complaint, a response--"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1782.467,1783.328,--An issue letter?
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.328,1784.938,--and an adjudication.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1786.42,1787.462,I don't know whether you mean the audit--
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.462,1788.2,"--""We think you owe this""."
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1788.2,1789.021,"--or the issue letter, but either way--"
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1789.021,1789.822,"The response comes back,"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1800.231,1801.272,--Yes.
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.311,1825.531,It does not--
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1825.531,1825.771,--no claim.
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.771,1827.963,--assert that there's a discrepancy?
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1827.963,1829.932,"Well, what it... what it asserts is that,"
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.895,1849.256,Do we have an example of issue letters anywhere?
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1851.407,1854.86,"No, in fact, it's not even... in fact, it's not even in the administrative record--"
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1854.86,1855.27,--Right.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1855.27,1856.362,--which is one of the reasons it's not in the issue--
2006.05-669,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1856.362,1857.093,Do we know--
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1857.093,1857.323,--record of the case--
2006.05-669,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1857.323,1858.062,--what time lapse--
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1858.062,1860.373,"--which also reflects that it's not a formal complaint, or it would be in the record."
2006.05-669,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.373,1865.638,"--Do we know, in this case, what time lapse there was between the issue letter and the order?"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1865.638,1870.3,I don't think it was more than a year or two.
2006.05-669,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1870.3,1871.091,But--
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1871.091,1871.742,And there was--
2006.05-669,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1871.742,1877.336,"--would that... if you took the issue letter as the day, wouldn't all of the... all of the Government's claims be timely?"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1882.217,1882.958,"--Here, I think if you ran--"
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.958,1883.459,I don't think so.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1885.88,1886.431,"--Yes, if it ran from the--"
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.431,1886.802,--I think--
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1886.802,1887.683,--if it ran from the issue letter--
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1887.683,1888.064,--Okay.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1888.064,1889.343,--I think there would still be about a year in dispute here.
2006.05-669,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1889.343,1890.915,There would be some in dispute.
2006.05-669,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1890.915,1892.805,"Going forward, if we--"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1892.805,1893.086,But--
2006.05-669,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1893.086,1905.344,"--if we agree with your position, the result will be that there will be a 7-year limitations period for oil and gas leases, but, for Indian claims and for minerals, there'll be no statute of limitations?"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1905.344,1908.386,"--Yes, and the reason is that that's what Congress chose to do."
2006.05-669,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1910.199,1910.729,Did they--
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1910.729,1911.248,--enacted the limitations--
2006.05-669,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1911.248,1917.302,"--When they enacted the 7-year limitation period, did they explain why they would treat those two situations so differently?"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1917.302,1918.934,"--No, there's no explanation."
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1940.559,1944.851,"How do you defend against a claim for, you know, stuff that went on a hundred years ago?"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1944.851,1947.542,"--Well, as a--"
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.542,1960.903,"I... I'm really very reluctant to... unless there is no possible other reading of the statute, to think that that's... that that's what the law provides, that the Government can show up a hundred years later, and say,"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1962.612,1963.494,"--Well, first off, until--"
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.494,1963.844,The company says
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1965.727,1966.177,--Right.
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1982.227,1983.199,Say that again.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1989.012,1990.153,Not contract.
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.878,2014.688,He didn't apply against the Government either.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2014.688,2017.149,--For the same reason laches is never applied against the Government.
2006.05-669,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2017.149,2020.903,"So, there's no limit at all, and you concede that that's the case."
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2027.116,2030.338,"Well, as an abstract theoretical matter, the Government could reach back many, many decades."
2006.05-669,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2040.075,2043.458,"Well, there's a case involving the Oneida Indians, that went back quite a ways--"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2043.458,2044.107,--That's true.
2006.05-669,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2045.068,2045.669,--200 years--
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2045.669,2046.27,--leasing context here.
2006.05-669,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2046.27,2046.661,--Yes.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2046.661,2048.601,I didn't mean in the leasing context here.
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2083.444,2086.456,That's another indication.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2101.579,2102.118,"Well, no, the--"
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2102.118,2102.428,"You say,"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2105.881,2107.764,"--Well, first, it's optional, not mandatory."
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2108.452,2108.722,Yes.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2108.722,2109.273,--certainly can.
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2286.238,2303.121,"Well, except when you... when you say 2415(a) and you leave out (i), which... or I guess it's ""one""."
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2304.591,2305.042,It's (i).
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2305.502,2306.093,--It's (i).
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2352.475,2353.485,I think the reason is that--
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2353.485,2356.797,"And, you know, the normal rule is inclusio unius, exclusio alterius."
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2386.426,2390.69,"--I mean, it's... there's no doubt the statute should be read as a whole."
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2412.034,2421.098,"That's the best thing you have going for you, really, the strict construction canon."
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2421.098,2425.903,"Well, because... I mean, and it is an important point, that the statute applies only if it clearly applies by its terms."
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2461.987,2466.018,"What if I didn't think the order was a complaint, but I thought the initial letter was a complaint?"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2470.381,2470.822,--Correct.
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.383,2472.703,Yes.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2472.703,2474.025,"--is that an ""order"" is a complaint."
2006.05-669,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2475.345,2475.966,Because you're--
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2475.966,2476.417,But--
2006.05-669,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2476.417,2487.061,"--you made the point that the issue letter is just raising the issues, and it's not charging, as a complaint would allege, ""You owe us"", but this is, ""Maybe you owe us""."
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2487.061,2487.592,--Correct.
2006.05-669,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2509.976,2522.586,"Are you saying that this doesn't apply to any administrative proceeding, or just those that are structured like this one, where you don't have anything that's labeled a ""complaint""?"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2522.586,2532.643,"We... well, our primary submission is that it does not apply to any administrative proceedings, for the reason... reasons I've given, that the ordinary meanings of all of the key statutory terms are for suits in court."
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2535.114,2538.056,"Even if you have an administrative proceeding which is called a ""complaint""?"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2541.298,2546.101,"--There are... there are some contexts in administrative procedure in which the word ""complaint"" is used."
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2546.101,2549.043,And that would not be covered by 2415(a).
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2549.043,2560.039,"Because it's not filed in an ""action"", which refers to a suit in court, following occurral of a right of action, which refers to the right to bring suit in court, in a statute which then juxtaposes the terms ""action"" against ""administrative proceedings""--"
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2560.039,2563.291,And let's assume all those terms are used in the agency procedure.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2575.489,2576.14,--No.
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2576.14,2577.242,I think you have to say no--
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2577.242,2577.89,Yes.
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2577.89,2581.774,"--because, otherwise, it would be up to the agency, just by renaming their things, to--"
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2582.615,2583.396,"Well, and it's a much more--"
2006.05-669,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.396,2583.657,Yes.
2006.05-669,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2583.657,2593.153,"--fundamental point than that, too, is that what Congress was doing here was, when using these terms in their ordinary sense, to lay out an across... the-board rule that applies to suits in court."
2006.05-669,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2649.52,2651.821,"Thank you, Mr. Joseffer."
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2658.654,2660.777,I will endeavor not to.
2006.05-669,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2731.683,2738.368,"Mr. Lamken, have you had any second thoughts about your position that it's the order, rather than the issue letter, that we should look at?"
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2738.368,2740.86,"Well, in fact... no."
2006.05-669,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2775.842,2776.473,"Well, that's true."
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2782.798,2783.699,That's--
2006.05-669,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.699,2787.059,"And that's what... you know, that's what starts the 6 years running."
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2794.616,2796.196,"--Actually, Justice Scalia--"
2006.05-669,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2796.196,2799.217,"You know, usually a complaint, you're... you make your point, and say,"
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2801.14,2801.521,--Well--
2006.05-669,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2801.521,2802.42,And this is an order.
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2804.002,2806.464,"--It certainly has a hybrid quality, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-669,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2826.966,2830.148,"Well, that's only true if you consider an appeal to be the response."
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2831.448,2832.199,It is--
2006.05-669,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2832.199,2835.401,--that the response to a complaint is an appeal.
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2835.401,2846.969,"--The language that has been used, and... as a result of very odd historical anomalies and attempts to introduce a sense of due process to these proceedings over time... is odd, and it is awkward."
2006.05-669,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2903.629,2911.166,"Could you get us... we're going to have supplemental material filed, the OLC opinion."
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2918.36,2919.812,"Yes, I... that's true."
2006.05-669,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2954.444,2955.115,May I suggest--
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2955.115,2955.375,--to try to define--
2006.05-669,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2955.375,2962.23,"--this, Mr. Lamken, that when the... when the filing is made giving us the OLC opinion, you include a... an example of such a letter?"
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2962.23,2963.52,--Yes.
2006.05-669,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2964.511,2965.891,"And so, we'll get a notion of what it looks like."
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2965.891,2966.141,Right.
2006.05-669,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2969.604,2974.456,"Your position is, this would apply to the universe of administrative proceedings."
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2997.933,2998.311,Right.
2006.05-669,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2998.311,2999.032,--court actions.
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2999.032,2999.493,Right.
2006.05-669,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3053.247,3053.488,What--
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3053.488,3053.738,--it also--
2006.05-669,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3053.738,3057.171,--What other areas would we be messing up by finding for you?
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3076.234,3076.883,--Right.
2006.05-669,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3085.888,3087.561,And that would prevail over this--
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3087.561,3088.302,"Yes, because the--"
2006.05-669,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.302,3088.57,--because it's more--
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3088.57,3088.78,--Contract Disputes--
2006.05-669,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.78,3089.141,--specific.
2006.05-669,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3089.141,3092.354,"--Act has an exception at the front and says 2415> [""]."
2006.05-669,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3218.833,3219.684,"Thank you, Mr. Lamken."
