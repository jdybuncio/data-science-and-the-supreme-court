1990.90-615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.338,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-615, Rafael Peretz against the United States."
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,9.477,13.641,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-615,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,151.189,152.461,xxx waiver?
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,152.461,155.202,"Your Honor, it was not an effective waiver."
1990.90-615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,204.754,207.697,"Was that an opinion of the Court, Mr. Rudin, in Glidden?"
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,207.697,211.941,"Your Honor, that was an opinion by Justice Harlan for a plurality of the Court."
1990.90-615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.049,297.407,"But in order to make this case parallel to that you would have to establish that there was not only a violation of the statute here, but a violation of article III."
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,297.407,299.016,"Well, Your Honor, I would respectfully--"
1990.90-615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.016,303.28,And so far all you have said is that this was not in accordance with the statutory requirements.
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,303.28,321.042,"--Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree with the premise of Your Honor's question because it... my understanding of article III is that for an officer to exercise judicial authority under article III there need not only be inherent authority for Congress to confer the jurisdiction, but Congress in fact has to then confer the jurisdiction."
1990.90-615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.443,342.434,It's pursuant to a statutory scheme that violated article III.
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,357.894,371.024,"--Well, Your Honor, we certainly have argued in our brief and I am prepared to argue this morning that there was an inherent violation of article III, that had Congress authorized this function to be exercised, that it would have violated article III."
1990.90-615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,465.777,472.16,"Of course those cases deal with subject matter jurisdiction, and I really don't think yours does."
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,472.16,485.879,"Well, Your Honor, I suppose that there can be a distinction made between whether or not the court that delegates the authority has subject matter jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction or the authority of the officer who actually exercises the jurisdiction."
1990.90-615,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,718.29,718.901,Excuse me.
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,748.62,752.962,"--Well, Your Honor, there I would distinguish between a procedural violation and a jurisdictional violation."
1990.90-615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,801.655,806.106,"Well, to call this a separation of powers case is, I think, a misnomer."
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,819.356,827.441,"No, Your Honor, it's... this case really has, it seems to me, has two components in terms of the separation of powers analysis."
1990.90-615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,888.192,891.033,So it's a violation of a law passed by Congress.
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,891.033,893.004,"--But a jurisdictional statute, Your Honor."
1990.90-615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,893.004,894.735,"Well, you call it a jurisdictional statute."
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,896.878,897.887,That is true.
1990.90-615,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,944.449,954.044,"Mr. Rudin, do you think Congress could have expressly authorized the use of magistrates to make the initial voir dire of jurors?"
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,954.044,954.955,"No, Your Honor."
1990.90-615,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,965.49,976.008,"Well, do you think since the ultimate seating of the jury is left for the judge, that our holding in Raddatz speaks to this issue?"
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,976.008,979.822,"--Well, it speaks to the issue, but I don't think it determines the issue."
1990.90-615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1013.302,1017.236,"How is it, then, that a magistrate can preside over a misdemeanor trial?"
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1017.236,1036.257,"What the Raddatz case, I think, went to great pains to point out with the decision it pointed out was that the degree of review that must be provided under article III must be directly related to the importance of the interest under article III that is in question."
1990.90-615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1058.652,1072.261,"But the Court has held, as I take it, that a misdemeanor trial can be presided over by a magistrate, that's an exercise of the judicial power, if it is a misdemeanor trial before an article III court, has it not?"
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1072.261,1079.758,"Well, the misdemeanor trial... this Court has not reached that question as to whether or not a misdemeanor trial may be delegated to a magistrate."
1990.90-615,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1140.025,1149.752,"Well, you could make the same argument exactly in suppression hearings, and a magistrate listening to the testimony in the suppression hearing."
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1183.723,1195.092,"The reason, Your Honor, I... first of all I think that the reasoning underlying Your Honor's question would also justify having the entire trial assigned to a magistrate."
1990.90-615,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1240.911,1247.976,But that's exactly the same thing that happens when a magistrate hears testimony it witnesses at a suppression hearing.
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1254.421,1260.395,"That is certainly true, Your Honor, but the difference is that at a suppression hearing there is no jury present."
1990.90-615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1328.109,1336.605,Do you say that his determination as to whether to admit expert testimony depends on his evaluation of the competence of a particular jury?
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1336.605,1346.152,"--I think that it, it is influenced to some extent by his view of the ability of the jury as a whole to understand the evidence, with or without the assistance of--"
1990.90-615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1346.152,1358.86,"In other words the same judge, faced with the same question of admissibility of expert testimony, the only difference being two different juries, might decide well, I think jury A can handle it, but I think jury B can't handle it?"
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1361.082,1369.078,"--Your Honor, I think that ordinarily the capability of the jury or the composition of the jury would not affect that determination, but in a close case it might."
1990.90-615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1393.954,1397.397,Are evidentiary rulings reviewed on appeal under a clearly erroneous standard?
1990.90-615,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1403.049,1409.675,"--Yes, but the determination of whether or not to admit expert testimony, the district judge is afforded wide discretion."
1990.90-615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1570.6,1574.104,"Thank you, Mr. Rudin."
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1576.137,1579.049,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1707.962,1713.957,"Mr. Bryson, that sounds very reasonable with respect to everything that has happened in the past."
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1720.14,1721.82,"Well, it could--"
1990.90-615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1721.82,1733.07,And the congressional desire that there not be a magistrate for these things can simply be evaded by the defendant agreeing to have a magistrate.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1733.07,1741.345,"--Well, the key element in the evasion, if it were to occur, of course, would be the district court, which has complete control over whether a reference to the magistrate is made."
1990.90-615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1742.604,1745.417,And a great interest in using its magistrates.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1745.417,1747.159,"--That's true, Your Honor."
1990.90-615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.705,1757.283,What's to be disregarded?
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1758.475,1759.727,"--Well, it isn't a question of harm."
1990.90-615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1759.727,1761.147,"Volenti non fit injuria, right?"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1766.17,1769.682,"No, there has been no harm done, but not... it's not the case that everything is fine."
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.763,1886.549,I suppose it would take two other people to carry that out.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1886.549,1887.819,--That's right.
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1887.819,1893.373,"The prosecutor and the magistrate would have to connive, too, wouldn't they?"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1893.373,1893.884,That's right.
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.197,2054.92,"Well, you say, you tell us... you're telling us what plain error is."
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2057.722,2066.598,"Well, harmful error is anything as to which you cannot say with confidence, or in the case of constitutional error great confidence, did not result in either--"
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2066.598,2068.027,You don't think it means inevitably harmful?
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2068.027,2069.379,--No.
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.231,2072.842,"Well, what if it did?"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2073.92,2074.632,--that it was not harmful.
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.632,2075.952,What if it did?
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2084.08,2086.44,"Well, I think it's a question of degree."
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.98,2102.81,Something really harmful.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2102.81,2104.192,"It has to be really harmful, that's right."
1990.90-615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2114.27,2119.382,"Or a structural violation under article III, if we have a structural violation."
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2119.382,2121.543,"--That's right, and that's my third category."
1990.90-615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2136.061,2151.132,"Are there examples of nonstructural errors, the kind of colloquy you were having with Justice White, in the case law of cases where there is plain error but that is not harmful, not prejudicial?"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2151.132,2153.133,I can't think of--
1990.90-615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2153.133,2154.064,I can't think of any.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2154.064,2170.453,"--a case that this Court has decided in which it has held that there is plain error which is not harmful, because the way we read the language of rule 52, and I think it's consistent with the way this Court has done so in Frady and in Young, is to say that it has to be an egregious error affecting the defendant's substantial rights."
1990.90-615,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2214.823,2215.714,Shocks the conscience.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2215.714,2217.624,"Well, that's right."
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2344.627,2359.35,"And you would say the same thing, I suppose, if you want to imagine something, that the judge assigned the entire trial of a felony case--"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2359.35,2359.657,Yes.
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2359.657,2360.238,--to a magistrate?
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2360.238,2362.361,"We would say, we would say the same thing."
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.529,2424.63,Of course it would be different if the defendant objected?
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2424.63,2426.733,I think it would be a different analysis.
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2454.389,2455.791,"Well, it certainly would be error, wouldn't it?"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2455.791,2458.713,"--It would be error under the statute as it now exists, certainly."
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.844,2464.417,"And if there was an objection, I suppose there would be a new trial, wouldn't there?"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2464.417,2465.178,"--Oh, yeah, absolutely."
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.119,2468.55,Yes.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2468.55,2468.929,That's right.
1990.90-615,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2468.929,2472.191,The magistrate could have conducted a perfect trial--
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2472.191,2472.842,That's right.
1990.90-615,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2472.842,2474.264,"--and then still, under Gomez--"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2474.264,2475.013,Absolutely.
1990.90-615,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2475.013,2476.014,--that would be reversible.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2476.014,2479.667,"Because we would not be allowed to claim that, harmless error under Gomez."
1990.90-615,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2480.358,2482.158,"And why would that be, do you suppose?"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2482.158,2484.69,"Well, the Court--"
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2484.69,2486.33,I know that you could say Gomez says that.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2486.33,2486.83,--Yes.
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.802,2488.653,Why do you think--
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2488.653,2510.085,"--I think what the Court in Gomez was getting at is saying that this is one of those areas, such as where you have a potentially biased fact-finder, in which it is simply impossible to make a fine determination as to whether there was absolutely no prejudice."
1990.90-615,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2517.522,2520.964,--Finish your answer.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2520.964,2525.556,--But I think that's very different from the inquiry that has to be made under plain error doctrine.
1990.90-615,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2525.556,2532.731,It seems to me that your whole line of argument here undercuts your concession or your reading of Gomez.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2550.403,2552.734,"Well, I don't think they're contradictory, Your Honor."
1990.90-615,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2603.638,2614.404,"The analogy, I suppose, would be if there were a statute saying you cannot stipulate as to any given line of evidence, and the parties stipulated that certain evidence could be introduced."
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2616.424,2623.51,"Well, except that I think our case is stronger, because it's not that Congress said you may not assign jury selection to a magistrate."
1990.90-615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2824.512,2837.989,"Mr. Bryson, if supervisory authority is all that is necessary to prevent a violation of article III, then I presume that a district judge can let the magistrate conduct the entire trial, so long as he supervises it?"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2837.989,2841.532,"I think with consent, Your Honor, that's, that would be our position."
1990.90-615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2849.019,2849.817,For felony trials as well?
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2849.817,2850.749,"--For felony... well, that's right."
1990.90-615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2851.39,2857.353,"So Congress could... and if the court can do it on its own, I suppose that Congress can require the court to do it."
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2865.959,2873.663,"--I think that gets harder, because there you have taken a very important ingredient away from the judicial branch, which is... from the article III judges."
1990.90-615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2882.109,2882.609,Why?
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2883.951,2884.432,Well--
1990.90-615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2884.432,2888.963,"If supervision is enough, you're adopting a general principle that supervision is enough."
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2902.541,2910.548,"--Well, I think... what I'm saying is I think that the decision to assign in a particular case is part of the supervision."
1990.90-615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2945.66,2947.481,That's all the statute has to say?
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2964.063,2974.07,"Well, if the statute... I'm not sure a statute that required that they be sent, that all cases be sent to magistrates would necessarily be unconstitutional."
1990.90-615,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.096,3020.981,So all the Constitution really contains is a guarantee that you'll have a Federal judge supervising your criminal trial if that's all he thinks is necessary?
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3026.414,3046.88,"Supervision and having a substantial responsibility at some point in the process, whether that's, in the case of consent whether that's a case of review of the judgment that's made if it's, suppose it's a misdemeanor trial conducted by the magistrate, review of the judgment by the district court in the case of consent is enough."
1990.90-615,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3049.91,3055.993,"When you get to what Congress said, Congress said misdemeanors."
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3055.993,3056.835,That's right.
1990.90-615,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3056.835,3060.268,And they deliberately didn't say felonies.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3060.268,3060.779,That's right.
1990.90-615,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3061.738,3064.502,"And they certainly had a reason for that, didn't they?"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3064.502,3065.27,"--Oh yes, they did."
1990.90-615,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3065.27,3067.81,So you want us to draw the line.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3067.81,3070.124,"No, we don't really want you to draw the line, Your Honor."
1990.90-615,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3070.124,3073.284,"Well, how can we say Congress meant felonies--"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3073.284,3074.115,I don't think it did.
1990.90-615,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3075.136,3076.907,--Well then how can we rule with you?
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3076.907,3090.248,"Well, I think because there's a difference between saying that Congress did not authorize it and that the consequence of a violation of what, the statute that Congress wrote, is that there absolutely has to be a reversal in every case."
1990.90-615,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3090.248,3094.308,"There is a difference between one year in the penitentiary and life, isn't there?"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3094.308,3095.59,"Oh, certainly, Your Honor, and--"
1990.90-615,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3095.59,3096.051,Okay.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3096.051,3098.383,"--that's, there's no doubt that that's why Congress chose to--"
1990.90-615,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3098.383,3100.903,You keep saying there's no difference between misdemeanors and felonies.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3100.903,3103.445,"--Well, I think there's no difference for purposes of article III."
1990.90-615,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3103.445,3104.556,There is quite a difference.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3104.556,3107.588,"Well, there is a difference in the real world, but in the world of article III--"
1990.90-615,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3107.588,3108.38,60 or 70 years.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3108.38,3113.561,"--Yes, but there is nothing in article III, we submit, that draws a distinction."
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.561,3126.481,"Well, suppose we disagree with you on that and say that even with consent a magistrate can't try a felony case."
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3127.941,3130.262,"We win, we submit, still because--"
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3130.262,3131.925,Because?
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3131.925,3142.591,"--we say that the magistrate, there's a big difference between the magistrate's trying the whole felony case from beginning to end and the magistrate simply performing one limited function within the sphere of the felony case."
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3143.622,3146.835,And because... and do you rely on supervision--
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3146.835,3148.224,--Yes.
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3150.695,3159.2,--I thought Gomez really questioned the whole business of the efficacy of a judge reviewing voir dires.
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3159.2,3162.122,"--Well, Gomez questioned whether--"
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3162.122,3162.553,Didn't it?
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3162.553,3162.883,--Yes.
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3204.14,3212.025,"So you don't mind us, our just for purposes of deciding this case, assuming that the magistrate in no circumstances could try a felony?"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3212.025,3213.637,--We certainly don't object.
1990.90-615,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3213.637,3225.946,"And that we should then, then address whether or not conducting a voir dire is part of a felony trial, or--"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3225.946,3249.521,"Well, it wouldn't be enough for it to be part of a felony trial, I think, just as it would not immediately be unconstitutional or contrary to, well, unconstitutional, for a magistrate, for example, to perform other services in the context of a felony trial, such as accepting the verdict, or even were the district judge to be ill during the time that the instructions had to be given, to reading the district judge's instructions, or perform other services."
1990.90-615,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3275.668,3277.989,"--Your hypothesis is with consent, I take it?"
1990.90-615,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3277.989,3278.91,"With consent, that's correct."
1990.90-615,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3287.385,3289.416,"Thank you, Mr. Bryson."
1990.90-615,2,32664,joel_b_rudin,,3292.067,3292.798,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.90-615,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3350.217,3362.445,You're saying that the only cases in which we can require an objection to be made are cases where the matter would be waivable?
1990.90-615,2,32664,joel_b_rudin,,3369.498,3397.558,"--If Congress makes a determination, Your Honor, that a particular procedure, or I shouldn't say procedure, that a particular exercise of power is something that cannot be done by a particular judicial officer, then all I am arguing is that an objection cannot be required to that exercise of power, because it's Congress' prerogative in taking into account all sorts of societal interests that go beyond the narrow interest of the defendant not to make it waivable."
1990.90-615,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3449.621,3450.772,"Thank you, Mr. Rudin."
