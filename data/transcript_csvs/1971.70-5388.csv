1971.70-5388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,31.156,"Arguments next in Number 70-5388, Loper against Beto."
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,33.528,37.474,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5388,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.112,168.199,"Mr. Cabaniss, Judge Connelly found as a fact in the District Court that he refused to believe Loper’s testimony that he had not been previously represented?"
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,168.199,169.361,He certainly did Your Honor.
1971.70-5388,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,169.361,169.89,In the Fifth Circuit?
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,169.89,172.471,"And he refused to believe anything Mr. Loper said, there is no question about that."
1971.70-5388,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,172.471,177.308,So you are asking us to offset that factual determination?
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,177.308,181.79,"I am, Your Honor on this basis."
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,226.905,231.945,We have granted certiorari on this case that we give it a limited grant of certiorari?
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,231.945,232.296,Yes sir.
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,240.915,243.098,Right and do you say this is the only one.
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,245.208,249.05,The issue presented Your Honor is whether on the facts presented by this record.
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,249.05,251.926,Are you reading this now from the petition for certiorari?
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,251.926,252.187,No I am not.
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,252.187,254.648,"I am asking you to be quite specific, if you will."
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,254.648,265.789,The -- does the use of prior void convictions for impeachment purposes deprive a criminal defendant a due process of law where their use might well have influenced the outcome of the case.
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,265.789,274.256,"Under that question, it is not open to us to decide whether not the prior convictions were void, is it?"
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,274.256,277.911,"Well Your Honor, I had believed that why --"
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,277.911,280.56,I have got to be of help to you not --
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,280.56,286.772,"It seems to me Your Honor that again we are proceeding in this case, we have throughout from the beginning proceeded on the basis --"
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,286.772,298.565,"Much the way decided it -- Taken case to grant certiorari on was whether not the use of prior void convictions for impeachment purposes violated the rule against Burgett against Texas, is that it?"
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,298.565,300.881,I will proceed to that question Your Honor.
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,302.043,309.255,We did not decide the Taken case of whether or not the issue or to consider the issues of whether or not these prior convictions were void.
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,311.857,313.606,I am sorry I did not understand your question Mr. Justice.
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,313.606,314.389,I see.
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,314.389,316.183,I will proceed to the question of Burgett.
1971.70-5388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,435.35,444.585,"Well, in the Burgett case what was the purpose of the introduction of the prior convections, let us forget the consequence for the moment, what was the purpose of their introduction?"
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,444.585,447.419,The purpose Your Honor was under recidivist counts.
1971.70-5388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,447.419,448.867,"Yes, to enhance the punishment."
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,448.867,449.681,That is correct.
1971.70-5388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,449.681,458.411,"Now, whether the jury did or did not apply it that way is as you suggest is really not the issue, is it?"
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,458.411,475.343,"The point, I would make Your Honor though is it seems to me that in the absence of enhancement, the result in Burgett was that the jury was aware in its deliberations upon the primary substantive issue of guilt of four prior void convictions."
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,507.697,512.663,"The petitioner was the only defense witness, was he not?"
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,512.663,513.859,That is correct Your Honor.
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,513.859,518.486,And daughter or stepdaughter was the only prosecution witness as to the --
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,518.486,521.02,"No, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,532.999,538.271,And the -- did the jury set the sentence here?
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,538.271,539.642,"I believe so Your Honor, 50 years."
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,539.642,541.198,That might be of some importance.
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,541.198,542.893,"I believe the jury did make the sentence, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,542.893,545.347,"But within what bounds of discretions, do you know?"
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,545.347,546.661,Two years to death.
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,546.661,558.652,"Two years to death and the jury said 50 years and then on the text of procedures the trial judge, the sentencing judge obligated to take the jury’s assessment of the sentence."
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,558.652,561.312,"Mr. Justice, I am not aware of the answer to that question."
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,561.312,563.256,This case did.
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,563.256,564.224,I believe that is the answer.
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,567.536,573.051,The jury could have sentenced him to his -- even on fact finding ability to a short term as two years?
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,573.051,577.184,I believe that is the minimum in Texas for that offense.
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,577.184,587.517,"So it is your submission that both branches of Burgett are involved here and those -- the finding of guilt and the imposition of the sentence, the enhancements of --"
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,587.517,594.52,"The fact that it was harmful, that's what Your Honor."
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,702.317,703.382,"Well, I should not think you would be."
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,703.382,705.247,We are not.[Laughter Attempt]
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,705.944,708.451,Do you think that case bears on this probability?
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,708.451,718.881,"No, Your Honor, except from the standpoint that I would certainly -- I like the language about the sentence being based upon this information of the constitutional magnitude, I would like to utilize that one concept."
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,718.881,728.604,"Well, is not -- in that case the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit as you have just told us disagreed with the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the present case."
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,728.604,730.847,That is correct Your Honor.
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,730.847,738.944,We did not indicate any disapproval that we have the Ninth Circuit’s view then went on to find it was harmless error in that case.
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,738.944,748.418,"The Ninth Circuit specifically decided that Burgett included impeachment, but did on the facts presented by that record to go on to determine that it was there harmless error."
1971.70-5388,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,748.418,750.531,And we have affirmed the judgment?
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,750.531,754.214,That is correct.
1971.70-5388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,817.854,829.454,"But there was no occasion in 1947, when this man was tried, I suppose for him to have any reason to challenge the nature of the convictions, was there?"
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,829.454,830.848,Not at all Your Honor.
1971.70-5388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,841.271,850.519,"But your contention is that when you are in the District Court now in 1970 or 1971, 1970 when you were there on the habeas corpus proceeding."
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,850.519,851.684,"1969, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-5388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,851.684,871.193,"1969 was it, that at that time you do not have the burden of proving that the convictions were obtained without counsel, that you merely establish it by his testimony that he did no have counsel."
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,871.193,881.245,"Mr. Chief Justice, I did not mean to imply that the testimony of the defendant as to those facts is all that is needed, I do not believe that is the case."
1971.70-5388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,898.951,908.226,"Yes, I have heard what you had to say about them would you -- are you telling us that that strong collaboration or solid collaboration of that testimony?"
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,908.226,913.193,"No, Your Honor, well it is -- I am saying that it is corroboration."
1971.70-5388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,965.995,980.243,"Well, is it possible that if we agreed, if we decided to the single question presented here in your favor, namely that a prior conviction now void under Gideon may not be used for impeachment?"
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,994.405,1003.48,"Your Honor, under the principle that I have put forth a little bit earlier, I would admonish the Court that perhaps it could."
1971.70-5388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1190.808,1198.479,"Are we concerned that the factual issue on that score now under the question, limited question of this grant?"
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,1198.479,1218.717,"It seems to me Your Honor that the last part of that question whether use might well have influenced the outcome of the case, it occurred to me that that might indicate that the Court would consider whether or not in the circumstances here presented, the prior convictions introduced did in fact influenced the jury in its determination."
1971.70-5388,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.221,1271.139,"Well, was each one of the priors attacked?"
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,1271.139,1273.416,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-5388,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1273.416,1275.836,And how about in the -- how about in this record?
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,1278.099,1279.92,There was one prior --
1971.70-5388,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1279.92,1280.532,Was not one other --
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,1280.532,1288.199,"-- prior conviction, 1932 conviction on the name of Milton Cummings as to which there is no evidence in the record at all."
1971.70-5388,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1288.199,1291.889,No evidence and for what was that conviction?
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,1291.889,1293.567,"The conviction was for burglary, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-5388,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1293.567,1295.484,And the five year penalty?
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,1295.484,1295.91,No sir.
1971.70-5388,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.439,1299.341,"Two years, so that -- there is not attack on that?"
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,1299.341,1300.261,No.
1971.70-5388,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1302.044,1304.33,And he was impeached on that as well as three other?
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,1304.33,1305.862,"Yes, he was."
1971.70-5388,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1305.862,1310.883,"And in connection of one of the others, the record is silent as to whether he was (Voice Overlap) --"
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,1310.883,1318.029,"That is of 1931 conviction in (Inaudible) Mississippi at which time he was 17 years of age, the sentence was six months."
1971.70-5388,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.651,1320.935,That is the record is silent.
1971.70-5388,0,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,1322.997,1323.838,That is correct.
1971.70-5388,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1378.167,1381.145,Very well Mr. Cabaniss.
1971.70-5388,1,39109,robert_darden,,1386.38,1390.722,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1442.188,1446.639,"Well, why is this not a proper proceeding in which to set them aside?"
1971.70-5388,1,39109,robert_darden,,1446.639,1462.68,"Your Honor, the -- getting to this in the District Court in 1969, the writ of habeas corpus that was filed was just to get relief from the 1947 Texas conviction."
1971.70-5388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1462.68,1466.473,And -- but underlying that claim was invalid prior?
1971.70-5388,1,39109,robert_darden,,1466.473,1473.059,"In this, he asserted that the four prior convictions were void."
1971.70-5388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1473.059,1491.429,"Were here that -- excuse me -- was that not -- excuse me and he introduced evidence to -- as much as he had to prove that, namely about two of them, the transcript to the proceedings or the docket entries, about three of them, he did that?"
1971.70-5388,1,39109,robert_darden,,1491.429,1491.674,Yes.
1971.70-5388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.674,1494.2,And nothing about the fourth?
1971.70-5388,1,39109,robert_darden,,1494.2,1497.245,"That is right, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-5388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1497.245,1509.156,"Was that not true in Burgett that they have not been officially set aside by some other and conclusively set aside by some other Court before the proceedings begin in Burgett, is that not true?"
1971.70-5388,1,39109,robert_darden,,1509.156,1512.189,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-5388,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.22,1527.7,"So again, why could not the Court here have said, well, these -- we find or the Court finds that these priors were -- prior convictions were invalid since he pleaded guilty or was convicted without counsel?"
1971.70-5388,1,39109,robert_darden,,1527.7,1534.002,"Well, as was held by the District Court, the District Court's said that the convictions were valid."
1971.70-5388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1534.002,1534.604,Alright.
1971.70-5388,1,39109,robert_darden,,1534.604,1552.265,"Fifth Circuit pointed out in their opinion that since the passing of Gideon versus, I mean, the handing down of the Gideon versus Wainwright which was six years prior to his going to trial in 1969, he had done nothing towards getting this removed from his record."
1971.70-5388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1552.265,1555.903,"But under Burgett, he did not have to?"
1971.70-5388,1,39109,robert_darden,,1557.476,1562.072,That is true and we are saying Burgett does not apply.
1971.70-5388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1562.072,1566.679,"Well it bears on the point you are now making, does it not?"
1971.70-5388,1,39109,robert_darden,,1579.222,1580.574,Yes sir.
1971.70-5388,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1581.249,1582.506,Yes.
1971.70-5388,1,39109,robert_darden,,1582.506,1598.757,"In that particular case, what I understand, this was used for enhancement and in order for them to bring in the original indictment, they also alleged the two or three priors which was a part of this proceeding."
1971.70-5388,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1638.08,1643.899,In Texas then you do not have to show a final judgment of conviction or at least you did not at that time to use for impeachment?
1971.70-5388,1,39109,robert_darden,,1643.899,1646.556,"In 1947, no, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-5388,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1646.556,1653.151,"So in 1947, if a man was indicted and acquitted, he has to show to indictment?"
1971.70-5388,1,39109,robert_darden,,1653.151,1656.151,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-5388,2,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,2445.294,2447.344,"One thing, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-5388,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2508.503,2515.259,"On the retrial, do you have any idea where this complainant witness might be as of now?"
1971.70-5388,2,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,2515.259,2517.519,"No, Mr. Justice, I do not."
1971.70-5388,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2519.489,2522.233,"She was eight-years old in 1947, right?"
1971.70-5388,2,29686,john_t_cabaniss,,2522.233,2525.796,That is correct.
