1972.71-1069,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,20.51,We will hear arguments next in number 71-1069 Associated Enterprises against Toltec Watershed District.
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,23.318,28.167,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1069,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,105.624,116.531,Mr. Burgess where in the record is there a finding by either the Trial Court or Supreme Court of Wyoming that Johnston Fuel Liners was a lessee from Associated Enterprise.
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,116.531,118.121,It is in the appendix Your Honor.
1972.71-1069,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,118.121,133.333,Where about.
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,150.096,159.191,"On page 19 of the appendix, there is a stipulation of the facts, and Paragraph 3 says that Johnston Fuel Liners is not a land owner."
1972.71-1069,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,174.996,187.07,(Inaudible) At least the Johnston Fuel Liners almost having this based on the land.
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,187.07,188.788,That is correct.
1972.71-1069,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,241.175,252.453,"Okay this is Johnston Fuel Liners position I realize, but how are we to know that either the Trial Court or the Supreme Court of Wyoming accepted this position?"
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,252.453,303.258,"Well, I believe then the Supreme Court -- the order of intervention of course, Johnston Fuel Liners is not rich as your party defendant and they were allowed to intervene and in the motion it says, that -- this is again on pages 14 and 15 of the motion, that they were a lessee and the entry of the lands upon Toltec, up the entry by Toltec upon the lands of Johnston Fuel Liners and their interference to move and strikes to its use and possession of the lands."
1972.71-1069,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,308.002,311.865,"Bunch of it I get, as to -- I was just concerned."
1972.71-1069,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,311.865,335.434,"I noticed though, before you leave it on the top of page on 25, there is the request in the interrogatory, please attach all copies of leases between the Johnston and Associated Enterprises, and then the answer is that the agreement is reflected on the Journals of the company and that there is no single written lease document."
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,335.434,335.888,Correct.
1972.71-1069,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,335.888,342.554,This is just an occupancy at sufferance.
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,342.554,345.133,I would resume that you could term it that.
1972.71-1069,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,364.521,375.207,"Do you think that might bear if it's a tenancyof sufferance and occupancy at sufferance, and might be relevant consideration and with their interest in going on the matter."
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,375.207,389.702,"Yes I would think that the interest of any user of this land who occupies it, that his interest is as great as the interest of any person who owns a title to that land."
1972.71-1069,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,402.591,415.51,"Would you think the right to vote might be different if it is a 99 year or occupancy at sufferance, terminable at will?"
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,415.51,423.893,No Your Honor I think that the right to vote is something that is granted by this particular case by this particular act.
1972.71-1069,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,442.219,453.95,"But in order to as maintain -- you have standard to maintain your constitutional issue, you got to show that if the constitution were applied in the way you say it be then your client would end up having right to vote."
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,453.95,480.912,"Correct I understand that and that is why in the interrogatories and the order of the Court, the Court did allow Johnston Fuel Liners to intervene finding perhaps not expressly but certainly by implication and as a general orders that all of the facts and legal conclusions necessary enter the order or embodies in that order."
1972.71-1069,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,768.241,778.953,"What if under Wyoming law, that Watershed Improvement District must be or formed on the vote of all the registered voters within that proposed district?"
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,778.953,780.543,What if it were to be?
1972.71-1069,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,782.006,784.795,"I know, but if the statute just provided that?"
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,784.795,787.913,"Well, I think that would be constitutional."
1972.71-1069,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,787.913,797.36,What if -- I don't know why your corporate lessee shouldn't demand on the same argument demand the right to vote?
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,797.36,806.997,"The corporate lessee in this case would not have a right to vote, if as the Justice says, it were upon the basis of an individual person voting."
1972.71-1069,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,806.997,820.842,"I know they wouldn't, I said that they wouldn't have the right according to the statute but would the statute be constitutional if, it like the present one excluded your corporate lessee from voting."
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,820.842,824.946,"My understanding, that is the law that it would be constitutional."
1972.71-1069,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,825.902,829.976,"Well, why can't the state then exclude it under this statute?"
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,829.976,830.348,Sir.
1972.71-1069,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,830.904,833.239,Why can't the state exclude your corporate lessee --
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,833.239,838.664,Because we contend that is a unreasonable and capricious exclusion.
1972.71-1069,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,838.664,844.948,"Well I don't know why it wouldn't under the other one, if you would have exactly the same interest."
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,844.948,858.204,"What we are talking about here as I understand it, in a sense is the purpose of an election and running counter and at the same time going along with that is a question of the qualification of a voter."
1972.71-1069,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,861.145,869.011,"You mean you have a case here, you think you have case here only because they proceeded on the basis of land owners being voters?"
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,869.011,871.104,And voting the acreage.
1972.71-1069,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,876.177,881.458,"So, you say therefore, it is just they proceed on the basis of the land owners, it's invidious to exclude lessee?"
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,881.458,883.84,Right.
1972.71-1069,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,907.355,913.365,"Mr. Burgess, who pays the bond that are issued by your district?"
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,913.365,924.603,"The bonds are paid by the owner of the land who benefits from the improvements made in form of the dam, and canals and ditches."
1972.71-1069,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,947.645,950.947,Is the assessment based on the number of acres--
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,950.947,965.962,"It is based upon the value of benefits on certain acres, for instance, if a total project had cost $100,000 and there is 10,000 acres, it must be $10 per acres, would be the assessment."
1972.71-1069,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,965.962,972.459,If the general public has no obligation directly or indirectly to pay the bonds that are issued by the district.
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,972.459,974.679,Correct.
1972.71-1069,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,974.679,985.791,"You refer to a case involving the issuance of sewer bonds, who paid for interest and principal on those bonds?"
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,985.791,987.3,Property owners.
1972.71-1069,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,987.3,988.07,Only property owners?
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,988.07,989.999,Only property owners.
1972.71-1069,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1009.105,1028.407,Is your position that one must have an interest in land by a lease or otherwise to be entitled to vote or would you suggest that anyone who lived in the district regardless of whether he had an interest in land also should be entitled to vote?
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,1028.407,1033.066,I would respectfully suggest that anybody in the district has a right to vote.
1972.71-1069,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1038.005,1041.451,But you don't have to go that far.
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,1041.451,1046.19,"No, I don't have to go that far, but I think that the people have the right to vote."
1972.71-1069,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1074.659,1078.822,What the priority of the used water in Wyoming to--
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,1078.822,1080.605,Doctrine of prior appropriations.
1972.71-1069,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1080.605,1086.704,And what got in to the conflict between the domestic consumption and irrigation?
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,1086.704,1112.239,"Well, we go on a doctrine of priority, if you have, we have four prime preferred uses, if you have a preferred use which is subsequent in time to an irrigation right, the irrigation right prevails, however the preferred right can Wyoming domain take the prior use or on the scale--"
1972.71-1069,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1112.239,1124.435,The water conserved by this district might be available or higher usage of --
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,1124.435,1129.422,"Well, the contemplated use is used for agricultural purposes."
1972.71-1069,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1136.656,1138.179,It would have to be bought.
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,1138.179,1140.914,It would have to be purchased by someone else.
1972.71-1069,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1140.914,1146.369,The improvement district doesn't acquire any water rights of its own as a result of constructing this facility.
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,1146.369,1154.855,"That's correct you have to file to the state engineer, make a beneficial use of the water and then you get a water right."
1972.71-1069,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1173.54,1181.068,"So, but the water it does store is not for its own benefit as such but simply for the benefit of its members?"
1972.71-1069,0,26556,henry_a_burgess,,1181.068,1197.338,"Of the members and also be used for recreational purposes, fishing."
1972.71-1069,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1233.293,1236.102,"Thank you Mr. Burgess, Mr. Phifer."
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1236.102,1239.474,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1280.815,1283.127,But the boards were the same.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1283.127,1288.614,"The boards are the same, yes, there is some differentiation in some of the minority stockholders but --"
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1288.614,1290.014,The stockholders are not the same.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1290.014,1294.077,The stockholdings are not quite the same but almost the same Mr. Justice.
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1436.202,1438.228,Present in the vicinity of--
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1438.228,1448.645,"Well, the Wyoming Peak is right on the edge of this, so it's in the vicinity of Laramie, Wyoming it would be about 60 to 70 miles in north of Laramie Wyoming."
1972.71-1069,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1448.645,1450.588,Really it is just irrigated pasture there.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1450.588,1452.286,"Well, no it's irrigated meadows."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1452.286,1453.338,Irrigated meadows.
1972.71-1069,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1453.338,1454.445,Because you harvest the hay.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1454.445,1457.127,"You harvested hay, you have to have it for winter."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1457.127,1458.483,Do you bale it?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1458.483,1463.38,"All that most part they don't bale it here, primarily because the meadows are too rough."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1463.38,1464.554,But do you keep the cattle there?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1464.554,1466.077,Keep the cattle there and feed them there --
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1466.077,1466.502,In the winter time.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1466.502,1469.049,In the winter time.
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1575.6,1577.824,"Well, how does this case get started?"
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1577.824,1591.793,"The case got started primarily right after the district was formed, we asked permission to go on to Johnston's land to make a survey to see if the foundation studies would be proper to build a dam in a particular location."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1591.793,1594.199,I think Johnston must have gone against the formation?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1594.199,1595.654,He allowed us to go on first.
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1605.57,1611.186,So that the people of -- there were other owners who own more land that he did.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1611.186,1612.045,Yes.
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1612.045,1613.18,So they outvoted him?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1613.18,1619.786,"Well, actually the vote -- there were only three land owners that voted against that there were about 12 that voted for it."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1625.023,1626.124,So he got voted.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1626.124,1627.404,He got out voted.
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1627.404,1637.576,"Now if this lessee is entitled to vote, that isn't going to do any good because he would have been out voted also --"
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1637.576,1637.819,Well --
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1637.819,1644.314,"If set what, do you have to really strike down, do you have to get to the acreage limitations as well as--"
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1644.314,1644.509,As to the land owners.
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1644.509,1646.651,I think it goes down rather than --
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1646.651,1654.17,"I think that based on the decisions in this Court, all of which are concerned with so called popular elections."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1687.906,1695.477,How would this election have come out in the first place if the rule had been (Inaudible)?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1695.477,1697.943,It would still have passed.
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1700.893,1707.948,"Well then let's assume this, let's assume you lose this suit?"
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1707.948,1717.47,"If we lose this suit, the entire Wyoming Watershed law I think is unconstitutional, then probably we have plans to go back and form a private ditch company--"
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1717.47,1722.911,No I was just asking just really a fair reliable law suit.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1722.911,1723.659,I beg your pardon.
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1723.659,1729.507,"And what interest would the other side have, and they would would still lose this, they would still lose the election."
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1730.858,1746.334,"Well they wouldn't, in one particular instance, if lessees are allowed to vote, then what is to prevent the landowner who is against this, from leasing, ten acres out of 10,000 acres to 50 different people in a line to vote."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1746.334,1748.521,That would be the situation for (Inaudible) --
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1748.521,1749.743,Yeah.
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1750.229,1750.819,Well if you lose this lawsuit --
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1750.819,1751.997,These are things that open to fraud.
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1751.997,1756.684,Well if you lose this lawsuit there will be a new vote that's the point and you don't know how that's going to come out.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1756.684,1763.031,"But we know how the new vote will come out because we not only have a majority in number, we have a majority in acreage both, either way we are --"
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1763.031,1770.458,"Except that, if there is a new vote as you say one of the land owners that might lease an acre of piece to 200 people, of all them were --"
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1770.458,1772.742,"That's right, and they will control the election."
1972.71-1069,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1806.906,1810.795,And he is lessor voted in the fist instance?
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1810.795,1811.667,He was his lessor.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1811.667,1812.207,He was his own lessor --
1972.71-1069,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1812.207,1814.138,He was his own --
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1814.138,1821.215,"Now going back to this popular election proposition, this is not a popular election, there is no secret ballot to start with."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1854.779,1860.545,Well if you distinguish the cases where -- say there is really no difference between landowner and a lessee.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1871.48,1879.094,That's the right because actually as you said in previous cases the renter or the lessee ends up paying bill and increased rent at least to next --
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1879.094,1880.182,Do you accept that?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1880.182,1896.52,"I do accept that, except that I am afraid that the compelling state interest in this case is to exclude lessees because it would lead the elections open to fraud and that any landowner that was opposed to it could bring an enough so called lessees to entirely control the elections."
1972.71-1069,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1896.52,1899.721,But other than that you have no answer to give?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1899.721,1901.233,No sir.
1972.71-1069,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1901.233,1918.135,"Mr. Phifer, Justice Powell as Mr. Burgess about the case of Cipriano, do you read Cipriano the same way Mr. Burgess does as involving a obligation that was to be ultimately paid only by property owners?"
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1918.135,1926.872,"Well no, I read Cipriano and all the other cases once you get out of the -- once you get into the bond election sort of process."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1944.836,1946.189,Regardless of who pays the bill?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,1946.189,1950.864,"Regardless of who pays the bill, everybody is directly affected by sewage disposal."
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1997.883,2004.053,"But don't you have that same possibility with one man one vote, (Inaudible) to bring in a thousand people?"
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2004.053,2004.566,Well --
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2004.566,2006.137,"Yes, yes, yes."
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2006.137,2011.937,You do Mr. Justice up to the point that they have to support them for about 30 days I believe now under your --
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2011.937,2016.112,"Well you could put a residence, what prevents them putting a residence requirement."
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2016.112,2017.787,A residency equirement in here?
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2017.787,2018.676,Yeah.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2018.676,2035.317,"Well I think that it would be unconstitutional to make a residency requirement here because here we go back to the matter of discrimination, is the class which is excluded more directly interested in the results than the class which is included."
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2042.596,2050.166,"All he says is let to lessee vote, he doesn't say that the lessee that comes in today, vote sort of thing?"
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2050.166,2061.295,"No but the only alternative I think to the present system where it limits the landowners, is a system that what put it back on the old residency requirement."
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2061.295,2065.117,Do you know of any lessor who pays taxes himself?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2065.117,2065.774,lessor?
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2065.774,2066.1,Yeah.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2066.1,2072.157,In our areas yes sir they all pay the taxes directly themselves generally speaking at least --
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2072.157,2076.592,"If you have got a lessor and a lessee, who pays the taxes?"
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2076.592,2076.739,Well.
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2076.739,2078.668,I know who signs the check but who will pays --
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2078.668,2083.341,"Well, of course ultimately then it goes back to who is paying the bill."
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2083.341,2085.797,How many people are in this district?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2085.797,2089.621,Probably 12 families.
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2089.621,2092.056,What's wrong if they let the 12 people vote?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2092.056,2099.673,Not a thing except that they are not the people who are directly interested in the elections.
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2111.796,2118.148,"But you said, definitely this and other cases is for the benefit of all the people in the district."
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2118.148,2124.325,"The other cases are at the benefit, I think sewer or bonds or --"
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2124.325,2127.783,Is this advantageous to all of the people in the district?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2127.783,2134.237,"No sir, No sir, it's only of interest to the people who own or lease irrigated land."
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2136.88,2140.901,"A sewer for 12 families, would that make difference?"
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2140.901,2141.733,I beg your pardon.
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2141.733,2144.221,A sewer for 12 --
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2144.221,2150.623,"That would make a great deal of interest, because even if you are --"
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2150.623,2155.918,I notice a great trouble with letting twelve people full.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2155.918,2166.533,"Well, I think that if you limited it again, as I said to residence, then you will be excluding a great number of land owners who are directly interested in this."
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2168.246,2172.871,I am only saying that you want to protect it against fraud.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2179.183,2186.348,"Well, if lessees were allowed to vote and if Associated or Johnston Fuel Liners is classified as lessee which has no lease."
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2186.348,2188.825,"Oh, you said bona fide lessee."
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2188.825,2193.886,"Bona fide lessees again, you can make out 50 leases in an afternoon."
1972.71-1069,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2260.079,2269.07,Do you think anybody could persuade to go up in the back woods of Wyoming and just stay there for the purpose of vote?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2269.07,2272.471,"They wouldn't, no, I don't think so."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2279.161,2282.275,It so happened --
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2282.275,2284.967,Here again the lessees would not have to come up here.
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2408.274,2424.548,"Mr. Phifer, some little time ago, you were contrasting the situation here with what you called a popular election, and as you rightly said, in a popular election generally there is a vote in polling place by a secret ballot by individual voters."
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2432.419,2436.445,"No, we have a meeting, and they come in and vote."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2436.445,2437.951,Individual representatives of the corporation?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2437.951,2440.261,Individual representatives of the corporation.
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2440.261,2442.317,Who in question show their authority to represent the corporation.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2442.317,2450.558,"Yes, in this instance, this is a small community and there is no question about who is the owner of the corporation and also the land."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2453.737,2455.988,Is it a public meeting?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2455.988,2460.424,"Yes, it is an open meeting and there is quite an involved due notice requirement here."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2496.667,2497.73,Actual notice by them.
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2497.73,2498.634,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1069,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2498.634,2502.879,"Mr. Phifer, where are these bonds marketed?"
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2502.879,2512.4,"They only have one market and that's United States government, the bonds as such are merely security for the obligation under the FHA Rules."
1972.71-1069,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2532.085,2535.08,Are they subordinate to the private debt?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2535.08,2555.644,"Well, they are really not a private debt, there are debt of the Watershed district itself, and the land under assessment is of course subject to leans or assessments, but -- and it might be subject to foreclosure by these, but I think the government would have step in pay off, lot of insurance company loans before they can do it."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2557.383,2566.708,"How do you know that if these assessments and the leans, the representatives -- subordinate with the private lease, does the statute say something?"
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2566.708,2568.327,"No, the statute does not say something."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2568.327,2569.675,This hasn't been adjudicated?
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2569.675,2570.933,"No, it hasn't been adjudicated."
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2571.848,2573.439,(Inaudible)
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2573.439,2582.281,"I don't -- I am sorry, I think you are right, it wouldn't be subordinate but the assessments are not subordinate."
1972.71-1069,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.117,2627.352,"But occasionally, when one recalls at lease cases where the bond owner has sought an action against the issuer to make the issuer take such action as it can by marshaling of assets to collect funds that maybe available to it but not directly to the bond owner."
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2639.236,2639.849,That's right.
1972.71-1069,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2641.848,2644.882,(Inaudible)
1972.71-1069,1,24476,fred_w_phifer,,2644.882,2656.237,That might be.
1972.71-1069,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2657.64,2663.839,"Thank you Mr. Phifer, Mr. Burgess, you have got about nine minutes left."
1972.71-1069,2,26556,henry_a_burgess,,2663.839,2676.531,"Mr. Chief Justice and the Court, several observations I make, but one of them is, and I think we got a little bit outside of the record here, discussing this district."
1972.71-1069,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2710.563,2712.277,Does it involve (Inaudible)
1972.71-1069,2,26556,henry_a_burgess,,2712.277,2725.312,"I will stop it Your Honor, if you don't believe, it shouldn't go on, but the point is that people did decide, it was said there was two big landowners and they voted the acreage and that's how we are here."
1972.71-1069,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2786.707,2804.933,"Your colleague said that the question of tenancy at sufferance would resemble the Wyoming Supreme court, was not decided to pass by them, which I take it means, it wouldn't make any difference to one on the Supreme Court in terms of its right, if this were a wholly independent lessee with a lease of 10 years."
1972.71-1069,2,26556,henry_a_burgess,,2804.933,2808.781,"Correct, or you have an individual."
1972.71-1069,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2812.349,2816.878,Is this true that there were only 12 people involved?
1972.71-1069,2,26556,henry_a_burgess,,2816.878,2835.401,"I think there maybe 12 families that voted for, I am not sure the exact vote, there were three who voted against as I understand, but there are more families involved above the upper limit which are interested in this, and of course, they were brought in."
1972.71-1069,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2839.122,2842.242,Are those families up there lessees or landowner.
1972.71-1069,2,26556,henry_a_burgess,,2842.242,2843.378,Both.
1972.71-1069,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2843.378,2845.814,Would the landowner be allowed to vote?
1972.71-1069,2,26556,henry_a_burgess,,2845.814,2851.001,"Certainly they should be allowed to vote, but they weren't, they weren't even put into the proposed boundary."
1972.71-1069,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2851.001,2852.378,Does that raise the interest?
1972.71-1069,2,26556,henry_a_burgess,,2852.378,2853.772,No.
1972.71-1069,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2853.772,2856.511,"In this case, there are 12 families involved."
1972.71-1069,2,26556,henry_a_burgess,,2856.511,2856.659,Correct.
1972.71-1069,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2856.659,2861.574,Why do you call this election made by who sits around the living room and tells about something.
1972.71-1069,2,26556,henry_a_burgess,,2861.574,2863.277,"That's correct, that's probably it was."
1972.71-1069,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2863.277,2865.325,And that's an election?
1972.71-1069,2,26556,henry_a_burgess,,2865.325,2868.308,"Well, that's for this court --"
1972.71-1069,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2868.308,2873.806,"If it wasn't called an election, would you have any case?"
1972.71-1069,2,26556,henry_a_burgess,,2873.806,2880.891,"Well I suppose not, except it is a governmental, political subdivision of the state."
1972.71-1069,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2882.551,2885.177,"Thank you gentleman, the case is submitted."
