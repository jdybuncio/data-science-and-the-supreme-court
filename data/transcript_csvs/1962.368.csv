1962.368,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,18.863,"No. 368 Retail Clerks International Association Local 1625, AFL-CIO, et al., petitioners versus Alberta Schermerhorn et al."
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,19.75,23.942,Thank you sir.
1962.368,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,70.101,71.643,"How many such states are there, about a dozen?"
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,71.643,72.703,There are 20 at the moment sir.
1962.368,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,72.703,78.487,Twenty.
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,78.487,92.022,We negotiated what I think could be correctly characterized as a service fee arrangement.
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,320.594,328.559,Which I suppose leads to objective employee pay a greater proportion of the collective bargaining costs?
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,328.559,329.683,No sir.
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,329.683,330.319,Why is that?
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,330.319,340.482,Because the costs of collective bargaining are ascertainable just as in the hiring-hall arrangement --
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,340.482,347.165,"But he's going to be paying monthly the same dues, the same amount?"
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,350.399,352.145,"In this case, but there is no demonstration --"
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,352.145,353.759,And we are talking about this case.
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,353.759,362.216,"Right sir, in this case, but there is no demonstration in the record that this particular union did not use all of its funds for collective bargaining purposes."
1962.368,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,379.204,394.009,"Well, are you saying now Mr. Lippman that as far as this record is concerned, we have to treat the case as if all union revenues were expended for purposes in carrying on collective bargaining."
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,394.009,395.716,That is correct sir.
1962.368,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,395.716,398.616,Was there a finding to that effect?
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,398.616,400.124,There was never any trial.
1962.368,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,413.364,416.678,"Were the pleadings alleged this, you said it was decided on the pleadings?"
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,416.678,422.772,"Yes, the pleadings point out that the employees that do not want to be members of the union."
1962.368,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,489.723,502.93,We'll recess now Mr. Lippman. [Recess]
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,502.93,505.168,"Yes, may it please the Court."
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,872.695,899.083,[Inaudible]
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,899.083,904.06,"Mr. Justice White, in my judgment it would be an unfair labor practice."
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.06,907.539,[Inaudible]
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,907.539,912.297,"Well, there may be an element of concurrent jurisdiction."
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.297,913.825,[Inaudible]
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,913.825,916.927,"I don't concede it, but I raise the problem."
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,937.322,947.514,[Inaudible]
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,947.514,950.997,Yes.
1962.368,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1124.265,1130.333,"But don't you think that we have a progress to that end, it might not be possible in this very case?"
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1135.396,1136.424,"Well, because the Court --"
1962.368,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1136.424,1139.638,What we are dealing with is a meaning of a Federal Statute?
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1139.638,1154.521,"But it's a Federal Statute over which the Board is given exclusive jurisdiction, if the Federal and the Board is given the primary responsibility of protecting rights under the law and caring of the policies."
1962.368,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1167.416,1181.936,"But right here in this case we have now before us, the question of what does Section 14(b) mean and it's -- certainly there is an opportunity is there not, to contribute to uniformity by deciding this case."
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1181.936,1221.876,"I would say that it would be of great aid to the Labor Board to interpret 14(b) and give it some definitive meaning, but I would also say that in the final analysis the determination of whether a service fee arrangement comes within 14(b) or the outside of scope of 14(b) and therefore, a protective kind of activity should be made by the Labor Board which is expert not only in the conduct presumably but also in the interpretation of a statute; 14(b) has to be accommodated to the rest of the act."
1962.368,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1221.876,1236.734,"Well, let's assume a State has a law prohibiting the union shop in the purer sense to that word, I choose whatever the language you want for the statute, and that the highest court of the state says this is all it means."
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1245.02,1245.566,I would say and certainly --
1962.368,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1245.566,1248.645,Do you think that means something else and you have to --
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1248.645,1258.027,"I would say sir if I understand your question correctly, in a situation where it is absolutely clear beyond any arguable reason."
1962.368,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1258.027,1259.857,"That's my assumed case, yes?"
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1259.857,1298.694,"That there I believe a State could outlaw or could prohibit the enforcement of that particular clause, but by an injunction, but where there is -- but where there is a great deal of doubt as to whether or not, I mean taking the reasoning of the Colorado Supreme Court, but where there is substantial doubt of substantial uncertainty where the law has been undeclared, then I think only the Labor Board can make that determination."
1962.368,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1370.132,1388.293,"Mr. Lippman, I really don't understand that in light of your reliance on Curry, while you conceded with Justice White with even in the crystal clear case, State Court granted an injunction against the enforcement of the act."
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1388.293,1389.563,Well --
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1389.563,1392.865,Does the conduct certainly have been unfair labor practice in that attempt?
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1392.865,1407.159,"Well, the conduct is an unfair labor practice with – I frankly -- I don't think anything anyone knows except as we have learned from this Court as to whether or not there is any kind of jurisdiction --"
1962.368,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1407.159,1413.033,Do you find anything in Curry which suggests that we should have made that confession?
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1413.033,1416.26,No sir I find nothing in Curry which indicates that.
1962.368,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1427.145,1428.444,"Well, I didn't mean to put words in your mouth."
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1428.444,1461.383,"Yes, but I was -- I just wondered whether or not if there was to be any area -- if there was to be any area, it is in that area in which there would be no doubt at all, but even there I speak with uncertainty as to just what the authority of the State Court is, but surely I don't have to go that far and I only contend to this proposition surely in a situation of this kind where there is substantial doubt."
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1461.383,1462.504,About what?
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1462.504,1467.819,As to whether or not a service fee arrangement comes under 14(b).
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1467.819,1470.097,Or under the State Law.
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1474.481,1478.895,"By the Florida Law itself; well, the Supreme Court of Florida said it was barred by [Inaudible]"
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1478.895,1483.103,And you conceded it in moving to dismiss.
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1483.103,1484.624,"No, we didn't concede that moving to the --"
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.624,1486.425,"Well, I think for the purpose of your motion to dismiss it."
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1487.163,1489.636,"Well, we filed a -- we filed a motion."
1962.368,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1520.506,1526.054,Suppose 14 (b) had never been adopted what would you say then?
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1526.054,1537.162,If 14 (b) had never been adopted again I would say in my judgment there would not been any doubt that appeal was completely preempted.
1962.368,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1537.162,1538.178,Why?
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1538.178,1538.684,Because –-
1962.368,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1538.684,1539.93,Preempted –-
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1539.93,1540.962,Yes the appeal would be --
1962.368,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1540.962,1547.949,What would you say about the legality of the agreement as far as federal law is concerned -- [Inaudible] had not been adopted –-
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1547.949,1550.681,It would appropriately lawful agreement.
1962.368,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1550.681,1551.691,[Inaudible]
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1551.691,1559.693,"Yes, if I understand your question whether or not an agreement for a service fee arrangement whether or not that that would have been --"
1962.368,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1559.693,1570.245,"If you are making service free arrangement with the employer that might be one thing, making a service fee employment for employee who do not belong your union might be another."
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1570.245,1576.664,"Well in case sir, we have a service fee arranged with the employer I --"
1962.368,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1576.664,1579.581,Which is to be paid by the employee who does not want to pay it?
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1579.581,1587.396,-- which should be paid employee sir in order to defray the cost of collective bargaining.
1962.368,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1658.558,1662.012,"Well, suppose you had a record here that told us [Inaudible]"
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1662.012,1662.522,Sorry sir.
1962.368,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1662.522,1673.613,"Suppose we had a record here and you told us we don't, showing that union revenues was spent for other purposes beside those that [Inaudible] to collective bargaining."
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1673.613,1684.201,"In that case sir there would be a surcharge, there would be a violation of a fiduciary relationship, violation of trust, the money could be recovered."
1962.368,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1690.34,1696.616,"You call this a, very carefully a service fee provision or a service fee arrangement all the way through."
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1719.61,1723.315,At this point I part to company with the Solicitor.
1962.368,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1899.583,1900.282,He can be.
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1900.282,1901.711,Yes sir.
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.205,1955.538,Mr. Lippman you said that there was nothing in the record indicating what the amount of these payments were to be?
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1955.538,1970.049,"No I said there was nothing in the record sir, I ought to say which in anyway raised the question of the reasonableness of the fee, that the only question which was raised is whether or not one penny could be obtained."
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.049,1986.329,But we are I suppose free to consider the allegations of the complaint which you didn't controvert in this respect as to -- that these payments would be equivalent to initiation fees and monthly dues.
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1986.329,1987.453,That's correct sir.
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1987.453,1991.346,And so we can accept those facts anyway.
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,1991.346,2005.703,"Yes sir you can accept those facts, but whether or not the initiation fees or the equivalent would be used for any other purpose, there you have -- there you must also be faced with the proposition --"
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2005.703,2013.579,"Well there's nothing in the record either way on that, whether the union spent -- they did or did not spend any money for other than collective bargaining."
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,2013.579,2023.873,"Yes you do have a record if my may say so sir, because the contract itself says it can only be used for the purpose of defraying costs in connection with collective bargaining."
1962.368,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2034.2,2036.826,That is the only way it can use to sue.
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,2054.495,2058.126,There is nothing in the record in that respect sir.
1962.368,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2058.126,2069.793,"Well you've asked us I understand it, to consider this record as if all union revenues, inclusive of the service fee revenues, are all used for collective proper bargaining purpose and nothing else."
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,2069.793,2071.984,That's right and surely.
1962.368,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2071.984,2073.969,"But there is nothing in the record to show that, is there?"
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,2073.969,2076.022,Well there is nothing in the record to show the contract.
1962.368,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2076.022,2078.759,"Well, we know the facts of life though."
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,2078.759,2096.585,"Well but we say though -- but we say so sir with respect to the particular sums collected as service fees; there, there is -- there if I that only leave one thought it is this; that, that money can only be used for collective bargaining purposes."
1962.368,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2096.585,2102.162,Well this means then that these people are paying a larger than their proportionate share of their collective bargaining expenses.
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,2102.162,2110.182,"No sir, it does not mean that, because if they were in that position, they would be in the same position that the Board was in the Holman case."
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.591,2152.368,[Inaudible] do establish that the member and the non-members in equivalent position insofar as his – the financial charge to him is concerned.
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,2152.368,2158.094,"Insofar as the charges concerned to him, but not as to the purpose for which the money could be used."
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.617,2174.954,"Well this may mean that this is even more burdensome than the union shop, I think?"
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,2174.954,2184.718,"I don't think so, because he is getting, he is paying -- he is paying only what he should pay as a member of the bargaining unit."
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.718,2188.596,"In any event, the same money comes out of the pocket of the member and the non-member."
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,2188.596,2189.573,"Well the same sum, but the purpose --"
1962.368,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.573,2190.68,"All right, that's all."
1962.368,0,41685,s_g_lippman,,2191.763,2195.61,"Yes, sir."
1962.368,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2195.61,2196.98,Mr. Weksler.
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,2196.98,2209.287,"Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please, in the course of this case which I have handled from the inception down in Miami, I have heard two startling propositions advanced by the union."
1962.368,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2628.71,2630.166,May I ask you a question?
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,2630.166,2631.276,Yes Mr. Justice.
1962.368,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2631.276,2661.51,"Let us assume as I understand your challenges, the challenges on the basis of this statement and everything else, let us assume they had provided in the contract that they must pay the cost of collective bargaining when they are representing it and they had figured out from last year [Inaudible] was so much that they would be required to pay that as a fee only for collective bargaining, what would you say to that?"
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,2661.51,2664.423,I would say sir that they cannot do that.
1962.368,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2664.97,2667.605,What would be the argument on that?
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,2667.605,2683.273,"The argument on that is the fact that the State has enacted a right-to-work law, which says if a person does not have to be a member of the union, and which would also mean that the person does not have to financially assist the union if that person does not wish to."
1962.368,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2768.927,2772.745,Does that have any relevance to the [Inaudible]
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,2772.745,2784.966,"No, it has a relevancy in this sense sir, only in the sense, and they talk about benefits that are being given by a contract and as a result that anybody who benefits by it should pay for it."
1962.368,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2795.008,2818.834,"It is your position that get the issues a little more confused than they have been, what was the -- you have a situation where its agreed that Congress has selected for its own purpose one reason, the majority of unions, if they are majority that represent all the employees as bargaining agents."
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,2840.268,2854.245,"Yes sir, under the National Labor Relations Act, because now is the only obligation that can be made upon an employee, is the obligation to pay periodic dues and initiation fees."
1962.368,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2929.915,2930.855,[Inaudible]
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,2930.855,2931.418,Yes sir.
1962.368,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2985.948,2990.165,"I'm pursuing this inquiry for this reason, there is a question of preemption."
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,2990.165,2992.178,Yes Mr. Justice.
1962.368,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2992.178,3014.885,"If you are wrong with reference to the fact that your argument, that such an agreement could be held valid under the National Labor Relations Act by the National Labor Relations Board, that would be a serious, more serious question here of preemption that you have assumed, would there not?"
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,3014.885,3021.92,"Yes sir, if the National Labor Relations Board would feel that this came within their jurisdiction that certainly would be a credit."
1962.368,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3021.92,3025.692,That is one of the questions raised.
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,3025.692,3030.438,"As far as we are concerned Your Honor, it has not been raised by the record."
1962.368,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3078.119,3090.076,[Inaudible] exhibits next to them show that the payments here were exactly the same as initiation fees and dues.
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,3090.076,3095.262,"Yes sir, I very gladly not even have to discuss anything relative to a service fee."
1962.368,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3095.262,3098.977,And a service fee might or might not be an entirely different case.
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,3098.977,3103.5,"That's right it is not -- and well, I certainly hope that it would not be necessary --"
1962.368,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3103.5,3113.357,"I mean the service fee where it was shown, where it was shown or whether it was not shown that this was for collective bargaining purposes only and it wasn't tantamount to membership."
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,3123.713,3124.355,Yes I would say this was an agency shop.
1962.368,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3124.355,3134.039,Therefore they come under the meaning of the word membership in 14(b).
1962.368,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3134.039,3136.667,My question is mainly this.
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,3167.532,3195.561,"Mr. Justice Black that raises a question in my mind because as you will recall the 1946, this Court in the case of AFL versus Watson pertaining to the same constitutional provision that we have here in the State of Florida, stated that it is up to the state, that the state Court must first interpret and construe its own constitutional provision, so I would humbly submit to this --"
1962.368,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3195.561,3197.149,"Well, I agree to that."
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,3213.126,3227.697,"Well it might come up Mr. Justice Black, but the question as to whether or not a service fee arrangement is embraced within the Florida, right to work provision and I believe that possibly under the construct --"
1962.368,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3227.697,3229.873,"Suppose it were, suppose it were."
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,3229.873,3230.982,"Yes, sir."
1962.368,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3230.982,3249.315,"Suppose Florida had attempted to forbid a service fee arrangement and suppose it would be held that under the National Labor Relations Act that power, the [Inaudible] of the kind is in the board, what would go with your Florida Act in that respect?"
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,3249.315,3265.273,I would say that the board would still have to ask the Florida Court or hold off until such time as the Florida Court has determined whether or not the service fee arrangement came within the proscription of the --
1962.368,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3265.273,3278.891,"Suppose It does, suppose it comes within the prescription of that -- proscription of that constitutional provision, but comes within the allowable limits of the jurisdiction of the board to approve it is right, what would you say there?"
1962.368,1,18155,bernard_b_weksler,,3278.891,3292.035,"I would say then that the board would go ahead and act and I would say also like Mr. Justice Stewart commented on the Indiana thing, that maybe the Indiana Court was wrong."
