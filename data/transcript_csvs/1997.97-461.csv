1997.97-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.42,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-461, Wisconsin Department of Corrections v. Schacht."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,15.343,19.212,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,93.176,95.628,"It was removed, in effect, by the State."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,95.628,104.132,--It was removed by the State and the employees of the State sued both personally and officially.
1997.97-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,104.132,105.066,Right.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,129.598,131.249,"Your Honor, there are--"
1997.97-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,131.249,135.253,"I mean, if you're right, I just don't see why the State didn't do it."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,136.919,141.156,--We return back to the decision on whether to remove.
1997.97-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,153.214,154.364,"Well, would you answer my question?"
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,154.364,154.58,I'm--
1997.97-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.58,156.166,Did the State waive its immunity?
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,156.166,157.116,--It did not waive its immunity.
1997.97-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.116,168.974,But your position is those claims against... the official capacity claims and the claims against the State cannot proceed under 1983 because the State isn't a person.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,168.974,170.759,That's correct.
1997.97-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.759,171.142,Okay.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,177.08,188.987,"We are now looking back, Your Honor, at... from the perspective of the Seventh Circuit decision at the initial removal decision."
1997.97-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.919,216.907,"And as to that you wanted it tried in Federal court, not State court."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,216.907,217.54,That's--
1997.97-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,217.54,219.941,So why not waive the Eleventh Amendment immunity?
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,219.941,223.143,"--Because that's not a price of admission to the Federal court, Your Honor."
1997.97-461,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,223.143,224.393,"Well, maybe it should be."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,236.451,252.126,"By joining with the officials sued personally in removing, which is required by the removal statutes, the State is not saying we want to be in... we don't want to be in court."
1997.97-461,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,255.112,256.447,"Well, you have to consent, as you indicate."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,263.134,271.374,"--Certainly it was a litigation decision by all of the defendants joining together, but the sovereign... the Eleventh Amendment is a defense."
1997.97-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,278.544,295.589,"Mr. Moriarty, I remember asking the counsel in the Chicago case that we heard, one thinks of Federal courts as being a place where you can get away from local prejudice and that sort of thing, but one would think that the State of Wisconsin would be perfectly happy to be in the State court."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,297.107,299.773,It isn't always the case in individual cases.
1997.97-461,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,315.866,320.437,"What difference does it make, so long as you're going to stand on the Eleventh Amendment?"
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,357.943,363.28,"--Answering the second question first, I do not concede that."
1997.97-461,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,389.014,414.562,"But then I don't understand, because what you're saying by your Eleventh Amendment plea, the Eleventh Amendment not applying in the State court whatever State immunity applies, that you cannot be sued any place, that you are just totally immune, because you do this, you go over to the Federal court and say, Federal court, you can't touch it because of the Eleventh Amendment and dismiss the case, and then no one can touch it."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,414.562,415.262,Right.
1997.97-461,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,425.353,426.837,But then you do this over and over again.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,434.959,440.53,"--We had here, however, claims under section 1983 that were barred in any court regardless."
1997.97-461,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,442.982,443.549,But that's a different issue.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,469.299,471.549,"--That's precisely what we were trying to do, Your Honor."
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,495.283,497.049,--So what... I'm not certain.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,498.318,498.635,Yes.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,498.635,511.209,"--don't understand the posture of this, but I thought that these... that the plaintiff has sued the State, i.e. the official capacity ones, and also a number of individuals, and then the whole case is removed to Federal court."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,511.209,511.693,Correct.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,511.693,514.16,"And everybody wins, the defendants won."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,514.16,514.794,Correct.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,514.794,515.445,All right.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,544.697,548.482,"It could be tried, certainly, in the State court."
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,549.115,551.184,I'm trying to find out what the issue is here.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,562.991,566.693,--I don't believe you're right.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,566.693,567.093,Good.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,568.895,584.905,"The issue that I see is the broader issue of what kind of a system are we going to have that is simple and effective for removal, that is simple and effective for determining jurisdictional questions, that is simple and effective for determining Eleventh Amendment immunity."
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,589.392,591.928,Maybe there's no way of straightening me out.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,594.578,595.212,--Fine.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,595.212,604.068,"I thought there are actions against the State and there are actions against people that aren't the State, and I thought the Seventh Circuit sent the whole kit and caboodle back to State court."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,604.068,604.685,It did.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,604.685,606.218,"Now, that's wrong, isn't it?"
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,606.218,607.103,It was wrong in doing that.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,607.103,607.537,All right.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,611.972,615.876,"As a matter of jurisdiction, yes."
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,615.876,616.259,Why?
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,616.259,618.578,"As a matter of discretion, it may not have been."
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,618.578,618.995,Ah.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,618.995,627.851,"They turned on jurisdiction and said, there was not removal jurisdiction at the threshold of this case."
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,627.851,629.717,"Right, so they should have used a different reason."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,644.075,644.375,Yes.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,646.31,647.512,So you're going to end up--
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,647.512,648.345,--as a matter of discretion.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,648.345,650.546,"--Yes, and so you're going to end up in the State court anyway."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,650.546,652.113,We might.
1997.97-461,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,664.688,666.021,Then you're changing the answer to the question.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,684.066,690.387,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, and it is precisely the point, and I thank you for tightening that."
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,704.763,708.015,"Well, may I interrupt you on that point?"
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,708.015,708.715,Yes.
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,708.715,712.602,It may be that there are two different jurisdictional issues involved here.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,760.983,773.124,"I don't believe it would fall within the 1447 issue because I do believe subject matter jurisdiction in 1447(c) goes to subject matter jurisdiction over the action, not over a particular claim."
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,776.492,779.443,"Well, is the... but isn't that a matter of semantics?"
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,797.405,806.428,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor, because claims within an action are not parceled out in that fashion."
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,806.928,820.068,"Well, you just agreed... I thought you just agreed with Justice Breyer that they could be parceled out in that fashion, because we can split the claims against the individuals, the individual responsibility claims from the Government claims, so you're parceling them out."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,820.068,823.722,"--When we get to the discretionary issue, far from the jurisdictional issue."
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,826.172,834.262,Why can it be parceled when the court is acting on the discretionary power but not be parceled when the court is considering whether it has a mandate?
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,834.262,850.707,"--Based on this Court's decisions that, for example, in City of Chicago the court had original... had Federal question jurisdiction over the entire action, over all the claims in the action because of the Federal claims."
1997.97-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,850.707,859.062,"But surely it's not your position, Mr. Moriarty, that the Eleventh Amendment is a bar to the claims against the individual defendants."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,859.062,859.595,Certainly not.
1997.97-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,859.595,864.431,"And those, then, would be litigated in the district court under a correct ruling?"
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,864.431,871.453,The... those claims... the district court had Federal question jurisdiction on removal.
1997.97-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,884.611,896.569,"But now, let's put the... the Eleventh Amendment immunity that you pleaded in your view requires dismissal of the action as against the State and the official capacity defendant."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,896.569,897.188,Correct.
1997.97-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.188,900.139,But it does not require dismissal as to the individual defendants.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,900.139,900.472,Correct.
1997.97-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,900.472,905.091,So the district court could properly adjudicate those claims.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,905.091,908.643,"The... certainly the individual capacity claims, yes."
1997.97-461,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,910.328,922.72,"May I ask this: under Wisconsin law, can the Attorney General, by his or her own determination, waive the Eleventh Amendment in Federal court?"
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,922.72,923.27,--No.
1997.97-461,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,934.444,939.432,So only the legislature can waive the Eleventh Amendment by special statute?
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,939.432,943.049,"--Right, either waive the Eleventh Amendment or sovereign immunity, correct."
1997.97-461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,943.049,944.335,Who do you--
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,958.559,960.611,I'm sorry if I misspoke.
1997.97-461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,964.28,964.547,"Ah, okay."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,978.473,978.973,Correct.
1997.97-461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,993.999,1003.938,"Well, isn't (c) relevant to the extent that it establishes the fact that the district judge could have sent back... could have remanded the claims against the State, the official capacity claims?"
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1003.938,1019.964,"I believe that the 1441(c) addresses an entirely different situation, and involves when there's a separable controversy, when there's not, that type of thing, whereas in this case it's clear we have one single controversy, the firing of the respondent."
1997.97-461,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1019.964,1033.686,"Yes, but we have a case, the Coville case which says that the statute does not preclude a remand that isn't covered by the precise... that these... the statute covers must remands."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1035.388,1053.618,"That's the central point I'm trying to make, that the... this decision by the Seventh Circuit was wrong because it looked at what must occur as a matter of threshold jurisdiction, mixed together the discretionary issues, mixed together the Eleventh Amendment immunity jurisdictional issues, and--"
1997.97-461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1053.618,1055.553,But may I just clarify one thing in your position?
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1064.124,1067.36,--I do not believe they should have remanded it.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1086.922,1088.191,Who do you represent?
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1088.191,1100.999,"We represent the Wisconsin agency, the officials in their official capacity, but the primary motivation on removal was the officials in their individual capacity."
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1100.999,1101.199,All right.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1102.099,1102.951,Absolutely.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1102.951,1103.451,Fine.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1127.749,1128.283,Right.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1128.283,1132.803,"--in a multiclaim suit, and they can't say you have to send them all back."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1136.005,1138.957,That is absolutely fundamental ground floor--
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1138.957,1139.357,Okay.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1167.726,1169.476,--With this variation.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1169.476,1170.26,Yes.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1170.26,1171.845,Eleventh Amendment can bar those claims.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1173.464,1173.914,It's unnecessary.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1175.68,1176.097,Exactly.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1176.097,1176.832,All right.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1176.832,1177.449,And the point is--
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1177.449,1182.118,"But your first argument is the main argument, and your second... I mean, and don't tell me I'm right if I'm not."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1186.788,1188.788,--I--
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1188.788,1191.923,"The first part is, they shouldn't have sent the whole thing back."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1191.923,1192.373,--Yes.
1997.97-461,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1192.373,1196.56,"The second part is, if we win on that one, they shouldn't have even sent the State part back."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1196.56,1197.01,Correct.
1997.97-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1197.01,1197.644,Okay.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1214.771,1231.983,"That would be the case except for this Court's decisions in Ngirainga v. Sanchez, in which it took up that definitional issue first, over the strenuous objections of the dissent, and that wanted the immunity issues addressed first in Ngiraingas."
1997.97-461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.983,1234.185,"Was this post-Steel Co., not--"
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1234.185,1234.819,It was not post-Steel--
1997.97-461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.469,1237.304,--Yes.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1239.837,1240.273,Indeed.
1997.97-461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.273,1243.975,"And I thought we said you address, unsurprisingly, jurisdictional issues first."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1243.975,1244.475,Correct.
1997.97-461,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1244.475,1256.515,"And in this one, if you take the words of the Constitution it says the judicial power of the United States shall not extend to any suit, so that sounds... there is no power over such a suit."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1263.352,1265.121,Which--
1997.97-461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.121,1267.323,"Well, it's the same question."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1267.323,1267.773,--Okay.
1997.97-461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.773,1269.056,You can answer... look at either one of us.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1270.192,1284.952,"In the Idaho case the Court looked at the words, in particular the word extends in Article III and looked at the word extends in the Eleventh Amendment and said, they seem similar, yes, it must be the same thing."
1997.97-461,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1295.307,1296.342,"Yes, because you could waive it."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1296.342,1297.309,We could waive it.
1997.97-461,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1297.309,1301.711,"We don't know whether it's that kind of bar until the State doesn't waive it, correct?"
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1301.711,1303.429,And also it is a defense.
1997.97-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1319.156,1335.134,"By failing to raise the Eleventh Amendment as a defense, the... it may not be the same thing as a waiver, where you expressly renounce reliance on it, but by, if you fail to raise the defense at any time during the proceedings, the proceedings stand."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1335.134,1336.6,--That's--
1997.97-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1336.6,1340.704,It's not like a case where there simply was no subject matter jurisdiction.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1340.704,1344.156,"--Absolutely correct, Chief Justice, and--"
1997.97-461,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1344.156,1345.356,Here you did raise it.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1345.356,1346.708,--We did raise it.
1997.97-461,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1354.262,1357.814,One part of this before you finish that I don't quite understand.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1376.477,1378.829,Because the removal decision must be made very promptly.
1997.97-461,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1390.637,1399.993,So you say... are you saying that the individuals would have been untimely if they didn't petition to remove until after the State was dismissed?
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1399.993,1402.279,Yes.
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1418.704,1421.906,"You made the right litigation decision, we'll assume."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1430.446,1436.416,Because the court had Federal question jurisdiction over all of the claims under--
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1436.416,1442.737,"But it no longer has... if the Eleventh Amendment issue is correct, it no longer would have subject matter jurisdiction."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1442.737,1446.558,"--Over one or two of the claims made in the case, but certainly--"
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1446.558,1449.676,"Oh, look, over the State and the official capacity defendants."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1453.377,1459.781,--We... it would have... no longer have subject matter jurisdiction over the claims made against the State.
1997.97-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1476.577,1477.293,"Yes, but these--"
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1482.981,1483.564,--Mm-hmm.
1997.97-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1483.564,1500.358,"And once the State in Federal court says, wait a minute, Eleventh Amendment as to State claims, then those claims could be remanded to the State court and you can go deal with it back in State court, leave the individual capacity claims in the Federal court."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1500.358,1501.208,Certainly--
1997.97-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1501.208,1503.458,Isn't that adequate?
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1505.243,1508.445,"--In this particular case, it's not going to make much difference."
1997.97-461,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1511.164,1513.682,You can go back to State court and make your pitch on person.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1513.682,1515.699,--And we'll prevail.
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1515.699,1517.218,And why shouldn't that be done?
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1517.218,1517.601,I know we'll--
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1517.601,1518.92,"In other words, why shouldn't it be done?"
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1518.92,1520.653,--Why shouldn't it be done?
1997.97-461,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1530.491,1531.643,Stand back from it--
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1554.591,1556.158,--I don't believe that's the result.
1997.97-461,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1564.047,1573.653,"But you're asking for Eleventh Amendment immunity, and as Justice Scalia has pointed out, at least after his recent decision that would come first, before you deal with the merits."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1573.653,1582.675,"--And if Eleventh Amendment immunity went to the jurisdiction of the court over an action, under Steel Company it would always have to be addressed first, always."
1997.97-461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1584.259,1586.294,"Would you say it's not jurisdiction, since it could be waived?"
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1588.663,1590.781,--I'm not... it is a jurisdictional issue.
1997.97-461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1592.748,1593.733,Mm-hmm.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1595.767,1596.934,It doesn't go to jurisdiction over the action.
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1598.518,1598.818,Over the person.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1598.818,1599.318,--particular claim.
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1599.318,1603.355,"No, but you're back... I mean, your argument now is back to saying, you cannot split them up."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1612.878,1615.313,"The... I don't believe it is, Your Honor."
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1615.313,1616.613,Then I don't understand.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1616.613,1619.182,Jurisdiction over the action is the first question.
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1648.384,1661.461,"Right, and this is unlike City of Chicago because once the Eleventh Amendment issue is raised, you don't have... the Federal court does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the State and the official capacity claims, so Chicago doesn't cover this."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1661.461,1662.411,It does not.
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1662.411,1668.698,"And you're saying, if I understand you, that with respect to the State and the official capacity claims, it was error to remand."
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1670.181,1678.72,"It was error to remand because the Seventh Circuit did it on a basis of lack of original jurisdiction, lack of removal jurisdiction."
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1678.72,1679.838,All right.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1688.778,1689.978,Under 1447(c)?
1997.97-461,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1689.978,1690.311,Yes.
1997.97-461,0,40014,richard_briles_moriarty,,1690.311,1695.348,"That replies again, as I read the cases, to jurisdiction over the action."
1997.97-461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1702.019,1703.638,"Thank you, Mr. Moriarty."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,1706.24,1708.573,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1729.438,1739.96,"Well, why couldn't the Federal court retain the action and decide the individual capacity claims, remand the claims against the State, and there you are?"
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,1739.96,1741.246,I don't think--
1997.97-461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1741.246,1741.762,What's the matter with that?
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,1741.762,1749.916,"--I think the problem with that, Justice O'Connor, is that it doesn't pay respect to the statutes enacted by Congress that govern this matter."
1997.97-461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1749.916,1768.813,"Well, I think it does entirely, and the case was removable in the first instance, but once the Eleventh Amendment defense is asserted, then the Federal court can remand so much of the case as deals with the Eleventh Amendment claims and keep the rest."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,1768.813,1769.713,"Your Honor, I--"
1997.97-461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1769.713,1774.883,I thought that was where the Seventh Circuit's decision appears questionable.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,1774.883,1780.204,"--Well, Your Honor, I do not agree that the case was properly removed to begin with."
1997.97-461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1795.364,1796.697,"Well, I think it fits."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,1816.674,1827.466,--I believe that it could have been filed there only to give the Federal court jurisdiction to determine that it lacked jurisdiction because of the Eleventh Amendment problem extant in the case as originally filed.
1997.97-461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1843.641,1845.427,"Well, that's where I disagree."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,1850.247,1873.178,"Well, Your Honor, I would say that Justice Ginsburg was correct in saying that what the State should have done in this situation, or which would have been the simple way out of the woods for this difficult problem that's presented here, would have been for them to move to dismiss the claims that were supposedly improper claims which were the only claims that presented the Eleventh Amendment problem."
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1877.999,1887.754,"Yes, but I think Mr. Moriarty pointed out that the individuals might have been told you're too late to remove, because the case was removable earlier."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,1887.754,1902.514,"--Perhaps that would be true, Justice Ginsburg, prior to the decision in this case, but this Court will now reach a decision which will speak to all lawyers and judges and clarify this difficult situation where we have Federal claims that are Eleventh Amendment-barred."
1997.97-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1902.514,1915.238,"Is it your position that the State could have moved, or the Circuit Court of Dane County, they could have moved in that court to dismiss claims that would have been barred by the Eleventh Amendment in Federal court?"
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,1915.238,1915.822,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1915.822,1918.274,Certainly not on the grounds of the Eleventh Amendment.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,1918.274,1919.89,"No, on--"
1997.97-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1919.89,1920.726,That's not binding on the State--
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,1920.726,1930.847,"--On the grounds of their argument that we failed to state a claim under section 1983, but once they had established that we'd failed to state a claim against the State, or the State defendants in their official capacities, they could have removed."
1997.97-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1930.847,1935.901,--But that's saying that you have to do what litigating you can in the State court.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,1938.603,1940.972,"I believe it's exactly what Congress intended, Your Honor."
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1945.924,1947.543,"It couldn't have been so clear, because you missed it."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,1953.113,1960.184,"That's true, Your Honor, and I'm quite an expert on the Eleventh Amendment since the cert petition was granted, but I can't say that I was beforehand."
1997.97-461,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1960.184,1961.251,I don't understand.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,1985.334,1985.968,Yes.
1997.97-461,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1985.968,1994.44,"I would have thought... is there any law, any case, anything that says that I can't bring that lawsuit in a Federal district court?"
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2015.937,2018.639,"Well, now that I've become an expert on that Eleventh Amendment, I do--"
1997.97-461,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2018.639,2019.089,Forgetting... yes.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2019.672,2024.126,--I do believe that the case you cite should not be accepted in the Federal court.
1997.97-461,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2024.126,2028.578,"Now, is there any precedent anywhere where a judge didn't accept such a case?"
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2028.578,2031.28,"I think this would have to become the case, Your Honor."
1997.97-461,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2031.28,2039.053,"So as far as we know, no; this would be historical to say that they can't have cases like that in Federal district court, and your reason for saying that is?"
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2039.053,2049.074,"My reason for saying that is that the Eleventh Amendment, Your Honor, is in the Constitution at all times, and it is in the nature of a jurisdiction bar, as this Court said in--"
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2049.074,2058.179,"But Mr. Lasker, what about the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which says that you can add and drop parties any time, so you were wrong about naming a State or a State officer."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2060.63,2071.654,"--If that party is dropped out, then the bar to Federal jurisdiction would be gone, and then under 1446(b) it could be removed to Federal court."
1997.97-461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2072.856,2078.058,"--Well, Mr. Lasker, I thought City of Chicago was relevant in one respect in this case."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2100.173,2100.673,--Thank you--
1997.97-461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2100.673,2101.373,--on that point.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2101.373,2112.981,"--Thank you, because I really think that it's important to underscore that City of Chicago involved State claims that were attached under the Court's pendant or supplemental jurisdiction."
1997.97-461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2112.981,2119.968,It did not involve claims which would be potentially subject to an Eleventh Amendment immunity defense.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2119.968,2120.401,Correct.
1997.97-461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2120.401,2121.168,It did not.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2130.324,2144.333,"Well, Your Honor, the difference between State claims, State law claims and Federal claims that may be barred under the Eleventh Amendment is a distinction that I think is important here, and... but certainly--"
1997.97-461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2144.333,2151.237,But you deal with it by remanding the claims in which the Eleventh Amendment would cover it and go on with what's left.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2151.237,2159.343,"--That does not pay homage, Your Honor, to the language of 1447(c), which says that when the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction the case shall be remanded."
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2162.628,2167.246,That's... on reading that... that that's all.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2195.516,2206.656,"--But this contains claims of Federal law, Justice Ginsburg, some of which may not be brought in Federal court but all of which may be brought in State court, and--"
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2206.656,2209.123,"Yes, but there's no exclusive venue."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2216.795,2223.433,--The... I guess I--
1997.97-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2223.433,2227.82,"You can bring a 1983 action in State court, can you not?"
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2227.82,2233.307,"--Of course, yes, and this entire action was properly brought in State court."
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2233.307,2244.513,"Yes, but defendants in 1983 actions can remove them to Federal court, as defendants in FELA cases could not, because there Congress says, not only can you bring it in State court, but it can't be removed if you bring it there."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2244.513,2269.146,"Your Honor, I think what I'm recommending to this Court is that you announce a doctrine in handling this case that is true to the unambiguous language of the statutes, that is... that honors the principles of Federalism under the Eleventh Amendment and Article III, and that applies a doctrine that is efficient and simple to understand for lawyers and judges, and that, I submit to you, is exactly what the Seventh Circuit did in this case."
1997.97-461,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2269.146,2276.05,And I take it that as part of this clarification you are going to stick with your answer that you gave to Justice Breyer.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2326.817,2328.851,"Well, I think--"
1997.97-461,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2328.851,2331.22,That is... you have absolutely no authority for that proposition.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2331.22,2337.54,"--I don't have a case to cite for that proposition, and this case does not raise those facts, of course, but--"
1997.97-461,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2337.54,2339.54,And the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are against you.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2339.54,2362.24,"--Your Honor, the fact is that we're dealing here with a hybrid type of case that is not... has not been addressed foursquare before in any situation that I'm aware of, and that is a case where you have Federal claims that are not barred by the Eleventh Amendment coupled with Federal claims that are barred by the--"
1997.97-461,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2362.24,2364.256,"Well, but these cases happen all the time... all the time."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2368.894,2381.202,"--Your Honor, I believe that on behalf of my client I had a right as the plaintiff's counsel to file this case in State court, which is how this question comes here from the Seventh Circuit, and--"
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2381.202,2385.236,"I can understand that part of it, and that's what this case is."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2410.471,2415.006,--Because I don't think that Congress intended to bifurcate the litigation in that fashion.
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2416.375,2418.493,Forget removal.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2418.493,2419.227,--All right.
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2419.227,2423.545,We're in Federal court with a complaint that includes the State and individuals.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2423.545,2424.23,Yes.
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2424.23,2432.05,And there is a motion to dismiss the State on Eleventh Amendment grounds.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2446.327,2449.779,"I suppose the answer to that question would be yes, and that does--"
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2449.779,2450.729,Yes.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2450.729,2477.365,"--then draw the importance of the fact that this case arises out of my choice to sue in State court and then the defendant's procedural maneuver that was disapproved of in this case and that was of concern to the Seventh Circuit in Frances J., that the defendants remove a case of that sort from State court to Federal court really for the purpose of separating the prospective relief claims from the--"
1997.97-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2477.365,2486.019,"Well then, your argument should address why it should be different on removal than it would have been if the case were originally filed in Federal court, and--"
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2486.019,2486.637,--Okay.
1997.97-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2486.637,2487.837,--perhaps pointing to some statutory language.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2487.837,2488.804,Well--
1997.97-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2488.804,2509.633,"Some statutory language that somehow overrules the extant statutory language that says that any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction may be removed, so we need a statute that somehow undoes that, but you've conceded it could have been brought in the United States district court."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2509.633,2515.169,"--Well, the statute that disposes of this case is 1447(c)."
1997.97-461,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.169,2525.393,"It's critical to your position, as I understand it, that if there is an Eleventh Amendment defense potentially available to one of the defendants, that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2525.393,2526.877,"That's my position, Justice Stevens."
1997.97-461,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2526.877,2528.095,And that we have not yet held.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2528.095,2529.162,That's correct.
1997.97-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2529.162,2538.201,"And that would be true in an original filing under Federal... in Federal court, surely, just as true as if the action were removed from State court."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2538.201,2545.141,"I believe it would, but I think that that would deal with the kind of case that we've got here in the most efficient way--"
1997.97-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.141,2546.924,"You're changing your answer, then."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2566.737,2589.919,"--I do assert that it should not have been accepted under the court's original jurisdiction, and I say that whether I'm right about that or not, Justice Scalia, certainly when the State asserted its Eleventh Amendment defenses in Federal court, then clearly under 1447(c) the Federal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and was right to send the entire case back, not just the--"
1997.97-461,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2589.919,2592.787,"All right, can I say... I'm trying to find some authority for you."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2632.579,2634.745,"--No, not that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
1997.97-461,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2634.745,2634.945,All right.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2645.387,2648.255,"No, there isn't, but--"
1997.97-461,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2648.255,2650.189,Then I think you're on a tough ground.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2650.189,2656.61,"--That's... my answer to you is correct, but I again have to ask you not to hang me on my answer to that question--"
1997.97-461,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2656.61,2659.229,"No, no, I wouldn't because I mean, you say, well, this will be quite simple."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2691.166,2694.384,"--No, it doesn't seem to be, Your Honor, so that's the situation we're stuck with."
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2694.384,2702.473,"Mr. Lasker, you have a statement in your brief that the State was not immune from suit in State court."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2707.093,2714.881,"Well, it... there is a sovereign immunity statute in the State court for State claims."
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2717.649,2731.723,"--On the top of page 9 you say that the Seventh Circuit held the district court lacked original jurisdiction because petitioners were immune from suit in the Federal court, and then you add, although they were not immune from suit in the State court."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2734.156,2734.523,--That's what I was referring to.
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2734.523,2737.508,"--most States have their own sovereign immunity doctrine, don't they?"
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2737.508,2756.088,"They do, but I was... but the State immunity is, I believe, abrogated by section 1983, although a State is not a person under section 1983 since Will."
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2769.562,2778.002,There isn't something like a Wisconsin tort claims act that would allow a wrongful discharge case to be brought against the State?
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2778.002,2788.643,"I do have a theory, Your Honor, that I seek to assert in the State court upon remand, that we do have a claim under the Wisconsin constitution that would not be barred by the State doctrine of sovereign immunity."
1997.97-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2788.643,2794.296,Is your... are the circuit courts in Wisconsin courts of general jurisdiction?
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2794.296,2795.179,"Yes, sir."
1997.97-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2795.179,2799.598,Where you don't have limitations of subject matter the way you do in the Federal court?
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2799.598,2800.083,That's correct.
1997.97-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2800.083,2815.043,"Mr. Lasker, what prevents us from holding that when a State removes or consents to removal of a case into Federal court it waives its Eleventh Amendment objection?"
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2815.043,2819.579,I just... I don't know that anything stands in the way of that except stare decisis.
1997.97-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2836.79,2842.36,"Well, I mean, isn't it clear that when you say, I want to be in Federal court, you mean I want to be in Federal court?"
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2842.36,2849.098,"Well, it would seem clear to me, Your Honor, but I don't think that that's ever been considered to be a proper waiver of the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity."
1997.97-461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2849.098,2853.168,We wouldn't have any of these troubles if that were the rule.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2853.168,2854.885,Perhaps not.
1997.97-461,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2854.885,2867.143,"If it were, then maybe Mr. Moriarty could not have removed the case, because he said that under State law they have no authority, the State AG has no authority to waive the Eleventh Amendment."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2867.143,2870.012,I'm not an authority on that.
1997.97-461,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2870.547,2885.489,"It follows from that, doesn't it, that if that's true, then it was clear even before the removal, because of the State law situation, that there would never have been jurisdiction in the Federal court over part of the case, because the... because it's foreordained that it's not optional, as your opponent suggests, that they may or may not waive it."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2897.697,2900.566,--I'd say that--
1997.97-461,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2900.566,2901.666,You don't know which side I'm on here.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2901.666,2902.766,"--Well, I do say that--"
1997.97-461,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2902.766,2903.735,It seems to--
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2903.735,2909.922,--that the case should not have been accepted into Federal court until the State court--
1997.97-461,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.922,2911.105,--Yes.
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2911.105,2912.874,--had sorted out the claims--
1997.97-461,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2912.874,2926.281,"Because as a matter of Wisconsin law, it's clear that the Federal court never had... could have taken jurisdiction of the claim against the State, as a matter of Wisconsin law, which they would have to honor, that they could not waive the Eleventh Amendment defense."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2926.281,2931.335,"--Well, I don't know that Wisconsin law is as Mr. Moriarty asserts."
1997.97-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2940.441,2950.13,"Of course, the Federal court would have had jurisdiction if the State had simply processed its removal and made no objection on Eleventh Amendment grounds."
1997.97-461,1,21141,david_e_lasker,,2957.902,2964.739,I think that's at least clear in determining the application of 1447(c) to the facts in this case.
1997.97-461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2993.724,2995.057,"Thank you, Mr. Lasker."
