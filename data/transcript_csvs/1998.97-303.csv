1998.97-303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.009,We'll hear argument next in Number 97-303... spectators are cautioned to remain quiet until you leave the courtroom.
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,60.171,63.442,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,191.997,201.844,"Well, how do you say we should look at the level of conflict between Federal and State law to determine impairment?"
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,217.995,231.484,Whether a remedy is supplemental of a State scheme or impairment of a State scheme depends upon the answer to the question of whether we take seriously the decision of the State legislature to limit remedies.
1998.97-303,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,256.569,262.375,But I thought the law didn't commute punitive damages which have no lid and could be higher than treble damages.
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,262.375,270.33,"--But the limit on punitive damages, which is critical to this issue, is that punitive damages, are not allowed where they impair the solvency of the defendant."
1998.97-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,294.265,314.338,"Well, I can understand if Nevada had passed some statutory provision in expressing its intent that its State remedies be exclusive, that this would be an impairment, but absent that, it isn't so clear to me that allowing the Federal remedy is an impairment."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,314.338,321.343,But why do we put the burden on the State of Nevada to adopt the hypothetical preamble I came up with a moment before?
1998.97-303,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,328.777,334.16,"Well, it doesn't have to, but when it's enacting its own laws it can certainly make it clear."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,336.894,341.366,"--Well, what are we to have the district courts do in applying Federal law in this instance?"
1998.97-303,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,357.775,359.888,"Well, the obvious thing would be much simpler."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,383.434,383.834,--Absolutely.
1998.97-303,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,383.834,404.879,"So Congress simply says, look all these laws out there that we've passed, general laws affecting interstate commerce, all right, they don't preempt State insurance laws unless we specifically said so by directing limited insurance, end of the matter, period, and the only purpose that the word impair is doing there is that sometimes you could in effect impair... sorry."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,428.924,458.885,"Well, it is perfectly plain from the debates and the enactment of the McCarran Ferguson Act that Congress was, as you've just suggested, Justice Breyer, extremely concerned about inadvertent interference with the State regulation of the business of insurance, and it's for that reason that Congress placed upon itself the burden of saying when congressional legislation would apply, the reference in the McCarran Ferguson Act to no act of Congress except that specifically related to the business of insurance."
1998.97-303,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,464.608,465.799,It couldn't have said when it would apply.
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,483.842,498.952,"--When... Federal law applies where the Federal rule of decision results in a different answer from the State rule of decision with respect to the business of insurance, the relationship between an insurance company and its insureds."
1998.97-303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,556.919,565.206,"Mr. Colbert, what is your authority for saying that Nevada does not allow punitive damages where they would threaten the solvency of the insurance company?"
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,565.206,576.543,"The Nevada law, Your Honor, I believe is referenced in one of the amicus briefs, and I'm sorry I don't have the citation at my finger tips."
1998.97-303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,576.543,578.163,Is it a case from the Nevada supreme court?
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,578.163,583.516,It is a case I believe from the... I believe it is from the Nevada supreme court.
1998.97-303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,587.029,588.331,It isn't in your brief?
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,588.331,589.801,"--It is not in our brief, Your Honor."
1998.97-303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,605.262,605.442,Well--
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,605.442,606.043,--that's not before the Court.
1998.97-303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,606.043,608.524,--we'll struggle even harder if we can't find the case.
1998.97-303,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,608.795,616.699,"As far as your brief presentation is concerned, the Nevada punitive damage provision has no cap and that's it."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,633.071,633.672,That is correct.
1998.97-303,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,637.375,641.967,And your position about the... you keep saying Nevada doesn't have to prove this or that.
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,660.048,675.049,"Well, it does not surprise me that the executive branch of the State wishes to have available to it all of the possible remedies and weapons that it can use to carry out the executive policy."
1998.97-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,676.561,680.625,Some insurance commissioners would like to have stronger State insurance regulation laws.
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,680.625,683.406,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia, and they haven't been able to get them."
1998.97-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,703.178,709.432,"Yes, but your argument, it seems to me, on impair talks about impairing the business of the insurance companies, not impairing any law."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,717.87,718.83,--That is correct.
1998.97-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,718.83,721.721,And what law enacted by Nevada was impaired by this?
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,721.721,744.437,"It's Nevada Code section 686A, Chapter 686A of the Nevada revised statutes, most specifically sections.310 of that particular chapter, which enumerates various acts which are rendered unlawful under Nevada insurance law and provides a--"
1998.97-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,744.437,749.49,And are those laws still rendered unlawful notwithstanding the application of RICO?
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,749.49,750.341,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,750.341,751.133,"Well then, how are they impaired?"
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,751.133,760.699,"Because Nevada elected not to provide an enhanced damage remedy for violation of those provisions, whereas the parallel substantive--"
1998.97-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,760.699,768.674,"No, but the remedies provided in those provisions may be enforced to the letter as far as the Nevada legislature is authorized."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,768.674,770.507,--Yes.
1998.97-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,770.507,781.853,"The... in other words, the Nevada laws can be fully enforced, notwithstanding the enforcement of RICO, and that's... for that reason it's hard for me to see how those laws have been impaired."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,781.853,798.123,"Well, I return to the question, suppose the preamble to the private remedy contained in that same statute expressly recognized the possibility of enhanced damage and stated the decision of the Nevada legislature to provide only compensatory damages, not enhanced damages."
1998.97-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.146,814.004,"No, but even if it did, and they'd say for that reason we've decided there's going to be a cap on all State law causes of action, you may still enforce the State law cause of action 100 percent, and therefore, how is it impaired?"
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,814.004,820.679,Because you have made the decision of the Nevada legislature to limit damages in that fashion an idle act.
1998.97-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.931,824.329,"No, it's not an idle act."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,833.526,843.443,"--But keep in mind, Justice Stevens, that the principal goal of insurance regulation in this State and every other State is the protection of the solvency of the carrier."
1998.97-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.443,844.304,"Oh, I'm not sure that's right."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,849.449,858.165,"Oh, no, I don't mean to overstate it, but it clearly is the principal aim of all State insurance legislation, because that is how you protect policyholders."
1998.97-303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,923.317,923.788,"Well, what--"
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,923.788,924.629,Yes.
1998.97-303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,924.629,941.189,"--Mr. Colbert, what if a Nevada trial judge had before him a case like this and the insurance company says, well, the recovery... we don't want you to charge on punitive damages because the recovery might threaten our solvency."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,946.602,964.684,"Well, the traditional analysis, Your Honor, is to examine the amount of the jury's award, or I suppose if you get a bench trial award as well, and to compare that with the net worth of the company to ascertain whether payment of those sums would significantly impair the net worth of the company."
1998.97-303,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,967.686,974.562,"If that's so, that's what... the kind of thing that convinces me that impair can't mean impair, or it must mean something quite weak."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1020.161,1030.298,"I don't believe, Justice Breyer, that I have argued, nor can you read the McCarran Ferguson Act to go so far as to say it was an intention by Congress to yield the Federal taxing--"
1998.97-303,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1030.298,1031.169,But why not?
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1037.079,1041.454,--Because the imposition of the Federal tax has no effect upon the collection of the State tax.
1998.97-303,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1041.454,1042.886,"Oh, yes, they find it does."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1072.125,1101.974,"But I see a distinction, if I may, between the State indicating it wishes to collect its tax and a State making a decision that the remedy that will be afforded to a private litigant will be limited to that which makes the litigant whole and provides no more for the litigant, no enhanced damages, out of the view that after all, all of these litigants... at least all the ones we're talking about here... are policyholders."
1998.97-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1169.208,1179.895,"Yes, well, I'm... you know, I'm not sure you're really urging a different test from the test that your opponents argue, the way you describe it."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1196.494,1202.639,"--Not as you have used the word conflict, Justice Scalia, but I'm afraid that we can get ourselves lost in semantics."
1998.97-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.594,1211.985,You can't comply with one law and comply with the other at the same--
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1211.985,1212.155,--Exactly.
1998.97-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.155,1212.666,--Well--
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1212.666,1224.033,"And if we use conflict itself in the more common parlance mat that we use... that I've just used since I've been speaking with Justice Breyer, then conflict is a perfectly good word."
1998.97-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1224.884,1229.038,"--You're content to have that as the test, whether you conflict with the policy of the State?"
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1229.038,1229.616,--That is correct.
1998.97-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1229.616,1230.076,Okay.
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1230.076,1251.031,"And I suggest that you find the policy of the State only by looking, as the McCarran Ferguson Act directs us to, look at the laws of the State enacted for the purpose of regulating insurance, and ask yourself if the laws of the State are materially different than the otherwise parallel Federal law, because--"
1998.97-303,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1251.031,1263.029,"You're not saying there's any difference in substance, so does your whole case... do I understand correctly that your whole case turns on the treble damage feature of the Federal law, which you say is absent on the State side?"
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1263.029,1263.539,--It doesn't--
1998.97-303,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1263.539,1265.059,No difference in substantive provisions?
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1265.059,1267.37,"--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.97-303,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1267.37,1280.75,And then if you're not right about the punitive damages... suppose we don't have this case that says we won't make the company insolvent.
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1289.687,1300.834,"There is, and the reason is that in punitive damage instance the trial judge always has the discretion to reduce the punitive damage award."
1998.97-303,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1347.547,1355.452,So that RICO would be incompatible with any State law that didn't provide for treble damages.
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1355.452,1364.836,"Any State insurance law that didn't provide for treble damages, that is correct, and I said the treble damage provision in this case... because that's what we have."
1998.97-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.507,1385.282,Are there other more general Nevada laws that could apply to insurance fraud?
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1385.282,1392.805,Nevada recognizes a common law cause of action for bad faith failure to provide benefit.
1998.97-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1392.805,1399.259,And is that... is the application of that law somehow limited by the special provision governing insurers?
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1399.259,1408.255,"No, because the Nevada... Nevada insurance legislation does not purport to supplant other Nevada State law."
1998.97-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1444.372,1463.413,"I understand that, but whether you're contravening some policy set forth in the State insurance law in particular is affected by whether that State insurance law is hermetically sealed, or whether in fact the insurance company is subject to a lot of other State laws anyway."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1463.413,1485.859,"--Well, in this instance, although I do not believe that it is dispositive of the question, in this instance, as the district court noted below, Nevada does have a little RICO, and the predicate acts listed in Nevada's little RICO do not include violation of the provisions of the Nevada insurance law that are implicated by the conduct alleged."
1998.97-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1502.138,1508.814,What about violation by the insurance company of that... the common law fraud provision?
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1508.814,1510.304,--Of the--
1998.97-303,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.304,1511.976,Would that come under the little RICO?
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1511.976,1513.178,"--No, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1522.002,1522.723,Let me give you another--
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1522.723,1523.113,--of the insurance law that are implicated--
1998.97-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.113,1534.611,"--Supposing your Federal statute authorizes a remedy for a RICO fraud that you can seize the assets of the company that have been used to perpetrate the fraud, but the Nevada statute does not have that remedy in it."
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1536.614,1536.874,--No.
1998.97-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.874,1537.625,You could not.
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1537.625,1538.395,I think that would be a more extreme example.
1998.97-303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1538.395,1538.915,Yes.
1998.97-303,0,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,1538.915,1540.645,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve the rest of my time?"
1998.97-303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.645,1542.187,"Yes, thank you, Mr. Colbert."
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1571.236,1574.729,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1656.972,1659.213,I didn't get that last point.
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1659.213,1659.664,--The--
1998.97-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1659.664,1667.19,The punitive damages exception for driving someone into insolvency does not apply to--
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1667.19,1669.061,"--No, Your Honor."
1998.97-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1685.47,1685.961,--Okay.
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1685.961,1688.322,That limitation has an exception to it.
1998.97-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1728.88,1733.842,"Well, do insurance companies go into ordinary bankruptcy if there's an insolvency proceeding under State law?"
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1733.842,1738.176,"Mr. Chief Justice, that is in fact my next point."
1998.97-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.246,1777.9,"Well, his point would be you would need a bigger insolvency fund, which means you would need higher premiums, and his point would be that the legislature has carefully calculated what a good level of premiums is, and it doesn't include the level necessary to pump up the insolvency fund enough to cover treble damages."
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1777.9,1785.487,"I hesitate to opine on insurance law generally, but my understanding of many of the insolvency funds is, they're not real funds."
1998.97-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.99,1852.291,"Through settlement, you mean?"
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1852.291,1852.621,--Pardon?
1998.97-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.621,1855.202,"You have treble damages, you can get a settlement that makes you whole?"
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1855.202,1865.968,"Yes, and if you don't have triple damages, what you end up is some discount of actual damages, so actual damages, a lot of... like a lot of phrases in the law, actual doesn't really mean actual."
1998.97-303,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1879.398,1889.824,Is it common ground here among the parties that we do have before us a State law that's for the business of regulating... for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance?
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1889.824,1890.165,--Yes.
1998.97-303,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1890.165,1896.79,And that is the Nevada law which prohibits the insurance companies to defraud their policyholders?
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1896.79,1897.29,Yes.
1998.97-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2033.78,2036.492,"I don't know that I agree with you, Mr. Blakey, on that."
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2046.799,2056.694,"--But in that case, since impair is met at a lesser stage, every time where you've had a supersession, every time when you've had an invalidation, you'd also have an impairment."
1998.97-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2073.668,2076.319,Are you saying that each word means something different?
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2076.319,2079.19,"Well, there's a connotation that's different."
1998.97-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2079.19,2080.719,"Well, could you answer the question?"
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2080.719,2089.284,"The answer, as I understand the question, is, my position is that impairment would take place in all three situations."
1998.97-303,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2106.178,2110.071,"Yes, but you're explaining his view, and I think the Chief Justice asked you what is your view."
1998.97-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2110.071,2110.299,"Yes, I asked your view."
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2110.299,2113.073,"--Oh, my view... I'm sorry, Justice Stevenson."
1998.97-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2121.217,2125.14,"And does each word, each of those three verbs have a separate meaning, do you think?"
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2125.14,2125.531,Yes.
1998.97-303,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2177.374,2187.531,"I'm still a little puzzled, because is it... are you suggesting that a law could invalidate a State law without impairing it?"
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2187.531,2187.851,No.
1998.97-303,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2202.601,2204.735,"It still seems to me under your reading it is, too."
1998.97-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.735,2205.823,The same with yours.
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2205.823,2206.344,No.
1998.97-303,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2206.995,2215.751,"Can you give me an example, under your reading, of a law that would impair the State law without invalidating or superseding it?"
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2215.751,2216.432,--Okay.
1998.97-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2261.81,2269.826,"Then Mr. Blakey, when you say he, Humana I guess is a corporation, and your opposing counsel, is that who you're referring to?"
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2269.826,2270.197,Yes.
1998.97-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2270.197,2272.938,I think it might be better to refer to him as counsel.
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2272.938,2273.169,Okay.
1998.97-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2304.82,2310.221,"Mr. Blakey, my suggestion was that you refer either to the petitioner or--"
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2310.221,2310.612,--I apologize.
1998.97-303,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2338.162,2341.362,--What... I'm having trouble what it does mean.
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2369.271,2372.053,"Well, this Court's teaching... yes and no."
1998.97-303,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2372.053,2377.569,"If the answer to that's yes, then all it says is, if the Federal law would preempt a State law, it doesn't."
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2377.569,2387.554,"Well, preemption in this Court... well, I'm uncomfortable with the word preemption, because that's a Whig's view of history, to read back into a 1945 statute preemption jurisprudence."
1998.97-303,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2417.795,2421.988,"Oh, but that's exactly now the point, because conflict can take place in one of two ways."
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2447.643,2457.341,"--With all due respect, Justice Breyer, I think this Court ought to spend its time interpreting Federal law and not get into a quagmire of State law, and this is not only a quagmire of State law, it's a quagmire of--"
1998.97-303,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2457.341,2459.151,"Your answer is the first, not the second."
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2459.151,2460.032,"--Actually, it's both."
1998.97-303,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.686,2495.015,"Before you go on, Mr. Blakey, I wasn't aware that conflict preemption in the Federal scheme... you know, you mentioned the three types, field, and so forth."
1998.97-303,1,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2508.483,2518.09,"Well, in National Securities, this Court held that impair in the McCarran Ferguson Act meant only direct impair, and saw it in terms of this kind of, you can't do both."
1998.97-303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2655.81,2658.171,"Thank you, Mr. Blakey."
1998.97-303,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2659.403,2670.282,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-303,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2723.723,2727.797,You emphasized the word law when you read that.
1998.97-303,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2733.091,2738.446,Perhaps common law would be included.
1998.97-303,3,29798,james_w_colbert_iii,,3275.352,3278.445,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-303,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3491.557,3493.167,"Thank you, Mr. Colbert."
