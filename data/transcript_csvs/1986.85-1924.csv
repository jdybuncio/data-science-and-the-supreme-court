1986.85-1924,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.022,"We will hear argument first this afternoon in 85-1924, National Labor Relations Board versus IBEW."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,12.308,14.76,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1924,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,378.827,381.863,"In ABC there was a strike situation, wasn't there?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,381.863,386.415,"ABC... the fines in ABC arose in the midst of a strike, that's correct."
1986.85-1924,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,386.415,387.35,And there was none here?
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,387.35,392.484,There had been a strike.
1986.85-1924,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,398.305,403.942,"Mr. Ganzfried, Section 8(b)(1)(A)--"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,403.942,404.728,Yes.
1986.85-1924,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,404.728,416.35,"--Saves out a union's right to impose discipline on its members, and you read this subsection (B) as an exception to that, some way?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,416.35,421.404,"Well, the proviso in subsection (A) is not part of subsection (B)."
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.411,464.35,Preservation of it by providing him with a larger pool of people from among whom to select?
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,464.35,472.187,Specifically protecting him from restraint or coercion in making his selection.
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.187,475.455,How is he being coerced?
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,493.286,497.654,"Well, this case is not to present a question of a pool."
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.959,532.911,"Is that crucial, that they already had the jobs as supervisors?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,545.735,548.051,It could well be.
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,549.687,551.17,Please don't tell me that's not this case.
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,554.59,559.292,--If what the union did constituted restraint or coercion.
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.292,562.177,To be sure.
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,578.456,589.062,"In the absence of any... simply a statement, a precatory statement by the union--"
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.062,590.312,"No, no, not precatory."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,591.412,592.764,--Then it would be a violation.
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,592.764,593.597,Okay.
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,593.597,599.751,In ABC the Court referred to two potential effects.
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.267,603.619,You are coercing the employer by limiting the pool from which he can select.
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,603.619,605.988,--That's right.
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,605.988,607.488,That's a mild form of--
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,607.488,633.638,"This Court did say in ABC that either of the two effects that I described, that is, the willingness to serve or the manner in which the supervisor performs his functions, constitutes restraint and coercion under the Act."
1986.85-1924,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.767,729.719,"--How deep does this go, Mr. Ganzfried?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,745.895,767.325,"If the union disciplines him for working for... the union may be free to discipline a journeyman for working for a particular employer, a non-union employer."
1986.85-1924,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,780.318,791.792,"--So, working for an employer as a journeyman, the union may discipline; working for an employer as a supervisor, a union may not discipline?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,791.792,794.828,That's right.
1986.85-1924,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,806.136,828.382,"But, Mr. Ganzfried, if there is no ongoing collective bargaining agreement or relationship between the employer and the union, how is the employer threatened in the integrity at the grievance adjustment bargaining process by this action?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,828.382,836.238,"He is restrained in his selection of the person he will have performing that function, and that is what the statute protects."
1986.85-1924,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,836.238,840.79,"But he doesn't have any relationship with this union at all, then."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,841.559,846.527,He may not have a collective bargaining agreement with the union.
1986.85-1924,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,846.527,852.248,"--What I am suggesting is, maybe there is some sense in requiring a representational nexus."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,852.248,869.209,"One answer to that is, well, in fact there is an adversity relationship between the union and the employer."
1986.85-1924,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,917.69,930.598,"Well, it sounds like you are arguing, there is in fact a representational nexus here, rather than arguing that a representational nexus is not what we ought to hang the decision on."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,930.598,936.77,"--Well, there is a representational nexus here and in fact the Board found that as a matter of fact."
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1038.032,1042.854,But the representative would be doing the employer's work with another union?
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1042.854,1044.487,With another union?
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1044.487,1045.806,Yes.
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1045.806,1048.272,"As in ABC, the grievance--"
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1048.272,1050.757,Suppose there were two employers here.
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1090.667,1110.831,"--If the supervisor in the non-union... and by that I mean no union employer performs the functions described in that section, grievance adjustment, and the union imposes that--"
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.831,1115.967,"So, it doesn't make any difference whether there is a union involved or not?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1115.967,1121.187,"--That's right, as long as the supervisor is performing the designated functions."
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.187,1122.287,"Well, there are a lot of supervisors who don't."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1122.287,1123.889,Then they are not covered.
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1123.889,1126.258,And so they--
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1126.258,1128.626,If they are fined for performing other functions.
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1128.626,1145.802,"--But you don't think it makes any difference that the representational activities involved here are between the... and respecting another union, a different union?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1145.802,1146.718,No.
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1172.952,1176.154,You want a strict reading of the statute; that is what you are urging on us?
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1176.154,1185.777,"--The conduct here comes within the language of the statute and that's the way the Board has interpreted it, and it's a reasonable interpretation."
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.777,1191.347,"Well, if you want to interpret the statute strictly, I don't know that the employer is being coerced here."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1212.327,1214.593,"Well, what Congress is doing--"
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1214.593,1216.279,"And that is the situation we have, right?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1216.279,1235.84,"--It's taking union interference... it's protecting the employer from union interference with the supervisors who are coming... who are in interface with journeyman, rank and file, the subordinate employees."
1986.85-1924,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.84,1240.144,May I ask... I'm not sure I remember your answer to the earlier question.
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1248.666,1257.439,The discipline was because he was working for an employer who was adverse and detrimental... whose position was adverse and detrimental.
1986.85-1924,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.439,1263.176,"It wasn't critical that he was a supervisor, from the union's rationale for imposing the discipline?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1263.176,1266.562,"Well, we don't inquire into that particular rationale."
1986.85-1924,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1266.562,1281.887,"And then it's the question that I think the Chief Justice asked you this and I'm not sure I got the answer, supposing he had not been a supervisor but merely among a group of employees who was eligible for promotion at some future date, and they in effect said, you can't work for that employer; well fine you if you do."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1283.339,1285.389,Our position on that is that it wouldn't.
1986.85-1924,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1285.389,1286.208,It would not?
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1290.743,1302.468,"The difference is that the statute protects the employer from having the union come in and say, we don't like foreman Smith."
1986.85-1924,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1302.468,1304.52,"--No, but the section says, ""in the selection of""."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1306.789,1307.872,Yes.
1986.85-1924,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.872,1309.741,--And wouldn't that affect the--
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1309.741,1310.807,In the selection of--
1986.85-1924,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1310.807,1313.943,--It would affect the pool from which the employer could make its selection.
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1322.065,1326.584,--In both cases it reduced the pool.
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1326.584,1332.42,"Well, in the one case it insists that somebody who has been selected be removed."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1332.42,1337.224,That's right.
1986.85-1924,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1338.608,1341.176,"So, it isn't a matter of selection, but--"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1341.176,1342.962,"--Well, it is the selection."
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.257,1366.023,--It's not threats or coercion.
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1368.623,1368.973,--It's a union rule.
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.973,1369.808,"And it's a very common one, isn't it?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1369.808,1375.712,And it's enforceable with respect to non-8(b)(1)(B) supervisors.
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.985,1387.869,"Once they are in, certainly."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1403.379,1412.15,If they are fined simply for working for a non-union employer and the work that they do is journeyman work--
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1412.15,1412.65,And I've got--
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1412.65,1414.35,--And it's not an 8(b)(1)(B) situation.
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1414.35,1423.106,"--And I presume we have middle situations somewhere, where they don't have the job yet but they have been offered the job by the employer and then the union chooses to--"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1423.106,1425.124,"And the union comes along and says, don't take the job?"
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1425.124,1430.778,"--No, the union says, you are... just by working for this employer, which is what was the case here."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1437.682,1446.205,"For working for someone whose position is adverse and detrimental to the union, and for causing economic harm to union members."
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.906,1454.56,"You mean, they would not have been dismissed had they not had supervisory bargaining responsibilities?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1457.029,1461.231,"Perhaps the union would have fined them, perhaps not."
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1461.231,1465.535,I thought the union rule was a general rule that you don't work for a non-union employer.
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1465.535,1471.772,The union rule in terms is even more general than that.
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.557,1474.941,Okay.
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1482.711,1492.852,"In the earlier stages of this case, there was another employee, Mr. Miller, and he is discussed in the Administrative Law Judge's decision."
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1510.23,1516.467,Were there any members that the union didn't discipline that were working for that employer?
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1516.467,1518.217,I don't know that the record indicates.
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1518.217,1518.65,Okay.
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1522.704,1527.942,But they selected particular employers as the disfavored employers.
1986.85-1924,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1527.942,1535.596,And the Board's position is that they can do that with respect to normal employees but they cannot do that with respect to supervisors?
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1535.596,1542.6,They can have a rule that says you can only work for employers that have a contract with this union.
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1544.7,1547.885,Unless that rule happens to apply to somebody who is doing bargaining--
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1547.885,1554.039,"--When they seek to enforce that rule against someone who is in an 8(b)(1)(B) capacity, it's a violation of 8(b)(1)(B)."
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1554.039,1560.495,"--So he, in effect, he immunizes himself from that rule by accepting a supervisory job with bargaining responsibilities?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1560.495,1568.231,"Well, he... the employer is entitled to the protection."
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.369,1585.593,"Well, has the Board ever explained or said why shouldn't... why the... if the employee doesn't like it he can get out of the union?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1585.593,1589.379,--Has it explained why that--
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.379,1593.366,Why shouldn't the employee just get out of the union?
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1593.366,1596.985,--The employee could.
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1600.287,1606.773,"I know, but when he takes the job, he quits the unions."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1606.773,1610.91,If when he takes the job he quits the union?
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1610.91,1611.344,Yes.
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1611.344,1616.481,The union has no ability to discipline him any more.
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.481,1617.248,"Well, right."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1618.364,1620.35,"Now, if it tries to restrain or coerce him in some other way--"
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.35,1622.302,--Why shouldn't that be a resolution in this case?
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1622.302,1628.206,"--To allow him to quit, for the union to say, because he can quit we can't coerce him?"
1986.85-1924,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1628.206,1629.589,"Well, yes."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1635.693,1643.013,"Well, it's an argument that the Court expressly rejected in the ABC versus Writers Guild case."
1986.85-1924,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1643.013,1657.272,"Well, isn't the Board's reasoning, at least in part, that in something like the construction industry a fellow may be a supervisor on one job and a journeyman or ordinary laborer on the next, and so he is really giving up livelihood if he leaves the union?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1657.272,1658.389,He may well.
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1662.926,1663.976,"Well, it isn't just supervisor."
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1670.58,1671.03,That's right.
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.03,1672.782,That's generally a distinctive character.
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1675.317,1680.102,"Well, in some industries you do, and as the record shows with respect to Mr. Miller in this case he did."
1986.85-1924,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1683.488,1685.654,May I ask you... supervisor with bargaining functions--
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1685.654,1687.606,"Supervisor with bargaining functions, and--"
1986.85-1924,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1687.606,1688.39,--With these functions?
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1688.39,1693.777,"--Yes, and he was found to perform these functions on one job site."
1986.85-1924,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1700.514,1713.072,"May I ask you the converse of Justice White's question, I take it from your position that the union could not have expelled him from the union either, because that would have been a form of discipline and he might have lost some pension benefits and the like?"
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1713.072,1717.79,There have been cases in which the Board has found that expelling a member for--
1986.85-1924,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.79,1719.306,As discipline?
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1720.989,1722.841,--They expel him--
1986.85-1924,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1722.841,1725.376,--That would equally be an unfair labor practice?
1986.85-1924,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1728.662,1729.278,--That's right.
1986.85-1924,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1819.22,1822.521,"Thank you, Mr. Ganzfried."
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,1824.038,1828.056,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1924,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.528,1963.528,"Otherwise, though--"
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,1963.528,1964.964,--I beg your pardon.
1986.85-1924,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.964,1966.18,--We have said otherwise.
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,1970.701,1974.503,"I don't, but I understand."
1986.85-1924,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2066.911,2082.188,"Mr. Cohen, what do you do with the language in note 37 in ABC case, which deals with the discipline of supervisors not involved in bargaining or grievance adjustment with the union?"
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2082.188,2094.746,"--Well, the particular phrase which the Board seizes on in footnote 37 is the employer's choice of a grievance representative with respect to employees represented by other unions."
1986.85-1924,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2130.819,2135.188,"Well, I guess the language could be read more broadly."
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2135.188,2147.78,"It could be, but the Court seemed to be directing it toward the situation it had before it, where there were several unions and some of the ""Hyphenates"" in question were not represented by the Writers Guild."
1986.85-1924,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2158.47,2170.111,"Well, does it make a difference that the union is trying to have a collective bargaining agreement by forcing this employer into the multi-employer--"
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2170.111,2175.098,"I don't think it would, as we understand the decisions of this Court."
1986.85-1924,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.534,2284.569,"--This decision, if it stands, that is an anomaly of ABC if it stands, isn't it?"
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2284.569,2295.877,"Except that it is anomaly of ABC, as it stands in the context of some sort of bargaining relationship."
1986.85-1924,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2341.071,2351.611,Because a hiring hall in the construction industry must refer a non-union member on equally as favorable a basis as a union member?
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2351.611,2357.867,"Precisely, and when they do not, the Board is very quick to discipline them for that."
1986.85-1924,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2357.867,2362.669,"What's the advantage of belonging to a union, then?"
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2362.669,2368.139,We think primarily in the obtaining of higher benefits and better working conditions.
1986.85-1924,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2368.139,2372.793,"Well, but if the free riders or the non-union get the same thing--"
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2372.793,2378.28,"I agree with you, that that is a very strong argument against free riders."
1986.85-1924,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2396.158,2401.896,--You can charge them for your services.
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2401.896,2410.316,"They can be charged, although not to an extent of dues for use of a hiring hall, that is true."
1986.85-1924,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2613.483,2614.768,All supervisors?
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2614.768,2619.153,All supervisors who are members of the union.
1986.85-1924,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2624.123,2630.61,"Maybe I don't know the business well enough, but I thought it's just supervisors who have bargaining or grievance responsibilities."
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2633.246,2640.8,"For the purpose of this argument, I will accept that because to explain it more fully would probably take an hour."
1986.85-1924,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2669.252,2684.095,"Well, wouldn't there have been some distinction between supervisors and run-of-the-mine people under the Taft-Ellender colloquy?"
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2699.522,2706.591,"Frankly, I think that is precisely the case, although when I say that I have to recognize that I have ABC standing in front of us."
1986.85-1924,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2706.591,2714.781,"And you also have a statute which, the Board has always had power to, you know, interpret in a fairly substantive way."
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2714.781,2728.839,"However, with this particular provision for 20 years it interpreted it in a narrow manner which was faithful to congressional intent and legislative history, until the Oakland Mailers case in '68."
1986.85-1924,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2776.522,2779.474,Labor Board versus Amax?
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2779.474,2780.007,Yes.
1986.85-1924,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2780.007,2781.64,Is that in your brief?
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2781.64,2782.007,No.
1986.85-1924,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2789.762,2790.529,Why don't you tell me--
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2790.529,2791.697,Let me give you the citation for it.
1986.85-1924,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.697,2792.247,--All right.
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2792.247,2800.72,"It's 453 U.S. 322, and the quote I read is at page 335."
1986.85-1924,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2800.72,2802.437,Thank you.
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2802.437,2829.406,"I'd like to point out one of the rather strange things about the Board decision here, is that it appears to us to fly in the face of a much earlier Board decision which we have cited in our brief, as has the Board: National Association of Letter Carriers."
1986.85-1924,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2877.137,2890.945,The government here was saying that the union could discipline any of its members who are not supervisors if they insisted on working for this employer?
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2890.945,2893.313,--The Board does concede that.
1986.85-1924,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2894.563,2895.279,That's this case--
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2895.279,2897.431,--I'm sorry.
1986.85-1924,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2897.431,2899.717,"--That's the case you are talking about, almost."
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2899.717,2907.137,"No, the case we are talking about is where the union stripped membership rights from those people--"
1986.85-1924,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2907.137,2908.489,They stripped the membership rights?
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2908.489,2910.673,--They denied... there were two issues in the case.
1986.85-1924,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.94,2914.559,"You mean, entry?"
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2914.559,2916.226,No... all right.
1986.85-1924,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2916.928,2919.244,Were they already members?
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2919.244,2922.063,The union dealt with the Postal Service.
1986.85-1924,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2942.627,2945.746,These people are already members?
1986.85-1924,1,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2945.746,2958.153,"Already members, as with us, banned from taking jobs as supervisors, as our rule does with respect to those employers who are adverse to our interests by having lower wage standards."
