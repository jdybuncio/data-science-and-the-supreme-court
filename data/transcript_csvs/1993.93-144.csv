1993.93-144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.837,We'll hear argument next 93-140... spectators are admonished the Court remains in session.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,50.075,53.886,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court:"
1993.93-144,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,53.886,57.479,"Counsel, before you get underway, straighten me out on a fact or two."
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,59.161,60.531,"--Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1993.93-144,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,60.531,66.016,Was this income subjected to that tax as well as to the marijuana tax?
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,66.016,67.908,"I do not know, Your Honor."
1993.93-144,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,72.369,74.151,So you don't know whether it was doubly taxed.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,74.151,76.063,"We do not know, no."
1993.93-144,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,76.894,78.262,Is that hard to find out?
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,78.262,91.412,"In fact, it is, because under Montana law I can only have access to Montana income tax records if I am prosecuting an income tax case."
1993.93-144,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,110.676,112.255,"Well, I'll ask opposing counsel then."
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,128.906,141.023,"Under the Montana income tax law the Kurths, the family or the individual members of the family, would be subject to income tax on the income earned from growing marijuana."
1993.93-144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,141.023,142.505,"Even if it was illegal income, it would still--"
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,142.505,143.204,Even if it was illegal income.
1993.93-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,144.656,149.311,"--Before you say good morning and begin your argument, I'll have one more question."
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,157.346,158.675,This tax?
1993.93-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,158.675,159.486,Yes.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,163.59,166.85,There is a criminal provision in the code.
1993.93-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,169.995,172.794,So there could have been a criminal prosecution here for failure to pay the tax?
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,172.794,182.9,"Under my understanding of the Montana interpretation of double jeopardy, I don't think... under the State rule, I don't think that would be possible."
1993.93-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,182.9,183.491,Thank you.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,186.073,198.151,"As I understand Montana's Supreme Court's interpretation of the... of our double... constitutional double jeopardy provisions and the Montana constitution, I don't think it would be possible."
1993.93-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,199.932,202.305,So there's no sanction for failing to pay this tax.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,205.358,207.087,"Well, Your Honor, this brings up--"
1993.93-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,207.087,210.77,"From people who have been growing marijuana, you sort of trust them to come up with it."
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,210.77,213.773,"--You... well, Your Honor, this brings up one point."
1993.93-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,229.211,231.274,"But you can put them in jail if they don't, I mean."
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,231.274,241.102,"Oh, we can only actually enforce it if... we can only actually bring an enforcement action if there's not a payment of the tax assessment."
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,330.947,347.12,"Mr. Van Tricht, just as a matter of Montana procedure, why wasn't this tax made part of the plea and sentencing proceeding, the criminal proceedings against the Kurth family?"
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,347.12,356.554,--By the time... by the time... the assessment procedures had not been completed by the time there was the criminal sentencing proceedings.
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,407.669,413.522,"It sounds, from what you describe, that it is... it would not be the common pattern to have the two merged."
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,413.522,416.494,In my experience they have never been merged.
1993.93-144,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,416.494,422.137,"If they were merged you wouldn't have a problem, I assume."
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,422.137,430.863,"Well, actually merger would create a great deal of problems because we're talking about an apples and oranges proceeding."
1993.93-144,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,436.427,439.028,But you wouldn't have this problem.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,439.028,444.063,"--Yes, we wouldn't have this problem, but we would have a great deal more problems in--"
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,444.063,447.326,"Well, this was settled by plea, wasn't it?"
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,448.014,449.427,"--Yes, Your Honor, it was."
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,449.427,450.358,Criminal.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,462.165,468.637,"Well, the impediment in this case was the fact that we hadn't completed our assessment procedure."
1993.93-144,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.71,511.707,"Mr. Van Tricht, if the legislature in Montana had passed its law saying that anyone found in possession of marijuana, that there will be a civil sanction imposed of $100 an ounce, do you think then we would be required to look at the Halper decision to determine its validity?"
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,511.707,513.597,"Yes, Your Honor, because--"
1993.93-144,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,513.597,519.722,"Do you think it makes any difference that precisely the same thing is done, only it's called a tax?"
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,519.722,522.183,"--Yes, I do, Your Honor, because there's a different--"
1993.93-144,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,522.183,522.624,Why?
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,522.624,524.246,--There's a different intent by the legislature.
1993.93-144,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,530.361,534.621,"Well, I don't see how the change of a word could alter the analysis?"
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,534.621,537.303,I believe--
1993.93-144,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,537.303,539.964,Calling it a sanction or a tax.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,539.964,548.171,"--I believe it does in this case, Your Honor, because of this Court's past decisions which upheld similar or nearly identical Federal taxes."
1993.93-144,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,548.171,552.463,Do you think we could ever view a tax as a sanction?
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,552.463,555.054,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-144,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,555.054,557.506,So it isn't just the use of the word.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,557.506,558.267,"No, Your Honor."
1993.93-144,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,577.878,581.421,Why doesn't the reference to structure go against you?
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,594.511,611.633,"Your Honor, it's... it's not the normal structure, but there's a least one Federal tax that has the same structure, and that's the tax on small cigars which is 12.5 percent or $30 per thousand cigars, whichever is greater."
1993.93-144,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,611.633,612.524,Is that so.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,612.524,617.185,"So there... it is a... not a normal, but it is not an unusual."
1993.93-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.086,622.498,"Mr. Van Tricht, is it one or the other?"
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,632.886,636.597,"Well, Your Honor--"
1993.93-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,636.597,641.412,Does its being a punishment exclude its being a tax or its being a tax exclude its being a punishment?
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,641.412,656.552,"--For the purposes of analyzing under Halper, it makes a difference, Your Honor, because we're dealing about the Halper decision and Halper was talking about penalties and not taxes."
1993.93-144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,656.552,660.553,But Halper also said it was a very narrowly confined decision.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,660.553,661.845,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,661.845,675.613,"So, why... why don't you take the position that even though there may be some sanction or penal effect, if there's... if it's also arguably a tax, you win?"
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,675.613,692.664,"Well, Your Honor, this Court has often recognized that a tax has both regulatory and... effects and not... effects other than its... just its purely revenue-raising effect."
1993.93-144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,721.604,724.736,May I ask another question about the way this tax works?
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,734.342,741.596,"Your Honor, the taxable... the taxable event is the coming into possession of the marijuana."
1993.93-144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,741.596,743.207,The coming into possession of marijuana?
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,743.207,743.537,Yes.
1993.93-144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,743.537,748.422,And is he allowed to retain possession of the marijuana or does the State take possession of it when it finds it?
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,748.422,754.784,"Well, if the State became aware of the possession, then it's contraband and it would be seized, unless there was some--"
1993.93-144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,754.784,762.181,"But you couldn't... obviously couldn't tax it without being aware of it, so I suppose that as soon as it has the right to tax it also has the right to seize it."
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,775.0,789.798,"--Well, Your Honor, Montana fully recognizes this is an illegal activity that it's taxing, and the statute's structure fully recognizes that and the rules recognize that."
1993.93-144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,789.798,794.381,So it's a tax on the prior... the fact that he previously owned the marijuana.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,797.443,799.925,"Yes, yes, yes."
1993.93-144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,799.925,804.339,So you're... he's being taxed for... because of the fact that he previously had in his possession marijuana?
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,804.339,805.087,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,805.087,809.442,"And, I see."
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,825.901,837.358,"Well, Your Honor, if he had a plant and it grew to a certain, you know... a pound, he would owe a tax."
1993.93-144,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,841.822,846.955,So the taxable event is the accretion of a pound of weight to his agricultural product.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,846.955,853.62,We tax the possession once and it's... and each time... each new possession of a different amount of marijuana--
1993.93-144,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,853.62,855.272,Each new pound.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,855.272,857.403,--Or new marijuana is the taxable event.
1993.93-144,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,863.947,873.194,"So in theory literally every time a new pound is added by nature's processes, he would be taxable on that."
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,873.194,873.923,"Yes, sir."
1993.93-144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,873.923,879.426,Could the State generate additional revenue by allowing it to... allowing him to retain possession for a while under supervision--
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,883.99,886.661,"In that event the State would get more... additional revenue, Your Honor."
1993.93-144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,886.661,889.694,Strange tax.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,900.083,901.3,"Well, Your Honor, this brings--"
1993.93-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,901.3,902.793,I'm glad I don't have to administer this tax.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,902.793,907.405,"--Your Honor, this brings up one point."
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,920.385,929.729,"But this... there's one portion of this, what you call shake, where it's at 800 percent, the tax, is it not?"
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,938.027,944.458,"Your Honor, the Kurths were producing two... they had 1,800 ounces of marijuana."
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,991.031,995.763,Well what was the tax on that $200 to $500 a pound?
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,995.763,1000.186,The tax on the shake was $100 an ounce.
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1003.898,1006.669,And the value of that was how much an ounce?
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,1006.669,1013.805,The value of that... the value... the value of marijuana is dependant upon what is the--
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1013.805,1017.047,But I thought there was a separate value... there were two separate commodities.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,1025.872,1032.478,"--Well, both of them... both the shake and the marijuana bud are marijuana."
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1038.821,1041.781,"But for different purposes, and one was more expensive than the other."
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,1041.781,1053.98,"Well, shake of the quality that the... that we have here were being sold for the purposes of making marijuana cigarettes and smoking, in addition to making marijuana oil."
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1067.651,1079.288,"I'm just trying to get an understanding of what was the tax on that commodity in relation to the value of that commodity, the market value of it."
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,1079.288,1086.382,"The tax on that commodity, taking the lowest price, would be eight times the value."
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1087.653,1089.033,The tax was eight times the value.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,1089.033,1090.234,--Yes.
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1094.189,1097.351,And that's a tax that's eight times the value.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,1107.235,1114.0,"--But remember, Your Honor, we're taxing the entire... all marijuana."
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1127.869,1135.335,"But I thought there's only two that were at issue here, the marijuana that was... and the shake."
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,1135.335,1137.666,"--Yes, that's the only issue."
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1137.666,1138.848,And the different rates applicable to each.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,1142.148,1143.45,Well--
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1143.45,1144.031,What was the tax?
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,1144.031,1149.934,"--The tax is $100 an ounce applicable to marijuana, whether it's marijuana bud or shake."
1993.93-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1149.934,1154.999,"Yes, but the bud... the marijuana bud is a much more expensive commodity, isn't it?"
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,1154.999,1156.449,"Considerably more expensive, Your Honor."
1993.93-144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1156.449,1161.043,And what is the ratio of tax to value in the case of marijuana bud?
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,1161.043,1169.158,"Tax to marijuana bud, the rate... the... in all instances the tax is less than the value."
1993.93-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.528,1189.0,I assume that you don't collect this tax on every piece of... on the usual percent.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,1193.284,1194.416,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1194.416,1205.272,"So to get the same net tax on all the marijuana, you... eight times the ones you catch probably isn't... isn't so outrageous, is it?"
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,1205.272,1212.756,"Your Honor, in this particular instance the Kurths were engaged in growing marijuana since January of 1986."
1993.93-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.756,1213.217,Right.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,1213.217,1219.1,The only tax they are now being assessed with is the tax... is the amount they had in October of 1987.
1993.93-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1219.1,1220.122,That you happened to catch him with.
1993.93-144,0,38395,paul_van_tricht,,1224.694,1225.706,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1226.767,1227.596,"Thank you, Mr. Van Tricht."
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1229.118,1245.287,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1283.722,1285.184,So you think it can be mixed.
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1290.598,1291.937,"Yes, I do."
1993.93-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.378,1333.135,"Well, but that... but that means that if there is any... to the... contrariwise, to the extent that there is any penal purpose, it is invalid, and that means it must be totally nonpenal."
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1333.135,1343.352,"I don't believe... I don't believe if... that... what the Court said several times in the course of the Halper opinion was if it bore a rational relationship to a nonpenal purpose, then it is not a penalty."
1993.93-144,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1353.65,1357.41,So that means that in this case if they labeled it a penalty your case would be just as strong.
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1360.122,1363.334,"--I think the difference... I think that there wouldn't be... well, I think this would be the difference."
1993.93-144,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1434.411,1445.257,"Well, do you think it would be constitutional to pass a statute that says that everybody that's convicted of a felony shall, in addition to whatever punishment the judge imposes, 1 year after his conviction pay a tax of $1,000?"
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1445.257,1446.109,"No, I don't think--"
1993.93-144,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.109,1447.04,So what's the difference?
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1447.04,1454.314,"--Well, I think it would... it would be constitutional for... that would be... I think that in that case it would be likely that you would see that as a criminal penalty."
1993.93-144,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1455.035,1459.418,Because the class of persons who are subject to the tax is limited to those who have already been convicted of a crime.
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1462.131,1475.958,"--I think that the lesson of Halper was the question that's asked... and the reason why Halper emphasized that it was a case... it was an unusual case and it was a rare case, was the analysis turns on the purpose that's underlying the statute."
1993.93-144,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1477.34,1488.166,"Well, what I'm really asking is do you think the State can constitutionally tax a class of taxpayers which is defined by the fact that they have all been convicted of a particular crime, without running into some kind of double jeopardy problem?"
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1488.166,1490.508,I think that you have... I think the question is looking at the purpose in each case.
1993.93-144,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.65,1501.605,"Well, they want to... they do it because they want to raise money and they think this is an easily defined class, we get $1,000 a head out of every burglar, we get that money... and there are a lot of burglars around, so we'll raise a lot of money."
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1501.605,1502.847,--I think where it's tied to a certain--
1993.93-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1502.847,1503.457,It's a sin tax.
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1506.7,1514.784,"--I think where it's tied to a criminal conviction, that it would be so close... and this would... is really related to maybe more the Austin case than the Halper case."
1993.93-144,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1519.757,1523.579,"Well, do any people pay this marijuana tax except people who are convicted of possession of marijuana?"
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1523.579,1524.381,"--No, that's not true."
1993.93-144,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.614,1535.918,"But as a practical matter, do they find people who are growing marijuana and they don't convict them of the crime?"
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1535.918,1536.268,I don't know.
1993.93-144,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1567.258,1570.68,"Of course, you could always do that with my burglary tax too."
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1571.561,1572.2,--Right.
1993.93-144,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1613.447,1631.229,"You said in your brief, to describe what would be permissible, that this has to be within the general range of sin... similar taxes, has to be something that is an ordinary kind of tax, and you give the sin tax as an example."
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1639.425,1643.517,"Actually, there are really two inquiries we suggested in our brief."
1993.93-144,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1650.883,1651.882,"Yeah, I know, but that's not at issue here."
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1651.882,1652.413,That doesn't apply to this case.
1993.93-144,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1702.215,1709.141,"In terms of the total amount that we're dealing with here, the 80 percent rate was on how much and the higher rate was on high much?"
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1709.141,1715.705,"--Well, I believe in this particular case the 80 percent rate was on 200 or 250 ounces."
1993.93-144,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1715.705,1720.237,"And the higher rate was on... the eight times was on much more, wasn't it?"
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1720.237,1720.888,That's correct.
1993.93-144,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1746.965,1757.983,"Well, wouldn't one say that to the extent that the product was not the buds but the shake, that it wasn't... that that rate was not within the general range of such taxes."
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1757.983,1762.876,"--I think if you saw the main focus of the tax as that, I think that would be a high rate."
1993.93-144,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1769.23,1778.956,"But you did say in your test in your brief that you would look to see whether it was in... within the general range, so... and here we go from a range of 80 percent to 800 percent."
1993.93-144,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1778.956,1779.456,Right.
1993.93-144,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1810.708,1811.246,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,1813.599,1817.741,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-144,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1912.664,1924.811,"Because if we don't take that position, then we've put ourselves right back in the old problem of having to... having to define the principal character of the tax again."
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,1931.076,1932.288,"Well, exactly."
1993.93-144,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2046.491,2047.79,$200 a pound--
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2047.79,2048.231,--A pound.
1993.93-144,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2048.231,2048.972,"--An ounce, what?"
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2048.972,2057.678,"$200 a pound and taxed at $1,600 a pound, eight times its market value, 90 percent of the product at issue here."
1993.93-144,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2065.643,2069.094,"Well, how important is that percentage, Mr. Goetz?"
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2082.043,2088.009,"--Well, the problem with the cigarette-tax analogy that they try to make is they're mixing up retail--"
1993.93-144,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2088.009,2088.848,"Well, I'm trying to make it."
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2088.848,2090.33,--Okay.
1993.93-144,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2103.667,2107.921,So... but if the figure got high enough then?
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2118.2,2119.379,It might well.
1993.93-144,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2142.062,2150.56,So it's enough if the tax has a very substantial deterrent effect to at least turn that factor against its validity as a tax?
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2150.56,2152.421,"As one of the indicators, yes."
1993.93-144,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2160.094,2175.325,"Mr. Goetz, do... would you have any problem if this tax had been imposed in the same proceeding as a criminal trial for the unlawful possession of marijuana?"
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2175.325,2187.793,"--Halper, I think, states explicitly that if you impose the tax at the same proceeding, or a civil sanction in Halper's case, then double jeopardy isn't implicated."
1993.93-144,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2332.32,2340.846,"So, in fact, no one could be prosecuted for not paying the tax as long as the return was filed within 72 hours of arrest for the possession."
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2340.846,2341.246,--Exactly.
1993.93-144,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2367.613,2379.732,"It does refer to report, and I take it the word report, in your view, is the report that's filed by the law-enforcement officials in lieu of the defendant having done it?"
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2379.732,2382.113,Yes.
1993.93-144,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2439.122,2448.467,One can accept all of that and still believe that the major purpose of this piece of legislation is to raise money.
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2488.422,2491.724,"--Well, I'd like to parse out the question."
1993.93-144,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2501.011,2501.562,Change it.
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2503.862,2505.683,"--Okay, if it's exclusively then we avoid that dual problem."
1993.93-144,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.683,2506.134,All right.
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2507.376,2517.782,"Then going to the record in this case, in a document of the Department of Revenue I filed last week and asked judicial... that judicial notice be taken of it."
1993.93-144,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2553.445,2564.254,"When you said raised, you mean the gross receipts from it discounted by the cost of enforcing it, or what?"
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2564.254,2567.055,I think those were the gross receipts period.
1993.93-144,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.055,2569.395,How could they have minus gross receipts?
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2569.395,2571.557,"Well, I think they had to pay some back."
1993.93-144,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2588.099,2588.487,"Well, I agree with you."
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2591.209,2594.234,It's my definition of a good tax.
1993.93-144,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2594.234,2594.792,They're doing something wrong.
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2594.792,2605.929,"In any event, going to another aspect of your question, that is perhaps the State, if we really want to speculate, was trying to avoid the Fifth Amendment problem."
1993.93-144,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.09,2630.445,"I just have to say, I don't see how, by confining the people who have to pay it, file a return to those who have been arrested, you've avoided any Fifth Amendment problem."
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2643.505,2665.127,"Well, I don't want to advocate for Justice Scalia, but I think maybe his point was that once the law-enforcement officers filed the report and the taxpayer may or may not sign... and in this case they declined to sign, maybe his point is they would... they could avoid, conceivably, the Fifth Amendment problem."
1993.93-144,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2691.675,2693.848,Does Minnesota collect any money off that scheme?
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2693.848,2699.441,--I don't know what their... what their proceeds are.
1993.93-144,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2699.441,2700.031,Not too many stamps being sold?
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2701.011,2702.273,"I'm not sure, Your Honor."
1993.93-144,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2748.924,2756.459,"Didn't we get an example that there was one Federal tax that has the either/or, so it's not--"
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2756.459,2757.32,--I'm not sure--
1993.93-144,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2757.32,2763.004,"--I think the answer was that it's not common, but it's not extraordinary."
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2763.004,2767.887,"--I don't recall saying that, Your Honor, but perhaps we did in the reply brief."
1993.93-144,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2830.197,2845.558,"Which they are likely to report, and it seems to me a reasonable judgment by the State that marijuana growers are likely not to be reporting the income they're making from growing marijuana, and therefore that crop, unlike the other crops, we will impose a crop tax on."
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2845.558,2845.968,Well--
1993.93-144,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2845.968,2847.879,That's a reasonable call.
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2847.879,2854.783,"--One could argue that that's reasonable, except there's no provision made, as I see it, for reporting this marijuana tax."
1993.93-144,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2964.666,2974.432,"Are you referring to those cases where the challenge was made that this isn't under the Congress' taxing power, and therefore it has to be under some other power, and Congress doesn't have that power?"
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,2974.432,2975.173,--Basically.
1993.93-144,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3050.572,3055.794,"But there you're talking, Mr. Goetz, about tax classifications."
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,3067.352,3076.678,"Well, I agree that that's a different kind of review, but I don't think the question is is this a tax or is it not a tax."
1993.93-144,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3146.273,3161.975,"But most of the cases in which are relaxed scrutiny, Lenhausen, that group of cases, the challenge has been under the Equal Protection Clause."
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,3169.129,3173.301,It depends on whether you have a fundamental right or a suspect classification.
1993.93-144,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3175.144,3182.838,"Well, you say... you say the Equal Protection Clause generally isn't of the same statue or stature in the Constitution as the Double Jeopardy Clause."
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,3182.838,3191.524,"Well, this Court has held in numerous cases that you apply at least a two-tier standard in Equal Protection Clauses."
1993.93-144,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3324.431,3327.181,"The tax was upheld in Sanchez, was it not?"
1993.93-144,2,30561,james_h_goetz,,3327.181,3327.712,--That's right.
1993.93-144,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3440.988,3444.119,"Thank you, Mr. Goetz."
