1992.92-466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.34,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-466, Brooke... Brooke Group Limited v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation."
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,56.181,59.304,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,70.986,77.688,That predatory price violation was discrimination among its wholesalers.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,77.688,78.656,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,86.887,89.323,Brown & Williamson wholesalers.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,89.323,91.355,Brown & Williamson wholesalers.
1992.92-466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,96.79,104.285,And how... did it find how that hurt those... that discrimination hurt your clients?
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,104.285,105.348,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,126.996,130.916,So you had wholesalers doing business both with Brown & Williamson and with Liggett.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,130.916,131.478,"Yes, sir."
1992.92-466,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,131.478,139.648,"But as I understand the instructions, the jury could have found in your favor even if it made no finding that the sales were below average variable cost."
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,139.648,142.864,"No, Your Honor, I think the instructions--"
1992.92-466,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,142.864,144.099,Or is that the argument in this case?
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,144.099,144.894,--That's the argument of the other side.
1992.92-466,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,187.611,191.923,"And is it your theory of the case that this is part of your burden, to show that it was below average variable cost?"
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,191.923,193.126,"--Yes, Your Honor, we do."
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.996,206.293,I don't understand.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,214.226,217.898,A scheme... the rebates were based on volume.
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,228.346,228.924,Right.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,228.924,232.704,And lesser rebates to other... to wholesalers who did not handle that volume.
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,232.704,233.703,"Right, right."
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,233.703,235.406,"Now, these are discriminatory volume rebates."
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.406,243.044,"I can understand how that discrimination would hurt a small wholesaler, one that does not buy in high volume."
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,251.962,255.663,The discrimination triggers the statute.
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,302.537,307.956,"Well, I thought it covered discrimination of this kind in order to protect the person who's being discriminated against."
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,307.956,308.503,But--
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,308.503,314.376,And I just don't see how your client is being discriminated against by this discrimination.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,314.376,319.342,"--My client is not being discriminated... the... in primary line... allow me to back up, Your Honor."
1992.92-466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,361.263,374.993,"Well, I thought you said in answer to my question, Mr. Areeda, that it did have an effect on your client because your client had to change its procedures in order to continue to retain the business of the wholesaler."
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,374.993,375.352,"Exactly, exactly."
1992.92-466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,414.038,418.256,And so what exactly are the losses that Liggett is suggest... subjected to?
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,418.256,428.704,"--When it has to match the below-cost... when it has to match the rebates the... of the defendant, of the respondent, which are below cost."
1992.92-466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.673,444.792,"But is it because the... is it because Brown & Williamson discriminated among its wholesalers that Liggett has to do that, or because Brown & Williams was selling below cost?"
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,444.792,446.259,Both.
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.189,472.235,"Well, why it is... I don't... I still don't see why the discrimination facilitates the scheme."
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,488.821,489.649,That... that might be.
1992.92-466,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,525.369,530.726,Is this the difference between a Sherman Act section 2 claim and a Robinson-Patman Act claim?
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,537.754,543.892,The answer to your... the answer to your questions are respectively yes and no.
1992.92-466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,573.676,576.613,May I ask you sort of a preliminary question?
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,582.252,582.845,--Was--
1992.92-466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,582.845,586.016,"Was there proof, for example, that the wholesalers were injured?"
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,586.016,589.421,"--That... no one has litigated that question, Your Honor."
1992.92-466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,589.421,600.728,"There was never a suggestion that the discrimination would be unlawful if that kind of injury to competition ensued, and then the next question is was your client damaged by the illegal discrimination."
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,602.899,608.585,"The... no one answered... argued the case on that basis, but let me answer your... let me answer your question."
1992.92-466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,620.44,631.951,"In other words, if a... if a food chain, for example, discriminated between a chain store and an individual small, and by that means got a large account away from a competing supplier, that would be--"
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,631.951,632.45,No.
1992.92-466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,632.45,633.809,--There would be no action in that.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,633.809,636.496,We would not contend... I do not contend that that is an offense.
1992.92-466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,643.978,644.4,I know.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,655.021,656.535,--That's not... that's not here.
1992.92-466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.535,656.817,Okay.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,656.817,666.235,"What is here is that the losses, as B&W predicted, induced Liggett to raise its consumer prices, its list prices."
1992.92-466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,672.811,688.1,"Now, Mr. Areeda, you... you agree that under Matsushita's holding that essentially there has to be a reasonable hope of recoupment of the loss?"
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,688.1,689.147,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,691.881,692.443,Uh-huh.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,692.443,708.342,"We do believe, and we have proposed, in fact, as the... as the rule in this case in our brief, that a reasonable prospect of recoupment should be required as a means of... as a means of reinforcing... making the court feel more comfortable that predation is actually taking place."
1992.92-466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,708.342,714.683,So to that extent Utah Pie is not to the contrary or it is limited somehow?
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,714.683,716.59,Utah Pie did not reach that issue.
1992.92-466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,716.59,717.322,Uh-hum.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,717.322,727.585,Utah Pie came early in the thinking about predatory pricing and did not reach the issue as to whether recoupment would be required.
1992.92-466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,727.585,736.316,"Well, tell me what differences you have with the respondent's legal theory in this case."
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,745.829,760.415,"The respondent suggests that he agrees with our position, that... that predation oligopoly is possible, but all of the arguments in the respondent's brief are that is it impossible."
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.014,838.309,But that's not what your... the officers of your client testified.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,842.869,845.306,"I know, Your Honor--"
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,845.306,846.149,"Can you... can you contradict that, I mean?"
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,846.149,854.943,"--Your Honor, the... competitive, when used by businessmen, means lots of rivalry."
1992.92-466,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,918.324,922.509,"On your theory, Mr. Areeda, does it matter what the market share of the oligopolist is?"
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,927.258,929.256,"--It's a matter of arithmetic, Your Honor."
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.89,1033.401,"Well, I guess the project wouldn't be successful, though, if the... if the... if the price gap was narrowed but the volume of the... of the generics increased substantially."
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,1033.401,1033.948,It did.
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.948,1034.682,"Which it did, here, didn't it?"
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,1034.682,1034.885,Yes.
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1039.242,1045.71,So you... you can... you don't achieve anything by a bit of a narrowing if the volume of the... of the generics increases.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,1045.71,1047.943,"Oh, you achieve a great deal if you could raise the average price."
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1047.943,1052.161,"Well, it depends... it depends on... on what the volume increase is--"
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,1052.161,1052.487,Yes.
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1052.487,1054.409,"--As compared to the price differential, I suppose."
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,1054.409,1054.644,"Yes, it does."
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1079.711,1080.289,Uh-hum.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,1080.289,1081.819,--At the... at the end of this period.
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1087.786,1106.731,"Mr. Areeda, one of the... one of the things that the predator in this situation had to anticipate was not only the ability to recoup later, but also that the other oligopolists would not... would not think that the predator was seriously trying to sell in the... in the off-brand market, right?"
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,1106.731,1107.216,Yes.
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1107.216,1111.448,And why... why would... why would you be confident about that?
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,1118.023,1123.161,"I... I beg to suggest that the outcome does establish the confidence, but let me explain."
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1123.161,1123.614,All right.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,1123.614,1137.439,"B&W itself predicted that its fellow oligopolists would be likely to enter the discount segment of the business, the generic sector of the market."
1992.92-466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1232.399,1232.961,Right.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,1232.961,1244.832,"And it did not feel obliged to lower its price while B&W was escalating its rebates, and did not feel obliged to raise its own rebates."
1992.92-466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1354.459,1354.974,"I have a question, if I may."
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,1370.469,1370.813,Right.
1992.92-466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1370.813,1371.92,--The fact of damage.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,1375.497,1375.887,Yes.
1992.92-466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1375.887,1378.761,--Which of those three issues are in dispute?
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,1378.761,1386.321,"I believe, fairly put Your Honor, only the first issue is in dispute."
1992.92-466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1389.788,1390.194,Whether there was an injury to competition.
1992.92-466,0,37660,phillip_areeda,,1390.194,1394.147,"--To competition, but does not dispute injury, in fact, to Liggett."
1992.92-466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1476.8,1477.815,"Very well, Mr. Areeda."
1992.92-466,2,37660,phillip_areeda,,3211.024,3211.945,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.92-466,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3216.897,3223.675,"Mr. Areeda, do you... do you agree with Mr. Bork's answer to my question, that this seems to be mostly just an argument about sufficiency of the evidence?"
1992.92-466,2,37660,phillip_areeda,,3223.675,3225.97,"--No, Your Honor."
1992.92-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3273.187,3277.139,What was the court of appeals... the basis for the court of appeals' opinion?
1992.92-466,2,37660,phillip_areeda,,3277.139,3286.355,"I read the court of appeals, Justice White, as saying that only a monopolist or a cartel can successfully predate."
1992.92-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3294.553,3298.521,"That wasn't much different from the... from the district judge's theory, was it?"
1992.92-466,2,37660,phillip_areeda,,3298.521,3298.708,No.
1992.92-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3317.638,3319.278,So you think the court of appeals erred as a matter of law.
1992.92-466,2,37660,phillip_areeda,,3319.278,3320.59,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1992.92-466,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.949,3321.277,Not--
1992.92-466,2,37660,phillip_areeda,,3321.277,3324.105,--The court there has none of the apparatus... the answer is yes.
1992.92-466,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3371.054,3372.507,"--The... what would the result of that be, then?"
1992.92-466,2,37660,phillip_areeda,,3375.959,3376.302,--Yes.
1992.92-466,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3376.302,3379.38,--Have a shot at saying whether the district court's theory was right.
1992.92-466,2,37660,phillip_areeda,,3379.38,3380.692,"Yes, it would go back to the court of appeals."
1992.92-466,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3380.692,3384.424,And then the court of appeals would decided whether there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict.
1992.92-466,2,37660,phillip_areeda,,3384.424,3388.704,"The court... the court of appeals would then have to examine the remaining evidentiary questions, yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-466,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3412.772,3413.241,I understand.
1992.92-466,2,37660,phillip_areeda,,3421.097,3430.547,"--The earlier document... a few pages earlier in the record, the B&W... the B&W more formal documents say something like the following."
1992.92-466,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3516.949,3518.073,"Thank you, Mr. Areeda."
1992.92-466,2,37660,phillip_areeda,,3518.073,3518.682,--Thank you.
1992.92-466,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3518.682,3520.573,The case is submitted.
