1993.92-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We'll hear argument now in Number 92-1856, the City of Ladue v. Margaret Gilleo."
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,10.706,13.391,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-1856,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,97.312,102.449,"Mr. Cherrick, your ordinance has some exemptions."
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,126.933,153.583,"Justice O'Connor, we think that the exemptions are neutral in the sense that under Ward the controlling test for content neutrality was, what is the Government's controlling purpose, and here, the narrow exceptions that we required are safety-related and those that, in fact, are required by this Court's jurisprudence in the sense that there are no ample alternative modes of expression, such as an onsite sign."
1993.92-1856,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,153.583,168.426,"Well, but you have exemptions for sale or for lease signs, which certainly aren't safety-related, and for church signs and so forth, so surely some of those are content-based?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,168.426,179.866,We think that under this Court's jurisprudence... for example in the Linmark case the Court held that real estate signs must be allowed because there are no ample alternative modes of expression.
1993.92-1856,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.208,215.491,"Well, do you think we have to apply our usual strict scrutiny test here, and under that test, do you think that the exemptions survive strict scrutiny, that there is a compelling State interest, that there's no other alternative that would be less burdensome, and so forth?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,215.491,238.837,"--Justice O'Connor, we think the ordinance does survive the strict scrutiny test, but we do not think the Court needs to reach that test, because what is at issue here today is, in the lower courts what actually happened is that the courts held that if Ladue allows any exceptions whatsoever, the ordinance is content-based, subject to strict scrutiny, and therefore unconstitutional."
1993.92-1856,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,254.032,263.388,"Is it your position that you cannot draft an adequate time, place, and manner ordinance that would allow some signs of this character?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,263.388,274.695,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, under the Ward case the Court has, of course, rejected the least restrictive alternative, and the issue is--"
1993.92-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,274.695,280.949,"Mr. Cherrick, tell me if I'm wrong, but I thought the Ward case was about the decibel level."
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,310.802,323.176,"--Justice Ginsburg, proliferation is to signs what volume is to loud music, and what Ladue is doing here is focusing and targeting the medium of expression."
1993.92-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,338.603,348.125,"Is there anything in this record that shows there's a greater danger of proliferation for ""Peace in the Gulf"" than ""House for Sale""?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,348.125,371.174,"The record is undisputed that signs proliferate in neighboring communities, and Ladue does not target any particular message, it is focused on the medium, so that this ordinance applies and prohibits in a particular place signs on the landscape, controversial signs, noncontroversial, political, commercial, noncommercial... it is focused on this medium."
1993.92-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,449.526,450.559,So nothing is better than something.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,463.869,472.308,"--No, Justice Ginsburg, because under this ordinance numerous modes of expression, ample modes of expression are left open for Respondent to speak."
1993.92-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,498.174,506.38,"Well, Mr. Cherrick, why would a rule of one sign per house... why would that violate this Court's precedents?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,506.38,526.943,"We think that would create a content-based problem, because in that instance the Government in effect would be imposing a decision to be made by individuals that in a... for example, the multiple issues that face... people want to speak on, they would have to put a sign on one issue, and there may be--"
1993.92-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,526.943,532.763,"Well, they would presumably choose the right to speak on one issue rather than the right to speak on no issues."
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,532.763,550.975,"--Well, the problem would be is that you would have... you would have neighboring people who... who, for example, would be allowed to speak on a specific issue because they would have the one sign, and there may be just one person living in that house."
1993.92-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,568.27,571.238,You should just prohibit the debate entirely.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,571.238,572.238,"--Well, Mr.--"
1993.92-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,572.238,573.674,Do you... excuse me.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,575.59,576.357,--Thank you.
1993.92-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,588.517,590.6,Don't you have a handbill ordinance?
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,592.386,593.986,"Well, that... those... those--"
1993.92-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.986,594.42,You do?
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,596.303,598.639,"--Well, they do--"
1993.92-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.639,603.776,It seems to me that would be inconsistent with this very... very fine neighborhood to have handbills scattered all over the place.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,606.545,616.667,"--Justice Stevens, as the Court pointed out in Vincent, the problem of handbills can be dealt with in different ways."
1993.92-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,635.747,637.93,Would you confirm one thing I really want to be sure about?
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,646.686,650.59,"No, Justice Stevens, because if we permitted that we would be favoring that speech over--"
1993.92-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,650.59,655.292,"And is that ordinance completely enforced and obeyed, that they've never even put election signs up in the windows?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,659.28,666.117,"--Well, the record is clear that for 55 years that this ordinance has been consistently enforced and applied in a constitutional--"
1993.92-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,666.117,677.407,"Although didn't this come to light because of a complaint that the sign had been vandalized, so it hadn't been... this wasn't a case of initial enforcement."
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,683.728,688.697,"--Yes, and the town enforced this consistently."
1993.92-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,691.751,698.071,"But there's no indication that if she hadn't made the complaint, or the sign hadn't been disturbed, anything would have happened."
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,698.071,724.638,"Well, the record is clear that whenever there have been signs and the police have been on notice of it they have applied this across the board to whatever the message... whatever sign there was that was causing the problem, and I stress here, too, that this Court in the Ward case pointed out that deference must be given to local judgment of city officials to deal with these types of problems, and here we have--"
1993.92-1856,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,724.638,727.424,"Was Ward a time, place, and manner case?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,727.424,729.19,--Ward?
1993.92-1856,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,729.19,729.79,Yes.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,729.79,730.209,Yes.
1993.92-1856,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,730.209,732.426,"Is this a time, place, and manner case?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,732.426,742.867,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, because it is focused on the medium, the manner of expression... signs... at a particular place, signs on the landscape that can be seen from the street."
1993.92-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,742.867,755.925,"You are also interpreting time, place, and manner as I understand it to authorize you to make a complete prohibition of, I gather, all signs, if you wanted to go that far, is that correct?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,767.132,771.703,"If I understand your question, Justice Souter, Vincent and--"
1993.92-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,771.703,790.498,"Could you have... in your view, would Vincent have authorized the town to prohibit not only the signs prohibited here, but also the... at least the private signs allowed here, commercial signs in front of stores, for sale signs, identification signs... could you have gone the whole hog, as you read Vincent?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,790.498,794.3,"--Well, signs for which there is no--"
1993.92-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,794.3,796.152,"Well, how about... what about the answer to my question?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,796.152,796.652,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1993.92-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,798.353,798.77,Okay.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,798.77,799.62,--and let me explain.
1993.92-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,829.14,833.444,Is that also your view on the religious sign that the red brief referred to?
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,845.667,852.071,--A church would only be allowed to have a sign identifying the church and what is going on at that particular premises.
1993.92-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,869.533,881.424,"And I assume you think, Mr. Cherrick, also, that one of the other reasons why you don't think it would be satisfactory simply to say everybody can have one sign of any sort is, you think that would be too many signs."
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,883.792,884.842,"--Well, that's absolutely correct."
1993.92-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.842,885.309,Even one.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,892.296,918.614,"Well, those signs are not, naturally, limited in number, and there are many types of signs that can be placed here, and the record is undisputed that this city has followed the counsel of some of the most expert land-use planners to... who have advised the city that this... based on this city's unique interest, the comprehensive city plan and the zoning interest, this is necessary."
1993.92-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.614,924.601,"You consider that a visual blight to have a sign up in every house... you walk down the street, every house has a sign, vote for him, vote for the other."
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,926.219,947.383,"Well, that's correct, and it's in the reasonable judgment of city officials, as this Court has said, to make the decision about what is beautiful and what is ugly and whether sign proliferation should be allowed, and that is what this city has done, and has done so in a constitutional fashion by only allowing the limited safety and onsite signs."
1993.92-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,947.383,950.752,Why is it that rectangular flags can say anything at all?
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,954.639,955.306,Yes.
1993.92-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.306,959.775,That's how you interpret the exception for flags which is contained in the ordinance.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,969.732,970.248,That's correct.
1993.92-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,970.248,971.332,But not a pennant.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,972.184,974.267,That was a land-use judgment--
1993.92-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.902,977.052,A pretty stupid judgment.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,981.373,982.54,"--No, Justice--"
1993.92-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.54,983.54,It's not irrational?
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,983.54,984.492,--It's not irrational.
1993.92-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.492,984.975,All right.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,989.544,999.252,"The judgment of the city was... is that there's certain types of signs that proliferate, such as a pennant and a banner."
1993.92-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1005.405,1011.975,"I think if you're talking about patriotic flags, you know, on holidays and things like that, I can understand it, but you haven't interpreted the thing that way."
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1022.8,1024.05,"Well, the city--"
1993.92-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1024.05,1025.319,I don't understand that at all.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1025.319,1051.7,"--Justice Scalia, the city made a reasonable judgment to deal with this problem, and it... at the same time it allowed that type of expression on a flag for people to display all types of messages, but this was... the city was trying to limit its ordinance to the problems that it saw, and under the Burson case the Court has said that the First Amendment does not require to deal with problems that don't confront them, but--"
1993.92-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.7,1057.271,"I don't really think that's what they meant when they made the exception for flags, I really don't."
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1063.944,1077.252,"--Well, they... there are different... people can put different messages on flags, and while it can be an American flag, it can also be a flag containing a different message, but the... I think that--"
1993.92-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1077.252,1081.204,Has this come up in the administration of the zoning ordinance?
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1085.239,1086.072,--Yes.
1993.92-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1107.669,1131.101,"Mr. Cherrick, is your position that you're forced into the flag position you've just taken that Justice Scalia just questioned as irrational by this Court's precedent in Street, the peace symbol on a flag, and that you're forced into the ""for sale"" because of this Court's decisions so you're preserving what you can but of course recognizing this Court's precedent?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1131.887,1140.141,"--Well, the city is trying to comply with this Court's precedents, while at the same time achieving the city's unique aesthetic interest, and I think it's important to focus--"
1993.92-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1140.141,1158.537,"--But is it your position that all of the exceptions here which create what some members of the Court have described as content-based problems for you are required by decisions of this Court, so that all of the exceptions are necessities, constitutional necessities, is that your theory?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1158.537,1171.428,"--Yes, Justice Souter, and the problem that the lower court has placed the city and other cities in is this catch-22 problem, because the lower court has said that all signs must be banned."
1993.92-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1176.766,1193.96,"Well, if we were to take the position that you are not constitutionally required to allow square or rectangular flags displaying this particular message, and... would that then knock out your theory of content-based justification?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1193.96,1204.649,"No, Justice Souter, because in that situation the city was making a judgment that flags have not created the problem of proliferation and visual blight, and so therefore it permitted that unique mode."
1993.92-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1204.649,1207.785,"Well then, you're going to a different rationale, then."
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1217.809,1219.159,"Yes, and--"
1993.92-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1219.159,1221.795,And they can be identified without any content base.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1221.795,1241.024,"--That's correct, and the Court in the... the lower courts have created this very difficult problem that applies not only for a city like Ladue, but would apply, frankly, in other contexts."
1993.92-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1263.938,1269.358,"Mr. Cherrick, where... what section of the ordinance is it that deals with flags?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1269.358,1276.447,The... it is the definitional section under page 120 of the joint appendix.
1993.92-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1290.439,1293.641,"And this ordinance was adopted in 1935, you say?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1293.641,1301.33,"No... well, the present ordinance was adopted in 1991, although the city has had sign ordinances ever since the beginning of the city."
1993.92-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1301.33,1317.858,"And you say cases have come up since 1991 in which people have flown flags that weren't national flags or State flags, or that sort of thing, and the city has known about it and said that's perfectly okay?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1317.858,1318.374,Yes.
1993.92-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1334.884,1336.786,But under your view I suppose they could have prohibited flags.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1343.057,1344.592,--If it was creating a problem.
1993.92-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.542,1347.143,"Well, in their judgment."
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1352.864,1353.447,"--Well, there is an--"
1993.92-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1353.447,1357.066,"Ever since 1935 you've said no ""I Like Ike"" signs."
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1357.066,1372.676,"--Well, Justice Stevens, there is an uncontested record here that in six neighboring communities, residential communities, there is a proliferation of small, temporary signs, and so that is a problem, a real problem that exists for the city."
1993.92-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1373.778,1376.813,"I'm sorry, you say there is a prolifer... not in Ladue."
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1376.813,1378.58,"--In... no, six neighboring communities."
1993.92-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1378.58,1378.947,Oh.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1378.947,1379.765,That... that's--
1993.92-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1379.765,1383.801,"But they weren't planned by this same architectural expert, were they?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1384.551,1391.322,"--Well, those cities do not make this prohibition, and they have a visual blight--"
1993.92-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1391.322,1395.958,Do the homes in those neighboring cities sell for anything like the price that you get in Ladue?
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1395.958,1403.547,"--Well, Justice Stevens, the record is uncontested also that one of the effects of this land-use plan and this zoning ordinance--"
1993.92-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1403.547,1404.047,Is to protect values.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1404.047,1405.514,--is that real estate values are increased.
1993.92-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.514,1405.916,Right.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1413.336,1416.621,"No, and that would be another alternative mode of expression."
1993.92-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.362,1432.881,"What about a child's wagon sitting out there, and put the sign on the wagon?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1434.0,1449.675,"Yes, but it is important to consider the overall land-use plan, not the individual case, and under a typical land-use plan like this, if everyone keeps the plan, then the entire community benefits in terms of quality of life and real estate values."
1993.92-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1449.675,1456.679,"If she had a wheelbarrow that she rolled onto her front lawn and propped up the sign on that, would that violate the ordinance?"
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1456.679,1462.5,"No, but that... again, we think it is not appropriate to look at the individual case."
1993.92-1856,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1490.0,1500.292,"Mr. Cherrick, before you do, let me ask, give me the names of one or two of the adjoining suburbs that have gone to pot because they don't have this regulation."
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1500.292,1524.407,"Justice Blackmun, the... the suburbs are indicated on pages 154 and 155 of the joint appendix, but those suburbs... each community has the right, in our view, to make its own decisions of quality of life, and this is a particularly--"
1993.92-1856,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1524.407,1526.673,I asked you to give me the names of one or two of them.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1528.709,1529.109,--Yes.
1993.92-1856,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1529.109,1530.644,I know St. Louis fairly well.
1993.92-1856,0,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,1530.644,1536.798,"Justice Blackmun, Ferguson would be one, Manchester would be another, that were mentioned by the expert."
1993.92-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1538.915,1540.267,"Very well, Mr. Cherrick."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1543.285,1548.022,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.494,1581.094,"Well, it hasn't done that."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1593.134,1602.09,"Justice Scalia, this Court has made clear that no time, no place, and no manner does not mean a regulation of time, place, and manner."
1993.92-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1602.09,1603.923,"This isn't no time, no place, and no manner."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1611.529,1616.75,This Court has said that distinct modes of expression must be judged by their own rule.
1993.92-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1623.154,1625.773,"Time, place, and manner doesn't apply to this case, then, is that it?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1625.773,1627.724,"Time, place, and manner would apply if this was--"
1993.92-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.724,1628.074,It does.
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1634.644,1635.228,--Your Honor--
1993.92-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.228,1644.167,"It seems to me you're enlisting support from a feeling that, you know, a woman's home is her castle, and she should be able to do whatever she wants with it, but she can."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1668.032,1673.186,"--Your Honor, Ladue does not allow Ms. Gilleo to maintain this sign anywhere else."
1993.92-1856,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1682.375,1693.917,"Well, they did say... I thought your opposing counsel acknowledged this morning that it would have been all right to put the sign in her car window and park it in the driveway."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1693.917,1710.461,"--Your Honor, I heard Mr. Cherrick say that, although the record in this case showed that Ladue has enforced its ordinance in a number of instances against cars parked in driveways or in front of houses with for sale signs on them, so I'm not sure that interpretation is valid."
1993.92-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1738.196,1739.429,"Well, that doesn't entitle you to do it."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1779.123,1785.593,"--Justice Scalia, sleeping in the park may be regulated because that involves conduct mixed with speech."
1993.92-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1793.365,1799.952,"Well, could the State restrict you to one sign per house?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1799.952,1805.173,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, certainly the State may reasonably limit the number of signs."
1993.92-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.629,1818.564,Do you have any order of magnitude in mind?
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1818.564,1820.433,"I don't have a specific number, Your Honor."
1993.92-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1823.968,1826.504,Would a limitation of half a dozen be permissible?
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1826.504,1827.82,"Perhaps, Your Honor."
1993.92-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1834.692,1837.727,How about a limitation as to size?
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1837.727,1841.613,"We believe the city may properly regulate size, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1993.92-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1841.613,1845.981,"Well, if you expand according to the political season, that's content-based, isn't it?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1848.517,1858.908,"Well, Justice Kennedy, we don't believe that if you adopted an expanded number during a political season that it would be appropriate to limit that expanded number only to political campaign signs."
1993.92-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1858.908,1861.86,"Oh, but your reason is to accommodate politics."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1866.145,1866.997,"Well, we're talking--"
1993.92-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1866.997,1868.064,"That's kind of tricky, isn't it?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1868.064,1878.286,"--We're talking about time, Your Honor, and so long as we're talking about time, and we're doing it in a content neutral way, and we're allowing reasonable opportunities for expression, I believe that's okay."
1993.92-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1878.286,1886.642,"Well, I take it the purpose for your expanding the number of signs in this hypothetical ordinance during the political season was to accommodate political speech."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1889.16,1891.279,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe that's right."
1993.92-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1891.279,1893.062,And I ask why isn't that content-based?
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1893.062,1900.718,"Well, the regulation in terms of its effects is not content-based because it allows an expanded number of signs--"
1993.92-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1900.718,1902.67,But the purpose of your statute is content-based.
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1904.554,1921.815,"--Well, Your Honor, if one has a purpose to allow speech consistent with the First Amendment, and one goes about implementing that in a content-neutral way to allow all speech along with the particular type of political speech that you have most in mind, I believe that's okay."
1993.92-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1921.815,1928.219,One of your arguments was that you didn't have... or that the people of this town didn't have reasonable alternatives.
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1938.51,1941.545,"I don't believe it does, Justice Souter."
1993.92-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1973.1,1977.052,"So alternative has got to include a sign alternative then, in your view."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1977.052,1982.539,"Well, alternatives have to include something that is of the same nature and quality, and we believe--"
1993.92-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1982.539,1986.174,"Well, what else is of the nature and quality of a sign except a sign?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,1986.174,1990.46,"--In the context of a resident speaking at her own home, we maintain nothing."
1993.92-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1998.215,2006.237,"Well then, in fact it's not so much the sign that you're relying on, it's the capacity to speak from one's own property, isn't that it?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2006.237,2017.277,"That's part of our position, Your Honor, but here we're talking about a particular mode of expression, and we're talking about whether there's some alternative to that mode of expression that is of equal--"
1993.92-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2017.277,2035.923,"No, but as I understand what you were just saying, if the city said, we're going to set aside two acres on one of the downtown streets, and anyone can put up a sign down there, this particular woman can go down and put up a sign about the Gulf War, you would not find that an adequate alternative, isn't that correct?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2035.923,2037.156,"--That's correct, Justice Souter."
1993.92-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2037.156,2041.494,And the reason you wouldn't is that you believe the speech has got to be allowed from one's own property.
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2041.494,2047.648,"That's correct, and the reason is that speaking from one's own property has special communicative impact."
1993.92-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2053.735,2055.754,"Well, what is your best authority for that?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2061.908,2065.193,"I believe the Linmark case would be the best authority, Justice Kennedy."
1993.92-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2070.078,2075.148,"Well, but it seems to me... because that has just a common sense functional aspect to it."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2078.183,2081.302,"--Well, we believe we're talking about the same thing here, Justice Kennedy."
1993.92-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2081.302,2083.385,The woman is an extension of her house?
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2083.385,2084.67,Absolutely.
1993.92-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2097.145,2102.298,"Well, what if she holds strong views about selling lemonade, can she put a sign up,"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2104.815,2112.404,"Well, Your Honor, that is a commercial undertaking, and I believe that via zoning laws, cities may regulate commercial activity."
1993.92-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2112.404,2114.939,So the city could prohibit that sort of a sign?
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2114.939,2116.139,"Well, perhaps."
1993.92-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.843,2125.747,"Well, supposing it were just a flat prohibition of all commercial signs?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2125.747,2135.203,"Commercial signs it has greater ability to regulate, Your Honor, because there are other alternatives for engaging in commercial speech."
1993.92-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2150.812,2175.844,"I suppose she has an equivalent right to speak on her own property, at least, so I guess the city could not prevent her from setting up, you know, a soapbox and holding forth about the evils of the Gulf War, or about her favorite political candidate, and attracting a crowd on the street because she's a very good speaker, and people milling around in this residential neighborhood."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2178.713,2180.815,"You may not ban that, and certainly again--"
1993.92-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.815,2181.215,Right.
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2190.337,2192.039,"--Not quite, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2202.245,2205.947,Supposing she wants to get a bullhorn to amplify her message?
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2211.934,2225.759,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, they may regulate that aspect, because once you get into bullhorns, you're getting into the Ward type situation, you're getting into the Kovacs Sound type situation, and you are talking about regulating volume now."
1993.92-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2227.793,2230.228,"Because it goes off of her property, is that it?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2236.632,2237.382,--That's correct.
1993.92-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2237.382,2241.536,"I mean, if she wants to put a sign behind a hedge, where only people who come on her property see it, that's okay."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2249.207,2254.261,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, because Ms. Gilleo's sign stands silently on her own property."
1993.92-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.213,2258.08,It's not visually... this is visual clutter.
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2262.917,2269.453,"It is visually silent, Justice Scalia, unless you choose to look over on Ms. Gilleo's property."
1993.92-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2269.453,2282.613,"Then why don't you take the position that if the city can prohibit the signs in the manner in which it's trying to do here, you can equally, or could equally well prohibit the person from standing on the soapbox and speaking in a manner that could be heard next door."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2282.613,2289.784,"Well, Justice Souter, I believe I said that they may regulate volume, they may impose other time, place, and manner regulation."
1993.92-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2289.784,2294.088,"Yes, but we're not talking about the bullhorn, or let's say just in a manner that could be heard on the street."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2304.961,2309.514,I don't believe that the City of Ladue may ban that mode of expression entirely.
1993.92-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2309.514,2315.751,"Well, that may be, but if they can ban what they're purporting to ban here, can they ban that as well?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2315.751,2324.524,"If you accept that they can ban what they ban here, I believe the implication of that position is yes, they can ban her from standing on a soapbox at her property."
1993.92-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2346.271,2355.745,"Well, except the problem there is you'd suddenly find yourself in the public forum doctrine, and the city's claim here is there's no public forum."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2369.803,2401.44,"Justice Souter, on the continuum of nonpublic forum, limited public forum, we believe that Ms. Gilleo's private home here has to be viewed as either the equivalent of a public forum for protected purposes, or even stronger, because again we're talking about a citizen's right to speak from her own home, as the Court recognized had special significance in the Vincent case, the Court recognized that in Spence, the Court has recognized that in a number of other cases."
1993.92-1856,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2401.44,2406.511,"Can you tell me... it's not a very important question... do they prohibit ""Keep off the grass"" signs?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2406.511,2407.878,"They don't, Your Honor."
1993.92-1856,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2409.546,2411.998,"""Keep off the grass"" is a directional sign?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2411.998,2415.534,"They've made clear that ""No trespassing"" signs are allowed."
1993.92-1856,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.938,2421.721,"And ""Beware of the dog""."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2425.173,2428.758,"""Beware of dog"" is also permitted in any size, and in any number."
1993.92-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2428.758,2429.96,But I just want to make one thing clear.
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2434.661,2436.713,"I'm not aware of any, Your Honor."
1993.92-1856,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2436.713,2466.733,"Mr. Greiman, would it be a reasonable alternative if at some public and prominent site within the community... for instance, city hall... there were a space or a big bulletin board allowed where the homeowners could place signs of any type, and could identify themselves as being homeowners within the city, so that everyone who saw it would know, this is the expression of the view of the homeowner who put it up?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2466.733,2469.769,"I don't believe so, Justice O'Connor, for this reason."
1993.92-1856,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2477.107,2483.694,"Well, how is that if the sign itself allows you to identify yourself as a homeowner in the community?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2483.694,2496.902,"Well, for example, a ""Tax the Rich"" sign posted in front of an affluent home carries a different communicative impact than would the exact same sign displayed in a less affluent area."
1993.92-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2503.425,2513.78,"Mr. Cherrick, if you reject the notion that this is a place restriction and therefore okay, what about the notion that it's simply a manner restriction and therefore okay?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2527.623,2533.194,"Well, Justice Scalia, that gets into arbitrariness, and perhaps viewpoint discrimination."
1993.92-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2536.646,2537.513,"Not American flags, any flag."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2545.935,2563.88,"--That suggests that if one wants to display an American flag at one's home, one can very easily go down to the corner store, buy one, and put it up, but if you want to display a custom-made flag message you have to go to a great deal of trouble, perhaps, or a great deal of expense to have your own sign custom-made."
1993.92-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2563.88,2566.915,All you've got to do is get a piece of cloth and some paint.
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2566.915,2570.55,"That may be more difficult, Your Honor--"
1993.92-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2570.55,2572.152,Is it more difficult than making a sign?
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2574.604,2576.954,"--Well, Ms. Gilleo didn't have to make her own signs."
1993.92-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2579.59,2583.21,"Sign-makers and flag-makers can make them equally easily, can't they?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2583.21,2587.162,"--They may make them, but they don't make them, and if one has to custom-make--"
1993.92-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2587.162,2599.654,"Well, they don't because the word hasn't gotten out, but I mean the flag business is--"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2602.672,2611.261,"--Perhaps, and it hasn't been clear to me through the city's position in this case whether they concede that you can make your own sign out of a bed sheet, for example."
1993.92-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2611.261,2614.629,"Well, if it's true, what about the answer to Justice Scalia's question?"
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2616.529,2641.614,"If it is true, then that confirms the arbitrariness and the content-discriminatory nature of the ordinance, and the lack of validity to their asserted reasons, because certainly a homemade sign on a bed sheet has no lesser impact on so-called visual blight than does a small, 8-1/2 X 11 inch sign posted inside a window of somebody's home."
1993.92-1856,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2657.306,2666.329,"Well, just to be sure of where your position takes you, I would assume you would have to say that the Federal Highway Beautification Act is similarly invalid."
1993.92-1856,1,25412,gerald_p_greiman,,2666.329,2668.864,"We do not say that at all, Justice O'Connor."
1993.92-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2675.552,2678.054,"Thank you, Mr. Greiman."
1993.92-1856,2,37685,paul_bender,,2692.797,2696.867,"Right, it is different, and perhaps I should start there."
1993.92-1856,3,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3261.519,3263.72,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1856,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3276.195,3282.032,"I think one could know that one way or another now because the city has not been allowed to have this ordinance for sometime, right?"
1993.92-1856,3,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3282.032,3284.801,"--It has been enjoined, and--"
1993.92-1856,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3284.801,3291.971,"So... I think for some 3 years, so there is... it's not in this record, but it is--"
1993.92-1856,3,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3291.971,3298.292,"--There's nothing in the record, and I don't think you'd want me to discuss what's off the record of the problems that have--"
1993.92-1856,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3298.292,3301.513,--Presumably the only people who live in the city are people who don't like signs.
1993.92-1856,3,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3308.632,3313.403,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I think it's important to emphasize the limiting principles of our submission."
1993.92-1856,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3331.615,3348.826,"Are you saying that the community that Justice Blackmun... that you told Justice Blackmun about couldn't now see the light and say, oh, we want to do what Ladue... because they've already... they've just gone downhill and they can't improve their situation?"
1993.92-1856,3,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3348.826,3356.33,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's up to every city to define its sense of values, its sense of community, and we're not saying that every city has to have this ordinance."
1993.92-1856,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3357.23,3359.699,But every city that wants it can have it?
1993.92-1856,3,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3359.699,3363.503,"--Yes, if that's... and that is what a land-use and zoning plan is all about."
1993.92-1856,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3368.138,3379.346,"Would a city need anything more than... you're not suggesting that because Ladue has all these other regulations it can have this one as well, or are you suggesting that?"
1993.92-1856,3,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3389.551,3395.872,"--If it had the same type of interest that Ladue has and did it in a constitutional fashion, but--"
1993.92-1856,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3395.872,3398.474,Just copy this ordinance word for word.
1993.92-1856,3,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3398.474,3407.596,"--Well, that may well be the case, but not all cities would want to live in a type of aesthetic community that Ladue had."
1993.92-1856,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3407.596,3411.734,"If they wanted to they could, though, and it wouldn't matter that they didn't have a fancy city planner come in at the outset."
1993.92-1856,3,29665,jordan_b_cherrick,,3411.734,3412.134,Yes.
1993.92-1856,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3428.659,3430.159,"Thank you, Mr. Cherrick."
