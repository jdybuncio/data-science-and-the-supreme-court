1970.5481,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.292,"Mr. Schlanger, you may proceed whenever you’re ready."
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,6.292,10.308,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,259.837,266.125,"The second period of attendance at the University was under a program quite different from the first one, was it not?"
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,266.125,268.221,"Yes, sir it was."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,268.221,269.719,For the Operation Bootstrap?
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,269.719,270.12,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,270.12,281.107,And you were at that -- during the second interval you were therefore in a different status in a military point of view aren’t you on permissive temporary duty or something like that?
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,281.107,289.001,"Your Honor, the Government’s brief makes this distinction between a permanent assignment and a temporary duty assignment."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,332.837,336.185,"While one directed your travel and the other permitted your travel, is that right?"
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,336.185,339.959,"Yes, sir but both were voluntary programs."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,346.563,349.409,Which your claim on the merits is that that was a condition of your reenlistment?
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,349.409,350.567,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,350.567,357.43,"But the second attendance at the University was one well, Operation Bootstrap but at your own expense?"
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,357.43,358.409,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,365.199,369.273,Haven’t you got also a habeas corpus proceeding pending in Georgia now.
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,369.273,370.488,"No sir, no longer."
1970.5481,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,370.488,371.505,No longer?
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,371.505,391.509,That had been on appeal to the Fifth Circuit on an issue of exhaustion of remedies and all the remedies suggested by the Government have since been exhausted and I believe I submitted to the clerk papers from the Fifth Circuit containing an order entering a voluntary dismissal since the question of exhaustion is moot now.
1970.5481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.992,570.715,"Mr. Schlanger, in that connection straight me out on one fact."
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,570.715,571.03,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,571.03,577.118,Had your leave expired when you instituted the habeas corpus?
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,577.118,578.966,"No, sir."
1970.5481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,632.866,644.46,"The next question is the reason for your instituting the action in Georgia -- in Arizona rather than Georgia and perhaps you’ve answered it, the presence of witnesses there in record?"
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,644.46,645.372,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,671.308,678.067,"Of course, even if you were venued in Georgia maybe the case could be transferred to Arizona?"
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,678.067,689.065,"Well sir, the way I understand 1404 (a) which is what I assume is being referred to Arizona would have to have had jurisdiction originally."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,734.078,734.764,Mr. Schlanger?
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,734.764,735.873,Sir.
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,735.873,739.132,You are now stationed in Iceland or supposed to be?
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,739.132,741.809,"On the Air Forces bookkeeping, yes sir."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,746.054,748.65,"If you were, let’s assume you were physically now in Iceland --"
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,748.65,749.549,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,749.549,757.122,-- and wanted to bring this kind habeas corpus action where under your theory could bring it?
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,757.122,762.764,"I believe unfortunately, Your Honor that I could only bring it in the District of Columbia."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,762.764,765.779,Only there because that’s where the Secretary of the Air Force is?
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,765.779,784.521,"Well, apparently Your Honor that it’s been held by this Court never directly but at least implicitly that the District Court for the District of Columbia has jurisdiction over American citizens outside any other District Courts and therefore the District of Columbia would be a proper district."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,800.124,802.798,Or you’d be appealing the effects of the custody in Iceland?
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,802.798,804.735,"Yes sir, there is no doubt about that."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,804.735,806.849,And that’s no U.S. district there?
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,806.849,813.009,"Yes sir, but for purposes of habeas corpus that would be the District of Columbia."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,892.891,907.6,"On the other hand, if one should accept your theory all the way if you had a week’s leave you could just look around with any one of the 50 States and fly up to North Dakota and bring your habeas corpus action up there?"
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,907.6,910.277,"No sir, I don’t believe so."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,923.608,924.117,Right.
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,924.117,931.321,"In McCabe v. Secretary of the Air Force and Judge Wyzanski looked at the facts and circumstances of the case and said, “You have no contacts in this district."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,948.34,952.155,"Of course, International Shoe contact has to do with personal service, as you know."
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,952.155,953.327,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,954.535,961.808,"What test, what limits would you put on? Would you just leave it on the discretion of the district judge?"
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,961.808,975.636,"I would say sir that broadly for those people contesting their induction let’s say which I am not, this is an enlistment, but their induction is conscientious objectors for instance."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1011.683,1016.781,"So you say he should at least be able to file his habeas corpus action in a place where he lived when he was inducted, isn’t it?"
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,1016.781,1022.879,"Yes sir, because that is the district with the most significant impact on the facts of the case."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1022.879,1032.09,"Well, then would you confront it to the district with the most significant impacts on the case?"
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,1032.09,1038.276,I am searching for some way to simply say I would like to be fair and equitable.
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1038.276,1039.18,I don’t mean to be.
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,1039.18,1039.579,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1039.579,1045.902,I was examining you but undoubtedly you thought a great deal more about this case than we have so far and --
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,1045.902,1046.155,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1091.902,1093.867,Very well Mr. Schlanger.
1970.5481,0,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,1093.867,1098.538,Thank you Your Honor.
1970.5481,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1098.538,1101.698,Mr. Solicitor General?
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1101.698,1104.934,May it please the Court.
1970.5481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1452.458,1454.203,What degree did he receive?
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1454.203,1454.505,What?
1970.5481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1454.505,1455.166,What degree did he receive?
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1455.166,1457.303,I do not know Mr. Justice?
1970.5481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1457.303,1459.313,"Bachelor of Science of Mathematics, sir."
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1459.313,1464.018,"Bachelor of Science, Mr. Schlanger advises me."
1970.5481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1585.074,1592.702,There was some talk that we have been supplied with something with respect to those proceedings and I don’t seem to have it personally perhaps my brothers too.
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1592.702,1597.393,I believe it was filed with the clerk by Sergeant Schlanger.
1970.5481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1636.969,1642.09,And the District Court’s decision had been to deny the application for failure to exhaust administrative remedies?
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1642.09,1647.515,The District Court’s decision had been to deny the application for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
1970.5481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1657.485,1661.58,Or in any event a new petition could be filed?
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1661.58,1664.022,Or a new application could be filed.
1970.5481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1664.022,1667.375,"Or not and now that he is in Iceland, could it be?"
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1667.375,1678.943,It might be doubtful whether a new application could be filed in the Middle District of Georgia but the one which is pending there is undoubtedly remains within the jurisdiction of the Georgia Court.
1970.5481,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1678.943,1686.885,But he could always file in the District of Columbia if there is some infirmity in the Georgia Procedure.
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1686.885,1693.559,"He could file in the District of Columbia, I believe Mr. Chief Justice if he is outside of the United States."
1970.5481,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1703.07,1709.918,I am assuming that his presence in the United States now is by the grace of the Air Force for letting him come here to present his case?
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1709.918,1715.145,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice by the grace of the Air Force and that the request of the Solicitor General’s office."
1970.5481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1715.145,1719.694,"I suppose he could file over there that day, couldn’t he?"
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1722.471,1743.475,He certainly can file but whether the District Court or the District of Columbia has jurisdiction and that situation I would not want to be completely clear on but I suspect it has if his orders -- if he is no longer under any duty to report to the base in Georgia.
1970.5481,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1920.787,1926.024,"Solicitor General, in respect to the question of venue, do you claim that the writ doesn’t matter at all?"
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1926.024,1928.018,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1970.5481,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1959.805,1963.302,How do you force that down if he is not in custody?
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1963.302,1972.673,"No, that he is in custody and rightfully in custody and that a breach of contract would not entitle into a release from custody."
1970.5481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1972.673,1975.315,"Of course that question is not before us, that’s the merits of his habeas corpus action."
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1975.315,1985.502,That is the question on the merits but arises on the face of the petition and is I submit a further ground to support the judgment of the District Court in dismissing the petition.
1970.5481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2010.055,2017.077,Although this is something not -- this isn’t a question that you pose in your brief?
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2017.077,2021.002,"No, Mr. Justice it’s not directly stated in the brief."
1970.5481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2021.002,2024.273,And that does go the merits of his application for habeas corpus?
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2024.273,2025.229,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1970.5481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2025.229,2026.814,And concerning here was that --
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2026.814,2027.993,But only being the case the court.
1970.5481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2027.993,2029.015,"-- (Voice Overlap) in jurisdiction, are we?"
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2029.015,2032.345,Only in case of the court found there was jurisdiction.
1970.5481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2150.631,2156.356,"The Solicitor General, he didn’t have to report to anybody in Arizona any military person?"
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2156.356,2157.835,No person whatever Mr.--
1970.5481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2157.835,2159.127,No supervision?
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2159.127,2162.479,"No supervision, Mr. Justice."
1970.5481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2162.479,2167.595,"Well, how did they found out that he didn’t attend classes?"
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2167.595,2170.377,That’s at a different time.
1970.5481,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2199.443,2208.482,So that even if there was a possibility could bring habeas on the first case you say that is certainly not true in the second.
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2208.482,2238.002,"Yes, Mr. Justice that is precisely our position, this might have been a different case had habeas corpus been brought in 1968 although I would still say as I suggested to Mr. Justice Stewart that this is not the kind of issue that ought to be under taken to be resolved in habeas corpus."
1970.5481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2620.617,2623.806,When does the petitioner’s present enlistment expire?
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2623.806,2623.885,When?
1970.5481,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2623.885,2625.464,Some time this year?
1970.5481,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2627.832,2658.355,"Well, it would have expired in 19-- late in 1971 except that there is provision that when certain types of permissive leave are granted such as that for which he went to the University of Arizona in 1969 not only is that added on but triple is added on so that I understand that somewhat more than a year still remains on his enlistment but I do not know the exact time of expiring."
1970.5481,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2658.355,2661.372,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,2664.233,2669.817,"Thank you Your Honor, I hardly know where to begin in rebuttal Your Honor."
1970.5481,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2681.042,2682.613,Who’s Mr. Reynolds?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,2682.613,2685.733,"The Assistant Solicitor General, sir who briefed the case."
1970.5481,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2685.733,2687.142,I see.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,2687.142,2712.687,"Initially sir, Mr. Griswold now hold claims that I was not in custody at the time the petition was filed and I would like to respectfully call your attention to page 12 of the Government’s brief at which the Government asserts that under 28 U.S.C 2241 he as clearly “in custody” in the United Stats Force at the time he sought habeas corpus relief."
1970.5481,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2712.687,2714.621,I think you must have misunderstood him.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,2729.532,2729.924,"No, sir."
1970.5481,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2744.983,2751.897,As he was directing that to the period when you were on leave free from military discipline and free from any obligation to report.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,2751.897,2754.909,"Yes sir, that’s the time at which I filed the case."
1970.5481,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2754.909,2762.931,But he wasn’t questioning the military duty as a basis for the writ.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,2770.377,2770.723,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2966.004,2975.794,I think what the Solicitor General said was that your original petition if it remained there would still be a good petition even though you’ve subsequently been moved.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,2975.794,2978.091,Even though there remains no respondent in the district?
1970.5481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2978.091,2983.6,I think the Solicitor General did not suggest that it was all that clear that you could now file a petition in Georgia.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,2983.6,2989.163,"No sir, even on the point that that one is still pending."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3031.859,3039.918,Aren’t you really arguing that there was a breach of contract but the Solicitor General said you are arguing?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3039.918,3043.388,"Yes, sir that underlies the habeas corpus petition that gave rise to the action."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3043.388,3050.025,What else do you have other than an alleged breach of contract?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3050.025,3051.327,To raise my habeas corpus on sir?
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3051.327,3054.34,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3054.34,3056.752,"Nothing at all, sir."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3062.197,3076.895,Do you think that you want to establish a precedent that if being enlist and is in commission as sergeant that he has a breach of contract action which he can bring by habeas corpus?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3076.895,3082.888,"Your Honor, I would I think if enlistment is anything but Carte Blanche to the military."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3095.456,3101.265,If you grant all of that as habeas corpus the proper vehicle to attack it.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3101.265,3102.509,"Yes sir, I believe so."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3102.509,3113.989,But suppose the Air Force promise that you could go to school for three months and they only let you go for two months that would void the enlistment?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3113.989,3114.872,"No, sir."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3115.361,3116.397,Would it?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3118.33,3121.798,Because in my case sir we have a status difference.
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3159.832,3163.904,Could they have prevented you from going the second time?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3163.904,3164.643,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3167.176,3169.123,So they let you go?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3169.123,3169.948,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3171.547,3175.597,And then they revoked this.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3175.597,3176.718,The second time?
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3176.718,3176.84,Yes.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3176.84,3177.076,"No, sir."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3181.136,3184.345,And then what happened that violate the contract?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3184.345,3187.117,"The contract had already been violated, sir."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3191.347,3194.708,Then why didn’t you bring habeas then?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3194.708,3197.754,Because at that point there was an impediment to filing.
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3213.274,3216.523,"Well, could it also have ended by your reenlistment?"
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3216.523,3217.39,Pardon sir?
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3217.39,3222.645,Could it also have ended by your reenlistment?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3228.331,3228.572,"No, sir."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3230.688,3231.677,Yes.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3231.677,3236.494,And then the alleged breach occurred in June of 1968.
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3241.725,3243.139,Right.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3243.139,3258.737,And so what we are faced with is the question of whether the military authorities can take action which gives rise to a claim for habeas corpus then remove the serviceman from that jurisdiction prior to as being able to initiate action because of some impediments or other.
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3258.737,3261.665,"Well, I think thee Solicitor disagrees with that."
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3265.434,3273.556,"Yes sir, but assuming that we did have habeas jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction."
1970.5481,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3343.892,3345.903,May I ask you exactly --
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3345.903,3346.546,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3346.546,3348.998,-- what is it you’re after?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3348.998,3354.623,"At this point, sir I would like to be discharged from the Air Force."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3377.136,3381.484,And when you get a relief from the Army for breach of contract?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3381.484,3382.821,Sir?
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3382.821,3387.241,Is your basis that Government has breached its contract with you?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3387.241,3393.24,That under law is it that at the moment that contract for under which I was reenlisted is void.
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3393.24,3395.334,Which part of it was breached?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3395.334,3399.495,The entire contract since it was a contract based upon my --
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3399.495,3402.745,What did they agree to do that they have not done?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3402.745,3404.081,"Commission me, sir."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3404.081,3404.774,Commission?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3404.774,3407.183,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3407.183,3409.641,And you want to get that tried in habeas corpus?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3409.641,3410.855,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3437.353,3440.981,Do you think that is the only way you could bring a suit against the Government by habeas corpus?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3440.981,3441.977,In this particular action?
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3441.977,3443.283,The breach of contract?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3443.283,3447.232,"In this particular action to affect my release from custody?Yes sir, I do."
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3447.232,3449.268,To affect your release from custody?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3449.268,3450.588,Yes sir.
1970.5481,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3452.558,3458.007,"You mean if they breach any part of a contract with you, you can get out of the Army completely?"
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3458.007,3459.867,"No sir, not any part."
1970.5481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3474.389,3478.246,Either -- and you’ve asked in the alternative either they make you an officer or they let you out.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3478.246,3478.414,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3478.414,3479.036,Is that correct?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3479.036,3479.691,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3479.691,3482.218,And you don’t want money damages?
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3482.218,3486.624,I have been thinking about it of late with the expenses [Laughter].
1970.5481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3491.054,3493.561,I’ll be surprised this lawsuit goes you don’t want money damages.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3493.561,3493.969,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3493.969,3496.213,You want either to be commissioned or let go.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3496.213,3499.66,Yes sir and I contend that the courts have no power to order my commissioning.
1970.5481,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3499.66,3500.448,Right.
1970.5481,2,28028,herbert_p_schlanger,,3500.448,3501.951,"Yes, sir."
1970.5481,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3503.106,3505.177,"Thank you Mr. Schlanger, Mr. Solicitor General."
