1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,28.775,"We will hear arguments next in number 70-7, Sarno against the Illinois Crime Investigating Commissioner."
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,31.946,39.974,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this Court.
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,269.544,274.473,"Is this Commission a Legislative Commission, Mr. Whalen?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,274.473,276.957,"Yes, it is."
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,276.957,290.268,"It is much like I suppose arisen now, but it is not much like a Congressional Committee conducting an inquiry into this particular subject?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,290.268,295.331,I would like commit to --
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,295.331,305.283,"What are duties in the event that does as -- it does has what it is before that do answer questions, what does it do with him?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,305.283,314.184,"Well, I can only assume Mr. Justice that it is to report as to the various prosecuting agents."
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,314.184,315.9,Not just to the State Legislature?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,315.9,326.953,"No and then, I am really not sure of my answer, but it is my understanding that that would be the function."
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,326.953,333.151,"So, it appeared correctly, you are understanding that this agency is a kin to the New Jersey Commission from which we have just heard?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,333.151,334.703,"Oh, I believe very much so."
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,334.703,336.637,Rather than just a legislative?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,336.637,338.127,"Yes sir, yes indeed."
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,338.127,338.574,(Inaudible)
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,338.574,341.076,"That is my understanding, Sir."
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,341.076,360.746,"If there is nothing that will prevent, if the committee of the Congress conducted an investigation, it is traditional, is it not, that all those reports are made available to the Attorney General of the United States, if they seem to disclose violations of law?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,360.746,361.133,I believe so.
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,361.133,362.309,It is routine?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,362.309,363.37,Yes sir.
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,364.932,373.323,"In the first instance does this Commission report back to the legislature, do you know?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,373.323,381.707,It is my understanding that it does for the purpose of the legislature enacting further laws.
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,381.707,383.79,Is its report made public?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,383.79,420.155,"Its report is made public, its hearings are public, in every sense of the word public, that is advertised in other words, its -- It is a very public proceeding and under these conditions, to petitioners it became apparent that the questions were based on records that had been illegally seized from the home of the petitioner McCarty on a previous occasion."
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,653.232,665.121,"Well, what has the Supreme Court of Illinois held with respect to whether the statute is co-extensive with Fifth Amendment?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,665.121,688.115,"This -- it was first interpreted upon this instant appeal and there the Supreme Court held that under this statute, the Court did not have power to grant express immunity, but that Murphy Work versus The Waterfront supplied the necessary compliment and held it constitutional."
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,688.823,690.291,"Now, how did, co-extensive with the Fifth Amendment?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,690.291,692.078,"Co-extensive, yes."
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,692.078,694.843,"Well then, let us pursue a particular case."
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,741.196,749.312,Provided Mr. Chief Justice that he could establish that that evidence was independently obtained.
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,764.369,772.543,"From the States, the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois treating the question has said that it is co-extensive with the Fifth Amendment."
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,773.825,775.088,Yes.
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,775.088,790.03,"But, whether they are not being obliged in reviewing any future conviction, would they not be bound to see to it that he got that degree of protection by whatever steps?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,790.03,799.69,Illinois has never decided that the burden is upon the prosecution or who upon whom the burden was placed.
1971.70-7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,866.535,882.526,"Did you present the Supreme Court of Illinois the issue or the claim that this statute was unconstitutional because it did not grant absolute immunity, but only use immunity?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,882.526,884.192,I did Mr. Justice White.
1971.70-7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.192,896.069,"And it decided that the statute granted as much as Murphy required, and that that was enough?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,896.069,902.83,We were concerned there with the provision that where the Court -- recently approve the Court.
1971.70-7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,902.83,905.235,I understand that that is a different issue?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,905.235,905.702,Yes.
1971.70-7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,905.702,906.765,That is a different issue?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,906.765,907.007,Yes.
1971.70-7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.007,914.964,"And I ask you, did you also present the issue of absolute as against use immunity to the Supreme Court of Illinois?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,914.964,918.997,"No, it was not raised in that manner Mr. Justice White."
1971.70-7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,918.997,922.645,And the Supreme Court of Illinois did not pass on that?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,922.645,924.856,I would say they did not.
1971.70-7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,924.856,931.111,What is the issue doing here?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,931.111,935.993,"Whether or not the statute affords an immunity, as brought in Fifth precede --"
1971.70-7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,935.993,937.189,Yes.
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,937.189,944.667,"It is our contention that under these circumstances, it does not and that it was not intended to."
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,944.667,947.028,Would you disagree with the Supreme Court of Illinois then?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,947.028,948.965,I certainly do Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,948.965,961.249,"Well, would that and I repeat would that Court not be found in the future case against your particular client which you claim was derivative from this investigation?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,969.708,970.013,"Yes, sir, provided --"
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,970.013,971.866,-- defined in the Murphy among other cases?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,971.866,985.908,"Provided Mr. Chief Justice that he could establish that this was the fruit or the links and he alleges that under these circumstances, he could not and of course when you rely on Murphy --"
1971.70-7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,985.908,989.757,"You say, I take it that they must got absolute immunity?"
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,989.757,990.792,Transactional Immunity?
1971.70-7,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,990.792,991.759,Transactional Immunity?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,991.759,992.272,Yes.
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,998.381,1001.55,"Well, the Illinois Supreme Court did not toll one way or the other on it --"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1001.55,1002.587,"It did not, sir"
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1002.587,1009.327,"-- question as I read their answers and you said that you say constitutionally, you are entitled to transactional immunity of your client?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1009.327,1011.989,Yes Mr. Justice.
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1011.989,1023.641,"And, I would suggest off hand that at least a casual reading of the first part of 203-14 seems to grant your client transactional immunity, does is not? Using the very word, transaction?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1023.641,1040.792,"It does use the word transaction, but it also uses the language to which he gave answer and we do not believe that that affords them Transactional Immunity."
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1040.792,1042.78,To which he gave answer or produced evidence?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1042.78,1056.26,"Yes, because the example that I have given and which is abstracted and the question, where in Cook County do your costumers need you to make your dues payments."
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1090.807,1096.232,"Well, the fact is that the Illinois Supreme Court really has not been construed (Voice Overlap)?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1096.232,1097.408,That is true Mr. Justice.
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1097.408,1123.454,"I have the idea that you are also objecting in this case to the second part of the 203-14 that part of it that purports to give some kind of immunity against the released or at least required -- at least directs the commission not to require with a witness to answer with respect to prosecuted, could lead to the danger of prosecution in another jurisdiction, are you objecting to that?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1123.454,1125.909,I am objecting to that sir.
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1129.988,1131.578,"Right, it has actually had the information."
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1131.578,1140.686,Not to -- not to grant immunity if it reasonably appeared to that Court that the answer could involve prosecution in another State or under the law --
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1140.686,1141.247,Right.
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1141.247,1157.837,"-- of and we say that a witness confronted with this situation is misled or at least he does not know, they will be doubt in his mind because he cannot tell -- he cannot tell under those circumstances just to extent of the immunity is being granted."
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1164.122,1174.813,"Well, He really is not being granted any immunity, is he, in the second part against the prosecution by another sovereign because it is just the direction to the Court and it is --"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1174.813,1175.399,It is a direction to the Court.
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1175.399,1178.925,"And the Court tells him to answer, that is it."
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1180.634,1187.468,"Yes, except that the petitioner faced with the statute does not know."
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1207.449,1213.087,Or is that already that he contests on that against citation for refuse to answer?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1213.087,1213.856,Yes Sir.
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1213.856,1214.721,Can he?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1214.721,1216.711,Yes.
1971.70-7,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1220.611,1230.17,"Mr. Whalen, way or way back, you said that these questions came from material that was illegally seized from of the defendant?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1230.17,1232.503,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-7,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1232.503,1245.796,"And, if the Government used that information to go to each one of these dues joints, what could you do about it?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1245.796,1253.264,"This of course was a -- at the time of these were seized, this was at the indictment level."
1971.70-7,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1267.616,1270.699,But what is the difference?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1270.699,1273.177,What would be the difference?
1971.70-7,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1288.935,1294.932,I still do not understand why they had asked him the question if they already had the information?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1294.932,1296.923,"Perhaps, I do not make myself clear."
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1328.699,1329.942,Let me get clear if I can.
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1345.267,1345.504,Yes.
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1345.504,1348.747,That is your position as to what Illinois has held?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1348.747,1378.318,"Yes and Illinois then referred to Murphy versus -- the Illinois Supreme Court referred to Murphy versus Waterfront Commission, but it is our position that that applies only where in the State proceeding, a State witness hears Federal Prosecution and here we are talking about further State Prosecution."
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1435.02,1440.168,How do you really test that in the case like this Mr. Whalen?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1457.836,1466.106,"I would say Mr. Chief Justice that it would be impossible to do so, even at the trail of other subsequent crime."
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1469.384,1496.686,"But first, you have a number of alternatives that he may never be prosecuted in which case, there will be no problem is assuming he went on and answered or if he prosecuted, you could assert that the Supreme Court of Illinois has said that his immunity is freedom from prosecution and was co-extensive with Fifth Amendment protection and that issue would be presented by that case, would it not?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1496.686,1513.934,"Except that the -- he would still be, and I do not know how to answer otherwise, he would still be absolutely unable to ascertain this or to establish this fact."
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1513.934,1530.17,Or what if hypothetically the burden is on the prosecution to establish that the case rested on information from an independent source?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1532.728,1535.934,"No, Mr. Chief Justice it would not."
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1564.359,1581.387,"As I understand, your argument is simply this Mr. Whalen if your client is entitled under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment and he continued to refuse to answer these questions until or unless the State makes clear to him that he is given transactional immunity, is it not?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1581.387,1582.667,It could be stated -- formally
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1582.667,1584.019,And it should probably in that right here in this case?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1584.019,1584.145,Yes Sir.
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1584.145,1586.419,And so far the State has not tolled any (Inaudible)?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1586.419,1586.854,"Yes, sir."
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1596.213,1615.492,"Now, if the Supreme Court of Illinois had said in this litigation that this immunity statute extends transactional immunity to your client, the Councilman against Hitchcock Immunity, that is -- you would be satisfied, you could have won your case, and you concede then that your client’s would have the ability to answer, do you not?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1615.492,1618.294,Certainly Mr. Justice.
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1625.412,1628.365,The answer is -- the Illinois Supreme Court did not give you an answer in this case?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1628.365,1629.252,That is right Sir.
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1629.252,1630.643,So you still have an area there --
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1630.643,1630.881,I am still --
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1630.881,1638.296,Got an assurance of transactional immunity and assured your point that the constitution accords you that.
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1644.31,1647.147,That is exactly the point Mr. Justice.
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1661.066,1668.665,"Yes, but for a Court to say the immunity given is as broad as the constitutional protection is double talk, is not it?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1668.665,1672.362,I believe so.
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1673.588,1680.594,"You got me that to say what the immunity is and you are entitled in answer to your -- the issue you present, it that your point?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1680.594,1685.44,That is our point.
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1775.415,1778.916,"Right, this act before us has now been amended?"
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1778.916,1779.749,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1779.749,1780.802,In what respect?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1780.802,1788.436,"The provision of -- the provision that the Court, if the reason it appeared to the Court that --"
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1788.436,1789.101,That part of it?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1789.101,1790.057,That has been eliminated.
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1790.057,1791.198,Eliminated entirely?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1791.198,1792.103,"No, it has been eliminated."
1971.70-7,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1792.409,1794.852,And there no substitute to this?
1971.70-7,0,24757,frank_g_whalen,,1794.852,1795.52,No.
1971.70-7,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1873.935,1879.379,"Very well, thank you Mr. Whalen."
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,1883.331,1887.502,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1971.70-7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1900.966,1915.484,You characterize the Illinois Supreme Court’s opinion in this case as being containing you strong or an ambiguous language with respect to the question of whether or not this statute gives transactional immunity?
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,1915.484,1923.93,"Frankly Mr. Justice Stewart, it is not as strong at some of the language contained in the cases preceded."
1971.70-7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1923.93,1925.468,"It does not even address itself to the question, does it?"
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,1925.468,1939.625,"Well, I would submit it Justice Stewart that it does say that Section speaking of the specific Section involved here grants immunity to defendants from further prosecution."
1971.70-7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1939.625,1941.063,"Well, that does not answer the question."
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,1941.063,1944.821,"No, I appreciate it does not carry that kind of language."
1971.70-7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1973.484,1975.983,"Of course, that was under a different statute?"
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,1975.983,1976.578,Yes.
1971.70-7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1976.578,1990.888,"And, that was at the time when it was not clear that the Federal Constitution guarantee against compulsory self incrimination without the approval of State because it is prior in the law, against them?"
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,1990.888,2005.615,"Well, Your Honor, in 1953, the Illinois Supreme Court had occasion to consider the identical language in the Cigarette Tax Act, the Immunity Section of it, the identical language."
1971.70-7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2042.529,2045.87,That was identical language or statutory language?
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,2045.87,2047.747,"Statutory language, interpreting statutory language."
1971.70-7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2047.747,2048.505,Not the same statute?
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,2048.505,2049.237,Not the same statute.
1971.70-7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2049.237,2052.507,"Okay, but some of the statute from which the statute borrows the language?"
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,2052.507,2069.266,"Exactly, and I just to reiterate again, this going to stand in the Immunity Act of 1954 which is Court Upheld as granting complete immunity."
1971.70-7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2069.266,2085.684,"You are talking about 1953-54, that was prior to law against Hogan (ph) and it was any business with this Court would be, was it, what kind of immunity Illinois gave because Illinois did not have any Federal Constitutional obligation to --"
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,2085.684,2086.855,"No, but we follow --"
1971.70-7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2086.855,2091.868,"Protect somebody from compulsory self incrimination because that was the regime of Twining against New Jersey, was not it?"
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,2091.868,2111.518,"Right, but we follow Mr. Justice Stewart, all the Federal precedent is involved and while it was not binding prior to 1964, it is found, we -- our language speaks of that as being complete as to the type of immunity grant within (Voice Overlap)"
1971.70-7,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2111.518,2113.819,(Inaudible) it is not a state constitution law?
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,2113.819,2114.623,"Yes, we do."
1971.70-7,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2144.127,2150.86,But everything it does is open to the news media and therefore to all prosecutors?
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,2150.86,2151.28,"Yes, it is."
1971.70-7,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2151.28,2154.291,That there will be no secret to the reports here?
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,2154.291,2154.737,No.
1971.70-7,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.765,2208.079,"Well, I think you argument is based on the Illinois -- is rather compelling except for the fact that the court in this case did sight Murphy against Waterfront and said that the immunity statute, that is all that Murphy against Waterfront requires which is use immunity?"
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,2208.079,2218.822,"Mr. Justice White, I would suggest that upon a reading of the cases prior (Inaudible) Illinois Supreme Court that if a meaningful deviation --"
1971.70-7,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.822,2219.588,Yes.
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,2219.588,2220.28,-- were to occur?
1971.70-7,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2220.28,2221.587,It would never occur like this.
1971.70-7,1,30250,joel_m_flaum,,2221.587,2226.2,Never occur like this.
1971.70-7,2,24757,frank_g_whalen,,2520.652,2522.104,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-7,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2522.104,2522.768,Thank you gentlemen.
