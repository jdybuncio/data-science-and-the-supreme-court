1979.79-5364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,50.047,"We will hear argument next in 79-5364, Brown v. Louisiana."
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,52.804,74.146,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-5364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,141.042,148.071,In which case did we define or at least tried to give some guidance on retroactivity?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,148.071,156.432,"In Stovall v. Denno the guidelines came out, the criterion to apply."
1979.79-5364,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,282.54,284.683,Was that this Court's --
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,284.683,288.354,That was in Ballew.
1979.79-5364,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,296.147,301.25,But was it this Court's statement that it should be a ten-to-one ratio?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,301.25,304.061,"No, it is not this Court's statement."
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,481.718,485.049,"Do you think that -- Ballew was the five-man, wasn't it?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,485.049,485.749,Yes.
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,489.457,494.364,Wouldn't you have argued that was retroactive?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,494.364,497.409,That Ballew was retroactive?
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,501.933,510.39,"What about people who before Ballew had been convicted by five, would they be out under Ballew?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,510.39,512.71,That was a unanimous group.
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,515.345,516.159,I understand.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,516.159,523.035,"And prior to 1974, when we tried these cases, where we have the five-man jury, it was a unanimous requirement."
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.035,527.067,"Well, are you arguing for retroactivity back behind Ballew?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,527.067,527.88,No.
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,527.88,529.07,Just back to Ballew?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,529.07,530.457,That's right.
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,530.457,536.216,And you think that that would not -- Ballew was '70?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,536.216,540.332,Ballew was in '78.
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,542.415,550.073,So you must be arguing for retroactivity of Ballew then.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,550.073,553.053,"Well, Ballew only had five people on the jury."
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,553.053,554.031,I understand.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,554.031,563.43,And in this decision we are talking about five people convicting out of six.
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,565.415,566.164,Yes.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,566.164,579.814,"So I would argue that any retroactivity -- yes, I'm sorry, also includes cases in Ballew, yes, back to 1974."
1979.79-5364,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,579.814,583.67,Are there any statistics as to numbers that would be affected?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,583.67,584.636,There are not.
1979.79-5364,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,611.571,616.229,"Of course, there are two elements really in the jury competition."
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,645.611,649.566,We are not talking here about the right to a jury trial or a judge trial.
1979.79-5364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,685.251,701.195,"Which do you say is the better truth-finding process, a jury of five, which must be unanimous, or a jury of six in which the conviction may be had by five out of six?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,701.195,725.216,"I would have to draw on my own prior experience before 1974 and I will be very candid with the Court in telling the Court that at that time I favored five out of five, unanimity, but I am not going to argue with the requirement now of the six, but I never favored the five out of six."
1979.79-5364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,725.216,731.39,My question is which do you think is likely to be the more accurate truth-finding process?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,731.39,734.565,"Unanimity, six out of six."
1979.79-5364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,734.565,735.475,That isn't my question.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,742.928,743.999,I see no difference.
1979.79-5364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,743.999,749.469,You see no difference?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,749.469,763.996,I see no difference in the -- except that you may be dealing with one person if you have a five-out-of-six situation that you would not be dealing with if you had a five-out-of-five.
1979.79-5364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,769.382,780.704,With the six and non-unanimity you have at least a challenger in the jury room.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,780.704,780.897,If you --
1979.79-5364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,780.897,784.346,Do you see some advantage to that in the truth-finding process?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,784.346,806.896,"If there is an advantage to it, then I would recall that in Ballew they talk about the five factors when you are dealing with a small jury, the lack of discussion that goes on, that the minority view-point may not be adhered to, and that the position of the defense is of some detriment when you have a small jury."
1979.79-5364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,806.896,810.458,"Ballew was simply a line-drawing process, wasn't it?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,810.458,813.873,"One line, yes, sir."
1979.79-5364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,813.873,822.014,There is nothing magic about five or six or seven except that the court concluded that the line had to be drawn somewhere.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,822.014,828.758,And it had already upheld the six line.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,828.758,829.607,Unanimity.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.607,834.816,"That is the only reason there was a line drawn, is because the six-person jury had been upheld."
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,834.816,835.537,Correct.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,849.571,854.295,Why do you say we are only talking about going back to '78?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,854.295,865.453,"Prior to 1974, in our state, the statute provided for a five-man jury."
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,865.453,869.801,So the five-out-of-six thing could only have been happening since then?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,869.801,873.192,Since 1974 through 1978.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,873.192,878.095,Has the retroactivity of Ballew been decided?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,878.095,879.126,No.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.126,881.188,"Well, This one would certainly decided it, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,881.188,882.642,"Yes, sir, it should."
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.642,888.422,So you are really not talking about just back to '74.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,888.422,892.872,"As I understand it, if there are other states who have --"
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,892.872,897.32,"Well, you are at least talking about it in Louisiana and Oklahoma."
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,907.552,911.902,If they are still in jail.
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,911.902,917.535,"Mr. Lawrence, do you know what the maximum sentence that could have been imposed for conviction by a five-man jury?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,919.879,930.023,"Yes, it was for minor offenses, what they call relative felonies where you could get not necessarily hard labor but --"
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,930.023,934.11,Could any of them provide for a sentence of in excess of six years?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,934.11,937.824,At that time it provided for a nine-years sentence.
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,937.824,939.269,A nine-year maximum.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,939.269,940.138,Nine-years maximum.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,940.138,944.08,And that was the sentences in this.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,944.08,947.981,In this case there was a multiple bill filed and he got 22 years.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,947.981,954.81,And that is not unusual?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,954.81,959.123,"Not with people convicted in Orleans Parish with a prior criminal record, it is not."
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,959.123,969.43,"Well, what is the maximum you could be sentenced to by a five-man jury prior to '74 in case of a repeater?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,969.43,974.507,18 years on a double bill and 18 years on a --
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,974.507,981.296,So there may be quite a few people in jail still who here convicted prior to '74 by a five-man jury?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,981.296,982.579,If they were multiple bill.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.579,983.116,Yes.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,983.116,985.899,And if they were in Orleans Parish.
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,990.567,998.194,"Well, what is your answer to Justice White's question, is it likely that there are quite a few people in jail?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1006.134,1006.949,Let me explain it this way.
1979.79-5364,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1039.195,1048.619,Even someone who was sentenced to 22 years in 1976 might be out now?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1048.619,1051.954,If they were multiple billed in 1976 --
1979.79-5364,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1051.954,1052.443,1976.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1052.443,1083.009,"-- say '76 or back to 1974, during that period of time, their good time would not be affected by the multiple billing and whatever their sentence would be from zero -- from a third of the maximum, which would be three years, which most of them received, three to the maximum of 18 on a multiple bill at that time, they would be out of jail."
1979.79-5364,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1093.383,1097.059,What is the population of Orleans Parish?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1097.059,1097.645,Over a million.
1979.79-5364,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1097.645,1098.493,Over a million?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1098.493,1099.509,Over a million.
1979.79-5364,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1099.509,1101.511,"Just by practice, not by law."
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1101.511,1104.234,That is by practice.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.234,1109.299,Can I go back to the question asked by the Chief Justice.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1131.016,1140.198,You have the wild card but I would like to just draw my own experience when I tried cases at that time.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1177.56,1190.64,Do you respond that way because you see some advantage in having a challenger in the jury room who is in effect going to make the other five jurors think a little longer?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1190.64,1192.532,It depends.
1979.79-5364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1215.317,1218.978,You are dealing with a lot of imponderables.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1228.186,1228.92,Yes.
1979.79-5364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1228.92,1232.409,There is no trouble with the figures.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1232.409,1232.86,There is no --
1979.79-5364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1232.86,1236.264,"I think I understand your problem, but isn't that what your problem is?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1236.264,1237.26,There is no doubt about that.
1979.79-5364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1246.207,1249.2,"Well, wouldn't 24 be even better from your point of view?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1249.2,1251.738,"From my viewpoint, yes, it would."
1979.79-5364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1251.738,1253.314,Thirty-six?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1253.314,1254.301,Yes.
1979.79-5364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1254.301,1257.209,Unanimous --
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1257.209,1259.829,"If I had enough guts to try it that way, I would do it."
1979.79-5364,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1259.829,1265.945,You are pretty close in the Fifth Circuit these days to that.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1265.945,1267.033,"I'm sorry, I didn't understand."
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1267.033,1273.387,"I say you have it close to that in the Fifth Circuit these days when you sit en banc, don't you?"
1979.79-5364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1273.387,1278.768,The Fifth Circuit can decide a case 13-to-12.
1979.79-5364,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1278.768,1281.248,"There are questions of law, too."
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1281.248,1284.087,That's true.
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.935,1296.8,Let me ask one other question.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1300.918,1301.873,That's correct.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1301.873,1303.795,-- by the time Burch was decided.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1312.004,1320.013,"I'm aware that they are doing that, yes."
1979.79-5364,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1320.013,1322.962,You say you are aware that is going on?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1322.962,1324.28,"Well, I have --"
1979.79-5364,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1324.28,1325.176,I just didn't understand your answer.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1325.176,1335.306,"Again, I am drawing on my experience with correspondence with people who have been convicted and are in the parish prison at this time, yes."
1979.79-5364,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1335.306,1337.979,I didn't really need an embellishment to your answer.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1338.117,1339.442,I'm sorry.
1979.79-5364,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1342.613,1344.001,You are aware that that is going on.
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1344.001,1345.437,Yes.
1979.79-5364,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1345.437,1346.157,Thank you.
1979.79-5364,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1346.157,1357.203,"Could I ask you, in the state's brief, on page 27, it says in the case of an habitual felon, a conviction by a six-man jury can ultimately result in the sentence of life imprisonment."
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1357.203,1362.593,That is if he has four felony convictions.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1362.593,1364.772,"Anyway, it can happen?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1364.772,1366.568,From 20 to life.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1366.568,1374.266,"Well, it can happen than that he could have a sentence for life and be convicted by five out of six?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1374.266,1376.259,"Yes, that's correct."
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1382.504,1389.634,How do you tell when a verdict has been unanimous on the six-man jury?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1389.634,1395.821,At the end of the trial you ask for a poll of the verdict.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.821,1399.653,What if the poll wasn't taken?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1399.653,1401.846,They take it in open court right at the end of the trial.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1401.846,1402.983,"It isn't required, is it?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1402.983,1404.182,It is not required.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1407.437,1408.608,So how do you ever know?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1408.608,1409.589,We don't.
1979.79-5364,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1410.861,1415.077,"I know, but once the trial is over how would you ever know?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1415.077,1418.915,"If there is no poll taken, you would not know."
1979.79-5364,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1418.915,1426.064,"In some instances, if there is a poll taken, I take it it doesn't necessarily show up on the court minutes."
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1426.064,1433.591,It may be recorded by the stenographer but it is not usually made part of the record.
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1440.417,1443.993,Do you in your defender practice routinely ask for a poll?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1443.993,1448.802,"Yes, unless I have the advantage and then I don't."
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1448.802,1452.357,Do most defense lawyers do that?
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1452.357,1459.657,"Yes, as a matter of practice they do, in any of the verdicts they do, whether it is five out of six or twelve out of twelve."
1979.79-5364,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1459.657,1462.299,"When there is an acquittal, is there a poll?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1462.299,1463.347,I would never ask for one.
1979.79-5364,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1463.347,1467.083,"I know you wouldn't, but is there one?"
1979.79-5364,0,31453,john_m_lawrence,,1467.083,1474.222,"Sometimes the state does, yes."
1979.79-5364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1479.092,1480.718,Mr. Chester.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1480.718,1482.906,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1522.692,1529.08,"Well, don't you at least think that Ballew heralded Burch?"
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1529.08,1530.238,"No, I don't, Your Honor."
1979.79-5364,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1533.66,1535.751,"There wouldn't make much difference, would it?"
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1535.751,1537.068,"No, sir."
1979.79-5364,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1543.382,1545.584,But they weren't far apart.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1545.584,1547.015,I believe there are differences.
1979.79-5364,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1547.015,1549.909,But how far apart were they in time?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1549.909,1552.495,About a year.
1979.79-5364,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.215,1566.852,"So in terms of impact on justice, even if Burch were retroactive back to Ballew, it wouldn't make that much difference."
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1566.852,1569.067,If Burch were retroactive back to Ballew?
1979.79-5364,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1569.067,1570.924,Yes.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1570.924,1577.932,"I believe there would be a substantial number of jury trials having been tried in the interim period, approximately one year."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1598.364,1601.615,Would you be able to estimate how many of those were non-unanimous?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1601.615,1603.351,"In no way, Your Honor."
1979.79-5364,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1628.381,1629.809,And no numbers at all?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1629.809,1632.867,"Not necessarily, Your Honor, not necessarily."
1979.79-5364,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1632.867,1642.648,What we are talking about then is 300 cases minus an unknown number of unanimous cases and again minus an unknown number of cases which the record is unclear.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1642.648,1647.608,"Yes, sir, for Orleans Parish alone, not for the entire state of Louisiana."
1979.79-5364,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.608,1654.514,"I gather from your point -- maybe I didn't get it right -- that that is probably where the problem is most likely to occur, is that right?"
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1658.863,1661.77,I believe the procedure would have been the same all through the state.
1979.79-5364,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.77,1664.137,I see.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1664.137,1672.202,The Parish of Orleans does have a disproportionate amount of jury trials because it has much more serious crime problems than some of the other parishes do.
1979.79-5364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1672.202,1674.717,What is the population of the state of Louisiana?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1674.717,1679.929,"Your Honor, I am not sure but I know that the population of the city of New Orleans is about one-half million."
1979.79-5364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1679.929,1684.222,Do you have any idea of the population of the state as a whole?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1685.202,1692.466,I think what Your Honor is getting at is about what proportion of jury trials in the state were held in New Orleans.
1979.79-5364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1696.415,1701.033,What I was getting at was what the population of the state of Louisiana is.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1701.033,1702.708,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5364,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1709.252,1714.891,"If you would back up for just a minute, about the other people now in jail who might be affected."
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1714.891,1715.906,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5364,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1715.906,1721.675,Do I understand you to say that practically none of them can show that there was a --
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1721.675,1725.859,"I don't know if that that would be a correct statement of the situation, Your Honor."
1979.79-5364,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1729.731,1732.74,So there wouldn't be many who could show.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1732.74,1734.232,There would be some but not all.
1979.79-5364,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1734.232,1738.204,That is what I thought.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1738.204,1738.435,How --
1979.79-5364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1738.435,1746.51,All of your friend's clients would be in the other category because he polls the jury on every guilty verdict.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1746.51,1750.492,"Yes, sir, some defense attorneys always poll the jury, others do not."
1979.79-5364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1753.736,1762.772,"Just to clear up any possible misunderstanding, I notice one of the briefs recites the Ballew case as 1975 which struck some of us as being incorrect."
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1762.772,1763.51,"No, that is incorrect."
1979.79-5364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1763.51,1764.673,It was '78.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1764.673,1768.681,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1818.065,1822.071,"Is that the issue here, whether there was any miscarriage of justice?"
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,1822.071,1835.276,"Your Honor, I believe that the ultimate issue in this case is whether nine unanimous jury verdicts are inaccurate, are unjust, if there is a good chance that they are erroneous."
1979.79-5364,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2047.172,2054.451,"You would argue that even if Ballew were retroactive, Burch is not?"
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2054.451,2057.869,"Yes, sir, I believe that there are several --"
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2057.869,2062.114,That Ballew did say that there is a real danger of reliability?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2062.114,2063.228,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2063.228,2066.043,But you think that is not the basis for --
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2066.043,2066.351,"As I stated, I think --"
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2066.351,2068.554,You think that is not the basis for Burch?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2068.554,2081.422,"I think that the major difference between the two cases is that the prior jurisprudence, up until the time of Burch, talks more in terms of the absolute size of the jury, representation of the community."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2081.422,2097.65,Ballew said that only five persons really raised a substantial doubt about not only the composition and representational nature of the jury but about the reliability of its verdict.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2097.65,2099.438,"Yes, Your Honor, and I believe that some of the --"
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2099.438,2101.992,And do you think Burch said the same thing?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2101.992,2102.608,"No, sir, I don't."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2125.05,2136.276,But you don't feel that the illegality in Burch of a five-out-of-six verdict rested on the danger of unreliability?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2136.276,2139.664,"I believe that that was a factor in the case, but I believe --"
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2139.664,2140.423,You think it was?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2140.423,2143.618,"I believe it was a factor in the case, but I don't believe that was the reason for the whole decision."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2174.621,2178.755,DeStefano v. Woods and Duncan v. Louisiana are not retroactive?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2178.755,2179.806,"Not retroactive, no."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2179.806,2181.897,"How about Gosa v. Mayden, what did that hold?"
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2181.897,2189.849,"That was a case which interpreted O'Callahan as not being retroactive, O'Callahan being the decision as to the military civil trial."
1979.79-5364,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.849,2193.818,Right.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2193.818,2201.632,"The state's position is that if these cases are not retroactive, then Burch v. Louisiana should not be retroactive because --"
1979.79-5364,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.632,2204.85,How about Ballew?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2204.85,2217.341,"Although I have prepared an argument as to Ballew, Your Honor, I think that if you applied the same test, the Stovall three-pronged balancing test, I think you would find also that Ballew should not be retroactive."
1979.79-5364,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.891,2266.556,"On the other hand, Mr. Chester, in the Ballew-type case the proof would be very simple, we would know -- I guess everybody who was convicted there has a claim, whereas in the Burch-type case a large percentage may not have a claim."
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2266.556,2267.466,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1979.79-5364,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2267.466,2269.92,So that may argue for making it the other way.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2269.92,2271.23,It could be both ways.
1979.79-5364,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.23,2273.56,Yes.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2273.56,2301.948,"Now, as I spoke earlier, once we have established that the rule with which we are dealing is not so grounded in fundamental fairness as is, say, the right to counsel or reasonable doubt, like in Hankerson v. North Carolina, then it becomes appropriate to apply countervailing factors to the analysis, factors that were first set out in Linkletter, later in Stovall and those cases progeny."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2429.932,2435.684,"Before this system you had, what, six-member juries unanimous or five-member juries?"
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2435.684,2445.357,"Before 1975, it was five out of five to convict for felonies which were not necessarily punishable by hard labor."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2445.357,2449.189,And that is precisely what was held invalid in Ballew?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2449.189,2449.433,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2449.433,2450.445,Ballew v. Georgia.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2450.445,2464.785,"The difference being that in Georgia I believe that the maximum sentence for a five out of five conviction in Georgia was one year whereas in Louisiana it would have been nine, possibly being enhanced by the multiple offender statute."
1979.79-5364,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2477.833,2484.486,"Well, wouldn't you think that if Burch would have to be retroactive a fortiori, that Ballew would be?"
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2484.486,2486.371,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2491.764,2497.035,"And Louisiana had the unanimous five-member jury for a long time, did it?"
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2497.035,2499.235,"Yes, sir, the 1921 Constitution."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2499.235,2500.401,It was in the 1921 Constitution.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2500.401,2500.534,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2502.206,2511.701,You have no figures nor any idea how many people might still be in jail who were convicted by five-member juries prior to 1975?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2511.701,2513.493,"I don't know how many of those people would still be in jail, Your Honor."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2529.438,2542.098,"If you just took 80 percent -- you really get the guilty pleas in 80 to 85 percent of the cases, don't you?"
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2542.098,2545.119,I would say we have guilty pleas in more than half of the cases.
1979.79-5364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2559.029,2564.838,"What is the Louisiana system for multiple billing, as your opponent has been referring to it."
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2572.269,2585.14,"We proceed with a bill of information after a man has been convicted or pled guilty to a felony, we proceed by filing a bill of information alleging that he has been previously convicted of one or more felonies within a statutory time period."
1979.79-5364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2589.472,2600.387,"Then that is an allegation in the bill that can be put in issue by a not guilty plea, I take it?"
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2600.387,2602.223,It is put in issue -- what happens is it is --
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2602.223,2603.101,It is after conviction?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2603.101,2604.49,It is after conviction.
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2607.236,2608.912,This is only for sentencing then?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2608.912,2611.172,"Yes, and it is tried before a judge."
1979.79-5364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2611.172,2628.103,"Now, would retroactivity here subject a person who was convicted by a unanimous six-man jury, would it give him the right to attack a prior conviction, say, back to 1921?"
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2628.103,2631.616,It would depend on the scope of the retroactive ruling.
1979.79-5364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2641.686,2643.95,"Conceivably this Court, too."
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2643.95,2645.386,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2645.386,2648.55,Whether or not there is to be multiple billing is in the discretion of the prosecutor?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2648.55,2649.708,Discretion of the district attorney.
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2661.77,2663.224,It is a matter of prosecutorial policy?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2663.224,2668.496,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2668.496,2673.154,Then that can be denied and that is tried before the sentencing judge?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2673.154,2675.857,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2792.777,2794.628,"What was the chronology here, Mr. Chester?"
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2797.431,2798.861,"Had not come out, Your Honor."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2799.093,2802.084,And of course it hadn't been decided at the time he committed the offense.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2802.084,2803.501,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2820.88,2822.707,Which had not been decided in the meantime.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2822.707,2824.977,Petitioner Brown could be on direct review.
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2824.977,2827.618,Right.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2827.618,2837.646,"Additionally, I would submit that I think that the impetus behind the argument for this distinction is basically one of inequity."
1979.79-5364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2869.689,2881.381,Was your earlier reference to the inherent inequity related to the inability to show that a polling took place of the jury?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2881.381,2883.672,"No, sir, this would be in more general terms --"
1979.79-5364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2883.672,2887.786,Wouldn't that be another basis for chance --
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2887.786,2890.426,It certainly would.
1979.79-5364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2896.095,2897.88,And maybe they never knew it.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2897.88,2898.847,"Exactly, maybe --"
1979.79-5364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2898.847,2902.575,Counsel didn't take the precautions what your friend did.
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2902.575,2903.184,That is perfectly correct.
1979.79-5364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2907.439,2913.263,"In Louisiana, can you establish such a factor by some collateral process?"
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2913.263,2929.475,"Well, there is a rule in the Code of Criminal Procedure which says that jurors are incompetent to [ILLEGIBLE WORD] their own [ILLEGIBLE WORDS] whether that would [ILLEGIBLE WORDS]."
1979.79-5364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2929.475,2930.641,"Well, that would be impeaching it."
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2930.641,2938.115,The practical problems inherent that are widespread.
1979.79-5364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2938.333,2951.314,"[ILLEGIBLE WORD] back jurors of five or six years ago and ask them whether or not a particular verdict was, in the words of the usual polling language, was this your verdict --"
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,2951.314,2952.198,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3008.814,3016.149,"Mr. Chester, I notice at the time that you wrote your brief you didn't have the citation to the U.S. reports in Burch v. Louisiana."
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,3016.149,3016.798,"No, sir, I did not."
1979.79-5364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3016.798,3018.041,Do you have it now?
1979.79-5364,1,42565,thomas_chester,,3018.041,3018.818,"Not with me, Your Honor."
1979.79-5364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3024.17,3029.329,"Mr. Lawrence, do you have anything further?"
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3029.329,3036.564,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to make one point to the Court, and it is not really in the nature of rebuttal but it is just something I feel the Court should know."
1979.79-5364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3055.608,3057.706,Were you defending then?
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3057.706,3059.257,Yes.
1979.79-5364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3059.257,3061.286,What was your advice?
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3061.986,3064.048,It would depend on the type of case I had.
1979.79-5364,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3074.204,3078.798,And if you weren't so strong you would go for that will card?
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3078.798,3080.415,Right.
1979.79-5364,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3080.415,3084.473,And maybe make a pass at a twelve-member jury?
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3084.473,3086.779,If we had that it would be even better for us.
1979.79-5364,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3086.779,3090.919,"I must say, that is very revealing."
1979.79-5364,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3090.919,3092.56,"Well, we thank you for your candor on that."
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3123.568,3131.27,"There are some attorneys who did poll and in some cases there are records to show the number, but not all."
1979.79-5364,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3131.27,3132.344,"It would be a matter of chance, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3132.344,3134.966,"It would be a matter of chance, that's correct."
1979.79-5364,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3134.966,3140.749,"To the contrary, wouldn't it be a burden on the person alleging to show it?"
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3140.749,3141.711,"That's correct, too."
1979.79-5364,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3141.711,3144.815,"And if they couldn't show it, they wouldn't get a hearing, would they?"
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3144.815,3145.607,That's right.
1979.79-5364,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3145.607,3159.717,"Then on what standards in Louisiana, if there are any on this point, would a defense counsel be open to a charge of ineffective assistance of counsel if the record did not show that he polled the jury?"
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3159.717,3162.428,In that case --
1979.79-5364,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3162.428,3169.711,"That is not a fanciful possible claim, is it, on the part of the defendant who is in prison now?"
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3169.711,3177.233,It could be a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without polling the jury if this --
1979.79-5364,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3177.233,3187.286,"There is nothing on federal habeas, do you suppose you could poll the jury if they were still alive?"
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3187.286,3191.046,I don't know how to answer that.
1979.79-5364,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3191.046,3194.683,"Well, do you know of any Louisiana law that would prevent you?"
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3194.683,3197.793,From polling the jury if they were able to be found?
1979.79-5364,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3197.793,3198.214,Yes.
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3198.214,3198.43,They would --
1979.79-5364,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3198.43,3199.514,If you could find them.
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3199.514,3200.373,If you could find them --
1979.79-5364,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3200.373,3201.141,And you might have to dig some of them up.
1979.79-5364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3201.141,3205.239,"You've got the summary records, haven't you?"
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3205.239,3208.454,"Yes, if they are still there."
1979.79-5364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3208.454,3212.28,"Of course, a lot of them may be dead by now or moved away or something, I agree with you."
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3217.549,3222.657,I'm sure they would remember the count.
1979.79-5364,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3222.657,3234.233,Your friend suggested that there is a statute prohibiting collateral attack on the jury verdict by such an inquiry.
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3244.391,3251.934,There is a statute that says that the jury is not competent to impeach its own verdict and I have only seen --
1979.79-5364,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3251.934,3256.465,"Well, it is not impeaching it, it, is just a question of fact."
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3256.465,3257.184,"That's correct, too."
1979.79-5364,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3261.388,3266.569,The fact is that it was not unanimous when the verdict has been impeached.
1979.79-5364,2,31453,john_m_lawrence,,3266.569,3269.802,That's correct.
1979.79-5364,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3269.802,3270.36,"Thank you, gentlemen."
