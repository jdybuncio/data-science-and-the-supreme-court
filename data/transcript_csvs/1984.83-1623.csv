1984.83-1623,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.896,We'll hear arguments next in Anderson against City of Bessemer.
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,96.304,97.985,"This is fine, thank you."
1984.83-1623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,355.284,361.208,"Mr. Wallas, would it be accurate to describe Bessemer City as a suburb of Gastonia?"
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,361.208,364.199,"Your Honor, I don't think it's a suburb of Gastonia."
1984.83-1623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,366.903,367.732,But not really a suburb.
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,367.732,369.024,That's correct.
1984.83-1623,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,504.632,508.305,"We'll resume there at 1:00, Mr. Wallas."
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,518.17,523.626,"Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1623,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,600.584,613.172,Do you think it would be unconstitutional for the inquiry to be made how many children you have and what are their ages if they were addressing that only to women?
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,613.172,622.99,"Your Honor, I think that that smack of Title VII... of a Title VII violation to ask that question only of women who applied for a job."
1984.83-1623,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,634.798,641.042,"Well, you say it would smack of, but you wouldn't think... you didn't respond that it was unconstitutional to ask that question."
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,641.042,645.604,"--Well, I'm not sure we have to reach constitutionality."
1984.83-1623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,763.742,770.147,"Mr. Wallas, what is this Court's standard of review in a case such as you've brought?"
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,782.796,793.281,I think the primary role of this Court would be to do basically what the court of appeals was to do: to look at the evidence found by the district court.
1984.83-1623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,820.41,823.372,Then we really have to review the entire record.
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,823.372,825.124,"I think you do, Your Honor."
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,851.301,859.646,"Mr. Wallas, the ultimate question in this case, I suppose, is which of these two were better qualified for the job."
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,864.869,865.88,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,865.88,870.863,Is that a fair summary of the qualifications of the two applicants?
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,870.863,872.004,"No, sir."
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,872.004,873.995,Would you address that briefly?
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,873.995,874.365,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,884.422,886.062,In the opinion in this case?
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,886.062,886.693,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,886.693,887.504,Of which court?
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,887.504,888.654,Of... of the district court.
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,888.654,889.145,Right.
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,890.076,890.617,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,896.291,897.72,Right.
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,911.0,916.453,"--I think the way... Your Honor, I can go through these if you would like."
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,917.024,923.547,"I don't want to take your time and the Court's time, but do... are you able by numbers to say that--"
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,923.547,924.728,--Not without reading--
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,924.728,926.799,"--three, five and seven are erroneous?"
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,926.799,929.19,"--Not without reading through this entire appendix, Your Honor."
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,929.19,930.502,"Well, let me ask you this."
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,957.009,973.141,"Our opinion would be that under... as I... as I read your decision in the Burdine case, Your Honor, that... that if two candidates are equally qualified, that the employer can take either one, but it can't discriminate on the basis of sex."
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1025.966,1029.926,"But the burden... the burden always, the burden of ultimate proof, was on the plaintiff, of course."
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,1029.926,1030.697,"--Yes, sir."
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1033.239,1048.98,"When the employer produced evidence that at least arguably rebutted the initial prima facie presumption, was the burden on the defendant... on the plaintiff that she was better qualified or equally qualified?"
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,1048.98,1063.97,"The burden was to show that the reason advanced by the defendant, the articulation was pretextual or, as Burdine suggests, to show that there was evidence of intentional discrimination, which is the sixth matter--"
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1063.97,1074.665,"So you're... you're saying that the evidence here shows that the respondent, the defendant in the case advanced only pretextual reasons?"
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,1074.665,1075.156,--That's correct.
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1077.096,1077.878,Yes.
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,1081.991,1093.819,"Yes, sir, that certainly could be reviewed by the court of appeals, but it can't review it... but that... that ultimate finding of... of intent is based on some subsidiary findings."
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1101.444,1107.708,"The subsidiary findings with respect to qualifications were all objective in a sense, weren't they?"
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,1107.708,1108.78,"Well, what Your Honor?"
1984.83-1623,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1109.579,1114.733,"Objective in terms of experience, the education of the respective candidates."
1984.83-1623,0,33404,jonathan_wallas,,1114.733,1120.317,The ones that the district court used were... were... were an objective weighing of the qualifications.
1984.83-1623,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1213.487,1219.321,"Very well, Mr. Wallas."
1984.83-1623,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1224.314,1231.518,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1623,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1353.792,1375.876,"Ms. Corwin, may I just interrupt a moment to ask you whether you think the plaintiff in this suit had a burden of proving that the impermissible considerations were a substantial factor in the decision, or is it a ""but for"" causation test?"
1984.83-1623,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1375.876,1380.467,"--Well, I suppose the ""but for"" goes to the remedy certainly."
1984.83-1623,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1413.429,1419.523,"Ms. Corwin, you used the word ""most qualified"" a moment ago."
1984.83-1623,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1431.752,1432.864,"Well, that... yes."
1984.83-1623,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1451.703,1454.768,"Yeah, but is it always easy... that easy to break it down?"
1984.83-1623,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1462.692,1465.564,"It is, of course, conceivable that that can happen."
1984.83-1623,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1640.778,1648.443,"Well, if you're right, what's the remedy that is shown to be equally qualified but not better qualified?"
1984.83-1623,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1650.304,1665.284,"Well, I don't... I don't think in this case we're talking about liability, but I think at least the employee has an injunctive remedy in that case if the employer has acted with a discriminatory motive."
1984.83-1623,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.295,1745.096,"Ms. Corwin, as well as your general view of how the court of appeals proceeded under Rule 52, is there some subsidiary question about how they dealt with the trial court's credibility--"
1984.83-1623,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1745.096,1745.807,Well--
1984.83-1623,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.807,1746.899,--Findings.
1984.83-1623,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1750.179,1756.644,--I think we regard that as subsumed in the application of the clearly erroneous standard.
1984.83-1623,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1756.644,1777.397,"Well, let's assume that... let's assume that the only thing that was wrong, that was arguably wrong with the court of appeals opinion was that it seemed to disregard the... at least on one or two factual issues... the credibility conclusions of the district court, but otherwise complied with Rule 52."
1984.83-1623,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1780.98,1788.393,"Well, I think it... it might be enough for this Court to find that the court of appeals had misapplied the clearly erroneous standard."
1984.83-1623,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.936,1810.028,"Do you think that's part of the clearly erroneous standard to say that a district judge says we have contradictory testimony on the same historical fact, and I just happen to believe A instead of B, and the court of appeals says well, we happen to believe B instead of A?"
1984.83-1623,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1810.028,1815.642,"--Well, I don't think the court of appeals is really in the business of doing that--"
1984.83-1623,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1815.642,1824.087,"I know it isn't, but part of the... as I understand it, part of the petitioner's argument is that that's exactly what the court of appeals did with respect to one or two facts."
1984.83-1623,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1824.087,1840.65,"--Well, I think that's right, and I... and I think the court at that point can say that the clearly erroneous standard was misapplied, and... and there we would regard as part of that argument the further point that under Rule 52(a) you have to give due regard to the credibility determinations of the trial court."
1984.83-1623,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.65,1855.807,"Do you agree with the petitioner's discussion of the... of the credibility findings, which kind of credibility findings should just not tinker with at all, and others that it... do you agree with that part of its brief?"
1984.83-1623,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1855.807,1858.632,We have not taken a position on that part of the brief.
1984.83-1623,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.501,1876.233,And is that enough to just give... give it great weight?
1984.83-1623,1,18561,carolyn_f_corwin,,1882.755,1901.218,"--Well, I... I think that there is some sense to what the petitioner has said about the fact that you may have the weight of the evidence affecting how you come down on whether a particular piece of evidence... and it may be oral testimony... whether that is believable or not."
1984.83-1623,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1910.825,1919.03,Mr. Van Hoy.
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,1919.03,1922.202,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1623,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2084.108,2085.44,Mr. Van Hoy--
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2085.44,2086.519,"--Yes, Justice Blackmun."
1984.83-1623,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2086.519,2091.514,"--the Fourth Circuit has consistently reversed Judge McMillan in these cases, hasn't it?"
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2091.514,2097.487,"Not... well, it depends on your definition of consistent."
1984.83-1623,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2102.67,2103.859,"There were very few, weren't they?"
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2103.859,2104.47,Very few.
1984.83-1623,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2105.362,2107.603,There are many in which he's been reversed.
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2107.603,2110.204,"That particular judge, that is correct."
1984.83-1623,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2119.12,2125.345,"Is that because he, in your estimation, doesn't appreciate the rules or what?"
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2125.345,2130.731,Any opinion I would offer would certainly be a personal one in that regard.
1984.83-1623,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2174.692,2182.076,May I ask you to comment on the practice of a district judge asking prevailing counsel to prepare proposed findings of fact?
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2184.607,2193.663,"As a general proposition I do in the manner in which it occurred, the chronology in which it occurred in this case."
1984.83-1623,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2252.321,2261.918,"Is this judge's practice where he let's one... the prevailing party submit proposed findings, gives the losing party an opportunity to comment on the proposed submission by the prevailing party?"
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2261.918,2263.768,"In this particular case, yes."
1984.83-1623,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2266.102,2277.949,"Well, if that practice is followed where the prevailing party submits those that he thinks are appropriate, and then the other side has a chance to criticize them so that you find out where the real dispute is, what's wrong with that... that procedure?"
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2277.949,2288.746,"--Justice Stevens, what is wrong with that decision, and as at least the Third Circuit has held in the case we cited in our brief, is that the opinion of the court has already been announced."
1984.83-1623,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2303.074,2305.375,"Well, finish your response."
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2305.375,2313.553,"That permitting, as in this case, permitting the other side, the losing side, to respond does not cure that defect."
1984.83-1623,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2458.206,2461.759,"Mr. Van Hoy, I don't know whether the Chief Justice is waiting to ask you--"
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2518.985,2545.673,"It has been suggested by a number of courts, including the Fourth Circuit, that if the court wishes to utilize the input of the parties that it do so before making the submission of its judgment of what the result will be, and that it consider... elicit and consider that input from both sides, not in a... not in one side and then the other commenting on it."
1984.83-1623,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2545.673,2554.989,"Well, but then... then both parties are put to a tremendous amount of work in proposing sets of findings, only one of which will... will be used."
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2600.828,2608.505,"Yes, and I... our position is that we agree with what they refer to as close scrutiny being justified by these facts."
1984.83-1623,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.505,2609.095,"Well, that's--"
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2609.095,2613.687,"Once again, since the work product of the court is actually the work product of the adversary."
1984.83-1623,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.687,2615.868,"--Well, is that really consistent with Rule 52?"
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2615.868,2618.469,"Yes, I believe it is, Your Honor."
1984.83-1623,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2689.767,2714.604,"Well, Mr. Van Hoy, isn't the practice which, at least as I understand Justice Stevens' question and Justice Rehnquist addressed, the common, overwhelmingly prevailing practice of all district judges and all trial judges in this country to reach his conclusion, ask the prevailing party to submit findings, refer them to the other party, and get comments?"
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2717.556,2724.251,"I frankly, Your Honor, do not know what the national practice is."
1984.83-1623,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2745.292,2750.418,Then they are not consistent with my experience of sitting and trying cases in seven circuits in this country.
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2781.937,2784.009,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1623,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2911.391,2922.358,"Well, Mr. Van Hoy, I thought you had just been discussing how the Court applied a closer scrutiny, if you will, here than in the normal, case."
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2922.358,2923.82,--Yes.
1984.83-1623,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2988.111,2997.478,"Well, I have a little difficulty seeing how if that's what the court did, it was at the same time following a normal Rule 52(a) type review."
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,2997.478,3017.21,"I would not... Justice O'Connor, I would not agree that two the principles are mutually exclusive; that close scrutiny does not foreclose the usual deference given to and required by Rule 52."
1984.83-1623,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3055.565,3066.353,"Well, then, isn't your answer to Justice O'Connor's question really that the court of appeals is entitled to exercise a different standard of review when the findings have been prepared by the party?"
1984.83-1623,2,37960,philip_m_van_hoy,,3066.353,3070.385,"I don't think the standard of review is any different, Justice Rehnquist."
