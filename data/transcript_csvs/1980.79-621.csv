1980.79-621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.92,We will hear arguments next in Arizona v. Manypenny.
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,11.168,18.477,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,143.772,145.459,"That's not before us now, is it?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,145.459,150.471,"--No, we didn't petition on that issue, Your Honor, and the 9th Circuit did not address it."
1980.79-621,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,264.145,267.378,"The removal statute is a fairly old statute, isn't it?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,267.378,267.91,Yes.
1980.79-621,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,279.062,286.106,"And of course, even after it was revived, as of that time there was no appeal in a criminal case for anybody, was there?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,286.106,289.449,Certain state courts allowed appeals but--
1980.79-621,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,289.449,289.855,"I mean, in a federal?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,289.855,293.885,--In federal court there wasn't any right to an appeal until 1907.
1980.79-621,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,293.885,295.087,"Right, for either."
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,299.946,310.55,"No, and I think the Sanges case of this Court states that prior to the late 1880s there wasn't even an appeal by a defendant in federal court; nobody had a right to."
1980.79-621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,310.55,318.25,"Well, that's what I meant, that a defendant prior to 1900 in a capital case could appeal."
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,318.25,327.59,"Well, I'm not familiar with that, but I know that there was no general right to appeal for a defendant prior to the act that was construed in Sanges."
1980.79-621,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,405.823,407.261,"Mr. Smith, may I interrupt for just a second?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,409.243,410.103,--Tennessee v. Davis.
1980.79-621,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,410.103,412.82,"--And then it had... that was in 1880, was it?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,412.82,413.164,Yes.
1980.79-621,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,413.164,421.583,"At that time that case was decided, there was removal jurisdiction to the federal court and is it your view that there was an appeal allowable at that time?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,421.583,425.301,"Well, this hasn't come up before."
1980.79-621,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,439.638,442.996,Even if there was no right of appeal to the United States in a federal prosecution?
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,442.996,448.791,"Yes, if Davis is applied literally, that would have been the case."
1980.79-621,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,449.885,455.257,"Well, somehow or other the Tennessee v. Davis got to this Court, so somebody must have appealed it."
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,455.257,463.332,"--Well, in Tennessee v. Davis, it got to this Court prior to trial where the State of Tennessee was challenging the constitutionality of the Removal Act itself."
1980.79-621,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,463.332,465.268,By what sort of procedure?
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,465.268,467.518,I would assume by writ of mandamus.
1980.79-621,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,467.518,468.36,I see.
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,468.36,470.532,"I haven't re read the case recently, so--"
1980.79-621,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,470.532,470.952,I don't know either.
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,470.952,473.765,--But the State of Tennessee raised two contentions.
1980.79-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.921,518.169,But it also said that state law governed the substantive aspects?
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,518.169,519.091,Yes.
1980.79-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,519.091,527.275,"And is it your position that appealability is a substantive matter, to be controlled by state law?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,527.275,539.894,"Your Honor, we haven't taken a position on that issue because the State of Arizona, which is the only state I'm representing today, does provide for appeals in this type of situation."
1980.79-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,549.158,553.797,"It makes quite a bit of difference what position you take, I suppose."
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,567.541,571.553,"I think that was the position the Solicitor General took, although they noted--"
1980.79-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,571.553,572.116,Is that your position?
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,572.116,578.849,"--Well, after I've reiterated the fact that it's unnecessary for the disposition of this case, it would be our position--"
1980.79-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,578.849,581.817,"I know, but you have to... you just can't say, reverse, or append, at the bottom."
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,587.3,597.983,"--Well, under most of the case law that I've read, substantive law defines what is a crime and the punishment for a crime, and procedure governs how that result is supposed to be reached."
1980.79-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.806,612.507,"Do you rely on 1291, or?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,612.507,622.957,"--Well, we would rely both on 3731, which provides, Subsection (e), that the provisions of this statute shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes."
1980.79-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.816,632.249,Then you would apparently say that Arizona could appeal under that statute even if it couldn't appeal in its own courts?
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,632.249,637.967,"--That would be our position, were we faced with that situation."
1980.79-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.044,653.602,"Well, I know, but if we decide on that ground, why then we are deciding that Arizona could appeal in a federal court, even if it couldn't in its state court."
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,658.193,664.315,"No, we're also relying on 1291 under the basis of the literal language of 1291."
1980.79-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,664.315,667.908,Then you're saying that the state is just a party that can appeal?
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,667.908,668.611,Yes.
1980.79-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,668.611,671.125,Wholly aside from whether it could appeal in its own courts?
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,671.125,675.53,"If the Court's going to base its decision on 1291, that would--"
1980.79-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.53,677.201,"Well, why are you citing Tennessee then?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,677.201,693.726,"--Because one of Respondent's arguments is that Congress never explicitly provided for this situation, and it would be our position that because Tennessee v. Davis was decided in 1880, 27 years before the first criminal appeals act was passed in 1907--"
1980.79-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,693.726,698.99,So you don't really care about Tennessee's holding that state substantive law governs?
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,732.819,733.944,--Right.
1980.79-621,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,734.522,737.849,"So whether it's substantive or procedural, in your plan Arizona wins."
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,738.912,740.146,--That's our theory.
1980.79-621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,740.146,755.172,"In a diversity case that's removed to federal court from state court, that's just a simple civil action, the federal statute controls the appealability of that, doesn't it?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,755.172,761.465,"Well, if the Court's asking about the Erie Doctrine, this isn't a classic diversity case."
1980.79-621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,762.059,767.228,"I realize that but I mean, I'm hunting around for some analogy."
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,785.785,808.212,"--I would think, again... I'm not familiar with the civil law, but on the Erie question, which is useful by analogy, I would request that the Court consider the late Chief Justice Warren's opinion in Hanna v. Plumer, in which he said that the twin policies of the Erie Doctrine, were to discourage forum shopping and to the avoidance of the inequitable administration of justice."
1980.79-621,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,874.704,887.777,"Well, just so I have your argument... if it's authorized under 3731, you are arguing that the State of Arizona should be treated as 3731?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,887.777,888.262,--Yes.
1980.79-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.262,898.678,And not be permitted to appeal except where 3731 would permit the United States to appeal?
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,898.678,911.861,"Well, if the appeal rights of the State again are to be predicated on 3731, that would be logical that we would have the same rights as the United State Government, were prosecution commenced by the United States Government."
1980.79-621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,911.861,914.502,Or the absence of such rights as they do not have?
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,914.502,915.266,Yes.
1980.79-621,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,941.1,947.347,"But if you take that view, then 3731 really wasn't necessary for the United States to have the right to appeal."
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,947.347,960.42,"Well, that's not so, because prior decisions of this Court prior to the amendment of 3731 and Wilson did hold that the United States Government couldn't appeal except where expressly authorized by statute."
1980.79-621,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,960.42,965.621,"In other words, prior decisions, it said that 1291 doesn't cover appeals by the prosecution?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,965.621,969.073,That's the general drift of the Court's--
1980.79-621,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,969.073,973.976,"If that's the case, how can we now read 1291 to allow appeals when the State of Arizona is the prosecutor?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,973.976,983.519,"--Because now 1291 should be read in light of the congressional amendment to 3731, which is the--"
1980.79-621,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,983.519,986.784,"Well, then, you're still relying on 3731 as a necessary part of your 1291 argument?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,986.784,1006.761,"--Yes, In the 9th Circuit, in the United States v. Hetrick, which was the case that was decided September 16, that I sent to the Court several weeks ago, they did hold that in light of the new construction of 3731, that 1291 did provide the basis for a government appeal in a criminal case, although that was an appeal by the United States Government, not a state."
1980.79-621,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1028.579,1033.328,"We'll never get to the second question if we decide against you on the first, is that correct?"
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,1033.328,1033.828,--Yes.
1980.79-621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1064.925,1071.439,"Well, if we decide in favor of you on the first question it would seem to me that we would not reach the second question."
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,1080.044,1081.559,"Well, the Court could certainly do that."
1980.79-621,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1087.119,1089.463,In any event we did grant certiorari on both issues?
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,1089.463,1092.602,"Yes, and they were both fully briefed below, in the courts below."
1980.79-621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1097.553,1099.193,"No, you do the responding."
1980.79-621,0,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,1099.193,1099.63,--Okay.
1980.79-621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1291.245,1292.792,Very well.
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1297.477,1301.131,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.741,1393.5,"Well, Mr. Whitney, I understand your colleague to take the position that the State has the right to appeal in the federal courts, whether they have the right to appeal in the state courts or not."
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1393.5,1394.702,"That apparently is true, sir."
1980.79-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.843,1401.668,"Well, if he's right about that, we needn't get into state law."
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1401.668,1418.443,"--Why I bring that, there was quite a colloquy between counsel, Justice White, concerning what basis it was that he was appealing on, and I never got it straight that he wasn't attempting to--"
1980.79-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.443,1419.881,I know he submits--
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1419.881,1422.426,--He submits as policy argument the fact that there was an appeal and--
1980.79-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1422.426,1428.736,--And several times he submits that the State shouldn't lose its right to appeal by a removal.
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1428.736,1429.517,"--That's right, sir."
1980.79-621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1429.517,1439.84,"But the grounds that he urges, independent of whether there's a right to appeal in the state courts or not."
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1439.84,1474.763,"I hope that the Court takes that position in rendering a decision, because it seems to me that we have at least three grounds that counsel is proffering as a basis for appeal, and the principal ground among those is that appeal should be allowed not only by reason of the language in 3731 calling for a liberal construction... I call the Court's attention to the fact that the liberal construction applies to this section, 3731."
1980.79-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1534.99,1537.567,"Mr. Whitney, let me ask you to go back for just a moment."
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1540.738,1544.299,"Yes, there was; yes, there was."
1980.79-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1544.299,1555.497,"Then look at page 18 of your brief, the statutory subsection 5, specifying appealability."
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1565.804,1571.147,"Well, sir, I believe you're referring first of all to our order."
1980.79-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1636.636,1649.944,"Well, but, it's one thing to say the trial court couldn't do something and it's another thing to say you can't appeal from what it has done, whether it was authorized by law to do it or not."
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1666.984,1688.647,"It affected it; it was a judgment, and I would point, sir, in the response to a petition for a writ of certiorari, the estate of State v. Hunt, where the Arizona appellate statute was almost identical to the one that we have before us today."
1980.79-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.969,1745.687,"Well, the state presumably wouldn't want to appeal from a judgment of conviction."
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1745.687,1751.979,"It probably wouldn't; you're correct, Judge."
1980.79-621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1751.979,1756.385,"You referred to State v. Hunt, but I don't see that cited in your brief."
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1759.353,1764.053,"State v. Hunt, sir, and it was in my Response to Petition for a Writ of Certiorari."
1980.79-621,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1764.053,1772.581,Do you say that held that Subdivision 5 did not include appeals from judgments of acquittal?
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1772.581,1773.488,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.516,1818.844,Is that case in your brief?
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1818.844,1824.561,"It was in my Response to the Petition for Certiorari, sir, State v. Hunt."
1980.79-621,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1827.982,1836.227,"Mr. Whitney, is your client still in the Border Patrol?"
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1836.227,1844.818,"His employment was terminated, I believe, some three or four months after this indictment came down in this case."
1980.79-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1891.613,1900.625,"This whole case is one that falls between the cracks, in a sense, isn't it?"
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1900.625,1902.139,"In what respect, sir?"
1980.79-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1902.139,1914.728,"Well, in that Congress has provided for removal to a federal court when a federal officer is tried."
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1934.689,1936.158,"It was at one time, sir, if I may?"
1980.79-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1936.158,1936.627,Okay.
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,1936.627,1946.794,"In the case of Maryland v. Soper, and they call it number one, that Chief Justice Taft rendered a decision on."
1980.79-621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2015.72,2021.529,Let me have the citation for Taft's quote.
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2023.919,2026.731,"Maryland v. Soper, sir."
1980.79-621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2026.731,2031.933,Thank you.
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2031.933,2055.235,"Now, the implications of that decision are that in 1924 the Supreme Court of the United States had found, they had to find, that the state in a removal action had no right of appeal."
1980.79-621,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2096.391,2100.935,Your point is that in Soper mandamus would not have issued if there was an appeal?
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2100.935,2101.467,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-621,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2109.713,2111.354,"That was also a judgment of acquittal, was it?"
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2111.354,2113.618,"No, sir."
1980.79-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2147.542,2150.246,Attacking the right to remove.
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2153.914,2154.742,"Absolutely, sir."
1980.79-621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2155.508,2165.348,"And what Chief Justice Taft had to say is just, it was self-evident back in 1925, that there was no right of an appeal in a criminal case."
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2165.348,2170.189,"Right, and particularly as it provided for the appeal."
1980.79-621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2171.814,2174.937,And he was talking about a judgment of acquittal in that court as final.
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2179.53,2182.607,"--Well, I thought so; yes, sir."
1980.79-621,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2201.912,2206.146,Did you say there was a statute providing for an appeal by the United States?
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2206.146,2207.972,By the United States at the... 1907.
1980.79-621,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2207.972,2220.593,"And your suggestion is that, implicitly, at least, Chief Justice Taft said that that was not available to support an appeal, therefore there was no right of appeal, therefore it had to be mandamus?"
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2220.593,2221.796,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2221.796,2230.697,Did he discuss at all the appealability of a post-trial motion under Maryland law?
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2230.697,2234.415,He never went into it.
1980.79-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2359.647,2366.535,"But at least that statute was enacted after the Maryland v. Soper dicta, for a state?"
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2366.535,2368.254,"No question, sir; no question."
1980.79-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.265,2564.848,"What if this had not been a removed prosecution but simply a prosecution by the United States, and a judgment of acquittal, and the United States appealed and the defendant claimed double jeopardy, should the court of appeals dismiss the appeal or examine the complaint, or examine the case and affirm, or reverse?"
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2564.848,2567.487,"Sir, we're speaking now of the United States."
1980.79-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2569.563,2575.999,"I know, but supposing we were dealing with something that had originated in the district court?"
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2575.999,2579.513,And it was the United States v. XYZ or something?
1980.79-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2581.528,2584.106,And a judgment of acquittal had been entered.
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2584.106,2616.014,"--My reading of the case is, if there was no jeopardy involved, that the matter did not involve a violation of the Fifth Amendment, then certainly the court of appeals could examine it as an ordinary review under Wilson or under Rojas, which is a 9th Circuit decision cited by counsel in his brief."
1980.79-621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2616.014,2619.325,I must have missed something there.
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2627.385,2632.96,"Sir, I thought his question went to the United States trying the case, not the state court?"
1980.79-621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2632.96,2633.726,Yes.
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2635.585,2636.194,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2636.194,2638.755,--And there's a verdict of acquittal.
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2642.629,2643.41,No.
1980.79-621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2643.41,2645.348,A judgment of acquittal entered by the court afterward.
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2645.348,2670.243,"I think Justice Rehnquist was saying, let's turn this around and put the whole thing in the nature of a federal prosecution, where you have a verdict of guilty, the United States stepping... the U.S. district court judge stepping into the case and examining it, and entering then a judgment of acquittal."
1980.79-621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2699.294,2715.241,"Well, I thought Justice Rehnquist's question was, in that kind of a case, and the government did appeal, should the court of appeals simply dismiss the appeal if it found that there was double jeopardy?"
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2721.801,2722.706,"We did, sir."
1980.79-621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2726.939,2728.594,Is that here?
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2728.594,2729.438,"No, sir."
1980.79-621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2732.187,2758.129,"So, I suppose it would be possible for this Court to hold that the court of appeals was mistaken in the ground that it gave, that there was no appeal allowed whatsoever by Arizona, and then to remand the case for the court of appeals to consider the appealability under the other ground rules, including double jeopardy."
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2765.689,2767.798,I believe that would be the order in that.
1980.79-621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2773.686,2775.7,I know; you're on the other side.
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2775.7,2788.679,"--Well, I was going to say, not make the decision that... well, you know, here it is, we can treat it as mandamus."
1980.79-621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2793.364,2807.454,"Well, again, maybe if your brother here on the other side is correct on his alternative argument, it was up to the court of appeals to treat it as mandamus and it's up to us to tell the court of appeals to do so."
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2807.454,2813.451,"--What I would prefer, sir, is that the court be told to examine its mandamus."
1980.79-621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2818.605,2822.229,Yes; you may.
1980.79-621,1,33612,james_d_whitney,,2822.229,2826.663,"That's all I have, gentlemen, unless there are any further questions."
1980.79-621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2827.398,2827.882,Very well.
1980.79-621,2,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,2829.069,2830.927,"Just briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2926.357,2927.809,"Mr. Smith, let me go back to Maryland."
1980.79-621,2,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,2937.447,2947.537,"No, he just said in that that there would be no appeal from a judgment of acquittal and it's not clear from the opinion whether he's talking about a postverdict judgment of acquittal."
1980.79-621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2958.766,2960.874,I see what you're saying.
1980.79-621,2,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,2960.874,2963.622,The only other point I wanted to--
1980.79-621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2963.622,2969.354,"Of course, it's still not a complete answer if there would have been an appeal from some kinds of acquittals."
1980.79-621,2,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,2973.963,2980.867,"--Well, but that wasn't in Maryland v. Soper, and it's more like it's dicta coming out of it in a different--"
1980.79-621,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2980.867,2990.518,"But there was no appeal from the refusal of a federal district court to remand or remove case back to the state, was there?"
1980.79-621,2,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,2990.518,2990.986,--Yes.
1980.79-621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2995.376,3001.483,"But what the case holds is... and also, there's no possibility of a posttrial appeal."
1980.79-621,2,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,3003.763,3004.559,It didn't say that.
1980.79-621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3004.559,3007.557,"--Well, if it didn't say that, why was mandamus necessarily appropriate then?"
1980.79-621,2,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,3013.493,3019.882,"Well, if the jury had come back ""not guilty"", it would have been moot to review the propriety of--"
1980.79-621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3019.882,3024.661,"No, but there could have been an order of say, of conviction, and a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or something like that."
1980.79-621,2,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,3024.661,3026.598,"--Well, that's theoretically possible but it wasn't--"
1980.79-621,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3026.598,3030.581,At that point there conceivably could have been review of the removal order.
1980.79-621,2,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,3030.581,3034.188,"--Conceivably, but that wasn't before the court back then."
1980.79-621,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3034.844,3037.186,Was the Soper case on the merits or was it on the removal?
1980.79-621,2,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,3037.186,3040.466,--Maryland v. Soper was on removal only.
1980.79-621,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3040.466,3040.794,That's what I thought.
1980.79-621,2,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,3040.981,3042.231,That's all it was about.
1980.79-621,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3044.309,3053.759,"The Court did cite United States v. Sanges, in saying that there would be no appeal by the state after verdict, didn't it?"
1980.79-621,2,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,3053.759,3057.896,"--Well, that's not in the quotation from Mr. Whitney."
1980.79-621,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3110.766,3112.187,"That's after a verdict of ""guilty""."
1980.79-621,2,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,3116.639,3118.763,"--Well, there are two cases where it was addressed by appeal."
1980.79-621,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3192.78,3195.388,"What about State v. Hunt, Mr. Smith?"
1980.79-621,2,21470,daniel_jesse_smith,,3195.388,3197.919,"--I'm not familiar with that case, Your Honor."
1980.79-621,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3262.863,3263.22,Very well.
