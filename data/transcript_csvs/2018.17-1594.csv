2018.17-1594,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.4,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 17-1594, Return Mail, Inc. versus the United States Postal Service. Ms. Brinkmann."
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,8.4,16.28,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The term ""person"" in this case does not extend to include the government for three reasons."
2018.17-1594,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,74.16,85.8,"Your position is that it's -- the estoppel provision is the linchpin, you just said, but your position would be the same even if there were no estoppel provision."
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,86.64,87.84,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-1594,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,138.08,151.12,"What if -- would the government or the Postal Service be able to initiate ex parte reexamination? Because, under your theory, ""person"" doesn't include the Postal Service."
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,158.44,167.56,"The statute does not preclude a communication, Section 303, that allows the sua sponte reexamination by the government through the PTO."
2018.17-1594,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,173.24,177.6,"But someone is not -- according to you, a person is not the government."
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,177.6,178.32,That's a different --
2018.17-1594,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,178.32,181.68,So where do the -- where does the government get its permission?
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,181.68,181.84,Under --
2018.17-1594,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,181.84,187.36,"In the form -- the government in the form of the Postal Service, where does it get the permission to initiate that process?"
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,187.36,194.76,"Well, there are two different ways that an ex parte reexamination could be initiated by a person or, sua sponte, by the director of the PTO."
2018.17-1594,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,249.12,264.76,"But do you think it would be proper for the Postal Service or some other federal agency to contact the PTO ex parte and say, hey, why don't you, sua sponte, look into the validity of this patent? Is that what you're saying? That would be proper?"
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,264.76,266.32,"I think it is allowable, Your Honor."
2018.17-1594,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,280.0,320.12,"Well, that -- I mean, that's an argument that makes me doubt your -- your argument on the statutory language because I think if -- if this were prevented -- presented to Congress, and the issue before Congress was do we want a federal agency to be able to initiate one of these AIA proceedings in the open, in accordance with the law, or do we want to allow them to pick up the phone to the PTO and say -- Patent and Trademark Office and say, hey, why don't you sua sponte look into this? Which of those -- do you think they chose the latter?"
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,320.12,330.2,The sua sponte reexamination process is very different because the government would not come in then and be a litigant as they are here.
2018.17-1594,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,382.04,399.44,But why -- why would -- why would the government -- why -- why would Congress want to leave a government agency out of this second look if the idea is to weed out patents that never should have been given in the first place?
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,399.44,407.16,Because the government already has opportunities through both the reexamination and through challenging the validity.
2018.17-1594,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,428.76,449.04,"Your -- your argument on the Dictionary Act, you know, the idea that everybody knows this is what it means and so you start from common ground, that really has to be based on a legal fiction, right? Nobody would think, when Congress wrote this, that, okay, we're using ""person"" according to the Dictionary Act, except sometimes we're not, because you agree there are some times when it does include the government."
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,456.32,458.52,"I don't think it's leaving it up to the courts, Your Honor."
2018.17-1594,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,464.4,470.92,"Well, I know, but that's my point, is that you rely on the Dictionary Act, but then you say except when the context suggests something else."
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,480.56,483.72,"Well, certainly, Your Honor, there are examples."
2018.17-1594,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,535.6,552.36,"Well, counsel, the argument on the other side I know we're going to hear is Section 207 allows the government to participate in a lot of aspects of the patent system affirmatively, and given that, it would be natural to extend it to IPR review as well. Do you care to respond to that argument?"
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,552.36,556.44,"Well, I think a very useful guide here would be to look at the Cooper case."
2018.17-1594,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,613.16,613.64,This is --
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,613.64,614.88,This is case -- excuse me.
2018.17-1594,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,614.88,615.28,Sorry.
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,672.2,675.84,"Your Honor, I can give you three examples that we discuss in our reply brief."
2018.17-1594,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,800.4,800.88,Ms. Brinkmann --
2018.17-1594,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,800.88,818.64,"So, if the Act permits the government to sue for infringement -- to be sued for infringement, which it does, what do you think it means to take away a defense? Meaning this is a defense tool for infringers."
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,825.32,833.4,"A couple things there I'd say, Your Honor. The Court did not grant cert on this and I'm not here to argue it, but we have a different view."
2018.17-1594,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,900.32,900.68,You --
2018.17-1594,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,900.68,923.96,"Ms. Brinkmann, I -- I take it you agree that 207 does indicate that the government counts as a person for a variety of provisions, is that right? So 102, 118, 119, all of those provisions, because the Act specifically says the government can obtain a patent, it follows that those provisions apply to the government as well."
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,925.32,935.84,It -- what the provision -- it references each federal agency. And it was part of the Bayh-Dole Act to try and figure out how that the government could -- could handle research patents.
2018.17-1594,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,967.12,1032.6,"Right, but I guess what I'm -- I wanted to ask was whether those provisions, the 207(a)(1) that the government can obtain a patent, 207(a)(3), which is that the government can protect its rights to inventions, whether those might also lead you to say that the -- that the -- the -- that the government is a person for means of bringing these challenges, because the idea, I think, would be something like these challenges to the PTO are a means of -- enable the government to innovate and to obtain patents itself. In other words, the government is looking at an area, it says somebody is claiming a patent on this, that's preventing us from inventing, that's preventing us from getting a patent, so we have to kind of clear the field in order to innovate. And that's what these challenges enable the government to do, so that they are a kind of function of 207(a)(1) and 207(a)(3). What would you think of that argument?"
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1032.6,1038.64,"It might be a policy argument that someone might consider, but it's not what Congress did."
2018.17-1594,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1084.0,1099.52,"What -- what is the director of the PTO supposed to do when he gets one of these calls from the government and says, we want you to reexamine this? Is -- is he or she supposed to make an independent determination, or is he or she supposed to salute and go ahead and do it?"
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1099.52,1125.12,"Under the statute, under 303, it explains that the director can on his own initiative at any time, as discovered by him or cited to him, it can even rely on art that was cited in a actual request that someone filed, or the regulation provides anything that's been brought to his attention. So there's a very broad area because that's only about beginning the process."
2018.17-1594,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1145.04,1146.0,Ms. Brinkmann --
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1146.0,1146.96,-- authority to exercise that.
2018.17-1594,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1146.96,1160.4,"But, Ms. Brinkmann, I guess the question I'm struggling with, and I -- I think some of my colleagues are as well, is one could understand why a rational Congress wouldn't want the government to go before its own agency to kill private party patents."
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1190.4,1198.6,"I would say on the reexamination, Your Honor, it's much more of a consideration, the agency's own reconsideration."
2018.17-1594,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1223.64,1240.64,"But one thing you haven't said is, why not simply say the government can't? Meaning, if you're going to be consistent, then why do you need to give a different reading to ""person"" in the ex parte examination context? I'm not quite sure why you're doing that, but --"
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1240.64,1241.4,And as I --
2018.17-1594,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1241.4,1242.68,-- perhaps in answering -- because --
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1242.68,1251.12,"And let me just say, Your Honor, also, I do think that if you're -- the starting point for the person in the ex parte reexamination is the same."
2018.17-1594,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1303.52,1303.92,But you're one --
2018.17-1594,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1303.92,1319.04,"A very small firm would like to go ahead with an invention, but it's afraid that Google owns a patent on it, but it thinks Google's patent is invalid."
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1413.84,1437.24,"A couple points I'd like to respond to, Your Honor. First of all, on our answer, you know, that the government can defend in the Court of Federal Claims, true, but also the government, through the expert office of the Patent and Trademark Office director, has the ability to sua sponte reexamine a patent, just like that. And that certainly is something that could be done. The second thing I would say is --"
2018.17-1594,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1437.24,1443.8,"Well, yeah, but, I mean, that's equally true of Joe Smith."
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1468.16,1468.6,"But, Your Honor --"
2018.17-1594,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1468.6,1469.76,What's the difference?
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1469.76,1471.28,"Well, it's not true for Joe Smith."
2018.17-1594,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1475.04,1481.56,And what can the government do -- what can DARPA do that Joe Smith can't do?
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1481.56,1501.92,"Well, if I can just flip for a moment to just explain what the AIA review provisions are because I don't think they're as broad as would be believed through that kind of scenario. First of all, the covered business method patent that's at review here, no one can bring this kind of review unless they've already been sued for infringement or charged with infringement."
2018.17-1594,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1505.32,1506.64,That isn't my question.
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1523.96,1526.12,The other difference is that DARPA can use it.
2018.17-1594,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1556.88,1592.0,"I was -- I was trying to figure out the difference between ex parte reexamination and these review procedures from your perspective, and I gather that the difference is that the PTO will be the final word within the executive branch if the ex parte reexamination procedure were the only avenue, whereas the Postal Service could seek judicial review against the office if dissatisfied, if the government's position prevailed? Is that the difference in the two review proceedings?"
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1592.0,1600.04,"Well, there also are all the litigation that's available if there's an action against the government for using the patented invention."
2018.17-1594,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1609.08,1609.96,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.17-1594,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1609.96,1613.24,Thank you.
2018.17-1594,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1613.24,1617.48,Mr. Stewart.
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1617.48,1629.2,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has said on a variety of occasions that the term ""person"" does not ordinarily include governmental bodies, but it's also made clear that this is not a hard-and-fast rule."
2018.17-1594,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1655.72,1659.08,Except this is a very different situation.
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1720.64,1747.76,"I -- I guess the first thing I would say is that regardless of how this case comes out, regardless of whether governmental units, federal governmental units are thought of as persons who can invoke inter partes and CBM review, there are at least two scenarios in which governmental bodies could wind up in PTAB proceedings. The first is, as Justice Kagan alluded to, Section 207 expressly authorizes each federal agency to seek a patent."
2018.17-1594,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1774.6,1774.76,"Well, but --"
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1774.76,1775.48,-- of a federal agency.
2018.17-1594,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1775.48,1780.6,"-- but, Mr. Stewart, there we have the express language of 207 that does that work."
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1837.16,1852.48,"Let me say two things, the first of which is a continuation of what I was saying to Justice Sotomayor, that, clearly, Congress did contemplate that there would be situations in which a federal agency could come before the PTAB because, in the initial examination context, if --"
2018.17-1594,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1852.48,1854.16,"If you could get to my question, Mr. Stewart."
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1861.8,1862.08,And --
2018.17-1594,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1862.08,1863.84,That's in the language of 207.
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1863.84,1864.36,Exactly.
2018.17-1594,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1938.52,1942.44,That's -- that's the difference that Justice Gorsuch is identifying.
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1962.32,1965.48,"Well, let me -- let me address that in -- in two parts."
2018.17-1594,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2004.8,2011.88,"Mr. Stewart, I hate to interrupt you, but I -- I'd really like an answer to the -- it's the same question I asked and Justice Kavanaugh asked, and perhaps you could get to it."
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2011.88,2024.04,My -- my answer is it is theoretically possible that there could be an appeal from a PTAB decision -- by a federal agency from a PTAB decision that was unfavorable to the government.
2018.17-1594,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2029.84,2031.48,And you acknowledge that's unusual?
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2031.48,2033.08,"I acknowledge that it's unusual, but as I --"
2018.17-1594,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2033.08,2043.68,"And you acknowledge also, I think, that ex parte reexamination is a process available to the Postal Service in this instance to ask the PTO to engage in?"
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2043.68,2050.72,"I don't see how it would be under Petitioner's theory; that is, Petitioner says that the word ""person"" presumptively excludes the --"
2018.17-1594,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2050.72,2052.6,"Well, can't -- can't the -- I'm sorry to interrupt."
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2055.8,2064.04,"In -- in general, that happens, but as Justice Alito's question was indicating previously, it would be -- it would be quite problematic for that to occur in -- in this context."
2018.17-1594,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2064.52,2076.8,"Well, why is that? Under Article II, I would think all components of the executive branch always are able to communicate with one another absent some rule to the contrary that Congress might try to insert."
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2076.8,2088.16,"Well, for example, Section 301 says that any person can bring to the PTO's attention information -- prior art that potentially bears on the validity of an issued patent."
2018.17-1594,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2216.12,2217.04,I think the --
2018.17-1594,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2217.04,2218.4,Mr. --
2018.17-1594,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2218.4,2218.88,Go ahead.
2018.17-1594,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2218.88,2222.52,"I think, Mr. Stewart, I'm -- I'm not really understanding your affirmative argument here."
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2248.52,2262.36,"I would say that the strongest contextual evidence is that the word ""person"" in the provisions that define IPR and CBM review is used to make available to the general public a procedural mechanism, an advantage."
2018.17-1594,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2268.52,2272.36,"Well, that doesn't seem -- I mean, that just is saying everybody else gets to do this."
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2272.36,2273.04,Which is basically --
2018.17-1594,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2273.04,2273.28,But --
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2273.28,2276.52,Which is basically what the Court said in Georgia versus Evans and in --
2018.17-1594,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2276.52,2286.12,"Isn't that flipping the presumption? I mean, the presumption is that ""person"" doesn't include the government, and you're suggesting, well, because ""person"" is broad and it's a big term, it includes the government."
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2286.12,2293.16,I think there are -- there are at least two or three different prerequisites -- prerequisites to -- to my theory about the context.
2018.17-1594,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2326.08,2327.04,What's -- what's the third?
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2327.04,2341.64,The third is that there is no evident reason that Congress -- that Congress would have wanted to exclude federal agencies because the rationales for creating these mechanisms in the first place apply equally when the federal agency is the requestor.
2018.17-1594,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2341.64,2358.0,"I mean, when I hear you say this, Mr. Stewart, I -- I -- I guess what I was hoping for was that you would have an argument from particular statutory provisions. I mean, I was trying to run an argument to Ms. Brinkmann about 207(a)(1) and (a)(3) and how those might suggest that the government was a person."
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2370.48,2382.8,"Let -- let me make one very quick general observation, and then I'll try to go to something more specific in the statute. The very general observation is that the argument I was fleshing out was basically what the Court said in Georgia versus Evans and in Pfizer."
2018.17-1594,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2420.84,2424.8,"But who deleted that, though? That -- that wasn't deleted by Congress, was it?"
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2424.8,2428.2,That was deleted as part of the 1948 recodification.
2018.17-1594,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2431.56,2433.52,"It was the reviser who did that, right?"
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2433.52,2434.48,Yes.
2018.17-1594,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2434.48,2435.48,Congress didn't do that?
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2435.48,2438.36,"Well, Congress reenacted the -- the statute."
2018.17-1594,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2438.36,2463.76,"Isn't there some kind of basic statutory canon interpretation -- canon of interpretation that says where the reason for the rule applies, the rule applies? And, here, we have the government, NASA, which might, in fact, want to do something, and they're being sued for infringing a patent. Now we have a speedy way of resolving that."
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2485.76,2486.8,I -- I think that's correct.
2018.17-1594,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2492.0,2498.32,"1498, by the way, is when I think they invented this canon of interpretation. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2498.32,2506.56,1498 is the provision of Title 28 that subjects the United States to liability for unauthorized use of a patented invention.
2018.17-1594,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2607.68,2609.08,"What does ""charged with"" mean?"
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2609.08,2609.36,I'm sorry?
2018.17-1594,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2609.36,2610.92,"What does ""charged with"" mean?"
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2610.92,2614.96,"""Charged with"" is -- it basically means you received a cease and desist letter."
2018.17-1594,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2639.68,2654.8,What about Ms. Brinkmann's linchpin that the estoppel provision -- that the government effectively gets two bites of the apple; everybody else gets just one?
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2654.8,2659.96,I -- I think we can be estopped in subsequent PTO proceedings.
2018.17-1594,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2690.8,2694.72,"By common law estoppel, what do you mean? You mean issue preclusion?"
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2694.72,2697.44,"Issue preclusion, that's correct."
2018.17-1594,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2697.44,2698.92,And what -- what would you --
2018.17-1594,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2698.92,2700.08,Could you tell me why is that?
2018.17-1594,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2700.08,2709.44,"If we -- you know, if we indulge the -- the possible fiction that Congress actually gave a second of thought to the issue that's before us -- (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1594,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2709.44,2733.16,"-- I -- I'm not sure Petitioner has a pretty good -- has much of an explanation as to why it would treat -- why Congress would have wanted to treat the government differently from a private party as to these AIA proceedings. But, on the other side, do you have an explanation why Congress would have wanted different estoppel rules to apply to the government?"
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2733.16,2750.28,"I mean, obviously, the government in a variety of contexts is subject to different estoppel rules, not only equitable estoppel but also regular issue preclusion, the -- whereas non-mutual collateral estoppel could apply to most parties, the federal government is not subject to non-mutual collateral estoppel."
2018.17-1594,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2782.08,2824.04,"Well, doesn't that counsel in favor of the presumption? Shouldn't we make the government think about this issue? It could very easily decide that we were wrong, if we were to decide in your adversary's favor, it's a hypothetical, but it would then be in a position to decide what kind of estoppel should be applicable or not in the Court of Federal Claims, but if it hasn't, assuming Justice Alito's process, wouldn't we be trumping the assumption by making a policy judgment to include the government because it makes sense to some of us?"
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2824.04,2827.48,I -- I don't think you would be making your own policy judgment.
2018.17-1594,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2854.88,2856.72,But there is a purported good reason here.
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2864.32,2902.0,"I think that is -- that has been identified as a disadvantage of our proposed rule, but nobody thinks that that's the chain of thinking that Congress went through. That is, Congress, in deciding whether the -- if Congress were thinking about whether the government should be included in these provisions, presumably, it would first decide, do we want the government to be able to invoke IPR and CBM? And if the answer to that was yes, it would decide, okay, now what should the estoppel rule be for the government? Congress would never say we'll first decide in what fora should estoppel be enforceable and then, having made that decision, we'll decide --"
2018.17-1594,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2902.0,2902.12,So --
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2902.12,2903.32,-- does it make sense to --
2018.17-1594,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2903.32,2942.2,"-- Mr. Stewart, does it -- does the estoppel point become just even a little odder still when we consider that, in the IPR proceedings, it's the government that would be the plaintiff, as it were, seeking to cancel a patent before the government as judge, so both prosecutor and judge in these proceedings, and then not be bound by its own findings brought in a case by its own prosecutor, effectively, later in a Court of Claims proceeding? So I understand the government's often not bound by estoppel, but it's usually in the role of a defendant in those circumstances, and certainly not before its own tribunal."
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2948.48,2954.68,"Well, our position still is that, under common law estoppel, we would be bound by whatever adverse ruling the PTAB made --"
2018.17-1594,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2954.68,2955.76,I understand that.
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2955.76,2957.92,-- with respect to the arguments we actually advanced.
2018.17-1594,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2957.92,2959.52,We all -- we understand that.
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2961.16,2979.96,"And I say I don't think it would be unusual for Congress to decide there will be somewhat different estoppel rules with respect to the government than with respect to private parties. Again, people were alluding in earlier parts of the argument to the possible anomaly of the government appealing from an adverse PTAB decision."
2018.17-1594,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3012.28,3026.56,"When you take a step back here and think about this case, there are provisions that specifically give the government the same rights as persons, 207 and other provisions in this statute. We don't have them here, obviously. That's what raises the question."
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3088.56,3154.4,"Let me make a couple of additional contextual points, one of which is a continuation of an answer I was giving to Justice Kagan and then another is a new one. What I was saying to Justice Kagan is everybody accepts that the government in litigation bears the same burden of showing patent invalidity by clear and convincing evidence. Now private parties have available to them an alternative, IPR/CBM proceedings, to try to escape that burden, to try to come before a different decisionmaker who will apply a de novo standard of review. You could think of it as roughly analogous to a primary jurisdiction mechanism, where one issue in the lawsuit is referred to an agency that has expertise in -- in the relevant area. And the Court, in applying various presumptions and clear statements rules -- clear statement rules, has been especially solicitous of the government as defendant; that is, resolving in the government's favor ambiguities about whether the government can be sued, what is the scope of its liability, et cetera. This is not quite that."
2018.17-1594,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3248.6,3255.2,"May I ask, Mr. Stewart, just a couple factual questions? This case is about the post office, but let's say it wasn't the post office."
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3271.12,3272.76,I don't know the answer to that.
2018.17-1594,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3286.32,3322.48,"I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, to the extent that you think that maybe Congress treated the government differently here because they were afraid that the government in front of the PTAB is -- has a kind of home court advantage and that they didn't want that, I guess the question is, is that true? I mean, is this a community of patent officials who talk to each other all the time across the government, who know each other, who deal with each other, or is this really stovepiped so that none of these people -- the PTAB would have no clue of who it was before them when the Department of HHS walks in?"
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3322.48,3372.36,"I mean, I have been to the Federal Circuit bench and bar conference and there -- there is a community thought of as the patent bar, and so there probably is some form of a professional acquaintance between the -- the various types of governmental members. But I think the one thing I would stress most is, in other respects, Congress evidently didn't see that as a problem because, in authorizing federal agencies to apply for patents, it didn't create a special patent examination process or even a special administrative appeal process so that the government would come before people who were unusually impervious to that sort of overreaching. And, similarly, Congress made federal-owned patents susceptible to potential IPR and CBM requests by private parties."
2018.17-1594,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3401.88,3406.92,"If you were -- if you were not to prevail here, what would the real world problems be for the government?"
2018.17-1594,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3406.92,3440.16,"You know, I'm told by the PTO that in the years since the AIA was enacted, federal agencies have submitted 20 requests for all forms of AIA post-issuance review combined. I mean, if you look at it from the standpoint of the government's overall litigation efforts across all subject matters, it's pretty small. But, if you ask would the Court naturally or likely construe a statute to say the government has to surmount a higher burden of proof than a private party, it seems unlikely even if it's a narrow class of suits. Thank you."
2018.17-1594,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3440.16,3442.64,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Three minutes, Ms. Brinkmann."
2018.17-1594,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3442.64,3482.48,"Thank you, Your Honor. I have four points I'd like to make very quickly. The first one, I just want to clarify the thing about trying to short-circuit the reexam process. Actually, under 301, there's a provision that says, when a person requests a reexamination, it can actually be confidential. So this idea that somehow there's going to be a secret person asking if the statute already says that doesn't have to be disclosed, I think that's 301(e). The second thing I would point about, just the anomaly of the agency versus agency. Whatever anyone thinks of that, it would be extraordinary for Congress to do that through silence. And to go to this question about who would represent the government, I do know that in the Civil Division, there, of course, is an office that handles the patent litigation."
2018.17-1594,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3581.96,3610.76,"Does that presumption make any sense anymore, Ms. Brinkmann? I mean, the idea of a presumption like this is that it's a stable default rule against which Congress can operate. But does anybody really think -- this perhaps goes back to Justice Alito's question -- does anybody really think that Congress thinks about this as a default rule and legislates against it? And if not, shouldn't we just do what strikes us as the thing Congress would have wanted done with respect to any particular statute?"
2018.17-1594,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3610.76,3614.0,"Your Honor, we think there's a very good reason for it."
2018.17-1594,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3653.12,3653.92,"Thank you, counsel."
