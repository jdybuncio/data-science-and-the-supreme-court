1986.85-1530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,73.012,"Mr. Pincus, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,73.012,76.131,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,160.837,167.558,"May I ask you, Mr. Pincus, because I'll tell you, I'm concerned about the timeliness of some of these things that happen in this case."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,175.43,179.449,"--Well, the statute does indicate that, set a 60 day limit."
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,184.269,191.958,What is the... where did the Secretary get the authority to just in effect ignore that 60 day requirement?
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,191.958,202.497,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think that the Secretary ignores that requirement, just in some cases it happens that the investigation, the questions are complex or witnesses are difficult to locate."
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,202.497,204.183,Was this a complex case?
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,204.183,210.937,This particular case involved many different claims by Mr. Hufstetler that he'd engaged in a variety of safety-related activities.
1986.85-1530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,210.937,220.459,"He may have gotten the authority from the same place that the last case we have from the Secretary of Labor got the authority, which as I recall was very belated processing."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,220.459,221.093,"Well, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,231.183,237.07,But there was a good deal of legislative history that supported the Secretary's argument there that that was directed to a different purpose.
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,239.356,246.093,"Well, Your Honor, we think that the statutory scheme would be... indicates itself that the same rules should apply."
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,273.077,282.766,"And whenever the Secretary does complete it... here I guess it was about eleven months... then the back pay obligation attaches, too, doesn't it, if he finds reasonable cause."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,282.766,285.818,"Yes, but the back pay obligation runs from the discharge."
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,288.77,297.107,"Well, it's a little more serious if an employer has to wait a year or so and then finds he's got a year's back pay to pay, which I suppose he'll never see again once he pays it."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,297.107,302.344,"Well, he doesn't owe the back pay until after the entire... there's been a final adjudication on the merits."
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,302.344,305.113,"Oh, he doesn't have to pay it at the time of the reasonable cause determination?"
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,305.113,310.183,"No, the only part of the order that goes into effect immediately on the reasonable cause finding is the reinstatement."
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.183,310.699,I see.
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,310.699,315.337,The other remedies don't go into effect until the order becomes final.
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,315.337,328.395,"Still, it might be considered a quid pro quo for the employers who are subject to this Act that what's taken away is that they have to reinstate; on the other hand, what they get is a pretty good estimation of whether they're going to have to pay back pay ultimately."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,347.54,357.58,"Well, on the other hand, Your Honor, the employers are protected by the thoroughness of the investigation, because the Secretary's determination becomes that much more accurate, and so his reasonable cause finding--"
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,357.58,358.064,That's fair.
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,358.064,365.52,--is that much more accurate.
1986.85-1530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,488.815,495.286,"Mr. Pincus, do I understand the Government concedes that there is a property interest on the part of the employer here?"
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,495.286,509.562,"Yes, Your Honor, we do, although let me add that we think the nature of the property interest is quite insubstantial as compared to the property interests that the Court has considered in its prior cases."
1986.85-1530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,509.562,512.514,"Well, what precisely is the property interest?"
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,512.514,523.054,"Well, the interest as we see it is the employer's right to discharge an employee that it has under its contract."
1986.85-1530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,523.054,532.661,And is there some case from this Court that you regard as peculiarly apposite in making that concession?
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,532.661,535.946,"No, Your Honor, we don't rely on any particular case."
1986.85-1530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,562.447,568.751,"Well, the order to reinstate would require back pay?"
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,568.751,574.238,The order... the back pay obligation does not become effective until the order is finally upheld.
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,580.409,585.646,You don't think it's a deprivation of property if somebody requires me to hire somebody that I don't want to hire?
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,585.646,586.179,"Well, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.915,602.174,"I thought you just said that there would have been a clear... the mere payment of the money would have been a property interest if all the Secretary did was require the back pay, without requiring the man to be re-employed."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,618.6,621.569,"--Well, Your Honor, that's why we think there's a property interest here."
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.123,633.443,"And you're saying he's not losing much because he's getting the labor of a person whose labor he doesn't want, and you don't think that's very much?"
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,633.443,647.001,"--Well, we think it's something, but we don't think it's anything like a person who needs disability not getting disability benefits or an employee being discharged or someone who is dependent on money for their livelihood losing that very money."
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,652.255,657.641,But doesn't the employer also lose a contract right under the collective bargaining agreement to have an arbitration award enforced?
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,668.597,669.499,"Yes, he did, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,756.822,758.924,"I suppose that's part of the 60 day requirement, too."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,763.828,767.78,"Well, Your Honor, the Secretary is cognizant of the need for expedition."
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,776.219,778.937,I can't resist also asking you about your interpretation of the sentence:
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,792.847,798.049,"Well, the statute doesn't provide a deadline for the ALJ, although the regulations that the Secretary--"
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,798.049,807.773,"Unless you read it into this 120 day... unless you read the plain language of the sentence I just read to you, because that certainly sounds as though the Secretary has to get through with the matter within 120 days."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,809.123,812.309,"--No, Your Honor, the Secretary hasn't interpreted the statute that way."
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,848.898,862.24,"Is there anything in the record to suggest that the process that he actually follows is any more expeditious than convening a very, on short notice, an adversary hearing like you might have on a motion for a temporary restraining order in a court?"
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,871.729,885.787,"Well, the fair reading of the statute, I think, is that Congress intended the Secretary to conduct an investigation and for reinstatement to happen on the conclusion of that investigation, and for adversary proceedings to follow."
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,904.081,908.985,You're going to have a hard time convincing me that they spend eleven months working on this case and nothing else.
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,918.608,930.232,"--No, Your Honor, we don't suggest that, and as the times that we've submitted in our reply brief show, that's not what the Secretary actually does in every case."
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,982.617,983.817,"Well, I'm not sure that follows."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1001.561,1007.249,"Well, Your Honor, that might be true in this particular case, but it may not be true in many, many cases."
1986.85-1530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1008.267,1018.057,"Well, it might be so, as Justice Stevens says, if you really lived up to the 60 day requirement, why, you could order reinstatement and then maybe take some time to have an evidentiary hearing."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1024.542,1027.828,"--Well, Your Honor, we don't think that that's what the Court's cases have required."
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1042.338,1043.523,I'm not sure that I'm following this discussion.
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1061.236,1063.469,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that's exactly right."
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.469,1069.639,"I mean, it may be a terrible way to administer the Act, but as far as the employer is concerned the longer these things take the better, right?"
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1069.639,1070.174,I think that's--
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1070.174,1071.991,20 months is great for him.
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1071.991,1073.043,"--Well, the Secretary--"
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1073.043,1074.509,Because he doesn't have to rehire this fellow.
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1074.509,1079.047,"--I think that's certainly true from the employer's point of view, and in addition the--"
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1079.047,1079.98,"Well, certainly that's not true."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1089.636,1090.536,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1986.85-1530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1090.536,1092.455,--Especially if he thinks he's a dangerous employee.
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1092.455,1093.005,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1986.85-1530,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1093.005,1094.123,And he isn't a good truck driver.
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1094.123,1096.24,--There are two different time limits at issue here.
1986.85-1530,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1117.405,1135.784,"No, but if the man doesn't work for eleven months and yet gets eleven months pay, that's worse than not working 30 days and getting 30 days back pay, because part of your argument was that part of the quid pro quo is he gets services for the back pay, but he doesn't get any services for the back pay during the period between the discharge and the temporary order."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1135.784,1142.354,"Well, Your Honor, except that I don't think that the length of time has anything to do with the back pay question."
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1152.493,1158.649,"But the back pay is going to depend on how long it takes to complete the final hearing, not this preliminary determination."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1158.649,1164.017,"--Yes, although the preliminary... well, the back pay obligation runs from the date of the discharge."
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1166.653,1167.269,"Oh, that's right."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1170.355,1175.592,--But I don't think that that question has anything to do with the due process issue here.
1986.85-1530,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1202.742,1221.39,"Well, Mr. Pincus, once the initial order has been entered by the Secretary of Labor insisting on reinstatement of an employee the employer doesn't want to have, then it becomes crucial to the employer, does it not, to have a prompt hearing, assuming that's constitutional?"
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1221.39,1224.342,"Yes, a prompt post-action hearing."
1986.85-1530,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1224.342,1230.995,"At that point the post-order hearing becomes vital, does it not?"
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1230.995,1231.928,"Yes, it does, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1231.928,1234.713,"And yet, there's no time limit in the statute at all."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1234.713,1259.995,"Well, the statute requires that the post-reinstatement hearing be expeditiously conducted, and the Secretary has issued regulations that do set down time limits on when that will happen... for every process, every stage along the process culminating in the Secretary's final decision, which amount to seven months, which is less than the period that the Court has recognized in both Mathews and Loudermill as appropriate."
1986.85-1530,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1263.131,1267.268,Are the time limits in the Secretary's regulations jurisdictional or directory?
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1267.268,1274.772,"Well, Your Honor, the time limits are directory, and if in a particular case, as in Loudermill, the Court indicated that there was a two-step inquiry."
1986.85-1530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1400.819,1404.605,"And that's the basis of the preliminary order, is based on that?"
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1404.605,1407.89,"It's a reasonable... it was a finding of reasonable cause, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1407.89,1417.012,"And the employer in this case sought and obtained the injunction after the preliminary order had been issued, is that correct?"
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1417.012,1418.697,"Yes, but before it went into effect."
1986.85-1530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1423.149,1429.505,But the only reason he wasn't required was because the district court enjoined the application of the preliminary order?
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1429.505,1431.472,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1431.472,1435.409,"What does ""reasonable cause to believe"" mean?"
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1452.102,1457.089,"Well, Your Honor, we don't think it's a 51 percent determination, a more probably than not determination."
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.432,1475.634,What did we mean by it there?
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1475.634,1483.573,"Well, as I said, we think that it's a finding that the complaint has merit, not necessarily a finding of 51 percent."
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1496.03,1499.982,"Probability is 51 percent, isn't it, or a substantial chance."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1499.982,1508.272,I think that the Court indicated in Illinois against Cape that probable cause is not a 51 percent determination; it's something less than 51 percent.
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1513.659,1524.9,"After doing eleven months worth of work, why wouldn't it be more sensible in deciding where the burden ought to fall to have it fall on the person who's more likely to be the one at fault?"
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1528.436,1533.24,"Well, Your Honor, in every case, again, there isn't an eleven month investigation."
1986.85-1530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1546.563,1552.367,"It makes it all the more amazing why it would take eleven months then, if all he looks to see is whether there is any merit."
1986.85-1530,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1552.367,1558.538,"And Your Honor, the Secretary in subsequent investigations has moved more expeditiously and is moving more expeditiously now."
1986.85-1530,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1568.496,1569.063,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,1574.749,1575.932,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1607.952,1610.137,There's going to be a substantial risk of error anyway.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,1619.325,1619.875,--I'm not sure--
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.875,1624.229,So there's a two to one chance that it's wrong on the face of the statute.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,1624.229,1630.8,"--I'm not sure what the technical definition of ""reasonable cause"" is."
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1649.695,1650.062,"Well, I don't know."
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,1666.906,1668.342,"--I don't follow the last part, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.258,1680.316,"You want the Secretary to be very careful in determining that you probably were right to fire this fellow, but you nonetheless should keep him on."
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,1680.316,1680.966,--We want--
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1680.966,1696.91,"It seems to me that if less... if you acknowledge that less than a probability is an adequate standard, it seems very strange to say that in order to meet that standard we need the full panoply of adversary proceedings, cross-examination and everything else."
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,1696.91,1701.313,"--I want to make clear, we're not asking for the full panoply of a full evidentiary hearing."
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1888.701,1893.688,"You know, the argument that judges usually here is that it's impossible to prove a negative."
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,1913.518,1914.101,"Exactly, and--"
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1914.101,1917.553,"All the rest is an attempt to prove the negative, which is very difficult to do anyway."
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,1917.553,1918.52,--It is difficult to do.
1986.85-1530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2104.192,2113.981,"Well, does the mere fact that the employer strongly and quite reasonably objects to being made to do this, does that convert the situation into a property right?"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2113.981,2115.433,It converts it to a property right.
1986.85-1530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2151.173,2152.792,Has there been an evidentiary hearing?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2152.792,2154.175,"Yes, there has been an evidentiary hearing."
1986.85-1530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2156.994,2158.21,Any decision?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2158.21,2165.849,"A decision of the Secretary of Labor April 21st this year, yes, Your Honor, finding that the individual should be reinstated, put back to work with back pay."
1986.85-1530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.849,2166.699,August.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2166.699,2167.132,I'm sorry?
1986.85-1530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.132,2167.617,August.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2167.617,2169.951,August 21st of this year.
1986.85-1530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2169.951,2173.205,And is that subject to some judicial review?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2173.205,2179.942,"That is subject to judicial review in the Eleventh Circuit, and in fact an appeal is pending in the Eleventh Circuit at this time."
1986.85-1530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2211.144,2217.817,What relief are you going to get if you win this case?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2217.817,2228.689,"If we win this case... well, the case is not moot because this is the type of case that is subject to repetition with no opportunity for quick review."
1986.85-1530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.164,2249.586,The short answer is that if you win this case you're not going to get anything except some protection in the event you allegedly violate the Act again?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2249.586,2250.621,That's correct.
1986.85-1530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.704,2257.525,"Well, isn't that pretty speculative, whether you're going to commit another violation of the law?"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2257.525,2258.742,"--We aren't going to, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2274.07,2277.606,And a big likelihood that he'll take eleven months?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2277.606,2279.356,"Some have taken longer, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.356,2286.378,"But of course, you don't... you say whether it's 60 days or however long, that there should be an evidentiary hearing?"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2286.378,2286.845,Yes.
1986.85-1530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.845,2288.579,Before an order to reinstate.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2288.579,2289.496,We want the an evidentiary hearing during the investigative period.
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2307.458,2311.493,"And the shorter it takes, the less likely you are to get here in time?"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2311.493,2312.529,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2313.412,2313.812,I'm trying to help you.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2313.812,2317.147,--administers any number of whistle blower statutes.
1986.85-1530,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2326.789,2338.494,"Mr. Towers, you say you do not want a full evidentiary hearing, but would you like... do you think you're entitled to the right to cross-examine the Secretary's witnesses?"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2338.494,2338.929,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2338.929,2339.996,Prior to the final?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2339.996,2341.096,"Yes, Your Honor, absolutely."
1986.85-1530,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2358.139,2361.408,What would be the difference between that and the final hearing?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2361.408,2372.531,"The final hearing would be... first of all, the Secretary of Labor would be putting on his case first, and he would be able to put on everything at that time that he feels supports a case to meet the preponderance of the evidence test."
1986.85-1530,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2393.529,2398.564,"Well, you'd want him to put on all the witnesses that he has."
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2411.991,2418.06,We didn't have the names of the witnesses under the asserted confidentiality rights that the Secretary of Labor asserts.
1986.85-1530,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2418.06,2420.346,So you had no idea what the Secretary of Labor had?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2420.346,2421.029,Not really.
1986.85-1530,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2430.285,2433.32,A question of the status of this case now.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2435.539,2437.589,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2445.378,2452.382,"Mr. Towers, do I understand you think that you're entitled to that preliminary hearing within the 60 days?"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2452.382,2453.734,Within the investigative period.
1986.85-1530,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2454.551,2456.369,Even though that's beyond 60 days?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2456.369,2458.637,--Even if it goes beyond 60 days.
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2493.276,2495.911,Could we find out more about the content of this hearing that you're asking for?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2501.548,2504.583,It would be up to the Secretary as the proponent to put on--
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2504.583,2506.785,"Well, could he withhold any of the witnesses that he has?"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2512.022,2516.991,--I would want to cross-examine all of the witnesses that he would be presenting to a neutral fact finder.
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2537.22,2538.12,And then what would you put on?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2540.006,2544.041,We would put on rebuttal to what they had put on.
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.041,2545.493,"Well, but rebuttal would include anything."
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2550.062,2551.23,I think that--
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2551.23,2557.384,I just don't see how it differs from the final hearing and what is saved by having this expedited process if we have this.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2562.67,2573.478,"--The full dress hearing would perhaps include witnesses testifying that this individual is a credible character, that individual is a credible character, corroborating evidence and so forth."
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2584.201,2587.07,"I assume an ALJ does that in the final hearing, too."
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2587.07,2587.687,--He can.
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2594.891,2600.711,And you would restrain yourself during that hearing and not put on all the evidence that you possibly have?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2601.847,2603.797,--I would be putting on the evidence in response to what--
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2603.797,2608.651,"You'd put on every bit of evidence you possibly could, wouldn't you, as much as the ALJ would possibly let in?"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2608.651,2612.619,--I think I would realistically put on my non-discriminatory reason.
1986.85-1530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2629.48,2634.801,"Mr. Towers, what other agency does what you want done?"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2634.801,2636.268,Gives preliminary hearings?
1986.85-1530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2636.268,2636.92,Uh-hmm.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2636.92,2641.205,"The Secretary of Labor does under the Mine Safety Act, in exactly the same situation."
1986.85-1530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2665.837,2671.307,"Well, in this I understand you want a preliminary hearing before the hearing?"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2671.307,2673.093,I want a preliminary hearing before the order--
1986.85-1530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2673.093,2674.409,"Well, that's two hearings."
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2674.409,2675.211,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2675.211,2676.178,That's two hearings.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2676.178,2677.095,"Yes, if it went to--"
1986.85-1530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2677.095,2678.997,Is that normal?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2678.997,2682.949,"--Well, it's available under the Mine Safety Act regulations."
1986.85-1530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2682.949,2685.484,"Well, it doesn't have to be available under another Act."
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2688.036,2689.069,That's the only one I know of.
1986.85-1530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2693.007,2708.616,"It seems that there is a difference between the investigatory process, and I always understood that you weren't entitled to get in at that stage, the investigatory stage."
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2708.616,2714.92,--We're entitled to get in at this investigatory stage because the results of this investigatory stage result in the deprivation of property.
1986.85-1530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2714.92,2721.757,"Well, are you entitled to get in at the investigatory stage in a criminal case?"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2721.757,2723.776,"Not that I know of, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2723.776,2726.561,"Well, that ends up with jail."
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2726.561,2732.732,"Now, an analagous situation would be you would be entitled to get in at the investigatory or the preliminary stage of a parole revocation."
1986.85-1530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2732.732,2733.932,Those cases are analogous.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2742.503,2761.734,"When the prosecuting authority is incarcerating an individual because he believes there is reasonable cause to establish that the individual has violated his parole, that individual is entitled to a hearing at that time and to know what evidence the prosecuting authority is relying on during that preliminary interim, before there's a final hearing."
1986.85-1530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2761.734,2762.967,Before the hearing?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2762.967,2763.384,Yes.
1986.85-1530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2763.384,2768.221,The preliminary is merely to find if there is probable cause.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2768.221,2769.673,And the individual--
1986.85-1530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2769.673,2773.375,And you say you're entitled to be there at go?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2773.375,2775.827,"--In a parole revocation case, yes."
1986.85-1530,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2775.827,2777.411,"When it starts, you're entitled to be there?"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2777.411,2792.853,"We're entitled to be there when a decision is being made as to whether or not the parolee will be incarcerated pending a full hearing on the question of whether or not he violated parole, yes, that is the case."
1986.85-1530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2792.853,2796.49,"Mr. Towers, may I ask you two questions."
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2819.088,2820.122,"I think it is, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.378,2832.847,"But your people are apt to be all over the country, whereas the miners I suppose all work in--"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2832.847,2834.782,Not actually all over the country.
1986.85-1530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2851.542,2862.617,"--My second question is at the time you get the finding of reasonable cause, does the Secretary also give you some kind of a summary of findings, identifying the people on whom he relied?"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2862.617,2863.166,"--No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2863.166,2867.253,You still get nothing more than the basic notice in the first instance?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2867.253,2867.786,That's correct.
1986.85-1530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2920.638,2925.607,"Perhaps I should ask you opponent, but what is the reason for not disclosing the names of witnesses if they're going to have to testify anyway?"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2929.661,2935.315,They invoke the informant's privilege and say that these people might be retaliated against by a hostile employer.
1986.85-1530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.315,2936.881,Before they have a chance to testify?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2936.881,2937.933,Before they have a chance to testify.
1986.85-1530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2937.933,2940.802,In which event they'd have the same statutory protection that this man has.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2940.802,2942.585,They would have the same statutory protection.
1986.85-1530,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2942.585,2955.561,Yes.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,2955.561,2964.065,An additional point that I would like to make in connection with the risk of error is the dual role of the investigator.
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3061.293,3064.162,"You don't assert that that's applicable here, 554?"
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,3064.162,3065.363,--I don't suggest that the APA is applicable.
1986.85-1530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.363,3066.514,You're saying by analogy.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,3066.514,3077.821,"I'm offering it by analogy, and the analogy is offered to point out that Congress has recognized that there is a substantial risk of error in combining those functions."
1986.85-1530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3162.241,3169.747,But the Secretary... the statute would not prevent the Secretary from providing hearings before?
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,3169.747,3170.214,"No, it would not."
1986.85-1530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3170.214,3177.318,So the only issue is whether the statute as applied in this case is unconstitutional.
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,3177.318,3181.472,The Secretary in his new regulations has not called for any kind of a hearing.
1986.85-1530,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3184.507,3190.244,"Well, I know, but he could under the statute."
1986.85-1530,1,36788,michael_c_towers,,3190.244,3191.128,He could under the statute.
1986.85-1530,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3222.799,3224.315,"Thank you, Mr. Towers."
1986.85-1530,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3226.334,3229.453,"A few points, Your Honor."
1986.85-1530,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3331.02,3332.786,"Well, don't hang too much on Congress."
1986.85-1530,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3341.459,3346.613,Congress devised the procedure whereby the hearing is held after the reinstatement of the employees.
1986.85-1530,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3346.613,3346.963,That's right.
1986.85-1530,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3346.963,3349.398,It didn't specified an evidentiary hearing at that time.
1986.85-1530,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3349.398,3351.934,"It didn't specify it, but it didn't say not, either."
1986.85-1530,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3360.087,3372.228,"Well, Your Honor, no, we interpret the statute as being quite clear that at the conclusion of the investigatory process that's when reinstatement occurs, and that the adversary process starts afterwards, while the employee is back at work."
1986.85-1530,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3375.18,3380.084,"Is that in the statute, the Secretary is going to be giving hearings before reinstatement?"
1986.85-1530,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3380.084,3387.273,"We think that Congress' determination was that the hearing should be post-reinstatement, not pre-reinstatement."
1986.85-1530,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3387.273,3389.523,So the answer is yes to my question?
1986.85-1530,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3389.523,3390.525,Yes.
1986.85-1530,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3390.525,3394.094,And why is this case not moot?
1986.85-1530,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3394.094,3400.164,"Your Honor, we think that it falls within the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception we discuss in our reply brief."
1986.85-1530,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3401.347,3408.103,Yes.
1986.85-1530,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3408.103,3420.244,"And just with respect to Appellee's investigatory-adjudicatory argument, we think the Court's decision in Withrow against Larkin makes clear that there's no due process problem in this case."
1986.85-1530,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3421.678,3422.78,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
