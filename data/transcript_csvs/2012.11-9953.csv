2012.11-9953,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.904,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 11-9953, Boyer v. Louisiana."
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,7.72,10.972,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,44.362,47.831,"Mr. Bourke, was it within the control of your client?"
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,47.831,53.135,"He was unable to fund himself, Your Honor, that is why he asked for the appointment of counsel."
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,53.135,56.087,Was he unable to get his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,56.087,57.503,Yes.
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,57.503,58.27,Why?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,58.27,66.975,That is -- he was unable to move forward to trial because he was not provided with counsel adequately funded to advance the--
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,66.975,68.477,"He had -- he had one counsel, right?"
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,70.627,72.962,"--In fact in a sense, Your Honor, he had two counsel."
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,72.962,79.2,"For part of it he had two, and then there was not enough funding for the second, okay?"
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,99.614,100.366,"No, Your Honor--"
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,100.366,100.832,No?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,100.832,101.482,--that is not correct.
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,103.417,104.917,What is the State of Louisiana law?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,104.917,110.671,Louisiana absolutely does not provide a right to two counsel in capital cases.
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,128.116,129.233,I don't -- I don't understand that.
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,136.289,138.322,--That is not the law in Louisiana.
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.322,145.994,--I -- you don't consider supreme court rules to be law?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,145.994,152.498,It is a supreme court rule which directs the trial judge to appoint two counsel.
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.833,160.92,Is it the fact that in Louisiana you cannot proceed to trial in a capital case unless there are two counsel?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,160.92,163.272,"--No, Your Honor, that is not the--"
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,163.272,165.122,Then you don't have a case.
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,166.824,168.024,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.11-9953,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,184.469,188.687,"The one counsel who was qualified, what was his name?"
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,188.687,189.787,Mr. Lorenzi was lead certified counsel.
2012.11-9953,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,189.787,190.72,"Lorenzi, yes."
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,194.591,195.091,Correct.
2012.11-9953,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,195.091,201.411,"And the Louisiana Supreme Court said, You don't have to do this."
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,217.537,222.174,Mr. Lorenzi declined to pay for Mr. Boyer's defense out of his own pocket.
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,222.174,226.643,Wasn't there at all times one counsel who was being paid by the State?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,226.643,227.743,There was--
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.743,228.976,At all times?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,228.976,237.282,"--There was at all times one counsel appointed as associate counsel, that is for the purpose of assisting Mr. Lorenzi as lead counsel."
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.282,243.686,Was that counsel qualified enough under our constitutional Sixth Amendment jurisprudence?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,243.686,247.389,"Well, I don't understand the -- the Sixth Amendment jurisprudence to place--"
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.389,247.906,Well--
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,247.906,252.124,"--a qualification minimum, so I'm not sure I'm understanding your question."
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.124,264.699,"--Well, the question is, would only lead counsel under -- under the supreme court's rule qualify as competent counsel for purposes of complying with the constitutional requirement?"
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,271.688,284.163,"The -- there is no -- I'm having trouble answering the question, Justice Scalia, because the two things don't talk to each other."
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,287.715,288.398,Exactly.
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,302.891,303.476,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.476,304.126,What?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,304.126,315.801,"The court of appeal twice found -- knowing that associate counsel had been appointed, the court of appeal twice found that the case could not proceed due to a lack of adequate funding and the State--"
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,315.801,323.038,Not because of a Federal constitutional reason; the court found you are not complying with the supreme court rule.
2012.11-9953,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,360.646,361.33,"Mr. Bourke, did anyone--"
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.33,362.496,--you didn't have to take that right.
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,371.788,387.813,"--Your Honor, if Mr. Boyer had been brought into court and had been told, We've got associate counsel here; they are qualified in the sense that they are Barred in Louisiana; and they can take your case to trial and move it forward now."
2012.11-9953,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,422.235,425.602,Can you tell me why that is not what occurred here?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,425.602,435.658,--Because the funding problem did not exist solely around Mr. Lorenzi's overhead and expenditure.
2012.11-9953,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,479.521,488.71,How much money would be needed for investigation and experts before you would acknowledge that that would be competent representation?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,488.71,506.505,"That is a very case-specific determination, Your Honor, and in Louisiana at that time rested with a judicial determination that the investigative or expert expenses were reasonably necessary to ensure a fair trial within the meaning of the Due Process Clause."
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,511.642,529.87,"Of course, a finding by the district court, or whichever court found it, that there was not enough money to pay counsel, to investigate, and to do whatever else -- buy stamps -- is not a finding by the district court that there was not enough money to investigate and to buy stamps."
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,548.833,552.119,There was never--
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.119,556.187,"The -- the big tag item was paying counsel, wasn't it?"
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,556.187,558.889,"--No, Your Honor, that was one of the big tag items."
2012.11-9953,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,636.639,638.156,Your point of view in this case--
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,638.156,639.091,"Yes, sir."
2012.11-9953,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,639.091,655.551,"--In your point of view, would it satisfy you if we say the Louisiana court of appeal found the largest part of the delay involved the funding crisis experienced by the State of Louisiana -- that meant giving you adequate money for counsel."
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,691.307,692.226,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-9953,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,692.226,694.109,"Period, and send it back."
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,694.109,694.976,"Well, Your Honor--"
2012.11-9953,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,694.976,703.281,"You would like us to say what Judge Cook said in her opinion, that responsibility for funding rests with the State, not with the defendant."
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,728.399,730.082,--That is what Judge Cook said.
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.082,733.886,I don't think it's enough that none of the delay was attributable to the defense.
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,758.768,768.674,"Your Honor, what Mr. Boyer did was act at all times in full compliance with the procedural mechanisms set up in Louisiana for doing that."
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,792.372,794.707,"Well, that's -- surely that's unconstitutional."
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,805.165,807.951,"--It's a procedural rule, Your Honor."
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,807.951,818.407,"I'm still waiting for anybody telling the court: I demand a speedy trial, and if I don't get a speedy trial, you are violating the Constitution and I ought to go scot-free."
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,818.407,822.793,"Well, Your Honor, the rule I am referring to is a procedural rule."
2012.11-9953,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,834.768,837.12,Isn't it true that you waited 3 years before doing that?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,837.12,845.49,"--That was the first point at which under Louisiana procedure he had a remedy available, exactly as Judge Cook stated in her abstaining opinion."
2012.11-9953,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,861.235,862.785,Can we clarify one point?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,885.467,886.084,"We do, Your Honor."
2012.11-9953,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,958.749,970.04,"What about -- what about the basic problem in this case as I understand the question presented, is, should the State be responsible when the funding problem is at a local level?"
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1000.076,1001.359,Justice Kennedy--
2012.11-9953,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1001.359,1006.063,I take it that's the issue that we're trying to decide here.
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1006.063,1015.002,"--Well, I think it starts with the proposition that it is the State, not the prosecutor who has the responsibility to ensure a speedy trial in accordance with due process."
2012.11-9953,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1058.765,1077.926,"The answer to the question, that's what I was trying to do -- this case, the briefing is filled with whether he asked in time, whether he was delaying, whether he should have done some other thing, whether he should have -- but the question that's asked is simply whether the failure to fund counsel is a factor that should be weighed against the State."
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1077.926,1078.526,--Yes.
2012.11-9953,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1078.526,1088.217,"And maybe it only gets very little weight, because maybe there was a hurricane, and maybe it doesn't even matter because he didn't make the right motions."
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1115.801,1116.784,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-9953,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1116.784,1117.803,And what else--
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1117.803,1127.175,"The first thing that we want is exactly that, Your Honor, that the court below incorrectly -- incorrectly failed to attribute this to the State."
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1133.063,1133.629,Not quite.
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1173.556,1189.515,"--Well, Your Honor, it -- I think it would be open to this Court to answer the question by saying the court got it wrong at the first step by failing to attribute it to the State and then remand for full consideration of weighing in light of that."
2012.11-9953,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1200.123,1209.396,"If we provide -- if we provide that guidance, what do we do about the continuances that Mr. Lorenzi requested that relate to the funding?"
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1250.14,1263.048,"--Your Honor, I'd suggest that this Court does exactly the same thing that the Louisiana Court of Appeal did with them, which was to find that it was the lack of funding, not any action by Mr. Lorenzi, which caused the delay."
2012.11-9953,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1312.078,1320.917,"I mean, Justice Alito's problem seemed to me, to get back to Justice Scalia's point, is that he seemed more interested in the funding than a speedy trial."
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1324.386,1327.99,"--In the absence of funding, there was no trial to be had."
2012.11-9953,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1346.052,1355.757,"And as Justice Alito pointed out on several occasions, what the defense lawyer said was, Let's put it off and see if we can get funding, let's put it off until there's the funding hearing."
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1364.363,1373.635,"--Well, under Louisiana's Article 701, there was no filing a motion for speedy trial, saying, Please give me a speedy trial, set a date now."
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.435,1377.521,The Constitution requires such a motion.
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1395.148,1406.006,"--Your Honor, this Court in Barker, when dealing with this very topic under the issue of assertion, specifically said it would allow judges to take account of assertion in accordance with local procedural requirements."
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.204,1437.059,"Now, they -- they don't even want counsel to say, you know, Your Honor, we've been trying to get funding, and we're just sick and tired of waiting for this."
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1449.05,1450.719,In July of 2005--
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.719,1451.369,What did you say?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1451.369,1457.139,"--In July of 2005, Mr. Lorenzi moved to quash the indictment and said exactly that."
2012.11-9953,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1482.256,1489.344,"But wasn't there something about that motion was withdrawn, the 2005 motion was withdrawn in 2006?"
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1489.344,1503.768,"--If I can clarify that, Justice Ginsburg, Mr. Lorenzi was at pains to say he was not withdrawing the motion, but dismissing the motion to quash because he couldn't advance it in a successful way in Louisiana without demonstrating prejudice."
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1503.768,1507.489,"Dismissing it instead of withdrawing it, that's the fine line he's drawing?"
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1507.489,1508.339,He specifically--
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1508.339,1509.756,Is that a line in Louisiana law?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1517.944,1525.683,"--Well, the point, Your Honor, was that he was not withdrawing his claim to a speedy trial, but rather, dismissing his motion to quash on the violation of that at--"
2012.11-9953,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.683,1527.05,Withdrawing his motion to quash.
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1528.319,1529.685,"--No, it was dismissed."
2012.11-9953,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1543.829,1547.547,I -- I think what you -- let's go back to that.
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1557.921,1561.79,"To move for a speedy trial, he had to do exactly that."
2012.11-9953,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1561.79,1566.944,"Under the Sixth Amendment, he had to comply with the requirements, the procedural requirements of Louisiana."
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1566.944,1569.296,The local procedural requirements for how one goes about doing that.
2012.11-9953,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1569.296,1569.696,All right.
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1577.483,1586.422,"It's the difference between moving for a speedy trial, Please give me a trial date, I want to go to trial next week, and moving to quash because the speedy trial right has been violated."
2012.11-9953,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1586.422,1588.108,So why didn't he move to quash earlier?
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1588.108,1593.944,"He moved to quash at the first moment that it became available under the State statute, which was at the 3-year mark."
2012.11-9953,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1597.229,1597.546,I'm sorry.
2012.11-9953,0,38793,richard_bourke,,1605.152,1606.185,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-9953,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1648.496,1649.348,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,1660.054,1662.672,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1669.076,1677.931,"How about the reasoning, is delay because of the lack of funding attributable to the State or not, or to the district attorney as agent of the State?"
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,1677.931,1686.953,"Justice Sotomayor, I don't believe that the funding -- that we can credibly argue that funding is completely outside the role of the State."
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1686.953,1697.509,"So what's wrong with what's been suggested by some, to remand to tell the court below to whatever extent this was the basis of your decision, it was wrong."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,1700.545,1719.024,"Well, Your Honor, if you review the Third Circuit Court of Appeals opinion, which is at Appendix D, the other Barker factors are analyzed incredibly thoroughly with a mind to this Court's jurisprudence, and the rationale may be flawed with regard to that one point in this Court's opinion, but the result is not."
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1719.024,1725.178,So is one factor determinative always in this calculation?
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,1736.886,1747.859,I think that this Court has always acknowledged in its Barker v. Wingo jurisprudence that there is no one talismanic factor; all of the factors are interrelated and all are reviewed.
2012.11-9953,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1755.115,1756.132,But how do we know that?
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,1762.535,1779.997,"--I think when you look at the Third Circuit of Appeals opinion, they specifically and with direct quotations to Barker v. Wingo, go through every other factor in the analysis, and they discuss the fact of the repeated continuances of defense counsel of his own funding motion as part of the assertion of the right."
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1779.997,1780.43,But wait a minute.
2012.11-9953,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1781.047,1781.547,Whether something is--
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1781.547,1782.33,--I'm sorry.
2012.11-9953,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1782.33,1803.778,"--Whether something is the State's fault is a significant factor in the analysis, and we have made that very clear in our cases, and so if they got that wrong -- and you, I think quite rightly, are saying we can't defend that part of it -- if they got that wrong don't we at least have to say, okay, well, get it right now and do it again?"
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,1803.778,1826.909,"Well, Justice Kagan, I don't think that what I would say is they got it completely wrong, because, as this Court has acknowledged throughout its Barker jurisprudence, there are different weights you attribute to government action, whether it is negligence or whether it is a deliberate attempt on behalf of the State to evade giving a defendant his Sixth Amendment right to counsel."
2012.11-9953,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1826.909,1829.011,I would like to get the structure of your argument.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,1836.917,1838.234,"Yes, sir, Justice Kennedy."
2012.11-9953,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1838.234,1839.536,The three reasons that we should affirm.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,1839.536,1855.478,"The first reason is that, as in Vermont v. Brillon, the delay occasioned in this case was due to Petitioner's counsel's repeated requests to continue his own funding motion, which delayed a source of funding when the Petitioner wished to proceed with capital-certified counsel."
2012.11-9953,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1855.478,1856.595,"Okay, and the second?"
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,1856.595,1880.713,"The second reason, Your Honor, would be, pursuant to Loud Hawk, even if this Court determines that there was a negligence factor with regard to the State of Louisiana in not properly funding capital-certified counsel, there are valid policy interests at play here; and the fact that Louisiana is generous enough to provide specially certified counsel to capital indigent defendants when there is no constitutional requirement for it to do so."
2012.11-9953,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1892.67,1893.12,Okay.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,1893.47,1894.22,"--Yes, sir."
2012.11-9953,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1894.22,1904.309,"How -- on that, how could it possibly be Lorenzi's fault, which is what you said is your first point, when he said: Pay me."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,1941.334,1952.209,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, there are several reasons why it's Mr. Lorenzi's fault, the first of which is he filed a motion under State v. Wigley and that is Appendix X of your Joint Appendix."
2012.11-9953,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.847,1964.782,I was going to ask you that question.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,1982.078,1983.661,"I agree with you, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1995.568,2004.424,"Doesn't he say at the same time, I couldn't do the investigation to make the motion required by the State?"
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2009.395,2013.699,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, if you look at Appendix LL where Mr. Lorenzi is speaking, he says"
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2024.671,2027.457,Were there funds for investigation?
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2027.457,2034.427,There were funds available in 2003 that Mr. Lorenzi did not avail himself of because he continued his funding motion eight times.
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2034.427,2036.313,Which funds?
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2036.313,2041.548,There was a capital defense account that was held by the Calcasieu Parish Public Defender's Office.
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2061.694,2062.444,Wait a minute.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2069.55,2071.084,"That is not correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-9953,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2105.74,2106.44,What about--
2012.11-9953,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2106.44,2121.167,"Ms. Sigler, on appeal you said this, the -- the State said: Because the defendant was without properly funded counsel for so long, the State simply could not ethically or legally bring him to trial."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2127.587,2137.778,"Justice Kagan, what that statement meant was that we were aware of the fact that the Petitioner was at all times urging his privilege under Rule 31 to capital-certified counsel."
2012.11-9953,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2151.438,2158.358,"Well, did you ever say to Mr. Boyer, you know, you can go ahead right now with this single counsel that you have?"
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2175.486,2186.775,"Justice Kagan, I think that that assumption was made in part out of a desire to recognize Mr. Boyer's decision to try to pursue Rule 31 privileges."
2012.11-9953,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2190.063,2191.379,"Well, a decision implies a choice."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2193.015,2199.269,"--He had a choice that was implicit, Your Honor, under Louisiana law; and he knew that and his counsel certainly knew that."
2012.11-9953,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2199.269,2200.685,"Well, you didn't even know that."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2205.839,2215.711,"Justice Kagan, our response in that particular phrase that you are speaking of has to do with our response to how the Petitioner has phrased this issue all along."
2012.11-9953,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2223.384,2232.823,I thought -- I thought the statement meant could not ethically or legally bring him to trial while he is insisting on his right to two counsel.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2232.823,2234.775,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-9953,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2234.775,2240.162,"It would have been different if he had said, The devil with the second counsel, I want a -- I want a prompt trial."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2240.162,2241.596,That's correct.
2012.11-9953,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2241.596,2244.481,"Then you would have felt that legally and ethically, you could proceed."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2244.481,2245.148,"Yes, sir."
2012.11-9953,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2245.781,2254.235,--What about your friend's argument that he couldn't ask for a speedy trial without an affidavit saying he was ready to go to trial?
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2254.235,2270.929,"It's interesting that petitioner argued that here today, because under Article 71 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, while an affidavit is listed in the statute as one requirement, as a matter of course, motions for speedy trial are granted pro se all the time that meet none of the requirements in that statute."
2012.11-9953,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2281.118,2289.391,Mr. Boyer was -- had a limited education and a low IQ.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2300.348,2306.519,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I would first like to address that I do not believe the petitioner has a low IQ."
2012.11-9953,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2322.947,2324.481,What was the level of his education?
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2324.481,2327.166,--I believe his level of education was eighth grade.
2012.11-9953,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2329.201,2337.706,"And he was expected to know all this about two counsel -- you have a right to two counsel but if the State isn't going to pay them, you can go forward with one counsel."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2343.86,2347.929,"--Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe that that specific discussion was ever had--"
2012.11-9953,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2347.929,2350.114,His one counsel might have known.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2359.62,2360.906,--Absolutely.
2012.11-9953,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2379.633,2383.435,"And he was not in -- you said that all times, he had at least two."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2392.708,2393.793,"Yes, ma'am."
2012.11-9953,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2393.793,2398.345,"--and then the woman, Lehman, is it?"
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2405.016,2414.557,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, as has been alluded to before, I believe by Justice Scalia, she absolutely had the qualifications to serve as counsel as required by the Sixth Amendment."
2012.11-9953,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2416.041,2422.477,But she wouldn't -- she couldn't be appointed counsel in a death case under Louisiana's rules.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2422.477,2426.348,--She met the qualifications for associate counsel.
2012.11-9953,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2430.75,2433.785,"But from the very beginning, she wasn't even qualified to do that."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2433.785,2445.26,"--Well, there was a provision -- there is a provision in Louisiana law that allows someone to move for the admission and the certification of somebody as capital counsel, which was the procedure employed in this case."
2012.11-9953,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2459.935,2462.971,"She was a graduate of Yale law school, wasn't she?"
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2462.971,2464.404,--She's a very impressive attorney.
2012.11-9953,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.404,2470.658,"And another of his counsel, Mr. Singer -- of the three that he had -- he was a graduate of Harvard law school, wasn't he?"
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2470.658,2471.525,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-9953,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2471.525,2472.077,Son of a gun.
2012.11-9953,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2472.077,2474.945,Well -- he did not [sotto voce] provide adequate counsel.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2476.895,2480.683,"I would refute that, Justice Thomas."
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2480.683,2485.235,"Counsel, do you want to define constitutionally adequate counsel?"
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2492.089,2492.991,Or LSU law.
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2492.991,2495.793,"I would think -- no, no, no."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2515.27,2516.456,Well--
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2516.456,2528.597,"I know plenty of lawyers who would never either volunteer or would resist being appointed to take on that kind of case, because it has many differences to a normal case."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2528.597,2536.853,"--I would agree with that, Justice Sotomayor, but I would invite you to look at the motion that moved for the certification of Ms. Lehman, which is in the record."
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2537.636,2539.22,She's a very experienced trial counsel.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2542.338,2543.273,"--She was, Your Honor."
2012.11-9953,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2556.531,2562.418,Let me -- let me give you a holding -- this is an incredibly factually complicated case.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2583.064,2592.604,"--If the failure to provide funding is a deliberate attempt on the State to interfere with the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, then I would agree with that."
2012.11-9953,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2592.604,2608.216,"You also agree, probably on this subject, but the only sentence that I can find -- I haven't read it totally carefully -- but in the lower court opinion that has to do with this is the sentence that I read before, and it says:"
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2657.882,2661.767,"Justice Breyer, I regret to inform you that I do not concede that point."
2012.11-9953,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2663.584,2664.302,All right.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2667.071,2681.58,"I believe if you look at Appendix D, as I stated earlier, the other Barker factors are discussed, and the continuance motions that were filed by defense counsel are mentioned with regard to the assertion of the right, but not necessarily mentioned with regard to the State."
2012.11-9953,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2681.58,2682.397,"Yes, you are right."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2700.725,2704.877,I don't think that was the stated -- the intention of the Third Circuit.
2012.11-9953,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2704.877,2705.446,Neither do I.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2714.052,2716.319,"Well, I believe--"
2012.11-9953,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2716.319,2717.087,"It says, you see --"
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2721.688,2728.226,"--Well, I believe what the Third Circuit was referring to was this Court's Barker v. Wingo jurisprudence."
2012.11-9953,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2732.963,2733.53,"Oh, okay."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2748.89,2763.649,"--I think that they are attempting in some fashion to reconcile some of this Court's later statements in the Barker jurisprudence, which this Court made it clear in Vermont v. Brillon that certain actions are not going to be attributed to the State for speedy trial purposes--"
2012.11-9953,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2763.649,2764.317,When you agreed with--
2012.11-9953,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2764.317,2766.084,"Ms. Sigler, could you go back to Justice Alito's question?"
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2766.084,2766.601,--I'm sorry.
2012.11-9953,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2766.601,2769.053,That was a big segue.
2012.11-9953,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2770.638,2772.821,Justice Alito has a question pending.
2012.11-9953,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2772.821,2783.896,"You agreed with the -- the principle that I mentioned, except that you want to draw a distinction between the failure to provide funding and the deliberate failure to provide funding?"
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2785.398,2786.498,Absolutely.
2012.11-9953,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2786.498,2789.45,That the State inadvertently failed to provide funding?
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2789.45,2799.575,I think that this Court has always recognized in the Barker jurisprudence that negligence is a very different factor in how it weighs against a State than a deliberate attempt to violate a constitutional right to a speedy trial.
2012.11-9953,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2799.575,2807.678,"--When we said in Brillon, delays resulting from a systemic breakdown in the public defender system could be charged to the State."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2830.794,2838.966,"Well, Justice Kagan, I think that the best evidence or the fact that there was no systemic breakdown is the funding hearing itself, Appendix JJ."
2012.11-9953,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2854.575,2870.102,"Well, what if you have a case where the defendant wants counsel, can't afford counsel, and the State says: We'd love to provide counsel for you, but we're broke; we just don't have any money to provide counsel; but maybe in a year we'll have money to provide counsel."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2878.025,2886.613,"Well, I think from that scenario, we would have to look at the State's intention."
2012.11-9953,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2901.723,2903.475,--Suppose it is negligent.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2925.938,2927.773,"No, Justice Breyer."
2012.11-9953,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2928.323,2930.006,Is there any authority for that?
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2936.843,2947.551,"--Well, you discount it, Justice Breyer, and you attribute it to more of a negligence standard than you would a -- an absolute failure or refusal to provide counsel."
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2947.884,2948.417,I'm sorry.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,2993.946,3007.02,"Justice Sotomayor, I believe in this Court's decisions under Barker v. Wingo the choice aspect, the deliberate intent aspect, has been looked at by the courts in deciding how much of the blame is to be assessed against the State."
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3007.02,3008.872,"Well, then answer the question."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,3025.898,3030.052,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, that choice was not made in this case."

2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,3035.956,3038.006,--There were available funds in 2003.
2012.11-9953,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3040.008,3050.282,The court itself said repeatedly that the cause of the delay was the funding crisis.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,3070.277,3076.364,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, the funding crisis that the court ruled on was present in 2006."
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3138.271,3142.558,I'm not going to argue the funding issue because I've got to go look at the record again.
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,3176.979,3185.135,"--Justice Sotomayor, I maintain that position, and I believe it to be consistent with this Court's repeated analysis under Barker v. Wingo jurisprudence."
2012.11-9953,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3197.876,3208.767,"So there could never be a systematic breakdown in your judgment, because any time the State gives resources to something else, it's not deliberate -- it's not a systemic breakdown."
2012.11-9953,1,20107,carla_s_sigler,,3208.767,3212.486,"--Justice Sotomayor, I would invite you to look at the motion for funding hearing again."

2012.11-9953,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3366.738,3376.427,"There was money allocated, but if I understood the record correctly -- by the State -- the funding was grossly inadequate to cover all the needs?"
2012.11-9953,2,38793,richard_bourke,,3376.427,3376.994,Right.
2012.11-9953,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3379.395,3382.93,"Mr. Bourke, would you respond to the last point made by -- by opposing counsel?"
2012.11-9953,2,38793,richard_bourke,,3382.93,3383.497,"--Yes, certainly."
2012.11-9953,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3383.497,3393.305,"You did state, it's in Appendix J, even if the murder indictment were quashed, Mr. Boyer faces the armed robbery prosecution."

2012.11-9953,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3393.855,3400.559,"You told us today that that's not the case, that the armed robbery prosecution goes down the drain."
2012.11-9953,2,38793,richard_bourke,,3401.442,3413.117,"The passage you're referring to is from a writ application purely limited to the application of the State speedy trial statute, which does accord a new clock to every new filing."
2012.11-9953,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3421.722,3426.193,As to the murder or as to the independent robbery count?
2012.11-9953,2,38793,richard_bourke,,3428.711,3436.399,"The armed robbery was a lesser included of first-degree murder, but it is not a lesser included of second-degree murder."
2012.11-9953,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3449.709,3450.725,Mr. Boyer -- why would--
2012.11-9953,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3450.725,3451.259,Go ahead.
2012.11-9953,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3451.259,3454.277,--Why would we get to that question?
2012.11-9953,2,38793,richard_bourke,,3463.132,3466.334,"It is well beyond the question presented, Your Honor, I agree."
2012.11-9953,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3468.036,3474.44,"So -- so from that point of view, we can assume that there is a robbery conviction that is still out there."
2012.11-9953,2,38793,richard_bourke,,3474.44,3478.326,--He has a murder and armed robbery conviction from the same incident.
2012.11-9953,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3482.013,3484.13,"Or assume there isn't, right?"
2012.11-9953,2,38793,richard_bourke,,3484.13,3491.136,"That -- that is why this Court would remand to allow the -- the local court to deal with it, and ensure that that's accurate."
