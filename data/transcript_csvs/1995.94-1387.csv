1995.94-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.689,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-1387, Yamaha Motor Corporation v. Lucien Calhoun."
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,16.259,17.426,Thank you.
1995.94-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,64.239,70.743,Do we actually know what difference it makes as to what this particular plaintiff recovers which view prevails?
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,70.743,84.82,"Well, of course, the damages issues, the exact elements of damages issue was not accepted by this Court, although it was one of those that was... we asked the Court to address."
1995.94-1387,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,84.82,97.478,"So at this stage, we're deciding a fairly abstract question, and conceivably it might not make any difference, is that correct, that Puerto Rico might have the same rule as the general maritime law?"
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,97.478,114.339,"I believe you are addressing, in that sense, an abstract question, yes, and, indeed, the damages issues can go either way, depending upon what State law you're applying, not just Puerto Rico or Pennsylvania, but my own State of Maryland, would have differences between those."
1995.94-1387,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,114.339,121.576,"Do the definitions of the primary duty possibly differ, depending on the rule we adopt?"
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,121.576,123.945,I do not believe so.
1995.94-1387,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,160.57,173.295,"So when we're deciding this case, I assume we should consider that the consequences of our decision may have some bearing on how the primary duty will be defined in other cases that come before us."
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,173.295,174.011,Certainly--
1995.94-1387,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,174.011,178.949,Or are you just confining your argument to questions of damages and remedy?
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,178.949,180.832,--No.
1995.94-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,200.01,205.28,"Yes, but isn't there this difference: you really wouldn't have a seaworthiness claim with this particular article, would you?"
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,205.28,205.797,No.
1995.94-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,207.399,208.399,Which is what we had in Moragne.
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,208.399,214.636,--has a theory of liability that is only available to a Jones Act seaman.
1995.94-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,214.636,221.873,"Well, theoretically you could have a seaworthiness theory of absolute liability for passengers, couldn't you?"
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,221.873,247.607,"Well, the strict liability theory is certainly an absolute liability theory, so if it was a claim that the ship or a passenger on a ship was injured by some defect or defective design of the ship or the boat, then you would have an absolute liability theory under which the plaintiff could recover, but it would not be the unseaworthiness theory."
1995.94-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,247.607,253.142,"In this case we have a negligence theory, don't we?"
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,253.142,264.3,"We have a... we have negligence but there's also a claim in strict liability, which this Court recognized as being viable under maritime law in the East River case."
1995.94-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,264.3,269.621,"You contend that marine preempts the negligence theory, don't you?"
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,269.621,270.521,"No, I don't."
1995.94-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,270.521,271.171,Oh.
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,271.171,286.398,"First of all, I think Moragne precludes the remedy of State wrongful death, but it doesn't preempt any theory along those lines, so--"
1995.94-1387,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,286.398,291.017,"Because, as Federal common law, we can adopt that theory."
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,291.017,295.421,"--What theory is that, Your Honor?"
1995.94-1387,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,295.421,301.825,Any theory that is not... you say it doesn't preempt a particular theory of liability.
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,301.825,302.292,Correct.
1995.94-1387,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,302.292,307.829,"And the answer to that is because we can make up common law, Federal common law, and adopt a different theory."
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,307.829,308.579,And you have.
1995.94-1387,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,329.659,330.594,I just wanted to understand your reasoning.
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,336.431,336.848,--Correct.
1995.94-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,336.848,337.381,Yes.
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,351.175,351.608,Yes.
1995.94-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,351.608,361.131,"And Moragne held that the unseaworthiness claim was available, and it left standing... as you remember, it was a 1292(b) appeal... left standing the negligence theory."
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,362.982,363.282,Correct.
1995.94-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,363.282,370.386,"Do you contend that if the same two-count complaint were filed today, that the negligence, State law negligence theory would be preempted?"
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,370.386,386.229,"Yes, because I believe the Moragne theory of recovery adapts itself, or allows itself to go forward under any theory of liability, be it strict product liability, be it negligence--"
1995.94-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,386.229,388.748,Even though it was not preempted in Moragne itself?
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,388.748,389.231,--Yes.
1995.94-1387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,389.231,398.572,"And even though Moragne, even going back to The Harrisburg, said the way we got into this mess in the first place was that they sued too late on the State claim."
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,398.572,405.06,"Yes, well, The Harrisburg, of course, held that there was no wrongful death remedy."
1995.94-1387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,405.06,408.427,"Yes, but let me just understand this background of the case."
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,422.604,432.96,"Yes, because this Court allowed State wrongful death statutes to provide a remedy where The Harrisburg said there was none under the general maritime law."
1995.94-1387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,432.96,445.469,"So when the Death on the High Seas Act was passed, everyone understood that for inland waters, as distinguished from overseas, that their State law remedies would apply."
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,445.469,455.742,"That was because, I believe, that the Congress, when it passed the Death on the High Seas Act, was providing the remedy where there was none."
1995.94-1387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,457.092,457.527,Right.
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,457.527,458.644,--that was presented to it.
1995.94-1387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,458.644,478.608,"Right, and then we get Moragne, which involves an unseaworthiness claim, and this Court is adding something that didn't exist before, a Federal maritime law claim for the unseaworthiness for the benefit of a longshore worker, and that's what Moragne itself does."
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,512.845,527.355,I think the logic of Moragne is such that you can only read it as providing a uniform death remedy that is to apply to the exclusion of State wrongful death statutes.
1995.94-1387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,527.355,539.246,"Well, Mr. Bartlett, to put it another way, it seems to me for you to prevail we would have to extend Moragne, because it didn't really cover this."
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,539.246,547.668,"It only went to the unseaworthiness theory of liability, that's correct, but--"
1995.94-1387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,547.668,549.787,"I mean, it seems to me you'd have to extend it."
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,563.028,563.797,"--No, I don't."
1995.94-1387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,576.021,591.531,"Well, there's a division of opinion on whether Moragne should be extended to this, but it... what is the Federal interest in uniformity in connection with a jet ski accident in territorial waters?"
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,620.583,621.183,--Yes.
1995.94-1387,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,637.762,655.139,"Well, there can be admiralty jurisdiction in territorial waters, we've so held, but perhaps it's limited to where there's really a Federal interest, where there are seamen involved, or longshoremen and harbor workers, or something of that sort."
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,666.679,689.028,"I believe it is, because the Constitution, Article III, section 2, spoke to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts, and with that this Court has held time and time again that that power meant that the Federal courts were to fashion this general maritime law, exactly what this Court did in Moragne."
1995.94-1387,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,689.028,691.979,But I had thought... you're referring now to admiralty jurisdiction.
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,704.887,706.239,Sir--
1995.94-1387,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,706.239,712.06,"I mean, it seems to me that we're mixing up jurisdiction here with the source of the primary duty."
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,712.06,722.968,--This Court has held in the East River case and articulated in several other cases that with admiralty jurisdiction comes admiralty substantive laws.
1995.94-1387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,743.614,763.093,"Mr. Bartlett, I think you conceded, and you were very forthright in this, that pre-Moragne, the law that was applied in cases like this was State law, State wrongful death acts, State survival acts, and you are not suggesting now, are you, that that was an unconstitutional course?"
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,763.093,765.128,Not at all.
1995.94-1387,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,795.047,805.42,"On your theory, is there any role left for the enforcement of a State rule on a kind of borrowing theory by an admiralty court?"
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,805.42,811.841,"In this particular area, wrongful death remedies, I think not."
1995.94-1387,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,816.06,817.11,What about the death of a swimmer?
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,817.11,821.547,"--It would depend on how the swimmer died, Your Honor."
1995.94-1387,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,842.445,843.045,Two swimmers collide.
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,843.045,843.828,--Excuse me?
1995.94-1387,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,843.828,847.515,"Two swimmers collide, no... State law can apply in that case."
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,847.515,848.565,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1387,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,848.565,851.717,"Yes, but the swimmer collides with water skis... admiralty jurisdiction."
1995.94-1387,0,29191,james_w_bartlett_iii,,851.717,853.502,"It would depend, I think--"
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1186.413,1192.685,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1387,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1207.445,1212.647,"Will you when you... before you get through explain why the second count of Moragne survived, then?"
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1212.647,1215.283,"The issue is not before the Court, Justice Stevens."
1995.94-1387,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1215.283,1216.885,"But it was decided in that case, was it?"
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1216.885,1217.551,No.
1995.94-1387,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1222.039,1223.639,"If Moragne didn't decide it, what did?"
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1223.639,1226.323,--What decides the--
1995.94-1387,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1226.323,1227.942,Decide your view.
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1227.942,1228.358,--Right.
1995.94-1387,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1266.983,1268.883,You say Tallentire decided--
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1268.883,1269.269,--Yes.
1995.94-1387,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1304.257,1306.025,"--Well, what's the substantive admiralty law here?"
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1319.3,1323.237,"--Well, I guess that's the threshold issue I meant to address, which is just what is the scope of the general--"
1995.94-1387,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1323.237,1328.891,"Okay, and until that threshold issue is addressed, Tallentire isn't on point, or we can't tell whether it's on point."
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1328.891,1329.341,--I agree.
1995.94-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1379.991,1387.728,"In this case, I get the sense we don't know what the State remedies are, and we don't know what the admiralty remedies are."
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1387.728,1387.978,Right.
1995.94-1387,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1387.978,1392.28,So we're talking about a very abstract proposition that may make no difference at all.
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1392.28,1407.373,"Conceivably, although I think at the end of the day the issue would be, are State remedies precluded because they are inconsistent with the Federal maritime remedy, so while it's possible at the end of the day a State remedy could apply, that is only because it is thoroughly consistent with the Federal remedy developed in Moragne."
1995.94-1387,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1407.373,1408.557,"What, in fact, you're saying is--"
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1414.109,1414.828,Right.
1995.94-1387,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1414.828,1431.738,"If we agree with you, we displace a substantial body of State law on products liability personal negligence, et cetera, in all death cases, areas in which States have very substantial expertise, very well-developed bodies of law."
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1453.753,1457.205,"Let me address those first as a matter of precedent, second as a matter of policy."
1995.94-1387,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1510.007,1513.375,But why does that lead to the rule that there must be absolute uniformity?
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1520.629,1522.997,--I agree with your proposition.
1995.94-1387,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1529.901,1542.358,"I don't understand the Federal interest in having a different remedy, a different regime for the jet skier who is off the coast of Puerto Rico and the one who is on an inland lake."
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1542.358,1550.798,"--The interest is that Article III has committed the admiralty jurisdiction, which has been defined to include the former, Puerto Rico, and not the latter."
1995.94-1387,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1557.268,1571.128,You've already... I think you've agreed with me that for years maritime jurisdiction coexisted peacefully with picking up wrongful death and survival acts from State laws and plugging them into claims like this one.
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1571.128,1586.137,"--Right, and I think historically the reason between The Harrisburg and Moragne, why State remedies were picked up, was akin... was simply because there was a gap in Federal remedial coverage, and the admiralty does what it does when there is no Federal law on point, which is to borrow State law, as Judge Breyer did in his First Circuit opinion."
1995.94-1387,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1606.218,1622.477,"I think you also make the more general point, if I understood your answer to my earlier question, and that is, Tallentire applies because Moragne requires you... requires the Federal admiralty courts to develop substantive law in this area."
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1622.477,1622.929,Exactly.
1995.94-1387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1622.929,1623.746,There is no choice left.
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1628.5,1641.641,"I couldn't put it better, and essentially the lower Federal courts for 25 years have fleshed out the Moragne remedy in the nonseamen territorial waters context, following the cues sent by this Court, for example in the Miles case."
1995.94-1387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1641.641,1643.426,"That's what I want to know, what they do."
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1643.426,1643.793,Right.
1995.94-1387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1643.793,1654.632,"In personal injury cases, in territorial waters, don't admiralty courts by and large apply for nonseamen, nonlongshoremen, State law?"
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1687.705,1688.422,Yes.
1995.94-1387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1688.422,1697.644,"--All right, then if that's what you should do, then isn't... then here, wouldn't State law apply across the board, with possible exceptions for punitives and survival of pecuniary damages?"
1995.94-1387,1,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,1699.044,1704.798,"But once you... but you've... you're... the last thing you said, Justice Breyer, I think answers the question."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1771.005,1776.909,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1387,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1797.422,1802.559,And you concede the Federal court has admiralty jurisdiction over the case?
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1802.559,1809.546,"We allege jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction both on the diversity statute and under the admiralty statute."
1995.94-1387,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.649,1841.784,That's the first inquiry in any Federal court--
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1841.784,1842.451,"--Precisely, Your Honor."
1995.94-1387,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.451,1843.386,--is subject matter jurisdiction.
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1843.386,1857.361,"But we have subject matter jurisdiction here because there is diversity, and we didn't need to allege admiralty jurisdiction, and we want to rest our claim on the diversity jurisdiction because we are relying on substantive State law in this case."
1995.94-1387,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1857.361,1858.745,May I ask you one question?
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1870.62,1873.988,"Well, Your Honor, that is, of course, the Court's prerogative."
1995.94-1387,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1881.428,1881.844,Yes.
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1881.844,1894.569,"--it is... it has been argued that way, but I would agree that the Court could now, as Justice O'Connor said earlier, extend Moragne to say, even though we didn't displace State law back then, we're going to do it now."
1995.94-1387,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1905.709,1924.421,"Well, what if a seaman, the executor of a seaman comes into court and says, my... the seaman had an unseaworthiness claim against a vessel, and so I'm suing... I'm suing the shipowner, and I'm suing him diversity of citizenship."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1932.027,1963.38,"No, Your Honor, it doesn't for one very important reason, and that is because as to the seaman, there is a Federal statute, the Jones Act, and as to death on the high seas, there's the Death on the High Seas Act, and for longshoremen or harbor workers there is another Federal statute, and so when... cases like Miles and Tallentire and Higginbotham all involve cases where there was a comprehensive Federal statute, and this Court said in every one of those cases, we are not in a position to second guess the judgment made by Congress."
1995.94-1387,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1978.223,1993.851,"Not only that, but may I just throw in, in Moragne itself, they referred that question to the Florida State supreme court, and they held there was no State remedy for unseaworthiness, so there's an absence of a State remedy as well as the presence of a Federal remedy in the hypothetical."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1993.851,1994.851,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1995.94-1387,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1997.886,2004.04,"Mr. Morrison, but I'm not still clear on this pleader's choice that the Chief was raising."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2035.142,2041.213,"--Well, I... I'm not sure that I understand Your Honor's question precisely."
1995.94-1387,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2056.239,2058.341,"No, let me... you don't understand my question."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2059.091,2059.608,"I think I do not, Your Honor."
1995.94-1387,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2059.608,2060.627,--as simple as I possibly can.
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2087.86,2096.382,I think Your Honor is referring to the cases in which the substantive law to be applied is Federal maritime law.
1995.94-1387,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2135.091,2141.495,"But you would envision a different result, then, if there had been no diversity of citizenship in this case."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2149.017,2168.829,"Your Honor, in that case, we probably would have filed it in State court, but I would agree with Justice Ginsburg that in that case, even by going into the State court, if Federal maritime law applies the substantive principle, the reverse Erie issue, we would have had to apply Federal maritime law even if the choice of forum was the State court."
1995.94-1387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.829,2171.364,"I'm not sure what you're saying, Mr. Morrison."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2181.054,2182.506,That is... we certainly do not have to decide it.
1995.94-1387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2182.506,2184.006,So long as Federal admiralty law doesn't apply.
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2184.006,2184.441,"Correct, Your Honor."
1995.94-1387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2184.924,2189.56,Are there any circumstances where it would make any difference so long as Federal maritime law doesn't apply?
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2189.56,2190.094,"No, Your Honor."
1995.94-1387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.911,2193.546,"I thought that was your point, not that--"
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2193.546,2193.879,"That is my point, Your Honor."
1995.94-1387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2193.879,2217.079,"--Do you care whether it makes a difference whether the court were... and does it, whether the court says, of course maritime law applies, but in territorial waters, Federal maritime law picks up State law insofar as it is not hostile to the policy of Federal maritime law, or the Court says, of course State law applies to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the policies of Federal maritime law."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2224.899,2235.04,"Well, I believe that the petitioners are arguing that in this case anything that looks to State law automatically undermines Federal law."
1995.94-1387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2235.04,2235.59,But do you care?
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2236.273,2240.36,"Yes, I... well, I care in the sense that I know what they are arguing for."
1995.94-1387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2245.662,2251.3,"--Yes, but you could easily say that Federal maritime law picks up in territorial waters."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2254.785,2257.62,"--Well, they pick up a lot less o the remedy side than most State wrongful death--"
1995.94-1387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2257.62,2263.191,--But they're dealing... on the remedy side they're dealing with Jones Act seamen and longshoremen.
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2274.579,2293.325,"--Well, part of my plea is that when we are dealing with civilians... that is, nonseamen, nonlongshoremen... that we ought not to start pushing them into the maritime field when there's no Federal interest in doing so except this rather generalized interest in uniform--"
1995.94-1387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2293.325,2294.459,--What happens in personal injury cases?
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2317.108,2332.034,"--Well, I have not been able to figure it out entirely either, Your Honor, but I do think that there is probably on the remedy side, as opposed to the primary duty side, a fair amount of differences among the States... that is, nuances differences."
1995.94-1387,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2348.46,2353.281,"Mr. Morrison, I don't think that's the question, because it is the same one that's troubling me, and let me put it this way."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2366.605,2375.361,"--In my view, it would have been... she should have and would have been entitled to sue under State law, and... but I recognize that there are some cases that call that into question."
1995.94-1387,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2423.127,2434.149,"Well, our Foremost decision, which says that pleasure boating comes within admiralty, is certainly a precedent that might suggest there's admiralty jurisdiction just on the basis of the jet ski here."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2434.149,2435.832,"There may be jurisdiction, Your Honor."
1995.94-1387,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2453.644,2457.93,"Well, maybe it's Federal law, but Federal law says we'll look to State law."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2461.799,2464.768,"--Well, I guess my... there's certainly a logical possibility."
1995.94-1387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2484.415,2489.884,"--Yes, the reason would have been because of the admiralty... you say, a) is it a maritime tort?"
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2510.38,2510.713,I don't believe so.
1995.94-1387,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2571.021,2606.527,"--Mr. Morrison, if I understand you correctly, Moragne would be a rather small thing... that is, if the personal injury claimant retains the same right that the or she had before Moragne for the civilian torts... and what claim would Moragne apply to other than a sailor who dies and there's a claim for unseaworthiness which is not covered by the Jones Act."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2612.681,2620.286,"Well, the Court has never decided how... who might be eligible to rely on a claim of unseaworthiness."
1995.94-1387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2716.015,2718.534,"I don't think the opinion speaks that way, Mr. Morrison."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2744.101,2745.934,--I was addressing the question of whether Moragne itself did it.
1995.94-1387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2749.069,2754.457,"--The holding of Moragne could be limited as narrowly as you say, but I don't think the language of Moragne--"
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2754.457,2756.325,"--Well, there is clearly some language about uniformity in there, Your Honor--"
1995.94-1387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2756.325,2756.792,--Sure is.
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2756.792,2759.777,--and I certainly would not extend to the contrary.
1995.94-1387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2794.284,2812.496,"Right, and you make that argument in your brief, and what it raises in my mind is whether you expect us to valuate each case and decide whether a uniform admiralty law will apply or diverse State law will apply on the basis of who the particular manufacturer is."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2812.846,2813.346,Well--
1995.94-1387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.346,2815.281,--can't we have more predictability than that?
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2815.281,2845.3,"--I would at least say, Your Honor, as to manufacturers as opposed to vessel owners, which is what Moragne was actually dealing with, we are in a different category of individuals, companies, and I think the principle difference is that the connection between the manufacturer and the territorial waters is a good deal more attenuated than the connection is between a vessel owner or a vessel operator with concerns about commercial navigation, other kinds of commercial activity, which has animated this Court's maritime--"
1995.94-1387,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2845.3,2847.752,"Well, I suppose the admiralty law could take that into account."
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2860.643,2861.427,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1995.94-1387,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2861.427,2866.963,And I might just say that I take it your position is contrary to the law of most of the circuits--
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2866.963,2870.165,"--That is, most of the circuits have come out the other way."
1995.94-1387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2906.457,2908.473,--Have they before picked up punitives?
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2910.242,2910.908,To my knowledge they have not.
1995.94-1387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2910.908,2911.158,--Have not.
1995.94-1387,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2911.891,2912.691,--but the law of punitive damages had--
