2012.11-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.904,"We will now hear argument in Case 11-192, United States v. Bormes."
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,7.47,10.372,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,19.645,31.019,"Under your view, is there any situation today where the Tucker Act would be applied to a statute?"
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,47.981,50.933,"There are such statutes, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,51.466,56.253,What would they look like to be able to get around our clear statement rule?
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,56.253,61.139,"--Well, they would have two features consistent with this Court's decisions that have found the Tucker Act to be applicable."
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,82.987,89.808,So basically -- I'm not sure why we're even addressing the issue of Tucker Act jurisdiction.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,95.962,96.745,"Well, of course--"
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,96.745,99.497,"--because that becomes, to you, the operative question."
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,99.497,101.699,--It does when they're dealing with the statute like this.
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,213.289,214.839,Could I ask you--
2012.11-192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,214.839,216.074,Mr. Srinivasan -- I'm sorry.
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,216.074,219.859,--I was going to ask -- following up on my question--
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,219.859,220.676,Sure.
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,220.676,226.596,--many courts have held that the FLSA has an express waiver of sovereign immunity.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,237.837,239.522,"Well, the--"
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,239.522,244.074,--because the FLSA has its own remedial scheme?
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,244.074,253.949,"--I think one -- one way to look at the FLSA, if we're looking at it in the first instance, would be to conclude that the FLSA itself has a waiver of sovereign immunity."
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,280.516,289.705,"But then the Federal circuit has no jurisdiction over those claims, according to you, because the waiver is in the FLSA, it has its own judicial remedy."
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,292.324,293.157,"Well, it would depend."
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,300.061,306.048,"--It has the same language as here, in -- you can bring your suit in any Federal or state court of competent jurisdiction."
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,306.048,306.698,Right.
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,316.022,317.539,I don't know -- I don't see the difference between--
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,317.539,339.186,"--Well, I think one way to potentially see the difference -- and I'm not going to quibble with -- with what Your Honor's saying, but one way to potentially see a difference is because the FLSA only refers to courts of competent jurisdiction -- it doesn't have a free-standing provision that reversed the district courts -- it's possible to read that statute as essentially incorporating the Tucker Act as setting forth what the court of competent jurisdiction would be."
2012.11-192,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,358.432,372.276,"Mr. Srinivasan, what you say has a good deal to recommend it, and it's basically, you know, why should we read the Tucker Act to reverse everything that we know about sovereign immunity, but it's really hard to get that from the text of this -- the Tucker Act."
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,380.03,380.882,Sure.
2012.11-192,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,397.891,399.509,"Well, that's not really a textual argument."
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,411.334,412.167,"--Well, I guess--"
2012.11-192,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,412.167,413.201,--against any statute.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,418.405,419.34,--Sure.
2012.11-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,441.336,446.24,I assume you are appealing to the textual principle that the specific governs the general.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,448.274,449.109,--We're appealing--
2012.11-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,449.109,460.315,"That the Tucker Act is a more general provision, and you are saying it's -- it's overcome by a more specific provision that provides for compensation but excludes the federal government."
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,460.315,468.921,"--We're certainly relying on that, Justice Scalia, when you're asking whether the Tucker Act can be used as the basis for waiving sovereign immunity for claims under the Fair Credit Reporting Act."
2012.11-192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,560.33,565.067,The United States is governed by the substance of the Credit Reporting Act.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,588.033,590.552,"Well, I guess a few responses, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,672.004,672.404,Excuse me.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,675.456,676.741,--1681b(b).
2012.11-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.291,678.558,You said 7a.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,678.558,680.193,"--Well, I'm sorry."
2012.11-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.277,708.16,Right.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,708.16,713.498,--it stands to reason that the term “ person ” in b(b) -- which starts at 4a; excuse me -- encompass the United States Government.
2012.11-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,755.591,761.763,"Still in all, your argument is -- is not just a straightforward specific governs the general argument."
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,814.879,820.883,"I think, with respect, Justice Scalia, I think that's a distinction that ultimately doesn't make a difference in the context of this case."
2012.11-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,854.687,863.86,"No, but that's -- that's because the negative implication of that statute is -- affirms that there is no liability of the United States."
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,869.93,881.004,"Well, I guess -- I don't think we need to have that negative implication to that full extent in order to invoke the specific versus the general canon, because the question at the end of the day is what did Congress intend?"
2012.11-192,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,900.383,900.801,Mr. Srinivasan--
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,900.801,913.626,"And therefore in that sense, the specific remedial scheme that's in the statute should control over some other general scheme that Congress might well not have had in mind at all when it set forward the terms under which claims can be brought under FCRA."
2012.11-192,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,913.626,916.078,--How specific does the other statute have to be?
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,925.933,928.718,If the statute were that general?
2012.11-192,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,928.718,929.202,Yes.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,945.097,952.518,"I think I would, because I think in that context, Congress would have made a determination on the scope of liability for claims under that statute."
2012.11-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1001.683,1020.245,Isn't it really -- doesn't the question come down to as you're putting it whether -- whether the Tucker Act eliminates for all other statutes the presumption against liability on the part of the United States?
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1020.245,1020.895,--It does.
2012.11-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1029.251,1033.203,"Well, then it's really the specific governing the general, but the other way around, right?"
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1045.895,1060.889,"--Well, it would be hard to square that understanding with the way -- with the series of this Court's cases that apply the specific versus general canon, because I think the same argument could have been made in Brown v. General Services Administration, in Erika, in Hinck, that if you thought that the subject--"
2012.11-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1060.889,1062.239,"You'd win under this argument, too, right?"
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1062.239,1062.705,--I'm sorry?
2012.11-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1062.705,1064.574,"You win under this argument, too."
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1072.197,1072.797,Right.
2012.11-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1072.797,1074.163,The Tucker Act does.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1081.902,1086.27,"It -- well, you can look at it that way, Mr. Chief Justice, but I guess my only response--"
2012.11-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.27,1087.456,"In which case you would lose, not win."
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1087.456,1089.574,"--Well, that's the question because it depends on--"
2012.11-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1089.574,1090.791,Yes -- we have known existed.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1090.791,1092.36,--it depends on how you construe the Tucker Act.
2012.11-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.264,1129.299,So what is covered by the Tucker Act?
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1141.424,1143.626,There -- well--
2012.11-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1143.626,1144.993,So what--
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1144.993,1147.511,"--not claims in contract, for example."
2012.11-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.434,1154.851,--Okay.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1156.817,1158.303,--The just compensation clause.
2012.11-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1162.255,1162.638,Okay.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1174.328,1181.768,"If that statute -- at least if that statute has its own remedial scheme, then you'd look to the remedial scheme in that statute."
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1183.953,1186.003,--That's exactly what I started with.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1188.738,1189.055,Right.
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1239.005,1248.626,"So the new rule is if a statute is written to impose obligations only on the government, then the Tucker Act is implicated immediately."
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1277.98,1278.665,I think that's--
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1278.665,1279.448,That's your position.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1279.448,1290.389,"--I think that's right, Your Honor, but I'd qualify it in one respect, which is that if the statute contains its own remedial scheme, that's an independent reason for not looking at the Tucker Act."
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1290.389,1314.505,"Well, you are not going to suggest that if the scheme I just described says X, Y, and Z, have to do all these things, and someone to whom they owe that obligation can sue the Medicaid provider, for example, for breach of that obligation, presumably -- I'm putting in a lot of hypotheticals given our case law -- but you're saying they can't sue the government under the Tucker Act--"
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1314.505,1314.938,Right.
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1314.938,1317.123,--unless there is an express waiver.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1317.123,1317.807,That's right.
2012.11-192,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1323.943,1334.132,"How about if a statute has no remedial provision at all; it just lists a set of legal obligations, but it is a generally applicable statute, it doesn't concern only the United States?"
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1337.62,1338.753,"Yes, it would."
2012.11-192,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1350.844,1355.063,So then your argument really isn't about another statute having a remedial scheme.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1383.315,1383.932,--That's true.
2012.11-192,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1409.88,1410.347,Say it again.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1412.799,1427.04,"The last sentence, the last thought at least -- maybe I should try to rephrase it, but the last thought is that this Court's jurisprudence already presupposes that the Tucker Act doesn't apply to every act of Congress because the Court's jurisprudence requires that the act of Congress be money mandated."
2012.11-192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1437.348,1439.367,But is this a money-mandated statute?
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1439.367,1447.604,--If you didn't have -- that's -- that's -- I guess -- if you didn't have the remedial scheme.
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1538.046,1538.962,"Counsel, this sort of begs the question--"
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1538.962,1539.946,--is you only get to that question if you get past that hurdle.
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1539.946,1544.783,"--the statute awards damages for breach of the obligation, so it's money mandating."
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1549.418,1551.02,"Well, right, but--"
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1551.02,1554.822,But there is not an issue of whether it contemplates the payment of damages.
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1556.508,1562.661,"--But I think the money-mandating test, Justice Sotomayor, is whether it contemplates the payment of damages by the United States."
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1585.693,1609.808,"--I -- it is -- there is some difficulty with your argument, which is, going back to my simplified hypothetical, government and Medicaid -- X providers have to do X, Y, and Z; if those persons, being defined as government and providers, doesn't do what they have to do, they have to pay these damages."
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1609.808,1612.01,That -- I will grant--
2012.11-192,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1612.01,1613.077,"I mean, that's pretty clear."
2012.11-192,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1613.077,1622.033,"--Well, I will grant you, Justice Sotomayor, that that hypo is more difficult than this case because, although I would construe that to be generally applicable, it does talk about the government."
2012.11-192,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1642.446,1643.146,"Thank you, Counsel."
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1649.367,1652.885,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1686.992,1690.444,"Well, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't need the Tucker Act now, would you?"
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1690.444,1692.546,We--
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.546,1694.079,Just sue under the statute.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1694.079,1694.914,--We could.
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1715.309,1716.744,So are you splitting your claim?
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1732.17,1738.924,"Your Honor, that was -- that was the subject of some debate in the court below."
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.18,1751.982,"You also claimed under FCRA, under the statute, right?"
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1751.982,1752.834,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.834,1753.2,Okay.
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1753.2,1754.584,So why do you care?
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1770.026,1783.186,"We don't particularly care, Your Honor, but we believe that we are required by the statute to appeal to the Federal Circuit if the claim is based in whole or in part on the Tucker Act."
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1783.186,1789.007,"I guess you and the Government could have stipulated, we agree it goes to the Seventh Circuit, and nobody would have opposed you on that."
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1789.007,1791.209,"I -- I -- I do not know, Your Honor."
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1791.209,1797.113,"This case is about you want to go to -- you want to go the Federal Circuit, they want you to go to the Seventh Circuit?"
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1797.113,1797.663,Right.
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1797.663,1798.279,Okay.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1798.279,1806.134,"And in 1681b(b)(4), the statute said--"
2012.11-192,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1806.134,1807.368,I'm sorry.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1807.918,1808.334,--Yes.
2012.11-192,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1808.334,1813.055,"--But if you -- their argument is if you go to the Seventh Circuit, you don't get any money, right?"
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1820.728,1823.528,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2012.11-192,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1823.528,1823.88,No?
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1823.88,1832.786,"I mean, 1681p says you can sue either in district court or any other court of competent jurisdiction."
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1865.321,1876.562,"Do you know any other statutes offhand -- I can't think of any, but maybe you know some -- in which you can get money out of the United States but don't have to go through the Court of Federal Claims and the Federal circuit?"
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1890.221,1898.91,"The Privacy Act, Your Honor, allows you to sue the government in the district court."
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1898.91,1900.394,For money damages.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1900.394,1901.446,"I believe so, Your Honor."
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1901.446,1903.912,Not in tort.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1925.227,1927.344,"The case is about printing the expiration date, Your Honor."
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1927.344,1930.096,"Yeah, can you do and/or or or."
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1935.564,1936.5,Yes.
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1936.5,1940.535,"It sounds like an -- sort of like an invasion of privacy, which is normally a tort."
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,1940.535,1968.971,"It is like it, but I believe this Court's jurisprudence has been for a long while now, at least since Jacobs and I would submit even earlier, Dooley onward, that it doesn't make any difference whether -- if you're suing under a statute of the United States or a contract or anything else, if there's any element of tort in it, it doesn't matter."
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1968.971,1970.837,What do you mean?
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2023.386,2027.854,"There's no doubt intended, Your Honor posed a very difficult question."
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2038.56,2039.995,Even if it says you may not assault someone.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2039.995,2040.712,Yes.
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2047.232,2050.201,And the case I should look at to show that is what?
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2052.803,2057.005,"I think Daly -- Dooley, I think, Your Honor, in 1901 said:"
2012.11-192,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2073.466,2086.624,"But your argument -- your answer is a little more complicated, because the statute doesn't say tort claims, it says claims sounding in tort, which means cases that aren't torts, but are like torts."
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2094.547,2105.288,"Your Honor, I believe, again, that this Court has not interpreted the cases that way."
2012.11-192,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2119.614,2127.451,"Well, your friend says that that's a fiduciary -- that's a trust breach, which has been regarded as different than a tort."
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2127.451,2136.957,"That's what the Government says, but it is also a breach of fiduciary duty, and that is often regarded as a tort, Your Honor."
2012.11-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2138.976,2141.444,"May I ask you, Mr. Jacobs--"
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2141.444,2142.128,--I'm sorry.
2012.11-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2142.128,2161.857,"--whether you think Congress ever honed in on the issue whether the United States, given the multitude of financial transactions in which it engages, ever thought that sovereign immunity would be waived?"
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2202.768,2219.628,"Your Honor, I would submit yes, there is no explicit -- to my knowledge, there is no explicit knowledge in the Congressional Record to whether this was going to impact the government or not."
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2250.849,2253.967,For the same reason that you have the principle of sovereign immunity.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2265.359,2267.794,"--That's exactly correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-192,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2292.076,2292.576,Mr. Jacobs--
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2292.576,2293.142,--the next year.
2012.11-192,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2293.142,2304.014,"--the -- the import of the government's argument is that if your interpretation governed, we would be facing, really, a quite massive change in the law of sovereign immunity as we've known it until this time."
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2362.119,2365.654,"With respect, Justice Kagan, I don't think that's true at all."
2012.11-192,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2384.616,2386.235,I don't think that quite answers the question.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2417.373,2419.923,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2012.11-192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2432.566,2438.452,"When the definition of persons was put into the statute, there was no civil liability; isn't that right?"
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2442.838,2460.783,"Well, when they amended FCRA in 1996 to add the -- to change the word from credit reporting agency to person, I would submit that had to be a conscious step."
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2550.626,2555.762,I -- I really have -- I haven't followed this argument.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2559.564,2560.63,--(l).
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2560.63,2564.016,--shows that they had liability by the government in mind?
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2564.016,2566.284,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.45,2576.556,"I mean, why anybody -- notwithstanding any other provision, the remedies and sanctions set forth in this section shall be the only judicial remedies and sanctions for violation of this section."
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2576.556,2579.008,"--I believe, Your Honor, that--"
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2579.008,2583.71,Why does that bear upon whether the United States is liable or not?
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2583.71,2589.38,"--This u only applies to United States, the FBI."
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.005,2599.438,I see.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2599.438,2607.175,"And this would say, notwithstanding any other provisions, and it wouldn't do that if there weren't other provisions applicable."
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2707.458,2720.7,"Well, if you are right about that, I guess we could write a very narrow opinion saying the Tucker Act applies where there is a cause of action under the original statute anyway, in which case we would not have made much new law, would we?"
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2720.7,2724.086,"Well, I'm hoping we won't make much new law, Your Honor--"
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.086,2724.452,Yes.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2724.452,2729.223,--because I believe this is consistent with this Court's longstanding jurisprudence.
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2852.752,2865.31,"Well, I mean, the -- a lot of these provisions are technical, like the one I think is fairly technical, the one you are talking about, the government -- it provides for treble damages -- treble damages, does it?"
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2865.31,2865.96,No.
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2865.96,2873.016,"Minimum damage, punitive damages, a fairly lengthy statute of limitations compared to the court of claims."
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2873.016,2873.699,2 years.
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2873.699,2873.982,2 years.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2875.284,2879.069,"2 years or 6 years -- 2 years from discovery, 5 years--"
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2879.069,2880.869,My -- my impression was there are several differences.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2920.913,2940.56,"--They -- they are different, Your Honor, but, with respect, I see nothing about saying, this is what you must do, and if you don't do, this is what you have to pay -- I see nothing unusual about saying that can be in the Court of Claims; that that's a Tucker Act claim."
2012.11-192,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2956.086,2969.477,So are you happy with the circuit's suggestion that the specific does govern the general insofar as it will adopt whatever FCRA's limitations are?
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2969.477,2970.246,--Yes.
2012.11-192,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2970.946,2972.698,And into its own processes?
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2972.698,2973.498,--Yes.
2012.11-192,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2973.498,2975.733,Your position is that's perfectly okay.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,2975.733,2976.35,Yes.
2012.11-192,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2980.785,2983.737,"Now, it does seem -- I mean, Justice Breyer's point."
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,3005.935,3015.291,"Well, Your Honor, if I understand your question correctly, I -- I don't believe I agree with the premise."
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3110.42,3110.753,Right.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,3122.927,3123.846,Absolutely.
2012.11-192,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3123.846,3125.946,"So what you want us to say is, okay."
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,3143.741,3149.278,I'm telling Your Honor that we win under such a test.
2012.11-192,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3159.002,3167.323,"One of the purposes of the Tucker Act was to provide a remedy, where none existed, to get rid of the private bills."
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,3210.852,3217.172,"Your Honor, I would submit that that would be a substantial change in this Court's jurisprudence."
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3232.782,3237.586,The Government doesn't concede that you have a cause of action under FCRA at all.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,3237.586,3238.403,No.
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3238.403,3240.955,They say -- they say just the opposite.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,3271.491,3284.649,"Your Honor, the Tucker Act, as made available by Congress, could we proceed only under FCRA?"
2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3295.689,3304.978,Do you have any other case where -- where you -- somebody's been allowed to proceed under the Tucker Act where there is clear ability to proceed under some other statute?
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,3304.978,3309.866,"--Your Honor, I cannot name you a case off the top of my head."
2012.11-192,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3319.138,3321.188,The FSLA as well.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,3321.188,3321.555,--I'm sorry?
2012.11-192,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3321.555,3323.39,The FSLA as well.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,3323.39,3323.874,Yes.
2012.11-192,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3364.001,3367.953,"But Mr. Jacobs, you are trying to evade a certain kind of limitation."
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,3382.211,3383.561,"No, Your Honor."
2012.11-192,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3390.484,3391.817,But then you wouldn't need to go under the Tucker Act.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,3403.225,3435.346,"--The standard, I would submit, Your Honor, is that the Tucker Act is always available unless a -- the substantive statute provides a limitation on that ability; either saying it shall be -- shall be litigated in the Tax Court, it can only be litigated if it is preceded by a claim, an administrative claim, some limitation like that."
2012.11-192,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3453.023,3454.142,You can finish your sentence.
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,3454.142,3462.913,"--what do you do when you say, eh, we think this is -- you know, is this express enough?"
2012.11-192,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3468.215,3469.401,"Thank you, Counsel."
2012.11-192,1,31120,john_g_jacobs,,3469.401,3470.151,Thank you.

2012.11-192,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3472.436,3484.661,"Mr. Srinivasan, I hate to eat up any of your time, but do you acknowledge that there are other statutes under which a person can proceed, either under the statute or under the Tucker Act?"
2012.11-192,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3484.661,3492.747,"No, I'm not aware of that situation, and I think that's why you look to this remedial provision that Congress enacted to determine the metes and bounds."
2012.11-192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3492.747,3494.699,What about the Privacy Act?
2012.11-192,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3494.699,3499.436,The Privacy Act has its own remedial mechanism within it typically.
2012.11-192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3499.436,3502.472,"So you'd say you either proceed under the Privacy Act and you're covered there, or you don't--"
2012.11-192,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3502.472,3503.088,"Or you don't proceed at all, yeah."
2012.11-192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3503.088,3504.605,--And what about -- what is it?
2012.11-192,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3506.424,3511.811,"Well, FLSA is a bit complicated, for the reasons I was adverting to earlier."
