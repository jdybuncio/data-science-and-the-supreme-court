1973.72-1188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.496,We will hear arguments next to 72-1188 Schlesinger against Reservists Committee.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,71.714,75.28,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1973.72-1188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,346.834,366.249,"I suppose -- I suppose that the theory is that the 117 or whether number of members who hold reserve commissions are not receptive to the arguments, political arguments that they want to advance, that they're not has to open-minded as Congressmen generally."
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,366.249,371.269,I think that is the part of the allegation Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-1188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,635.516,639.379,Is the Ex parte Levitt a -- a motion filed originally in this Court was it not?
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,639.379,640.986,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1973.72-1188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,640.986,643.252,It wasn't a -- it wasn't a lawsuit filed in the District Court?
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,643.252,646.448,"No, a petition filed directly in this Court --"
1973.72-1188,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,646.448,648.141,That was the original action?
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,648.141,648.838,That is correct.
1973.72-1188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,648.838,650.163,Well if you?
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,650.163,651.021,Well it's a -- it's --
1973.72-1188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,651.021,651.907,Not like that.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,651.907,656.764,"Wasn't the complaint Mr. Justice Douglas, it was just a motion (Voice Overlap)"
1973.72-1188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,656.764,658.904,"A motion period, wasn't it?"
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,658.904,659.789,Yes sir.
1973.72-1188,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,659.789,663.541,Well it wasn't a motion to start the suit in a District Court.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,663.541,665.194,No Mr. Justice Douglas.
1973.72-1188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,672.459,677.794,But there was -- it did not invoke the original jurisdiction of this Court as such it was a motion filed here.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,677.794,678.214,Yes sir.
1973.72-1188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,678.214,680.487,Alright.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,680.487,703.321,"It would be instructive I think to imagine whether the result would have been any different in that petition had Mr. Levitt alleged that this Clause was designed to eliminate bias and then Mr. Justice Black's service in the Senate was likely to biased in favor of broad national powers, a position which Mr. Levitt did not like."
1973.72-1188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,714.809,718.05,But was not the main burden of Mr. Levitt's complaint?
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,722.776,724.559,That's correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-1188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,724.559,729.507,And he's a member of the bar or is a potential litigant who he had a case here.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,738.03,739.59,It would indeed Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-1188,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,951.389,961.167,"Is the remedy sought would say against the special treatment, remove them from the list of reservists is not cross to remove them in Congress?"
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,961.167,963.356,That is quite true Mr. Justice Douglas.
1973.72-1188,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,973.983,977.432,It's been -- what you mean by this issue?
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,977.432,978.166,That's correct.
1973.72-1188,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,980.361,983.935,This is not a challenge to them to their power to seek in a Congress.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,983.935,984.68,That is quite correct.
1973.72-1188,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,985.394,988.722,Not like the Powell case?
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,988.722,989.915,That is quite correct.
1973.72-1188,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1014.124,1021.009,"If the man has been seated by Congress and still there, we don't have any part there, do we?"
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1021.009,1030.371,"Mr. Justice Marshall, if by that you mean, if he has been seated by Congress and still there the Congress, in that sense, judge the issue."
1973.72-1188,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1033.733,1035.195,Isn't that like politics?
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1035.195,1037.178,That's correct.
1973.72-1188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1037.178,1054.466,Would you think it might be different if after a man was selected to either House you were then confronted with the situation of a new commission emanating from the Executive Branch to the Member of Congress for the first time.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1054.466,1056.458,Mr. Chief Justice I don't think that would be different.
1973.72-1188,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1065.786,1080.782,"Suppose a reservist sues is not paid, and he is in the service and he's not paying, he assumes to recover his salary and the defensive is being in Congress is not lawfully on the reserve."
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1088.682,1090.962,Mr. Justice Douglas that is a very good question.
1973.72-1188,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1096.965,1102.664,Heading on (Inaudible) of other position that they -- he is not entitled to a --
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1102.664,1108.734,"I think, I would -- I think I would say that probably would not be a justiciable issue."
1973.72-1188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1108.734,1124.887,"I think, we have to get a case in our Court involving American soldiers who were taken prisoners during the Korean Hostility saying that there's no defense anyway then until or unless you're terminated from the service is an obligation to pay your salary?"
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1124.887,1125.393,I would suppose so --
1973.72-1188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1125.393,1129.006,Even though you are a deserter or a prisoner war or anything else?
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1129.006,1129.528,I would suppose so --
1973.72-1188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1129.528,1131.738,And that simply wouldn't be a defense?
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1131.738,1136.939,"I would suppose so, but I think that if the Court, Mr. Justice Stewart reached that --"
1973.72-1188,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1136.939,1137.926,It's valid case.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1137.926,1148.226,"With the other way, I think they would -- I think in fairness to Mr. Justice Douglas' question I would have to say, should the Court decide where defense I would think it will not be a justiciable issue."
1973.72-1188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1148.226,1159.72,I suppose there's a certain element to speculate a hypothetical element in that question as it was attempted to be because -- because that was the attitude of the military establishment.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1164.23,1165.423,That's quite right Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-1188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1186.626,1194.867,The Congress would still retain the right to and not to exclude but to expel a member of this ground.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1195.721,1210.656,"Congress, Mr. Chief Justice has -- has vacated seats and expelled members upon the ground that other kinds of commissions in the Armed services were incompatible with the membership in the house did constitute --"
1973.72-1188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1210.656,1216.583,The matter is not closed when they are seated in the first instance by any means.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1216.583,1232.628,"Mr. Chief Justice, the matter is not close, repeatedly Congress has acted under these Clause to vacate seats and is recently is 1963, the Senate passed a resolution which was acted upon requesting the Senate judiciary committee to consider the issue of reserved memberships."
1973.72-1188,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1388.582,1396.994,I think if you suggested that being in Congress is a not a disqualification or holding another office.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1396.994,1406.062,"Yes, I think it is, Mr. Justice White (Voice Overlap)"
1973.72-1188,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1406.062,1418.67,-- so the president or the services would -- could terminate anybody holding a reserve commission when he was elected Congress?
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1418.67,1424.882,"Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Justice White I -- I thought we were discussing the first-half of the Clause."
1973.72-1188,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.492,1436.01,You're' saying -- You're saying that is a qualification for -- it states a qualification to bring a member of the House.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1436.01,1436.416,That's correct.
1973.72-1188,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1436.416,1437.557,That's all it did.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1437.557,1438.921,I think that's all it does to Mr. Justice White.
1973.72-1188,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.921,1443.033,So you do say that it is not a disqualification for holding another office.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1443.033,1452.254,"No Mr. Justice White, I think it's optional with the executive, should he decide that it's bad policy to have two offices of any kind."
1973.72-1188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1473.071,1485.608,Passing on the Levitt case back in the '30s the Court assumed that there was a direct violation of the Constitutional provisions is it not?
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1485.608,1489.735,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe so, I don't believe so, oh -- oh you mean necessarily assume."
1973.72-1188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1489.735,1492.194,Not necessarily assumed.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1492.962,1495.639,Well it depends on which issue you reach first Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-1188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1504.516,1506.335,Assume that arguendo so to speak.
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1506.335,1509.031,So to speak.
1973.72-1188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1509.031,1523.991,"Well at least preferred to the courts of opinion there, the court would have ruled the same way even if it satisfied itself that there have been a direct violation of the Constitution -- that it affected in no way it's determination to standing."
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1523.991,1526.987,That is entirely correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1973.72-1188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1526.987,1543.098,"In other words the remedy -- the remedy there is that the president in 1937, the Court was saying you should apply the -- should not -- have nominated and the Senate should not have not confirmed but having done so the Court wasn't going to get into it."
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1543.098,1551.325,"That's entirely correct, if -- if one takes that is an arguendo position that is entirely correct Mr. Chief Justice."
1973.72-1188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2049.994,2058.927,"Are you suggesting, Mr. Solicitor General, that as to the past, both of these men are something like Kentucky Colonels in terms of --"
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2058.927,2066.092,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, yes, I guess I would suggest precisely that the inactive standby is really an honorary status but the --"
1973.72-1188,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2066.092,2069.246,As long as we don't (Inaudible)
1973.72-1188,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2069.246,2089.949,"Yes, I --I would prefer that -- that of the -- the retired reservists, 50 of them are without pay, a very few of these Congressmen have any substantial connection with the military and such as it is, it's purely voluntarily at their own expense."
1973.72-1188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2089.949,2094.21,Mr. Dobrovir?
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2094.21,2099.19,"Mr. Chief Justice and Justices, may it please the Court."
1973.72-1188,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2176.088,2178.358,The entire Clause or just the (Voice Overlap) --
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2178.358,2246.594,"The basic -- the basic principle that a member of Continental Congress should not hold any office at that time under any of the states because we had a very rudimentary national Government was in the Article V, I believe of the Articles of Confederation and the Clause was stated in the Articles of Confederation as in -- in terms that no member of the Continental Congress shall hold any office as to which there are salaries, emoluments or other -- Article V, Clause 2 of the Articles of Confederation -- nor shall any person being a delegate be capable of holding any office unto the United States for which he or any other for his benefit receives any salary fees or emoluments of any kind."
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2325.922,2341.851,"Would you say that the bar was anymore absolute than the bar that the Court was dealing with in the Levitt case, the appointment of the member of the house or Senate who had voted for an increase or in salary or voted for the creation of the office?"
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2341.851,2344.742,"The bar had a different purpose, as I --"
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2344.742,2347.175,"It's equally explicit, is this not?"
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2347.175,2386.214,"It's equally explicit but there was -- I don't know if I can find the right word but I think there was more of an effect, a desire of an effect beforehand in the first half of Article I, Section 6 in which they were speaking directly to the members of Congress, to say, you shall not create offices, you shall not create or increase the emoluments of offices to which you then may seek appointment and this was something rather more directly aimed at preventing any activity by the members of Congress."
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2699.256,2700.797,Where is that in your brief --
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2700.797,2704.05,That provision is (Voice Overlap) -- that provision is not quoted in our brief.
1973.72-1188,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2799.433,2807.878,And that he should have -- by being sworn into the Congress that automatically vacates which --
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2807.878,2813.644,"As we read these -- as we read these authorities, it -- it seems to say automatically."
1973.72-1188,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2814.093,2826.783,"But you're suggesting on this -- when each of these members of Congress took his seat, automatically, his Reserves Commission disappeared, terminated or whatever?"
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2826.783,2838.954,"Yes Your Honor, Mr. Justice Brennan, I would say that of course, that did not occur because there had to be some further action by one or the other of the parties."
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2960.703,2964.204,What is the relief you ask for in this case?
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2964.204,2982.316,"The relief we ask for in this case, Mr. Justice Marshall was a mandamus or an injunction extended to the Secretary of Defense and the three service secretaries requiring them first of all to strike from the roles of the Reserves, any member of Congress --"
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2982.316,2987.384,What is the qualification that Congress had to do with that?
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2987.384,2987.676,"Well, we don't think --"
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2987.676,2989.786,I'm not asking Congress to put him out.
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2989.786,2990.78,"No, we are not sir."
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2990.78,2993.018,You're not asking him to resign from Congress?
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2993.018,2994.941,We are not sir.
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2994.941,2997.707,"Well, what did the qualifications got to do with it?"
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,2997.707,3000.232,"Well, I don't believe that this -- that the qualification matters --"
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3000.232,3004.404,Has anybody raised the question of one of these people here is not a Congressman?
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3004.404,3006.996,"No sir, by no means."
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3006.996,3010.068,"Well again, I ask, what is the point?"
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3010.068,3028.845,"Well, we do not believe that the qualification matter is a -- a significant issue in this case but it has been raised and has been argued effectively by the Government and we felt that we should respond to it in the way in which -- in which we (Inaudible)"
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3033.88,3062.088,"That arises, does is not in connection with the language of Baker against Carr having to do with textually committed to another branch by the language of the Constitution and that's the argument of the Government on one leg here that this whole subject was textually committed and therefore, it is a nonjusticiable question."
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3062.088,3071.119,That is the argument -- that it is a textually demonstrable commitment of the matter to a coordinate branch of the Government.
1973.72-1188,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3071.119,3075.922,"Your standing argument is -- is dependent to a certain extent, isn't it?"
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3103.607,3123.351,Our standing army -- argument is premised upon the fact that this Clause was intended to prevent this duality of office in order to benefit citizens of this nation as a body politic in order to prevent and influence upon the Congress that the executive branch might exercise --
1973.72-1188,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3123.351,3131.515,Which -- which are normal -- say as the garden variety Reserve requirement that the guy have corrected 20-20 vision wouldn't be anything like.
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3131.515,3134.212,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3134.212,3137.937,But Mr. Levitt had much of the same thing in mind when he came here.
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3154.726,3154.823,Well --
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3154.823,3155.973,-- under those circumstances.
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3155.973,3172.305,"Any litigant who comes to this Court, who comes into the Federal Court's raising a Constitutional issue is going to seek it and if he prevails obtaining enforcement of that Constitutional provision, generally for all of the people of the United States."
1973.72-1188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3261.04,3263.725,(Inaudible)
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3263.725,3267.434,"The District Court did not issue an injunction, the District Court issued a declaratory judgment --"
1973.72-1188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3267.434,3269.294,Did you appeal that?
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3269.294,3270.158,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-1188,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3289.825,3297.367,So you're not asking -- you've never asked any other Court to overturn the District Court's refusal of an injunction?
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3297.367,3302.681,We have not because we don't feel that it is yet -- yet an issue in this case.
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3343.242,3345.663,If they don't however.
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3345.663,3346.156,If they --
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3346.156,3363.479,"If -- if you take your hypothetical case -- if they simply say the Court has no power even if the Court says it has power, then you have the confrontation of what was discussed to some extent in the Baker against Carr and several other earlier cases do you not?"
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3363.479,3378.271,"Well,I -- I would be -- let me say this very seriously that it would be -- it would almost be the end of our Constitution if the executive branch failed to follow an order by a District -- an order of the District Court."
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3378.271,3390.926,"Alright, let's pursue it and says that the executive branch follows it but Congress passes an act unanimously reinstating the commissions of these officers."
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3390.926,3392.01,Well --
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3392.01,3399.245,Is that not the type of confrontation that the Framers talked about and what the Court's have talked about from time to time?
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3399.245,3415.942,"Well, I would have thought that that kind of confrontation was the very thing dealt with very specifically in Marbury v. Madison and Kilbourn v. Thompson in this established principle of our jurisprudence that if Congress passes an Act which turns out to be unconstitutional, the courts declare it to be unconstitutional."
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3415.942,3424.294,"But Baker against Carr, then it went into some specific details about that, did it not?"
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3424.294,3431.852,"I'm -- I'm afraid, I don't have in my mind the -- the passages and Baker v. Carr that you referred to, sir."
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3431.852,3434.981,"Well, no matter, I just wanted to interrupt your argument any further."
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3434.981,3440.249,"Well, I'm happy to try to answer the questions if perhaps you could be -- you could help me."
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3440.249,3449.669,"Well, the confrontation problem is there is it not when you -- just as the confrontation problem was inherent in the Levitt case."
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3487.434,3488.961,I see -- I see Your Honor 's point.
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3490.513,3498.453,"And the Court said this is the kind of question the Courts can't get into, won't get into."
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3498.453,3501.039,There are some kinds of questions that Courts won't get into.
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3756.47,3759.858,Do you have Reserve officers if your committee?
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3759.858,3761.036,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3762.764,3768.934,"Well, then how do you assume that all the Reserve officers on the hill are opposed to what you say."
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3768.934,3770.526,"We don't assume it, Your Honor."
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3787.287,3791.201,You will block the Reserve officers over here to control the Congress?
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3791.201,3796.288,"Well, I -- I don't want to try to go beyond of what is in the --"
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3796.288,3802.502,"I think you haven't shown how been injured, I am not sure whether you've been injured at all here."
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3802.502,3803.01,"Well, I --"
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3803.01,3807.017,And how did this group of Reserve officers stopped you from lobbying?
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3807.017,3807.347,I don't stop --
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3807.347,3809.01,-- make sure that they don't stop you.
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3809.01,3810.623,That's right.
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3810.623,3813.84,"Your question is, they might impede to?"
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3813.84,3814.723,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3814.723,3819.109,"Well, what concrete allegation do you have that they do --"
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3819.109,3834.143,"Our concrete allegation is very simply this -- that by reason of their Reserve of their Reserve membership, they have used -- they are influenced by the executive branch because of this Reserve connection in ways which would --"
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3834.143,3838.859,Where are the reserved members of your committee influenced --
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3838.859,3845.852,"Well our reserve -- the reserve members of our committee, I supposed could be called a dissident -- a dissident faction in the reservist."
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3845.852,3850.193,And they could be -- all in Congress could also be the dissident faction.
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3850.193,3851.821,"I supposed they could, Your Honor."
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3851.821,3854.972,So you're really hoping or imagining?
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3854.972,3861.781,"I don't think it's imagining, Your Honor, I would say, this -- that we would rely on -- on the allegations in our complaint -- we think that they are --"
1973.72-1188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3861.781,3865.548,"Well, I'm talking about the allegation -- or like of --"
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3865.548,3867.721,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3867.721,3872.424,"Would it be relevant if you went to trial on the merits, this is highly hypothetical now."
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3884.813,3901.271,"We went to trial on the merits and that -- and that turned out to be the proof then, we would loose on -- those allegations of our complaint with not -- we would lose on that point and I suppose, we would then -- no, we would not have a standing if there were a trial on the merits on this issue."
1973.72-1188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3948.573,3950.993,(Inaudible) to stand in Court.
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3950.993,3951.841,"That is right, Your Honor."
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3992.33,4000.834,Would you say that if the member of Congress is appointed to a presidential commission that he suffers the same bar?
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,4000.834,4021.777,"That was one of the matters that was considered by the Congress in this very comprehensive 1899 report and I -- as I read the language, I think they at least felt that any kind of office, however 10 U.S. if may be was barred by the Clause."
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4035.798,4039.407,Mr. Dobrovir do you have further now.
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,4039.407,4041.146,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4114.282,4118.801,That's of course a state function in -- in the Roudebush case wasn't it?
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,4118.801,4119.604,Yes it was but the Court --
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4119.604,4120.471,On a federal matter.
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,4120.471,4132.22,The Court -- the Court indicates very expressly in Footnote 23 just mentioned the fact that this is a qualification committed to the Senate and discussed it in those terms.
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4132.969,4138.761,That -- that function was just like counting the ballots in the first instance --
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,4138.761,4157.701,"Well, I would -- I would only submit that -- that nothing this Court does will interfere with the power of the Senate where it has -- itself to determine the qualifications of any of its members and there are political considerations both ways involved in what the Congress may do which is not what this Court does or what any Court does."
1973.72-1188,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4341.347,4349.55,Well then you -- you're standing according depends partly on the fact that you're a lobbying organization or -- or you know trying to influence legislation whatever you want to call it.
1973.72-1188,1,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,4349.55,4351.98,"That is right, that is right."
1973.72-1188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4532.353,4535.37,Do you have anything further Mr. Solicitor General?
1973.72-1188,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4535.37,4536.876,I think not Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-1188,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4536.876,4553.266,Is this the case Mr. Solicitor General on which the District Court said that at least in the District of Columbia Circuit standing was no longer anything to be taken very seriously or words to that effect.
1973.72-1188,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4553.266,4554.59,That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1973.72-1188,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4558.477,4559.386,Something like that.
1973.72-1188,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4562.098,4563.71,This is the case.
1973.72-1188,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4563.71,4564.06,Alright.
1973.72-1188,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4565.563,4566.22,Thank you gentlemen.
