1995.95-157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.728,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-157, United States v. Christopher Lee Armstrong."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,28.322,32.482,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-157,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,152.616,166.878,"General Days, do you agree that the standard on this discovery claim should be whether a colorable basis is made out for the claim?"
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,173.832,177.393,"It is the locution that's used by most of the courts of appeals, Justice O'Connor."
1995.95-157,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.393,177.654,And do you accept that--
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,177.654,180.305,"Well, not completely--"
1995.95-157,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.305,181.276,--or do you ask us to adopt some other standard?
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,181.276,197.888,"--Well, I think that, although the courts have used various formulations, the bottom line is that all the courts of appeals, with the exception of the Ninth Circuit, that have addressed this issue have required that there be a showing of individuals who are similarly situated to the defendant."
1995.95-157,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.888,203.952,"Well, is it your argument that that showing is necessary to establish a colorable basis?"
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,208.324,216.95,The colorable basis terminology that's used... there have been references to prima facie evidence.
1995.95-157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,241.687,249.753,"I take it you have some reservation about phrases like, a colorable basis, as giving any real guidance to what to look for in the details."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,249.753,251.593,"Precisely right, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,251.593,254.245,"Well, can you tell us what the details would be?"
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,265.592,277.701,"Justice Ginsburg, the respondents have made the suggestion that the evidence that they need is within the control of the Government, but that is simply not so."
1995.95-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,277.701,279.403,But at least would you seek--
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,279.403,281.895,"There were many things that the respondents could have done, and let me lay them out."
1995.95-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,281.895,282.155,--Right.
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,282.155,284.786,They could have done a further review of their own files.
1995.95-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,313.726,316.768,"Mr. Solicitor General, suppose... I don't remember which brief it is."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,328.806,339.324,"--Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, it really would depend upon the nature of that evidence and whether it provided a basis for the court--"
1995.95-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,339.324,352.262,"Well, if they came in with an affidavit, the public defender said, our files in State court show that 50 percent of the crack prosecutions are not Afro-Americans, whereas 100 percent of the Federal prosecutions are, would that be sufficient for discovery?"
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,352.262,355.884,--I think the court would have to decide whether that information--
1995.95-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,355.884,357.717,How would you decide if you were the court?
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,357.717,359.279,"--Well, I'd have to look at the universe."
1995.95-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,360.411,365.735,The universe is the files of the Federal... of the State defender and the Federal defender in 1991.
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,365.735,372.079,--I think 1991 would be too narrow a time frame for that type of determination.
1995.95-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,372.079,373.849,Even if there are 100 cases in each file?
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,373.849,378.053,"I don't think that that would be the case, Justice Stevens."
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.38,399.548,"General Days, what is your basis for requiring a substantial threshold showing with respect to this category of defense, assuming that we're proceeding under Rule 16?"
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,432.494,434.956,"Well, there are two responses, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,454.347,455.789,But there is a general right to discovery.
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,457.371,458.323,I think--
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,458.323,467.78,"I mean, apart from Rule 16 there is no general right, I assume, and if you can get me out of Rule 16, then I'll be prepared to entertain your notion that we should require a substantial showing first."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,467.78,470.631,"--I don't have to get you out of Rule 16, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,483.75,483.84,I--
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,483.84,484.692,--that is really circular here.
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,485.893,491.416,--So you say a substantial threshold showing that the defense is valid is always necessary under Rule 16.
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,492.856,493.968,--I think--
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,493.968,498.552,I thought it was just a special showing you were going to require in this kind of a case.
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,498.552,523.998,"--Well, there are obviously other types of material that are available under Rule 16, but the point here is that Rule 16 has to be read against a backdrop of this Court's presumption that prosecutors act lawfully, and that the investigation by outsiders or inquiries by outsiders of how prosecutors carry out their responsibility imposes substantial cost on the system."
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.998,539.94,"Well, what I was going to suggest is that Rule 16... what is it, 16(a)(2) makes it clear that you can't use (C)... (a)(1)(C)."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,561.596,573.923,"Well, Justice Scalia, as we've addressed in our reply brief, there are specific provisions of Rule 16 that go to the availability of certain material."
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.923,577.185,Let me complete the thought I was beginning with.
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,659.76,660.001,That's correct.
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,660.001,661.583,And not to a defense of this sort.
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,679.367,682.489,"Well, I'm certainly not going to reject that suggestion, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,684.401,688.272,"What does that suggest you do, for example, to suppression?"
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,693.747,693.987,--Right.
1995.95-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,693.987,699.363,What does it do to a whole range of claims that actually are there for reasons of constitutional or administrative--
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,699.363,700.344,Yes.
1995.95-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,700.344,700.945,--So I'm nervous about that.
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,700.945,711.321,"Well, I think, Justice Breyer, that we believe we can remain within Rule 16 and nevertheless support the substantial threshold showing that we've been advocating."
1995.95-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,714.344,719.719,"Well, in aid of Justice Breyer's question, suppose... what happened before Rule 16 was on the books?"
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,728.143,734.138,--I think it's a due process standard.
1995.95-157,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,734.138,744.253,"There was a rule that had in some words about reasonableness, and they cut out the words about... at least that's what my law clerk found out."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,752.611,754.611,"No, I'm not familiar--"
1995.95-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,754.611,759.564,Only in a constitutional case can a court ever order discovery?
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,778.456,782.998,"--Well, Brady, for example, is a rule that is outside of Rule 16."
1995.95-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,782.998,785.79,That has a constitutional basis.
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,785.79,793.968,"That's correct, and so to the extent there are these constitutional requirements, I think as Justice Breyer was suggesting, they would stand outside of Rule 16."
1995.95-157,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,793.968,813.909,"General Days, are there things that were requested in this case that fall within Rule 16's (a)(1)(C) articulation... books, papers, documents in the possession or control of the Government?"
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,818.452,822.044,Certainly documents.
1995.95-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,834.954,840.838,"Is a request for a list, where the Government has to compile a separate list, the same as a request for documents?"
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,840.838,841.309,"No, it is not."
1995.95-157,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,841.309,845.643,"Well then, it seems to me that this may not have been under Rule 16(C)."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,845.643,855.27,"Well, if there were a print-out, just like a paper list, I suppose that could be regarded as a document, but I take your meaning."
1995.95-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,885.592,917.873,"General Days, before we get to the question of what could be discovered if there could be discovery, you were going to tell me what in the Government's view would be necessary concretely to satisfy that substantial threshold question, and you gave one answer that I found surprising, but it was your answer that even if you had 100 percent African Americans in Federal court in a given year and 50 percent Caucasians in the State court in that same year, that that would not have been enough."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,917.873,936.877,"Well, I think that, Justice Ginsburg, under those circumstances the Court might well ask the Government for some indication, but it may not result in full discovery, or the providing by the Government of the type of information that was being sought here to the defendants."
1995.95-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,936.877,944.02,"But you said that would require something rather than nothing, but if... I'm just not clear on... the Government does the negative side--"
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,944.02,944.471,Yes.
1995.95-157,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,944.471,947.863,"--well, but you don't say what it would take."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,947.863,958.99,"Well, I think that the example that Justice Stevens gave, and you gave, would be going a very long way toward showing that there was a selection."
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,996.812,1029.365,"Okay, but if we agree with you that in fact there's... there are two prongs involved here, and we then pose Justice Ginsburg's question, what if they had come in with the evidence which I guess turned up later, a year or so later in the State reports, that something like 50 percent of the State crack prosecutions were Caucasians, I take it... and please correct me if I'm wrong... that you would say, even though that addressed the second prong, it did not address it to a sufficient degree."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1058.045,1059.537,"No, Justice Souter."
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1089.477,1095.942,"Well, let's just assume that they couldn't have had anything but the terms of the study, and they said, this satisfies each of the prongs."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1095.942,1096.243,Yes.
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1096.243,1105.479,Would it be the Government's position that it didn't satisfy the second one because it did not show to a sufficiently high or probable degree that there really was comparability?
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1105.479,1107.68,"No, Justice Souter."
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1134.798,1135.509,"Okay, so you--"
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1135.509,1142.845,--responsibility of figuring out at every point the degree to which one group is comparable to the other.
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1142.845,1145.076,"--But you would say, then, that you had a burden to respond."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1145.076,1145.316,Yes.
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1145.316,1149.069,But not a burden to comply with the discovery request.
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1149.069,1156.335,"Well, I think where there is this similarly situated showing, that may well shift the burden to the Government--"
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1156.335,1161.348,"No, but I want to understand... I, like Justice Ginsburg, I'm trying to get an example so that I know what we really mean--"
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1161.348,1161.528,--Yes.
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1161.528,1182.472,"--when we use the terms, and I take it in the example you're saying... that I gave, that that would result perhaps in a shifting of the burden of persuasion, or at least the burden of going forward, but it would not result in a satisfaction of this threshold which would obligate you to produce the discovery that they want."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1182.472,1184.575,"Well, not the full discovery."
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1207.691,1223.871,"So some discovery, then, would... so you're saying discovery is a step-by-step process, and the Government would perhaps not merely have had the burden shifted back to it, but the Government could properly be subjected by the district judge, as it were, to satisfy that burden."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1231.608,1231.788,Right.
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1246.048,1247.46,"Oh, I quite... I realize that."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1247.46,1248.001,--situation.
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1248.001,1258.306,"But what you're saying, then, is that I think that it's a mistake to think of discovery... the discovery obligation as being an all-or-nothing obligation."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1258.306,1258.887,That's right.
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1259.208,1274.828,"And you're saying that if you went as far as to get the Burke study in, there would be a discovery obligation to produce evidence, if you had it, that would tend to disprove the suggestion of comparability, and if you met that, that's where the process would end."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1274.828,1275.049,--Yes.
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1275.049,1279.152,"If you didn't meet that, then I presume even further discovery might be warranted."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1279.152,1279.332,Yes.
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1279.332,1279.533,Is that--
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1279.533,1282.344,"Let me make... yes, that's correct, but let me make clear about the Burke study."
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1290.129,1290.81,"--I realize... no, I realize--"
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1291.03,1291.969,--the dissents for the panel.
1995.95-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1291.969,1292.99,--May I ask--
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1298.154,1303.898,"I don't recall, Justice Ginsburg, because there were challenges as to the accuracy of that information."
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.912,1340.124,Is this a court of appeals case--
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1340.124,1340.484,"Yes, it is."
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1340.484,1340.775,--or one of our cases?
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1340.775,1342.505,It's from... it's the Eighth Circuit.
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1342.505,1349.33,"You know, the only cases of ours that I'm aware of... what cases of ours involve this area of selective prosecution?"
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1351.804,1353.444,"Ah Sin, and Wayte."
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1353.444,1353.704,--And--
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1353.704,1354.996,And Wayte.
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1354.996,1359.157,--What was the... what was involved in Wick?
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1359.157,1360.739,In Wayte?
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1360.739,1361.06,Yes.
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1361.06,1373.856,Wayte had to do with the allegation that persons who had failed to register for the draft were being selectively prosecuted because they were vocal opponents to that particular program.
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.856,1388.036,"You see, in both Ah Sin and Yick Wo, which are the classic cases, you had at issue a local ordinance, and the ordinance was a phony, because in fact it was only being enforced against one racial group."
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1432.257,1436.46,I think there would have to be some showing that there was a comparably situated--
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1436.46,1436.651,Probably--
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1436.651,1437.69,--white defendant.
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1437.69,1440.611,--So why should the office be the criterion?
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1469.311,1483.753,"Well, I think, Your Honor, the Government certainly is not standing here arguing that it's permissible for any U.S. Attorney to bring discriminatory prosecutions and avoid the sanction of the law simply because it's one office as opposed to the entire country."
1995.95-157,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1483.753,1487.874,"Let's sanction him, but why should the criminal defendant who's been guilty of the offense walk away?"
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1487.874,1495.881,"Well, the fact that the defendant shows that there is selective prosecution generally does not mean that that particular defendant would walk."

1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1507.998,1508.208,Yes.
1995.95-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1508.208,1511.031,"--because we're really talking about discovery, not the ultimate outcome of the case."

1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1596.954,1600.166,I would say that there is not that power.
1995.95-157,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1600.166,1601.158,There's not that power.
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1601.158,1601.408,No.
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1601.408,1608.541,"Well, is your answer to Justice Stevens that there is not that power an answer across the board?"

1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1618.281,1618.651,--Isn't that so?
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1618.651,1618.881,--Yes.
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1619.821,1620.622,Why wouldn't this be one of them?

1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1627.199,1627.63,Okay.
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1635.406,1635.717,--Yes.
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1635.717,1636.018,--Have the right?
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1636.018,1636.328,Yes.
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1636.328,1636.619,And he would.
1995.95-157,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1636.619,1637.27,I misspoke.
1995.95-157,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1637.27,1637.46,Yes.

1995.95-157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.631,1642.983,"Very well, General Days."

1995.95-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1687.293,1693.027,But you wouldn't be entitled to... under 16 you wouldn't be entitled to any documents pertaining to this case.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1693.027,1695.318,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia, but--"
1995.95-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1695.318,1706.556,It's very strange to establish a selective prosecution claim without the use of any documents pertaining to the case in which the selective prosecution is alleged to have occurred.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1707.907,1713.502,"--I think, as the Court has suggested in argument, discovery is a step-by-step process."
1995.95-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.807,1744.664,"I understand that, but what it suggests to me, the fact that you cannot get any of these documents from this prosecutor, is that Rule 16 was not designed for this kind of a defense at all, that perhaps when it refers to the defendant's defense, it means his defense on the merits, and this constitutional claim comes up under our inherent powers to require discovery with respect to constitutional claims."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1747.085,1747.626,--Well--
1995.95-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1747.626,1748.247,"Indeed, a likelihood?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1748.247,1750.147,--we disagree with that position.
1995.95-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1759.424,1770.694,"Well, but certainly there is a difference, Ms. O'Connor, between the kind of defenses one normally talks about to a criminal prosecution and the selective prosecution argument, is there not?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1770.694,1777.997,"Selective prosecution doesn't go to the traditional notion of guilt or innocence, as I believe you're suggesting--"
1995.95-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.997,1778.218,Yes.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1778.218,1779.35,--Mr. Chief Justice.
1995.95-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1785.604,1792.049,"So you say it results... in other words, the person simply ""walks""."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1792.049,1798.494,That would be the ultimate result were we able to put forward sufficient evidence at that level.
1995.95-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.494,1800.894,To show that there was a selective prosecution.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1800.894,1801.605,That's correct.
1995.95-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.605,1803.045,He goes scott-free.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1803.045,1809.15,Dismissal would be the appropriate remedy for a constitutional violation based on race.
1995.95-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1837.78,1850.679,"Ms. O'Connor, do you think that either the district court or the Ninth Circuit was relying on Rule 16 in making their various orders and judgments?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1850.679,1851.57,I--
1995.95-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1851.57,1858.674,"You don't mention it, and how are we to know if they were thinking in terms of Rule 16?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1858.674,1870.712,"--I understand your question, Justice O'Connor, and while we never mention Rule 16, it was clear we were asking for documents, it's clear the documents are contained in Rule 16."
1995.95-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1870.712,1876.526,Is everything you were seeking matters that you think are covered by Rule 16?
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1876.526,1880.83,I believe that those documents would be covered by Rule 16.
1995.95-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1892.967,1903.284,"Do you think Rule 16 can be used to require the Government to conduct a survey, or produce information that it doesn't already have reduced to documentation?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1903.284,1918.924,"--What I would anticipate, and what I would have anticipated at the time in early 1992, was that the Government would proffer that objection to the request and say we don't have these documents and we can't be compelled to create a summary based on your request."
1995.95-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1918.924,1919.635,"Yes, and what is the answer?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1919.635,1926.209,I think that the answer would be the Government cannot be compelled to create a document under Rule 16.
1995.95-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1926.209,1945.923,"Now, at the time that your discovery request was made, and that the district court made its ruling, is the only thing the district court had before it the summary of the closed cases for the year in question from the central district?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1951.449,1952.358,The district court--
1995.95-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1952.358,1954.859,At the time of its order.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1954.859,1960.174,--At the time of its order was in possession of the limited survey to which you reference.
1995.95-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1960.174,1960.635,And that's all.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1960.635,1963.875,And that was all at the initial hearing.
1995.95-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1963.875,1967.727,And at the time the district court entered its order.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1967.727,1970.44,The final order was issued in December.
1995.95-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1970.44,1970.97,"Well, its initial order."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1970.97,1973.291,At the time of the initial order.
1995.95-157,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1973.291,1980.507,"And do you think that that was sufficient to compel the discovery, and to justify the order?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,1980.507,1993.625,"I do think it was sufficient, and I also believe the record reflects that the district judge was relying to some extent on her own experience, as district judges do when presented with discovery requests."
1995.95-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2008.217,2010.42,"Well, her own experience of what sort, Ms. O'Connor?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2021.937,2028.271,"Well, certainly we wouldn't expect a district judge to proffer her own evidence in support of the motion."
1995.95-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2041.571,2055.179,"So it would be permissible, in your view, for the district court to take into consideration in granting a discovery request her own recollection of the percentage of blacks and Caucasians that had been in crack cocaine cases in her particular court?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2055.179,2060.563,--I think that common sense tells us that district judges rely on their own--
1995.95-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2060.563,2062.157,I didn't ask you what common sense told us.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2064.29,2064.51,--Yes.
1995.95-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2064.51,2065.109,--You do.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2065.109,2076.967,"I think it would be correct, and I think this district judge, in framing the order, recognized and mentioned that a number of these type of cases had come through the Central District of California."
1995.95-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2084.233,2087.143,What about the knowledge of the public defender?
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2110.13,2117.665,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, and had we been ordered to find one, perhaps we could have gone out--"
1995.95-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2117.665,2133.894,"The question is, what did you have to show to meet the threshold for discovery, and I'm asking, is such information accessible to a defendant without resort to discovery against the U.S. Attorney, and I think you've just answered yes, it is, but you didn't get it."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2133.894,2143.021,"--The information that you are referencing is not easily accessible, and in many instances is not accessible at all."
1995.95-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2143.021,2150.407,"Why couldn't you just go to a... you know, in your own office, in your own experience, other people?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2176.125,2188.023,"At the time that we raised the motion, we were not limiting our claim solely to the possibilities among crack defendants."
1995.95-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2199.575,2202.477,"I'm not saying one, but... I have no idea what the number would be."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2250.411,2254.745,"--Number 1, we disagree that that's required in order to obtain discovery."
1995.95-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2304.95,2312.827,Would you comment on the Solicitor General's argument that the Burke study shows that this information was in fact available?
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2312.827,2320.191,"--The Burke study was conducted over a period of time that encompassed, I believe, more than a year."
1995.95-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2333.571,2334.47,"But it was done by the defense, I take it."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2334.47,2335.562,--Pardon me?
1995.95-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2335.562,2338.683,The Burkes memorandum was prepared by and submitted by the defense.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2338.683,2346.93,"That's correct, although ordered by the district judge in the context of an ongoing discovery dispute and resolution of the request."
1995.95-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2406.76,2416.505,"Ms. O'Connor, am I wrong in thinking that the Burke study showed that there was... the figure of white defendants was between 3 and 4 percent?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2416.505,2419.257,I believe that's the ultimate finding.
1995.95-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2420.048,2425.273,"But just sticking with that, it's nothing like 50 percent, 3 and 4 percent."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2437.231,2447.348,"--Well, may I suggest, Justice Ginsburg, this is precisely why the district judge made the order that she did asking for expert testimony."
1995.95-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2466.212,2468.222,I don't understand the expert testimony.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2488.376,2497.302,"--I don't believe that we're limited solely to that claim and, in fact, there may be other areas of selectivity that come up as discovery is--"
1995.95-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2497.302,2511.632,"I thought your claim was the disparity between State and Federal prosecutions, because the Federal prosecutions involve the higher penalty, and as Justice Ginsburg points out, even under the Burke study, 3 percent of 42 defendants is 1 defendant."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2515.115,2524.661,"--The question of the appropriate universe for comparison has been shifting over the course of time, and during this 3-1/2 years or--"
1995.95-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2524.661,2528.144,But it is correct that you were comparing State prosecutions and Federal prosecutions.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2529.396,2530.337,--That was one point.
1995.95-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2533.319,2568.004,"But that's the problem, because being a very good defense lawyer, you probably could think of dozens and dozens of possible comparisons, and what's worrying me is that, because you are so good at thinking up definite... you know, lots of different comparisons, some of which may be true, I don't know, but if the... if there isn't some burden to show, in addition to the large number of African-Americans who were prosecuted in this category, here are some comparable people who were Caucasian, and they weren't, which doesn't seem like a big burden, that the thing could go on endlessly as you think of more and more categories and they have to respond more and more."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2582.124,2583.756,"I understand that, Justice Breyer."
1995.95-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.8,2612.126,"Well, why isn't that just in accord with the principle that, you know, we do try to have the main issue in trials be whether the defendant is guilty or not."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2665.185,2683.667,"Well, certainly, Justice Scalia, the universe of cases presented to you is much different from the universe of cases that are dealt with at the district level, where guilt and innocence is determined every day, and we are certainly present for much of that."
1995.95-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2699.538,2699.799,Ms. O'Connor--
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2699.799,2701.879,--have discretion to look at the issue.
1995.95-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2701.879,2710.127,"--the question, why should this be the rare case in light of something else that has been going on?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2738.196,2753.677,"That certainly is the backdrop against which this whole issue is framed, the disparity between the sentencing schemes that everyone is concerned about at all levels and in all branches of Government."
1995.95-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2753.677,2760.31,But the concern stems from the identity of a particular crime with one racial group more than another.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2760.31,2768.025,"If that presumption is true, and the Government is able to come forward with evidence that shows--"
1995.95-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2768.025,2769.636,The Sentencing Commission thought it was true.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2769.636,2775.66,--I believe the Sentencing Commission is certainly concerned about the pattern of prosecutions.
1995.95-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2779.804,2788.129,"Well, I take it, just for... Justice Ginsburg's point is that the backdrop that you refer to has a premise which is fundamentally inconsistent with yours--"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2788.129,2794.654,I would disagree with the idea that that has been proven.
1995.95-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2801.54,2803.599,--So the Sentencing Commission is wrong in its suggestion.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2803.599,2807.392,--The Sentencing Commission is looking at the end result.
1995.95-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2818.73,2829.589,"But if you don't accept judgments of conviction as probative because you say they themselves may have been the result of racial prosecution, then there can never be any end to the argument."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2829.589,2839.844,"Mr. Chief Justice, what we're seeking is the beginning of the argument, in this case, to attempt to gather more information."
1995.95-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2862.22,2871.825,"You, I take it, don't depend upon Judge Reinhardt's assumption to establish the second prong, the similarly situated but not prosecuted prong."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2874.94,2882.484,"Justice Souter, you're referring to Judge Reinhardt's statement that we must assume all persons commit all crimes?"
1995.95-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2882.484,2882.904,That's right.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2882.904,2888.186,I think that that statement was more in the nature of a descriptive statement.
1995.95-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2889.656,2890.337,"Well, do you depend on it?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2890.337,2890.817,--as a binding presumption.
1995.95-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2890.817,2892.35,Do you depend on it for your argument?
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2893.632,2894.162,No.
1995.95-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2894.162,2894.743,All right.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2894.743,2905.59,"And in fact I would suggest the Government is depending on the opposite presumption, that only blacks commit the crime, and had they shown that, we might not have succeeded in our request--"
1995.95-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2905.59,2909.604,"Well, the Government at least has some figures, and I'm not sure that you do."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2923.904,2936.922,"--Well, as the Court may be aware, I did provide a limited declaration in response to the Government's motion for reconsideration, and I think the district judge did consider the two declarations that we submitted."
1995.95-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2936.922,2938.795,That was the reference to the State experience?
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2938.795,2951.173,"Mr. Reed submitted a declaration laying out his experience in State court, his perceptions of the nature of the defendants that were being prosecuted in State court, which is directly across the street--"
1995.95-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2951.173,2951.343,Right.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2951.343,2957.057,"--from us, and we submitted another declaration regarding some information from a treatment facility."
1995.95-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2957.057,2961.421,"When you say declaration, Ms. O'Connor, does that suggest the statements were sworn?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2961.421,2967.235,I recall they were signed declarations.
1995.95-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2977.042,2984.819,"Ms. O'Connor, specifically what was declared in the statement, in the two statements that you say came up later."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2984.819,2989.113,Mr. Reed laid out a description of his experience in State court.
1995.95-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2990.922,2991.152,Which was--
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,2991.152,2997.998,"--Well, I would suggest to this Court that the district judge in Central District of California--"
1995.95-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2997.998,3003.241,--Did he say there have been a white... similarly situated whites prosecuted in State court?
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,3003.241,3008.176,--He did say that whites were prosecuted in State court for crack cocaine violations.
1995.95-157,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3015.65,3019.493,"He just said whites were prosecuted, but not similarly situated?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,3019.493,3042.077,"We at the time did not know what similarly situated was, and as I am perhaps not explaining sufficiently, I think that definition continues to evolve, and our point is to require us to present evidence of similarly situated individuals at such an early stage is premature, because we don't know who is similarly situated."
1995.95-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3042.077,3047.9,"Well, if you don't know that, then you don't know sort of the fundamental structure of your argument."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,3069.346,3083.116,"I don't believe any court has ever held that there must be a showing of a similarly situated individual to succeed on a claim of selective prosecution, and certainly the Government concedes that's not true."
1995.95-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3083.116,3089.318,"Well, if there isn't an understanding of what similarly situated means, how is there even a claim of selective prosecution?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,3089.318,3090.539,I would--
1995.95-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3090.539,3102.937,"It implies selection, and the implication of selection requires some understanding of a class, some of those members are being treated one way, and some of whose members are being treated differently."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,3110.564,3118.388,"--Our position is that selectivity is the issue, not similarly situated individuals, and certainly--"
1995.95-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3118.388,3119.599,We're not meeting.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,3156.863,3166.0,"--I think I'm proffering a broader definition, which is that at the initial stage it's clear selectivity has occurred."
1995.95-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3171.665,3173.146,"Well, why is it clear in this case that selectivity has occurred?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,3179.132,3179.853,That's correct.
1995.95-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3179.853,3182.705,What is self-evident about selectivity there?
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,3182.705,3195.984,"What is evident is that based on our experience it was an unusual pattern, a pattern that caused my office concern and then, in turn, caused the district judge concern."
1995.95-157,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3198.636,3205.731,"Well, it may be the point from which you start, but it is not the point at which you have defined a similarly situated class, I would suppose."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,3205.731,3211.225,"I would agree that it is the point at which to start, and that's where we were."
1995.95-157,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3211.225,3213.288,Was... were the 24 related to each other?
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,3224.959,3235.404,"I would not know what the relationship is and, frankly, based on the Government's proffer of different variables over time, we are looking at those aspects also."
1995.95-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3235.404,3237.136,Did the 24 include these defendants?
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,3237.136,3239.848,"Yes, I believe these were--"
1995.95-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3239.848,3242.25,"Well, they were all related, and then how many defendants were there?"
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,3242.25,3244.871,--I perhaps am misspeaking on that.
1995.95-157,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3262.476,3265.688,They also had in common that they knew each other and they were in the same conspiracy.
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,3267.37,3271.425,"--I wouldn't suggest that that is true or is proven at this point, Justice Kennedy."
1995.95-157,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3326.464,3339.764,"--I suppose that discriminatory prosecution cannot be remedied as discriminatory taxation can, for example, in a Commerce Clause case, by after the fact going out and finding the 24 white people to prosecute."
1995.95-157,1,17926,barbara_e_oconnor,,3342.696,3347.15,"I'm not certain that I should comment on that, Justice Scalia, but--"
1995.95-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3347.15,3349.181,"Thank you, Ms. O'Connor."
1995.95-157,2,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3353.007,3356.51,"Unless the Court has further questions, I have no further comments."
1995.95-157,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3356.51,3357.081,Very well.
