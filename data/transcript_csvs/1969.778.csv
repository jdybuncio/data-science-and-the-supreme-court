1969.778,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,155.842,161.865,"But if you see someone that you have known before, isn't one second sometimes enough?"
1969.778,0,40659,rena_k_uviller,,161.865,175.656,"Yes, Your Honor but in this case really it emerged that she knew this boy previously, not at that time but she was confronted by him in a one-to-one confrontation the next night in the police station."
1969.778,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,177.365,182.855,What difference does it make which time she drew those conclusions?
1969.778,0,40659,rena_k_uviller,,182.855,206.877,"Well, it's unclear from this record and I would suggest that the family court judge, in finding a boy guilty, conceded that there was a reasonable doubt in this case about I don't -- it's unclear as to whether he was -- what the doubt was about that the lady had an opportunity to see him or when she made the determination that this was someone that she had known previously."

1969.778,0,40659,rena_k_uviller,,317.518,320.338,"That's right, Mr. Justice Stewart."
