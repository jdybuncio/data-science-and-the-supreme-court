1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.166,"We'll hear argument now in Number 97-704, Philomena Dooley v. Korean Airlines."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,11.419,12.199,Madole.
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,12.199,12.709,Madole.
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,13.219,16.123,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-704,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,98.761,106.327,"The case, of course, since it does survive... involve the survivor's action, could mean much more than that."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,111.65,126.759,"--That's correct, and respondent in their response to the petition for certiorari also agreed that the rule of the Court... that this Court will lay down will be applied whenever the conduct causes the injuries and ultimately causes the death occurring on the high seas."
1997.97-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,194.667,222.275,"Ms. Madole, I think that the Court is generally familiar with the difference between a wrongful death act and a survival act, and getting down to the nub of your problem, as I understand it the FELA originally did not have any survival aspect to it, and this Court declined to create such a claim."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,229.389,236.833,"--What occurred is, I believe, Justice Ginsburg, is that the original FELA was patterned after Lord Campbell's Act."
1997.97-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,253.816,263.803,"But am I wrong in thinking that there was an attempt, before that amendment, to get the courts to recognize a survival claim for railroad workers?"
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,263.803,265.666,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.97-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,307.353,310.756,And wasn't the Death on the High Seas Act... that wasn't modeled on Lord Campbell's Act?
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,310.756,323.566,"It does not in that it did not require the existence of the cause of action in the decedent prior to death, so that there is no foreclosure of a survival cause of action alongside a wrongful death cause of action."
1997.97-704,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,344.609,353.695,"Well, do you consider it significant that Congress was aware of survival provisions under the Federal Employers Liability Act and it did not incorporate them here?"
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,356.717,370.378,"--Well, it is to a limited degree, Justice Kennedy, and that is that Congress decided it wanted to provide a remedy from what it felt was the harsh rule of The Harrisburg, that there was no common law right to recover for wrongful death."
1997.97-704,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,420.961,439.484,"Well, of course, Congress did, in 42 U.S. Code section 765, deal with death of a plaintiff and what's recoverable, so to that extent Congress certainly addressed the subject."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,439.484,442.436,"To that extent, but that... thank you."
1997.97-704,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,530.348,558.886,"I guess it's hard for me to see that Congress was entirely silent on what would happen to the claims of pre-death injuries because in 765, if I'm reading it rightly, it converts the pre-existing action for pre-death injuries solely into the kind of death claim that is allowed under the statute, and that sounds to me as though it's saying, everything except the claim allowed under this statute goes away."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,558.886,568.982,"And again, it has to be read in the context of what it was attempting to achieve, and what Congress was attempting to achieve was a rights-granting statute."
1997.97-704,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,583.303,597.872,"But if that's all it wanted to do, I would have thought that in 765 it would have said a wrongful death action may be added to the pre-existing personal injury action of... that the decedent had begun, and it didn't do that."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,604.245,616.733,"Well, it could be read that way, Justice Souter, but I do not believe that if you look into the historical background of what Congress is trying to achieve, that that effectuates the remedial effects--"
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,616.733,622.557,"But we deal with what Congress wrote, not with what someone thinks Congress was trying to effectuate."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,630.771,635.276,"--And again, from the legislative history, it's very hard to decide that."
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,635.276,636.748,"Well, why do we get into legislative history?"
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,636.748,637.246,Pardon me?
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,637.246,638.978,"I say, why do we get into legis--"
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,638.978,639.927,Just from the language itself.
1997.97-704,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,671.089,677.203,--Does that apply to causes of action under than those... other than those under the Death on the High Seas Act?
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,682.728,706.752,"--It does cover causes of action under general maritime law, under the Death on the High Seas Act, and under the Jones Act, and it changed the statute from one in which the statute began to, begin to run from the date of the wrongful conduct until it begins to run from the cause... the date the cause of action accrues, and it extended the statute to 3 years for all three of those issues."
1997.97-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,794.821,808.85,"Under the Jones Act, which picks up on the FELA, there is both wrongful death relief and survival that's rather circumscribed."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,827.751,849.867,"The lower courts and many commentators have said that the legislative history of the Jones Act is not clear, and that the provision of a survival cause of action in the Jones Act is solely because of its wholesale incorporation of the FELA into it."
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,882.598,887.393,"But one can argue equally well, and I think perhaps better, that Congress has addressed itself to this question."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,896.442,902.293,"Mr. Chief Justice, what Congress granted certainly was remedies for deaths on the high seas."
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,929.061,930.833,What's your authority for that proposition?
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,930.833,932.263,--For the proposition that--
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,932.263,933.074,That you just stated.
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,933.074,937.706,"--I'm sorry, it was in a couple of parts."
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.167,955.559,"Well, that preemption principles as you describe them, where Congress has addressed one particular subject, it doesn't prevent the courts from developing common law policies that may be contrary to that in a related area."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,957.26,962.413,"--The cases that are in the reply brief, Your Honor, that deal with preemption, in the context of statutes--"
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,962.413,965.204,"Are you talking about preemption of State laws, or--"
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,965.204,978.284,"--The most common fact circumstance that comes up and appears in the preemption context is of State laws, or of common law remedies under State laws, and what you--"
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,978.284,982.425,--What is the closest case you have to support the proposition we're talking about now?
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,988.088,989.34,--Medtronics.
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,989.34,990.912,Medtronics?
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,990.912,991.511,Which is at--
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,991.511,995.074,"Well, that's preemption of State law."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,996.116,996.747,--Common law.
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,997.855,1002.879,"--Well, you know, Congress passes... common law doesn't exist by itself."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1020.87,1027.095,"General maritime law is a species of common law, judge-made law."
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1027.095,1032.319,"Well, but it's not a species of common law under the aegis of a State."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1061.837,1085.582,"Then the closest case that is in the context of the issue that we're here before is the Moragne case, where the Court said that Congress had only legislated as far outward as the 3-mile limit, and that because it had not gone into the territorial water jurisdiction with the Death on the High Seas Act, the court was free to develop the common law--"
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1085.582,1086.223,"Yes, but--"
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1086.223,1086.724,--in a Federal--
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1086.724,1087.485,--Go ahead.
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1087.485,1096.521,"--Under Federal common law aegis, and to then identify a general maritime law right to recover for wrongful death."
1997.97-704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1116.773,1119.556,"Ms. Madole, let's assume we grant that."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1170.719,1180.886,"Well, when Congress enacted the Death on the High Seas Act in 1920, it was true that there was no common law right of survivorship of personal injury actions."
1997.97-704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.845,1192.733,I'm giving you that.
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1195.695,1221.133,"--Because unless the Court finds there's a general maritime law survival cause of action, there is no recovery for all the pre-death injuries that occur from the date of the injury to the date of death for someone injured on the high seas regardless of the extent of the injury, regardless of the length of time between the injury and the death, and those serious, can be serious and significant and very large--"
1997.97-704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1221.133,1222.964,That person's... he's gone.
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1235.233,1239.607,"--There are two responses, Justice Scalia, to that inquiry."
1997.97-704,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.067,1314.588,But Ms.... may I just ask you a question about that?
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1348.211,1350.304,--In the--
1997.97-704,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1350.304,1353.596,I don't know of any case that points out that fact pattern.
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1354.204,1365.424,"--There are the cases that arise out of the Korean Air Lines accident that do that for the issue of the pain and suffering, but those are not petitioners' cases before this Court."
1997.97-704,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1378.861,1380.023,In a what?
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1380.023,1382.003,Engine... fire... engine explosion on a ship.
1997.97-704,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1382.003,1382.744,"Oh, okay."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1382.744,1385.255,And he died 3 years afterwards.
1997.97-704,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1397.827,1404.349,"Oh, I'm sure it happens a lot, but the thing that puzzles me is, why is it 1998... this statute's been on the books since 1920."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1409.655,1417.619,"--Well, the issue of the evolution of the pre-death pain and suffering under the survival action claim has been around a long time."
1997.97-704,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1434.792,1444.267,"Well, of course, most survival actions are justified by statutes that authorize survival of common law claims, I believe just as Lord Campbell's Act took care of the death action."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1444.267,1454.283,"--That's true, and twice this Court has refused to approve or disapprove use of State survival actions when the deaths occur on the high seas."
1997.97-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1484.604,1500.044,"Ms. Madole, do I understand that Congress is now considering a bill that would take aviation tragedies out of the Death on the High Seas Act and have another regime for them?"
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1500.044,1501.116,--That is correct.
1997.97-704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1527.265,1529.235,"Well, what are we supposed to about Higginbotham?"
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1555.364,1565.251,"Higginbotham does not decide the issue, because the issue there was whether the general maritime law... was whether the general maritime law death action could be superimposed on the Death on the High Seas Act death action."
1997.97-704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1565.251,1586.396,"Why isn't what you're doing... the bite of what you do is, it provides a somewhat different class of beneficiaries when a person dies, and it provides the whole of the beneficiaries with more money, so it seems to speak to both who the beneficiaries are and what the damages are in respect to the harm caused when a person dies."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1586.396,1597.222,But that's because that is only the wrongful death action idea behind both the Death on the High Seas Act and the general maritime law remedy.
1997.97-704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1603.161,1604.714,"No, I understand that they're different remedies."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1604.714,1605.462,--And they don't--
1997.97-704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1605.462,1606.744,Why isn't Higginbotham relevant?
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1606.744,1609.318,"--They don't overlap, and the only language that--"
1997.97-704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1609.318,1612.179,You're assuming more knowledge of Higginbotham than I have.
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1618.635,1642.708,"--Because all of the verbs and nouns that you used have to do with wrongful death remedies except for the survival, which I suggest to the court is that argument under 765, which is really a nonabatement provision and not a survival action prohibition, because it doesn't change the cause of action into pre-death injury remedies."
1997.97-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1645.41,1651.945,"--Ms. Madole, may I ask if you would complete what you were explaining to me about what Congress is doing about it now?"
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1664.836,1670.8,It currently is in its... I'm not sure how many reiterations... it's been changing quite a lot.
1997.97-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1673.322,1675.833,But what is the solution?
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1675.833,1681.756,The primary focus of it is that it would remove airplane accident cases from the Death on the High Seas Act.
1997.97-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1681.756,1682.895,And put them under what?
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1682.895,1687.159,Some... that's one of the reasons why it is not quite fixed.
1997.97-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1696.185,1698.558,"Picking up on State law, is that what it would do?"
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1699.979,1701.561,--It would be some State law.
1997.97-704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1704.134,1709.919,"So it would not be the... creating a new counterpart to the Death on the High Seas Act, only more general."
1997.97-704,0,31966,juanita_madole,,1713.521,1715.554,"As best I know, as it's currently pending."
1997.97-704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1715.554,1716.635,"Thank you, Ms. Madole."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1722.169,1722.808,Harakas.
1997.97-704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1722.808,1723.799,Mr. Harakas.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1723.799,1730.454,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1803.697,1820.459,"Under the present law, if a victim lingers, say, for a year and has medical expenses and lost wages, are those pecuniary losses recoverable when it converts into a Death on the High Seas Act action, or into a wrongful death action?"
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1820.459,1824.981,"If it converts into the Death on the High Seas Act, generally lost wages would not be recoverable."
1997.97-704,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1881.11,1891.336,"But for pain and suffering for the decedent, who might have lingered several years, you say there is no recovery."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1891.336,1893.005,"There is no recovery, that's correct."
1997.97-704,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1893.005,1900.782,"Now, what's the situation in territorial waters, where Death on the High Seas Act presumably doesn't govern?"
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1900.782,1906.545,"With respect to the territorial waters the courts have taken two... well, the courts have basically taken two approaches."
1997.97-704,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1925.997,1936.745,"So the recovery would be substantially different, depending on whether it's... the death occurs from the accident on the high seas or in territorial waters."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,1936.745,1936.945,Yes.
1997.97-704,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2065.119,2084.193,"But one can argue that the analysis in Moragne was partly based on when there's a hole in the law on the high seas, and when the universal judgment of State legislatures all over the country have changed from what it used to be on the death act, that with regard to survival, the same thing happened."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2103.274,2103.965,"Well, that's--"
1997.97-704,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2103.965,2105.497,So at least we'd have the power to do it.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2105.497,2114.024,"--Well, with respect, with the Death on the High Seas Act, I don't think the Court would have the power, because it's a different situation than the situation presented in Moragne."
1997.97-704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.495,2132.286,"Well, Moragne, of course, was geographically outside the scope of the statute, but the counterargument we hear in a legal category sense, survival actions, are... or preexisting common law actions by the injured party himself or herself are outside the scope of the statute, too."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2134.77,2138.984,"They were not addressed, but when you go back to the Moragne case, what was the driving force in Moragne?"
1997.97-704,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2145.148,2145.569,Right.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2145.569,2149.372,--to make unseaworthiness a base of liability uniform within the class.
1997.97-704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2203.708,2214.566,"Well, of course, the prohibition against pecuniary... I mean, the limitation on pecuniary damages doesn't entirely solve the problem, because you can have a decedent whose beneficiaries are not among the people who are entitled to sue under DOHSA."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2220.66,2222.062,Well... under a survival act?
1997.97-704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2222.062,2222.693,Yes.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2222.693,2223.802,"Well, they--"
1997.97-704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2223.802,2229.147,"See, there's no... if there's no survival statute, those... the defendant just gets off scot-free on that."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2229.147,2232.27,"--Well, they don't get off scotfree, because there is still the wrongful death action, but--"
1997.97-704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2232.27,2241.086,"No, but the wrongful death action under DOHSA, as I say, is limited to a specific category of plaintiffs, and I'm assuming an estate where none of the beneficiaries of the estate are within that category."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2241.086,2246.532,"--Well, then the beneficiaries set forth in DOHSA are the ones closest to the decedent, so--"
1997.97-704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2246.532,2247.029,"Oh, I understand, yes."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2247.029,2261.819,"--You have the parents, spouse... parents, spouse, and children, and dependent relatives, so anyone who's very close to the decedent, even a niece who thinks she was a dependent relative, would be entitled to recover under DOHSA and, of course, if you have a survival action--"
1997.97-704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2261.819,2271.145,"No, I agree it covers most of the cases, but there are cases where the beneficiary under the will might be not a dependent but just a friend, or an associate of some kind."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2274.097,2279.643,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but even the State law statutes draw lines as to who can recover and--"
1997.97-704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2279.643,2282.184,"Oh, but not the survival statute."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2282.955,2283.496,--Well--
1997.97-704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2283.496,2286.498,And whoever will participate in the estate would share in the recovery.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2286.498,2286.498,"--Under typical State statutes, but if you look to the provisions under the Jones Act and FELA incorporated by reference, it's a very similar scheme to DOHSA--"
1997.97-704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2286.498,2295.073,Yes.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2295.073,2299.777,"--with respect to the estate doesn't recover, the personal representative recovers on behalf of certain named--"
1997.97-704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.777,2300.058,Yes.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2300.058,2302.57,"--people, and it's an exclusory class."
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2302.57,2304.583,The obvious group is grandchildren.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2316.543,2316.933,No.
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2319.886,2320.277,Right.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2320.277,2327.562,"--someone in the will they would not be... if they weren't named in the will they would not be able to recover the recovery for pain and suffering, that's correct, but again--"
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2327.562,2333.416,"They wouldn't recover anything, I mean, because there's nobody who has anything in a case where the... I mean, what could they recover for?"
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2342.114,2343.666,--With respect to... for--
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2343.666,2355.183,"To the death of the person... I mean, imagine any kind of awful case you want, but I mean, you know, the terrible suffering or whatever, or people linger for a long time, the medical bills eat up the whole estate... I mean, I could go on if you want, but--"
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2355.183,2355.364,--No--
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2355.364,2364.639,"--the point is that then there's no money left and the grandchild who was going to get the money has no lawsuit and no money, and nothing."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2364.639,2365.728,"--Well, that's--"
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2365.728,2367.491,So they're saying you should fill in that hole.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2367.491,2371.292,"--Well, you can fill in that hole, but you have to work within what Congress--"
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2371.292,2372.524,"No, but am I right about the facts?"
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2373.776,2374.077,--I'm sorry.
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2374.077,2379.329,Am I right about the assumption that in such a circumstance nobody... it's... nobody would get any--
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2379.329,2382.341,"Well, if there were no proper DOHSA beneficiaries, then there--"
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2382.341,2385.844,"--There are, but they didn't suffer any harm, because you see, they weren't left any of the money."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2385.844,2389.067,"--Well, there are other types of... you can recover loss of support."
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2389.067,2391.4,No... they... all right.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2400.565,2405.738,"Well, I respectfully disagree with that, Your Honor, because I think Moragne was a very limited--"
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2405.738,2407.819,"Well, even Higginbotham said that the Court has the power."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2407.819,2416.245,"--If the Court has the power, but Moragne dealt with a different situation than when you're on the high seas, where Congress has legislated, and I think Higginbotham recognized that."
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2420.668,2426.572,So in order to distinguish it you'd have to draw a negative assumption from the enactment of the Death on the High Seas Act.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2430.436,2431.227,That's correct.
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2431.227,2433.828,And the reason that Congress wouldn't have wanted it supplemented is?
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2433.828,2444.386,"Because they affirmatively set forth what they decided was recoverable, because when Congress was enacting DOHSA they said there was no other possible action for a Death on the High Seas Act."
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2446.599,2450.042,"Exactly, so they're operating against an environment where nobody gets a penny."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2450.042,2450.731,Exactly.
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2450.731,2458.828,"So they say, hey, nobody gets a penny, now we're going to give a few pennies to a few people, so what is it that suggests that they wouldn't have wanted more pennies to go to some other people?"
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2458.828,2459.747,"Well, I think when you look to--"
1997.97-704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2459.747,2460.538,If everything changed.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2460.538,2466.522,"--Well, when you look to the structure of... I'm just sticking with the language right now of 765, what's the reason for 765."
1997.97-704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2480.831,2484.443,"Well, maybe Congress wasn't all that crazy about awarding noneconomic damages."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2484.443,2485.575,"Well, I... well, that's--"
1997.97-704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2485.575,2488.647,It seems pretty clear that's the way they felt in 1920.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2488.647,2490.37,--It is pretty clear when you go back.
1997.97-704,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2506.822,2516.006,"What is in the Jones Act... picking up on the FELA, what is the survival feature of that act, and how does it compare with State legislation?"
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2516.006,2528.655,"--The difference between the survival provision in the Jones Act and most State statutes is, the Jones Act, section 59, sets forth that there is a survival... this is the 1910 amendments, when they added the survival provision."
1997.97-704,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2555.644,2556.495,That's who recovers.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2558.616,2563.351,"Well, various... State statutes vary."
1997.97-704,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2599.725,2602.357,But you haven't told me anything about what is recoverable.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2604.881,2612.676,"Oh, with respect to the damages recoverable, whatever damages would be recoverable under a personal injury action, so pain and suffering damages are recoverable under this, Your Honor."
1997.97-704,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2612.676,2613.427,--Without any ceiling?
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2613.427,2614.108,Correct.
1997.97-704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2665.549,2677.207,"May I ask a question that will kind of reveal my ignorance, but supposing you have a slip-and-fall case on an ocean liner out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and they come back and sue, what law governs the measure of damages?"
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2677.207,2679.808,"--The measure of damages is general maritime law, actually."
1997.97-704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.808,2680.059,Generally maritime law.
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2680.059,2683.832,"It's traditionally recognized, personal injury actions for injuries on the high seas."
1997.97-704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2683.832,2687.665,"And that's all judge-made, isn't it?"
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2687.665,2697.213,"And that is all judge-made, and the Jones Act does deal... the Jones Act does deal with personal injuries, but the Death on the High Seas Act does not deal with personal injuries."
1997.97-704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2749.237,2754.21,"Well, what is the general description of the causes of action that 763a pertains to?"
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2754.21,2757.432,"It pertains to personal injury, or death."
1997.97-704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2757.432,2760.974,But it has to be on the ocean?
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2760.974,2763.316,It... any time there's maritime jurisdiction.
1997.97-704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2763.316,2764.067,Any time there's maritime--
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2764.067,2765.316,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2767.57,2769.63,"--Thank you, Mr. Harakas."
1997.97-704,1,16185,andrew_j_harakas,,2769.63,2770.339,--Thank you.
1997.97-704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2770.339,2771.63,"Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you."
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2771.63,2781.379,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-704,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2863.962,2867.654,"So the personal representative sues, but the beneficiaries are those named in DOHSA?"
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2867.654,2870.206,"--That is correct, yes."
1997.97-704,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2885.865,2894.081,What do you say to your opponent's argument that at least you can explain that provision as a way of saving an action that otherwise would not exist.
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2894.081,2907.018,"--Yes, that is... well, what I think that Congress was attempting to do here is, it recognized that in the absence of section 5 the personal representatives would have to commence a new suit, and what they're allowing here is--"
1997.97-704,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2907.018,2907.789,And it might be barred by limitations.
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2907.789,2910.902,"--Yes, and they will just... can step right into the shoes of the decedent--"
1997.97-704,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2910.902,2911.343,Right.
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2911.343,2917.076,"--and continue on, but the action would be transformed into a wrongful death remedy for the particular class of survivors."
1997.97-704,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2917.076,2921.718,May I ask you how you'd decide this case if Congress had omitted section 5 from DOHSA?
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2921.718,2936.758,"If Congress had omitted that section, then we would be faced with the question of, well, what did Congress intend to prevent this type of cause of action, and I think the argument would still be quite clear that Congress did, and I think it's the legislative history that we would then turn to under that circumstance."
1997.97-704,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2936.758,2937.359,"You'd have to rely on legislative history, then."
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2937.359,2939.871,I think that would be one of our primary sources.
1997.97-704,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2939.871,2940.112,Yes.
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2940.112,2954.54,"It would certainly figure more prominently, but I think even then the text would be quite helpful, because the text was written to indicate that these would only be pecuniary damages that would be provided, and here we are seeking a different type of remedy that would not have been available in 1920."
1997.97-704,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2954.54,2962.935,"No, but where... your opponent's seeking the kind of remedy the Court created, in effect, in Moragne, and everybody seems to agree we have the power to create such a remedy here--"
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2962.935,2963.556,Yes.
1997.97-704,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2963.826,2966.958,--if we think it is not inconsistent with any congressional direction.
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2966.958,2967.259,--Yes.
1997.97-704,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2969.17,2969.47,Yes.
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2969.47,2977.858,"But the principal thrust of our position here is that this is a legislative choice, that the question... that deciding that there's a survival remedy doesn't put an end to the number of questions that will come up."
1997.97-704,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2986.022,2990.463,"But those are all the same kind of questions we get if the plaintiff doesn't die, if it's a slip-and-fall case."
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2990.463,2991.995,--Not necessarily.
1997.97-704,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3008.956,3009.157,Yes.
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3009.157,3012.77,"--so there will be some, I think... some additional questions that would come up, and some additional complications."
1997.97-704,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3058.19,3067.304,"Was Congress aware... at that time, had Federal courts created new tort remedies in admiralty law, or tort-like remedies on their own at all?"
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3067.304,3078.083,"--I think that this Court had followed what was traditionally English practice, which meant that there was an action for maintenance and cure for seamen, and there was also an action for negligence, general negligence for passengers--"
1997.97-704,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3078.083,3086.037,"What I'm driving at is, would Congress at that time also have been aware of the possibility that Federal admiralty courts could create remedies?"
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3086.037,3086.528,--No.
1997.97-704,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3087.539,3087.73,No.
1997.97-704,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3087.73,3090.913,"--that would have caught it by surprise, but that has changed now with Moragne."
1997.97-704,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3107.544,3112.517,And can you enlighten... give us any more enlightenment than we've already had from counsel on legislative policy?
