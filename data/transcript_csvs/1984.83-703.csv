1984.83-703,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.106,The Court will hear arguments first this morning in Florida Power and Light Company against Lorion and the consolidated case.
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,16.776,30.619,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents one narrow issue, whether the word 189 of the Atomic Energy Act to refer to all proceedings or only to certain types of formal agency proceedings."
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,191.273,194.827,"Mr. Rothfeld, can I interrupt you just a second to be sure I have your position correct?"
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,202.331,204.599,"Justice Stevens, we believe that there was such a proceeding."
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,204.599,205.533,There was a proceeding?
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,205.533,206.166,Yes.
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,206.166,207.235,But it was not required.
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,210.77,217.007,"We believe that the agency had discretion to dispense with the hearing if one was unnecessary, as it was in this case."
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,217.007,219.693,"And so the word ""shall"" doesn't mean what it says?"
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,219.693,234.285,"Well, this Court repeatedly has indicated that statutes that create hearing rights implicitly contain the understanding that administering agencies can dispense with the hearing if one is unnecessary, or when the person seeking the hearing fails to advance any issue that a hearing might help resolve."
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,234.285,237.237,"In other words, the word ""shall"" does not mean what it says?"
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,237.237,250.728,"I think, as this Court has indicated, ""shall"" should be read to contain the understanding that Congress didn't want agencies to conduct meaningless hearings, and I think that that... the types of cases that have raised this issue really make that clear."
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,277.461,278.578,"Well, you may be entirely right."
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,285.465,287.667,--I wouldn't say there is no support in the statutory language.
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,339.1,346.37,"Well, I suppose you would still say it was a proceeding even if somebody, some court thought that you had to have a hearing."
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,346.37,347.372,Absolutely.
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,363.815,374.123,"Is it your view that every time some member of the public writes a letter to the agency and says, I would like you to revoke the license of this utility, that that is enough to start a proceeding?"
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,374.123,374.789,"Yes, that is our position."
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,374.789,377.475,Every letter constitutes the commencement of a proceeding?
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,377.475,377.991,That's true.
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,383.645,390.882,"And if the agency just writes back and says, we're too busy, we're sorry, we can't do it, that would then be appealable to the Court of Appeals?"
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,390.882,414.766,"Technically, I think that would be a proceeding within the meaning of the APA and Hobbs Act, but that will never occur, because the agency had obligated itself in Section 2.206 to respond in detail to all the factual allegations or complaints presented in letters to the agency, and to issue a formal opinion articulating its rationale and addressing those points in detail if it declines to take further action."
1984.83-703,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,423.103,429.526,"Mr. Rothfeld, how many letters of the kind that Justice Stevens was asking about does the agency get in a month or a year?"
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,430.792,438.279,--My understanding is that in the past ten years... this process began with the promulgation of Section 2.206 in 1974.
1984.83-703,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,442.433,450.689,There must be some favorite correspondents that you don't start a proceeding to answer.
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,450.689,457.109,"Well, under the agency procedure, it has obligated itself to respond to each of these in detail."
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,457.109,458.009,All right.
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,466.965,467.565,I think it could.
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,483.51,492.516,"Any such exchange of letters you have, agency changes through any such exchange of letters would give rise to an appealable order, appealable to the Court of Appeals?"
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,492.516,496.151,"Well, presumably it would be challenged in some court, if not in the Court of Appeals."
1984.83-703,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,510.744,516.214,Does the record show how many letters of this kind the agency receives in a year?
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,516.214,523.951,"--It varies from year to year, Justice Powell, but I think in a typical year it ranges from ten to thirty."
1984.83-703,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,523.951,527.603,What would happen if 400 or 500 were filed?
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,532.555,543.594,"If a tremendous number of letters were presented, it would present a burden for the agency's... but the agency has obligated itself to do so, and Congress has obligated the courts to do so."
1984.83-703,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.963,557.67,"Well, the Court of Appeals decision rationale wouldn't... change the court you go to on review."
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,557.67,558.453,That's true.
1984.83-703,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,558.453,567.292,"So any one of these letters, if you answer it and say, sorry, George, that is reviewable in the District Court under the Court of Appeals."
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,567.292,572.446,"That is true, Justice White, and that, in fact, is one of the problems with the Court of Appeals analysis."
1984.83-703,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,582.552,607.303,"Well, Mr. Rothfeld, the respondent, of course, argues that Congress limited jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to cases in which formal hearings had been held, so there would be an adequate record for review by the appellate court, which of course is the typical situation for an appellate court review."
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,622.129,627.85,"Justice O'Connor, the agency has taken action to assure that in every one of these cases there will be an adequate record."
1984.83-703,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,647.763,660.254,"Well, I guess here the respondent contends that he was unable to submit additional information to the NRC."
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,660.254,663.773,"--Well, in this case, respondent originally sent a brief letter."
1984.83-703,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,680.501,688.238,And didn't you suggest that perhaps whether there should have been a hearing is still open?
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,688.238,690.173,--That issue was never decided by the Court of Appeals.
1984.83-703,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,697.211,700.898,"Let me ask you a practical question, counsel."
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,731.331,735.366,I can't speak to every one of these letters in years past.
1984.83-703,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,753.742,758.46,You say each one.
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,767.9,770.502,"I am not aware that the agency has done that, Justice Marshall."
1984.83-703,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,770.502,773.185,"Well, you have seen agencies do that, haven't you?"
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,773.185,776.22,I haven't seen this agency do it in this context.
1984.83-703,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,783.291,785.993,Why would the agency want to prevent that from happening?
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,807.456,819.664,"We don't submit that there would be anything wrong with that, but the Commission in the exercise of its discretion has decided that given the magnitude of the safety issues involved it would treat these things seriously, and will address each one in some detail."
1984.83-703,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,844.881,857.189,"Well, is there anything in the agency's regulations that would ensure that in every case of a denial of a hearing, that there is enough of a record that it would be appropriate for appellate court review?"
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,857.189,864.093,"--Well, I think there is, because the agency has obligated itself to articulate its rationale and explain the basis upon which it--"
1984.83-703,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,864.093,866.628,What regulation are you referring to?
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,866.628,877.584,"--Section 2.206 itself obligates the agency to do that, and that will lead to the type of record that the Courts of Appeals regularly review in cases of informal adjudication and rulemaking."
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,881.119,884.154,May I ask... have you finished your answer?
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,884.154,885.04,--Yes.
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,885.04,903.417,"A question about 2.026(b) which says that after you get a request within a reasonable time you will decide either to institute the request of proceeding or that no proceeding will be instituted, and is it your position that the decision of whether to institute a proceeding is the proceeding that you are talking about?"
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,903.417,907.636,"I think the agency has used the term ""proceeding"" to mean different things in different contexts."
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.636,912.707,"Where in the regulation does it use the word ""proceeding"" the way you are using it today?"
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,912.707,914.39,"In the regulation itself, it does not."
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,915.459,916.875,Nor in the statute.
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,916.875,917.761,--Nor in the statute.
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.765,928.367,But not in accord with the way it is used in the regulation.
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,928.367,961.521,"The agency orders interpreting the regulation have used the term 2.206 request as proceeding, as we point out in our reply brief, it has also referred to Section 2.206 requests as requests to institute show cause proceedings or enforcement proceedings or informal proceedings, but I don't think the agency intended to interpret the word 189(a)."
1984.83-703,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,976.263,978.463,May I ask just one other question about the Court of Appeals?
1984.83-703,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,981.501,982.151,"Yes, it did."
1984.83-703,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1006.664,1014.72,Mr. Reis.
1984.83-703,1,27896,harold_f_reis,,1014.72,1050.209,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to emphasize at the outset that in deciding this case, the Court below gave no consideration whatsoever to the relationship of the judicial review provision in the Atomic Energy Act, Section 189, the section we are dealing with now, to the overall scheme of regulation which the Act put into effect."
1984.83-703,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1256.528,1270.019,"The Commission's brief, Mr. Reis, tells us that on the basis of a 547-page record, the director issued a decision on November 5th denying the respondent's request."
1984.83-703,1,27896,harold_f_reis,,1301.573,1306.791,"I think the answer is, it is related to it, and I would like to explain why, if I may."
1984.83-703,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1306.791,1308.477,Related to it but independent?
1984.83-703,1,27896,harold_f_reis,,1308.477,1309.193,Related to it.
1984.83-703,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1336.127,1337.596,"Would you raise your voice a little, Mr. Reis?"
1984.83-703,1,27896,harold_f_reis,,1337.596,1359.843,"--The letter asked that the Turkey Point unit be shut down immediately, that consideration be promptly given to suspension of the license, and the director's response to that request was, as the respondent herself characterizes it in her brief, at Page 2, I believe, as prompt."
1984.83-703,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1457.589,1468.314,But then it is pretty clear that that 547-page record was not put together in any kind of an adversary proceeding.
1984.83-703,1,27896,harold_f_reis,,1468.314,1471.349,That is correct.
1984.83-703,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1494.448,1499.852,"Mr. Reis, may I ask you a question about the 547-page record that the Chief Justice mentioned?"
1984.83-703,1,27896,harold_f_reis,,1525.151,1534.858,"Under the... I think the answer is that if there was a process, that it would be reviewable."
1984.83-703,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.391,1560.724,"Well, Mr. Reis, if they aren't, they could be sent back."
1984.83-703,1,27896,harold_f_reis,,1560.724,1562.693,--Precisely.
1984.83-703,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.369,1587.872,"How could it ever be arbitrary and capricious for the director to say, we have a lot of people who are studying these things constantly, and we have concluded there is no need for this action?"
1984.83-703,1,27896,harold_f_reis,,1587.872,1590.24,"--I think so, and there are a number of other--"
1984.83-703,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1590.24,1592.859,You think it could be arbitrary and capricious?
1984.83-703,1,27896,harold_f_reis,,1592.859,1631.167,"--questions that indicate that the court is somewhat puzzled as to why the Commission didn't do it, and I can't speak for the Commission, but I think that Mr. Rothfeld has suggested the answer, and that is that as long as there is this kind of public concern for the use of atomic energy, and as long as the Commission feels it is able to handle the matter in this way by giving serious consideration to requests, not matter how frivolous, then it is doing it this way."
1984.83-703,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1633.503,1652.815,"If the Court of Appeals on receiving a file of the kind we have been talking about with virtually nothing in it, the Court of Appeals, Courts of Appeals frequently remand a case for the development of an appropriate record, and that could be done here, could it not?"
1984.83-703,1,27896,harold_f_reis,,1652.815,1654.75,"Yes, sir, it certainly could."
1984.83-703,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1654.75,1683.186,"But in effect what your... what I gather your response earlier was, that the Commission had this problem under study for a long time independent of the papers which were sent on September 11th by the respondent, and it simply used the materials it had on this subject to respond to her claim."
1984.83-703,1,27896,harold_f_reis,,1683.186,1684.086,Yes.
1984.83-703,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1707.301,1709.217,The court didn't undertake to look at it at all.
1984.83-703,1,27896,harold_f_reis,,1709.217,1715.555,"No, because it found that it had no jurisdiction to handle the matter."
1984.83-703,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1715.555,1717.923,Very well.
1984.83-703,1,27896,harold_f_reis,,1717.923,1719.442,Thank you.
1984.83-703,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1719.442,1727.863,Mr. Hodder?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,1727.863,1736.468,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Ms. Lorion has alleged essentially there is a ticking nuclear time bomb in her back yard."
1984.83-703,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1759.484,1763.638,"Your client went to the Court of Appeals, didn't she?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,1763.638,1765.254,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-703,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1766.94,1767.973,Now you are taking the position--
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,1767.973,1784.734,"--brought an appeal before the Court of Appeals because it was her belief based on the existing seven or eight cases that that was the appropriate path on appeal, having been denied the relief she sought by the director's decisions, which were then known as director's denials."
1984.83-703,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1784.734,1790.038,--But now you are taking the opposite position?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,1790.038,1793.24,I don't follow that observation.
1984.83-703,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1793.24,1794.906,That jurisdiction is in the District Court.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,1794.906,1815.919,"We were overjoyed to find the decision of the Court of Appeals that jurisdiction lay in the District Court, because one of our major concerns in this case and the first consideration or challenge is that there has been an abuse of agency discretion on the part of the Commission."
1984.83-703,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1850.409,1852.092,You want a hearing?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,1852.092,1854.078,It was our request--
1984.83-703,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1854.078,1856.563,"Do you now, at this stage?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,1858.515,1859.098,"--Yes, we--"
1984.83-703,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1859.098,1860.532,Where you could put in evidence.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,1860.532,1864.086,"--My client, of course, seeks that opportunity, and one of the--"
1984.83-703,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1864.086,1871.09,Is there anything to prevent you from starting a proceeding more formally?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,1883.631,1893.938,"--The government has argued that one could renew the request in a new and separate 2.206 request, but that would require new information not previously submitted."
1984.83-703,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1958.548,1975.89,"Mr. Hodder, would you say the Commission's response to your client's letter was in the nature of saying the facts you allege are not so, or that even if the facts you allege are all true, it is still no reason for concern under the law?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,1975.89,1979.925,--I think the Commission fairly addressed the question.
1984.83-703,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2012.729,2015.931,But I am not quite sure what your answer to my question is.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2024.454,2030.006,"I think that as a matter of fact, of course, is the response."
1984.83-703,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.006,2040.528,"So you say you should have a hearing because you have made allegations of fact that if you could support them would be legally significant, and the Commission has just chosen to, what, disregard those allegations of fact?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2040.528,2040.828,Of course.
1984.83-703,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2047.281,2068.631,"Well, do you agree, Mr. Hodder, that it is reasonable to conclude that the statute only requires a hearing when the requesting party makes a certain threshold showing of health or safety risks or allegations?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2068.631,2073.599,"Of course, I think that that is the basis for the definition of the rule."
1984.83-703,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2075.115,2079.417,"Well, is that a reasonable interpretation of the statute, do you think?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2079.417,2084.805,"--I think that it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute, and the client has made such a showing."
1984.83-703,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.096,2179.7,"Well, you went to the Court of Appeals on appeal, and one of your claims was, I suppose, that you were entitled to a hearing."
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2179.7,2181.085,When we went to the Court of Appeals--
1984.83-703,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2181.085,2183.07,Wasn't that one of your claims?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2183.854,2184.87,"--Of course, we felt that the--"
1984.83-703,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.87,2185.47,That's what you wanted.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2185.47,2189.141,--director abused his discretion by not implementing a hearing under 2.202.
1984.83-703,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.141,2196.561,"And if the Court of Appeals decision is sustained, you are going to be in the District Court claiming that you were entitled to a hearing."
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2196.561,2210.737,"If we go into District Court, we would seek to utilize the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and examine in that court the existing record's adequacy by presentation of evidence and--"
1984.83-703,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2210.737,2214.689,But you will be asking the judge to remand it to the agency for the hearing.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2214.689,2215.458,"--No, sir."
1984.83-703,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2216.525,2217.991,Would there be a de novo hearing?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2217.991,2223.879,--We feel that based on interpretation of the law and the nature of the 2.206--
1984.83-703,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.879,2231.318,"My point is, my point is, though, the Court of Appeals never decided, never got to the question of whether you were entitled to a hearing."
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2233.836,2234.669,--That's true.
1984.83-703,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2234.669,2245.56,"And if we affirm... if we reverse them and say they have jurisdiction, they are going to have to face up to your claim that you are entitled to a hearing."
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2245.56,2246.01,Of course.
1984.83-703,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.512,2249.746,"Well, you may win."
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2249.746,2250.162,--Of course.
1984.83-703,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2250.162,2254.516,They may remand and say the agency abused its discretion in not giving you a hearing.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2254.516,2255.866,Of course.
1984.83-703,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2274.996,2284.185,"Is that normal for a case to come from an agency to a Court of Appeals, and then for the Court of Appeals to remand the case to the District Court?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2284.185,2287.57,"--Well, that is the result we are trying to avoid this morning."
1984.83-703,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2287.57,2288.22,I thought you said--
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2288.22,2290.506,Because that would impose an extra tier of review which--
1984.83-703,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2290.506,2292.458,--Will you answer my question?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2292.458,2292.874,"--Yes, sir."
1984.83-703,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2292.874,2297.326,I thought you said that the Hobbs Act required that result just now.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2297.326,2298.778,"I didn't hear you, sir."
1984.83-703,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2298.778,2307.134,I thought you said that the Hobbs Act required the result that a case coming from an agency to the Court of Appeals should be remanded to the District Court.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2307.134,2316.239,"By examination of the facts in this case, that would be the result were we to find jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals and then apply the Hobbs Act."
1984.83-703,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2326.445,2330.997,May I ask kind of a threshold question that I have never thoroughly understood in this case?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2363.718,2371.24,I think the entire Atomic Energy Act constitutes a very serious mandate to maintain the safety of the nuclear power industry.
1984.83-703,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2371.24,2374.442,"This specific provision, you just kind of read it in the statute as a whole?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2374.442,2380.163,"Yes, and failure to observe that very serious mandate constitutes an abuse of agency discretion."
1984.83-703,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2380.163,2384.798,But there is no statute that says that in so many words?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2384.798,2397.624,"Oh, yes, I think that one could read Section 189(a) of the Act to show that parties are entitled to a hearing if a requester seeks one, and any proceeding for the--"
1984.83-703,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2397.624,2398.524,189(a).
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2400.243,2400.626,"--Yes, sir."
1984.83-703,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2403.059,2412.434,"When you went to the Court of Appeals, did you suggest to the Court of Appeals that the record was inadequate for review?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2412.434,2420.354,"Yes, I claimed at the Court of Appeals level that the record constituted denial of due process due to the fact of a selective ex parte--"
1984.83-703,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2420.354,2426.241,Did you ask to have it remanded to the Commission to give you the kind of a hearing that you have been talking about?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2426.241,2436.549,"--Based on my best recollection at that time, I felt that... I believe I argued that it should be remanded, and that there should be some type of 2.202 hearing implemented."
1984.83-703,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2437.265,2439.934,Any reason why that can't be done now?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2439.934,2446.505,"No, because then we would win, and we would... that is, if I am understanding your question, and you were to remand to the agency--"
1984.83-703,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2446.505,2464.132,"Well, remand to the Court of Appeals, and tell the Court of Appeals that it does have jurisdiction, and to proceed, and then that would leave the Court of Appeals free to tell you, tell everyone that the record was not adequate for review and remanded to the Commission to supplement the record."
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2464.132,2511.947,"--Of course, that is very true, but we must concern ourselves when we remand to the agency with the effect that is going to have on the rule and the previous teaching of this Court in the case Vermont Yankee, because if we don't remand to the agency with the direct proviso that they implement a 2.202 show cause proceeding, which is what we are seeking, that is, if anything else is requested, then you have a situation where a Court of Appeals is tampering with the procedure, the rule, 2.206, established by the agency in engrafting its own notions of judicial procedure upon that agency process, which is exclusive to the agency and which the courts have been told not to do."
1984.83-703,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2519.369,2541.883,"Mr. Hodder, I think I don't understand your position that if the Court of Appeals determined that, let's say, they do have jurisdiction, and if it determined that a hearing should have been allowed, why wouldn't it remand it to the agency rather than to the District Court?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2544.835,2545.353,"Well, of course--"
1984.83-703,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2545.353,2558.661,"Why doesn't the Court of Appeals, if it has jurisdiction, look at the record that comes to it from the agency to determine whether it was an abuse of discretion to deny a hearing?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2568.434,2582.227,"--Your view is absolutely correct as far as it goes, but we must contemplate the nature of the procedure upon remand, whether it is specifically ordained that it be 2.202 or something else."
1984.83-703,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2634.844,2636.694,May I just pursue that a little bit?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2657.96,2661.996,"Yes, and that result would please us, because we support the decision--"
1984.83-703,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2661.996,2671.767,"Right, and what would you ask the District Court to do, ultimately to decide the merits or remand it to the Commission for it to have a normal proceeding?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2671.767,2675.988,--It would be our view that upon remand to the District Court--
1984.83-703,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2675.988,2676.721,It is not remanded.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2677.755,2678.107,--Transferred.
1984.83-703,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2680.123,2681.392,Yes.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2681.392,2688.296,"Upon transfer of the case to the District Court, then the rights as a party would attach for the first time."
1984.83-703,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2688.296,2688.729,Yes.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2688.729,2696.502,"And this requester would then have or proceed under the rules, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and shouldn't be able to--"
1984.83-703,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2696.502,2697.585,To do what?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2698.552,2715.963,"--To examine the existing record and to present evidence and testimony and cross examination, and therefore develop a record that adequately and fairly represents her views, which was not the record established by the director below."
1984.83-703,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2715.963,2722.117,"So you would make a record before the District Court, and you would not go back to the Commission?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2722.117,2724.702,"If the case be transferred, yes."
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2724.702,2730.973,In the District Court do you have pleadings?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2730.973,2732.808,My presumption is that--
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2732.808,2741.698,"I am kind of old school, and I think if you are going to have a case in the District Court without pleadings--"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2741.698,2755.073,"--Well, I think we would file an amended complaint at that point, and we would avail ourselves or seek to avail ourselves of discovery rights, and then proceed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and yes, there would be pleadings."
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2755.073,2756.773,--Could you have done that originally?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2756.773,2759.892,Not under the definition of the 2.206 rule--
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2759.892,2764.046,How can you do it now if you couldn't have done it originally?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2764.046,2780.573,--Because for the first time here the rights of a party have attached because we raised an issue of material fact that the Court finds worthy of consideration.
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2780.573,2781.089,I must say--
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2781.089,2790.696,"And that question, of course, is whether or not it is safe to operate this plant at full capacity, or whether it should be derated, that is, reduced to the lesser capacity for safety considerations, or perhaps shut down."
1984.83-703,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2790.696,2799.386,"--You are not then taking the position that the District Court will be performing a reviewing function, but rather it is just a brand new lawsuit, and you just go right into discovery?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2802.838,2809.925,"I believe that under the general jurisdiction statutes that would admit us to the District Court, which is 1331--"
1984.83-703,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2809.925,2820.566,"So you think you are going into the District Court bringing an original action, not a review as you review Social Security cases or something like that on the record that is before the agency?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2820.566,2821.85,--I believe so.
1984.83-703,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2823.252,2826.637,I don't know why you couldn't have done that without ever taking this appeal.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2826.637,2830.338,--The District Court might also examine the question of abuse of discretion.
1984.83-703,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2849.319,2853.271,I would expect the government to take the position that you are quite wrong about that.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2855.739,2859.425,"I suspect they would, Your Honor."
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2859.425,2863.477,Can you give me a case?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2869.363,2870.748,"Yes, there is a case known as--"
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2870.748,2873.017,Any place in the world.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2873.017,2880.688,--A case where we have transferred to the District Court and then the rights of a party attach?
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2880.688,2885.492,All I understand you transfer is your original action.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2891.396,2892.712,"Well, the question is--"
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2892.712,2895.264,You can't transfer a brand new action.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2895.264,2898.65,--The question is how one perceives the original request.
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2923.2,2924.917,What relief do you want there?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2928.769,2934.656,That is a proceeding where hearing rights would attach and an interested party could participate under 2.202.
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2951.117,2956.252,A review proceeding is the exact opposite of a de novo proceeding.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2956.252,2957.937,We are not seeking a de novo proceeding.
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2957.937,2962.323,I thought you said when you got down to the District Court you start all over again with discovery.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2968.477,2969.095,"Well, I--"
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2969.095,2972.78,Have you had discovery before in this case?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2972.78,2976.248,"--No, we never had even notice that the director's decision--"
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2976.248,2979.2,"Well, then, it is new, then, isn't it?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,2979.2,2981.886,"--In a sense, Your Honor."
1984.83-703,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2981.886,2985.921,"Well, let's assume we affirm the Court of Appeals."
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3012.422,3015.79,We could go into District Court on a new case--
1984.83-703,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3015.79,3017.242,"Well, how can you go to the Court of Appeals?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3024.998,3027.867,"--On future director's decisions, that would be the result."
1984.83-703,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3027.867,3035.954,And what would you claim... wouldn't you have to claim jurisdiction under 1331?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3035.954,3036.973,Yes.
1984.83-703,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3039.389,3047.512,"A review on the record, then, on the record as it exists of 547 pages?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3047.512,3055.267,"I believe that we could raise, yes, a bifurcated argument alleging that that record and decision constituted abuse of discretion."
1984.83-703,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3055.267,3059.386,But you say that you want to supplement that record by discovery and by more evidence.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3059.386,3072.646,"If the Court were willing to entertain an amended complaint that addressed the material issue of fact raised by the requester when she sought the initial relief, then we would seek to litigate that de novo."
1984.83-703,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3072.646,3074.246,You would be seeking in the District Court.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3078.4,3080.683,The Administrative Procedure Act would control--
1984.83-703,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3080.683,3082.668,The Hobbs Act?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3088.506,3089.222,"--No, it isn't."
1984.83-703,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.222,3091.291,It is the review of administrative--
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3091.291,3095.326,It is a jurisdictional grant contained in Section 189(b).
1984.83-703,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.326,3095.761,--Of?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3095.761,3097.027,"In other words, of the Atomic Energy Act."
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3121.893,3126.464,"Counsel, you talk about filing an amended complaint."
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3128.566,3131.701,--Contained in the requester's letter requesting enforcement action--
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3131.701,3133.634,Is that a complaint?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3133.634,3135.919,--It is the only complaint I can deal with here.
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3135.919,3137.319,"Well, you know the complaint I am talking about."
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3139.805,3141.473,"Well, of course, I--"
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3141.473,3149.577,"You really don't want to file an amended complaint, you want to file an original complaint in the District Court and start an original, new action."
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3150.829,3151.995,--I am not sure.
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3155.18,3158.498,"Well, would new ground be a new case?"
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3158.498,3171.742,"--I think that we would file a petition for review of an agency order in the District Court, and all that entails."
1984.83-703,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3171.742,3177.246,That would give you discovery?
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3177.246,3182.448,"Since I am operating under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, I believe I would be entitled to discovery."
1984.83-703,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3183.9,3210.967,"As I read Section 1631, which is what the Court of Appeals relied on to transfer to the District Court, all that does is say the District Court may treat the case as though it were originally filed in that court rather than the Court of Appeals, and therefore it seems to me it is open to the government... I don't know whether it's right or not... it is open to the government to say, since they decided it is not a proceeding within the meaning of the statute, it is just not reviewable at all."
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3224.877,3226.593,"Well, this Court--"
1984.83-703,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3226.593,3229.429,And I don't think the Court of Appeals order requires it.
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3229.429,3236.867,--This Court did not grant the petition for cert on the issue of whether or not these decisions were reviewable at all.
1984.83-703,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3238.886,3248.742,"No, we granted cert on the question of whether there was jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals to review an order which at least on the face of these documents does not appear in the proceeding."
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3252.277,3254.729,--I am following your argument to some extent.
1984.83-703,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3296.489,3307.281,"Well, there are situations in the law where you have a time bomb ticking in somebody's back yard and you go to the prosecutor and say, I want you to arrest that man, and he says, well, I will think about it, but you can't make him do it if he decides not to do it."
1984.83-703,2,36046,martin_h_hodder,,3307.281,3308.847,"That is true, Your Honor."
1984.83-703,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3373.639,3375.089,"Very well, Mr. Hodder."
1984.83-703,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3379.976,3381.828,"Yes, three quick points, Your Honor."
1984.83-703,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3387.816,3395.069,So that you may well take the position in the District Court that this is an unreviewable refusal to institute a proceeding.
1984.83-703,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3395.069,3404.258,"The Commission might very well take that position, and certainly if there were District Court proceedings, they would proceed on the record that is in existence."
1984.83-703,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3415.797,3421.534,"Under the Administrative Procedures Act, the District Court can reopen on its own."
1984.83-703,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3423.636,3433.777,"I think so long as the record is adequate to support the decision of the agency, the court would have to review that record."
1984.83-703,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3439.579,3442.966,"Couldn't it take testimony itself, though, under the APA?"
1984.83-703,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3442.966,3444.783,"I am not sure if it could, Your Honor."
1984.83-703,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3455.624,3459.326,"Under the APA, if there were jurisdiction, what would be the standard of review?"
1984.83-703,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3461.592,3469.514,"Arbitrary and capricious, I would think, because a hearing has not been held, and the Atomic Energy Act does not require a hearing on the record."
1984.83-703,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3469.514,3477.037,"When you seek that kind of review under the Administrative Procedure Act, what is your jurisdictional basis?"
1984.83-703,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3477.037,3483.191,"Well, it is not clear, as the Court of Appeals noted, it is not clear precisely what jurisdictional statute respondent could proceed under."
1984.83-703,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3486.743,3487.709,What do you think?
1984.83-703,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3494.999,3504.105,"--Well, I think it is arguable to proceed on one of those other statutes, but the government has not conceded that it could, or that it would be appropriate in District Court in any event."
1984.83-703,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3504.105,3515.995,"I know you haven't, but my question was, if you were going there, what would you suppose, if you were going to try to go there, what jurisdictional basis would there be in the District Court?"
1984.83-703,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3515.995,3524.684,"If I were the respondent, I would point to one of the statutes that were noted in the Court of Appeals opinion, Section 1331, 1337."
1984.83-703,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3527.686,3528.803,"Yes, I understand."
1984.83-703,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3528.803,3538.159,"Finally, I think that if the Court of Appeals were to review this case and decided the record was inadequate, there would be no bar in the Hobbs Act to a remand to the agency."
1984.83-703,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3551.066,3552.801,But your opponent disagrees.
1984.83-703,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3558.939,3568.778,"He presented factual submissions to the agency, but the question for the Court to decide is whether the determination that the agency made is appropriately based on the record."
1984.83-703,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3579.853,3588.042,"As I understand Mr. Hodder's argument is that they have never had a chance to present anything, to make a record here on which any court could review."
1984.83-703,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3588.042,3595.195,"Well, respondent certainly had an opportunity to present whatever factual material she wished, and may present whatever factual material she has not presented to this point."
1984.83-703,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3595.195,3602.118,"Ordinarily, to present factual material, you have at least an invitation to a hearing."
1984.83-703,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3603.768,3607.253,Only if it is a case of formal adjudication or formal rulemaking.
1984.83-703,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3625.231,3626.181,Very well.
