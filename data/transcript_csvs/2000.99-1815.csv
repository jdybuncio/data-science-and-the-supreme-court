2000.99-1815,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,33.468,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-1815, National Labor Relations Board v. Kentucky River Community Care, Inc.--"
2000.99-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,34.57,38.622,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1815,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.424,233.1,"So there were those three phrases that could possibly justify the exclusion of registered nurses generally, and one of them was disposed of in the earlier case."
2000.99-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,252.745,261.184,"Well, this was a determination made by the board in going back to the drawingboard, so to speak."
2000.99-1815,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,261.184,261.517,"Well, that's the Government, right."
2000.99-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,262.267,304.844,"Yes, of course, but the board made a determination that responsibly to direct in the abstract need not be defined because it is always qualified by the exercise of independent judgment not of a routine nature in order for these determinations to be made, and early on, after Taft-Hartley was passed, the board got burned by courts of appeals in trying to interpret responsibly to direct, particularly in a case called Ohio Power."
2000.99-1815,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,304.844,316.419,The trouble is that hanging it all on independent judgment is... that's much the broader way to go.
2000.99-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,342.052,378.725,"Well, the board I think quite properly on the basis of textual analysis of this provision holds that there must be a nexus between the exercise of independent judgment and the exercise of one of the 12 categories of authority that define who is a supervisor, because that is what is qualified by the phrase, requiring the exercise of independent judgment."
2000.99-1815,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,378.725,391.902,"But your basic position is that professional judgment is not independent judgment, that if something is required to be done, and any qualified professional would do it that way, this is not independent judgment."
2000.99-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,393.802,413.998,"Well, the... if we're talking about when an employee is performing his own functions, his trade or his profession, carrying out his own tasks, that is not one of the functions that makes one a supervisor."
2000.99-1815,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.998,417.367,"No, but let me give you a hypothetical, one that concerns me."
2000.99-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,492.6,501.373,"Well, assignment is a separate category in this, but let me respond more directly to your question."
2000.99-1815,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.851,570.234,"Sure, I understand."
2000.99-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,588.412,602.655,--That would depend on further inquiry about whether she is making determinations about how the staff is to be deployed beyond direction that she got from her--
2000.99-1815,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.655,602.905,Yes.
2000.99-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,619.867,628.822,--That would be much further along what I think of as a spectrum between the journeyman apprentice and the managerial employees.
2000.99-1815,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.822,648.118,"Mr. Wallace, maybe you can tell us when an RN, under the board's current definition, when would an RN not... would be an uncovered employee and would be ranked a supervisor, so that she would not come under the Act's protection."
2000.99-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,659.342,678.072,"Well, it was stipulated that the nursing coordinator here, who had authority to hire and fire, and made staffing decisions about who would be working in the wings of this facility was a supervisor."
2000.99-1815,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,678.072,684.393,"Isn't that just the question that Justice Scalia asked about staffing, making staffing decisions, who goes to which ward?"
2000.99-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,684.393,688.445,"If it became comparable to that, yes."
2000.99-1815,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,689.145,731.322,"Well, I thought in this very case, and maybe I'm wrong, but there is a mechanism whereby there's a registered nurse who's the building supervisor when the other folks aren't there, and that that amounts to about 72 percent of the time, in terms of total hours that the building is open, 24 hours a day, and there is an internal memo which states that these registered nurses, as building supervisors, are in charge of the facility, and all rehabilitation staff, and are ultimately responsible for quality patient care."
2000.99-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,749.7,792.978,"--Well, there's also a finding that these registered nurses usually work on their own, without any assistance in performing their duties, and the other employees who may be present... we're talking about the evening hours when less is going on, are... do not report to the nurse, whether she's the building supervisor or not, and are performing tasks that are laid out for them by management in the facility, so of course she would be using judgment in performing her own nursing services, to the extent they're called for."
2000.99-1815,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.386,845.93,"Mr. Wallace, I am less concerned about, you know, the outcome of this case, whether these particular nurses were, indeed, supervisory, as I am with the rationale that the board used, and the rationale that it used... I'll quote it from your brief."
2000.99-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,913.056,956.584,"--Well, what... that standard that we've articulated was based on longstanding board experience with other employment situations involving skilled crafts, team leaders, lead men, group members, who they on their experience, or their superior technical knowledge, direct discrete tasks to be performed by other members of the group that management has assigned to be members of that team."
2000.99-1815,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,965.19,972.094,But most supervisors don't necessarily decide who shall compose the people that they're going to supervise.
2000.99-1815,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,975.998,986.438,"--That's precisely my point, Mr. Chief Justice, that management is deciding who the team shall be and who shall be in the position of the leader."
2000.99-1815,1,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,1558.878,1563.081,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1815,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3394.756,3406.997,"Well, the only nurse who testified said she had not read two of the three memoranda that had been introduced and had never been shown it."
2000.99-1815,3,35965,michael_w_hawkins,,3451.859,3458.18,"The board did not say that, and that is not my understanding of the findings."
2000.99-1815,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3509.079,3511.815,"--Well, to--"
