1978.78-488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.045,Case is submitted.
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,118.76,125.495,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-488,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,171.523,174.683,Attachment to the original 564?
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,174.683,182.619,"The 564 acres, Mr. Justice Blackmun, included a number of tracks besides the three owned by the Synod."
1978.78-488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,276.514,282.593,"Am I right, gener -- I'm thinking that this Court has even applied that doctrine to public."
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,282.593,283.258,That is true.
1978.78-488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,659.371,663.749,It isn't very helpful to use a capitalization approach on a voice camp which --
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,663.749,669.732,"No, it will not be, and nobody -- (Voice Overlap) -- and nobody suggested that that approach be used here, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.78-488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,918.915,923.406,"I suppose, Mr. Barnett, you take the same position with regard to an old church, too."
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,925.912,927.731,"Well, I guess, that would be true."
1978.78-488,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,958.403,978.137,"Well, that was the case too in Cors, wasn't it, where the ships condemned had risen in value and it's perfectly clear that the Court said the award -- the just compensation award need not be sufficient to enable the owner to buy ships at an inflated value because the inflated value had been created by the Government."
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,978.137,980.027,Yes.
1978.78-488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,998.023,1003.222,"Yes, but as I understand their test, it's substitution cost less depreciation."
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1004.364,1007.759,"No, we do -- we're not sure that they do it at all, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1978.78-488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1046.91,1052.858,But you would still object to the alternative approach even if they did allow a factor for depreciation or betterment in the insurance company?
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1052.858,1054.594,"Yes, we still would object to it."
1978.78-488,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1101.651,1113.025,"Well, your ultimate purpose is to provide just compensation as required by the Constitution and it -- and one could say that that means you've got to have full compensation and able to replace it, but you're not entitled to a profit on the transaction."
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1113.025,1114.752,"Well, one certainly could say that."
1978.78-488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1508.572,1522.857,"Before you get to that, Mr. Barnett, where lies the authority to define what is just compensation, exclusively with Congress or is it with the Courts or where?"
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1522.857,1524.905,"Oh, I think it's in the courts, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.78-488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1538.037,1554.017,"This Court could say, in your view, that just compensation means to do justice presumably, and that when you take something away from a person, you want to give him the equivalent."
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1554.017,1557.82,"The Court could say that, but it will be inconsistent with what the Court has said."
1978.78-488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1557.82,1558.543,Well --
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1558.543,1567.184,"In -- in the recent Budcore case, for example, the Court of Appeals said something very much like that, that our duty in just -- in eminent domain cases is to do justice."
1978.78-488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1574.706,1577.81,I was only addressing myself to the ultimate authority.
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1590.187,1593.129,"Well, Congress can add to the compensation to be provided."
1978.78-488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1604.906,1607.239,I'm just talking about enlargement substitution.
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1607.239,1611.143,Enlargement certainly could be done by Congress or by state legislatures.
1978.78-488,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1611.143,1616.485,Could they set the guidelines?
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1618.681,1623.001,That's a difficult question.
1978.78-488,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1634.714,1641.155,"There's no such thing as a state condemnation of a federal property, is there, I suppose because of the Supremacy Clause?"
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1641.155,1641.934,Not that I know of.
1978.78-488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1645.53,1662.449,"Certainly, when I -- taking demolishes, let us say, a small college in an isolated place, a non-denominational, so you keep away from the First Amendment that you're about to address."
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1669.547,1676.15,"Well, there may be a market for college type facilities for campuses in isolated areas."
1978.78-488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1679.845,1684.055,But it isn't the kind of market you have for real estates in --
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1684.055,1684.548,No.
1978.78-488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1684.548,1685.005,Washington.
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1685.005,1687.681,"No and, in such a case, you have to look further."
1978.78-488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1704.543,1712.502,"Well, when I said “no market,” there's not a very good market for colleges campuses and things of that kind, is there?"
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1712.502,1728.078,"Well, there may be -- it may not be terribly active but, certainly, the land is marketable and the buildings, depending on how many other things they're suitable for, there are all sorts of conference centers and retreats these days that thrive on being in isolated places."
1978.78-488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1729.587,1735.771,"This case illustrates something about the marketability and how much market there is for boy's camps, doesn't it?"
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1735.771,1743.61,"Well, we put in testimony showing that, indeed, there were, that there had been 11 comparable sales within a 7-year-period in this very county of camps."
1978.78-488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1746.024,1748.719,That's because it's up in Pocono.
1978.78-488,0,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,1751.069,1752.652,I think so.
1978.78-488,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1757.448,1762.381,Very well.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,1769.038,1774.755,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1823.689,1827.899,I didn't understood -- I didn't understand it to concede that.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,1827.899,1834.748,"I take it then, if I may rephrase my sentence, not to dispute it at this time."
1978.78-488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1834.748,1841.543,But that's just -- that will be -- just be the Government's opinion as to what the constitutional law might be.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,1847.879,1848.734,Well --
1978.78-488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1848.734,1849.709,And this Court has never decided --
1978.78-488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.709,1852.178,This Court has never so-held.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,1852.178,1860.692,"Certainly, it is open to this Court despite that very nice dictum of Chief Justice Taft in the Brown case."
1978.78-488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1866.855,1870.11,You mean not to embrace it.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,1870.11,1881.935,"To demolish it to the extent that it has been followed, if the Court please, in 10 circuits and rejected in none and in some State Courts as well."
1978.78-488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.935,1885.328,"Well, surely, we're not bound by the holdings of the Courts of Appeals."
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,1885.328,1890.146,"Indeed, not."
1978.78-488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1923.739,1930.4,"Mr. Hess, is it perfectly clear that the doctrine would apply to a government-owned piece of property, such as a camp?"
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,1933.749,1935.233,"Well, I would -- I cannot--"
1978.78-488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1935.233,1937.618,Even in the lower Courts.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,1937.618,1948.495,"I base by statement that it would upon the comparable cases involving bath houses, recreation centers, playgrounds, and public parks."
1978.78-488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1954.383,1957.287,And there is the same uniformity of that category of cases.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,1957.287,1959.713,Yes.
1978.78-488,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2104.948,2121.085,"We'll resume there at one o'clock, Mr. Hess."
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2126.34,2131.487,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-488,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2202.201,2202.798,I don't -- i don't --
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2202.798,2203.385,In this --
1978.78-488,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2203.385,2207.055,I'm not quite sure I understand the third of those criteria.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2207.055,2222.816,"The third is included because this is the familiar category in which non-profit activities, which are classified in the quasi-public corporation category, are expressed."
1978.78-488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.228,2242.133,"You say it's expressed in many places of the law, like the Internal Revenue Code, or --?"
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2242.133,2247.691,"Yes, a number of times in the Code and elsewhere in our jurisprudence."
1978.78-488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.691,2247.761,Where?
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2247.761,2252.538,"Now, in this case, we're not talking about the Tennis Club or the Swimming Club or the Country Club."
1978.78-488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2252.982,2255.44,Where other than --
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2255.44,2283.518,"Well, in the Constitution of Pennsylvania, for example, and in real estate tax exemption cases such as existed in New York which came under inspection in Walz versus the Tax Commission, to which I will presently refer it in another context."
1978.78-488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2307.35,2310.869,What if a Country Club gave a free golf clinic once a week?
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2310.869,2330.454,"Well, I would not think, Your Honor, that that would put it in the category of a non-profit corporation operated -- organized and operated for public, charitable, educational, or religious purposes."
1978.78-488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2410.389,2421.365,What if a non-profit company paid its director a salary that the Government claimed was three times what a comparable director would receive?
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2433.349,2438.79,That would contradict the non-profit -- it might go to contradict it.
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2497.092,2497.986,But what were --
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2497.986,2498.97,"Homes for the aged, and schools and colleges."
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2498.97,2507.526,"Mr. Hess, I agree on tax exemption and all those things but, here, you're asking the Government to give you some money."
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2507.526,2510.565,"I am not asking the Government, Your Honor, to give us any money."
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2510.565,2510.702,You are asking the Government to give you --
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2510.702,2513.398,I am asking the Government to give us just compensation.
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2513.398,2520.2,"You are given -- you're asking the Government to give you the difference between 740,000 and 3 million."
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2521.974,2524.434,"I am asking for just compensation, Your Honor."
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2524.434,2526.863,"Is that in dollars and cents, what you're asking?"
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2526.863,2528.334,"In dollars and cents, I am asking for --"
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2528.334,2530.737,You are asking for money.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2530.737,2537.361,I am asking -- our evidence was the effect and wasn't contradicted because we didn't get into that phase at the trial.
1978.78-488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2647.186,2647.217,Mr. Hess.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2647.217,2659.768,And it's this very policy of encouraging volunteerism which makes non-profit corporations of this category quasi-public corporations in the language which was used in Walz versus the Tax Commission.
1978.78-488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.768,2678.171,"Mr. Hess, on your emphasis on the justice, which of course is the bottom line in a case like this, is it really just, if your view is correct, to treat a profit corporation, take -- give it $700,000.00 when it cost it $5 million to stay in business?"
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2678.171,2684.329,"Now, Your Honor, that's a different category, as I endeavored to point out."
1978.78-488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2739.687,2742.536,"Well, but let's take this example."
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2758.797,2762.148,"Well, you mean, to us, a non-profit --"
1978.78-488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2762.148,2766.888,"No, I want to try and think it through in terms of a profit-making corporation."
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2773.764,2773.981,Oh!
1978.78-488,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2796.413,2799.17,"Even if all the comparable sales were at 700,000?"
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2799.17,2806.017,Yes.
1978.78-488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2824.011,2835.265,Does the camp -- does the public or does the non-profit facility have to be in existence and operating to invoke your rule?
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2835.265,2837.422,"Yes, it has to be."
1978.78-488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2840.032,2857.831,"Suppose the Government condemned the day after the organization passed a resolution saying, “Our -- we've been doing a great job, but our facilities are worn out and we can't afford to replace them, so we're closing down at the end of the year.”"
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2857.831,2859.955,That would be another case.
1978.78-488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2860.104,2862.924,But it would still be the same valuable function.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2862.924,2867.625,"No, if the Court please, may I repeat the three test."
1978.78-488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2889.978,2899.0,"Well, but in my example the only reason this very valuable public function doesn't go on is that there isn't -- that the organization doesn't have the money."
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2899.0,2900.614,That would have bearing upon full --
1978.78-488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2900.614,2916.602,"And similarly, in the actual case, if there's a condemnation and they play only the fair market, the only reason the organization does -- won't continue is that it doesn't have the money."
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2916.602,2920.581,"The case, Your Honor, supposes is different from the case here."
1978.78-488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2928.795,2936.761,"Well, death row is only because they didn't have the money to replace the sewer plant or the water facility."
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2936.761,2943.859,That would bear on the full use at the time of the taking.
1978.78-488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2949.789,2950.098,"Well, I know, but --"
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2950.098,2951.396,Such a rare coincidence case --
1978.78-488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2951.396,2952.278,But I would think --
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2952.278,2953.863,It would be a different case from this.
1978.78-488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2968.28,2977.3,"Well, you could also make your argument in the case where an organization was about to -- had the great plans to build a camp."
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,2992.383,2997.482,That would not be this case or anything closely reassembling it in our --
1978.78-488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2997.482,3003.564,"Mr. Hess, did this “charitable” mean something more than non-profit in your definition?"
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3003.564,3004.053,Yes.
1978.78-488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3006.976,3007.276,Yes.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3010.462,3021.906,Charitable embraces a whole dictionary of considerations.
1978.78-488,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3021.906,3028.763,"What if instead of Lutheran, these have been very wealthy Episcopalians that had gone to this camp?"
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3028.763,3047.548,"Well, if it's operated on a non-profit basis for wealthy people who could pay and don't, it's -- I suppose that puts it in the category of a Country Club, but it's --"
1978.78-488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3047.548,3049.752,Even a Lutheran Country Club?
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3049.752,3060.45,"Well, the Episcopalians have the money, and the Lutherans have the good intentions."
1978.78-488,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3060.45,3068.232,"Mr. Hess, I suppose your approach here would be the same if this were a non-profit denominational hospital."
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3068.232,3072.262,Precisely.
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3199.159,3206.239,"Why should the federal government be moved eminent domain, while we're at it?"
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3206.239,3207.536,The federal government?
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3208.649,3214.971,"Well, you say it's just like a county, or a city, or anything else, but you don't have eminent domain."
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3214.971,3215.772,The --
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3215.772,3217.2,You don't have anything close to it.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3217.2,3222.439,"Well, of course, many subordinate governmental units also lack eminent domain."
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3226.752,3229.604,But you still want money.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3229.604,3236.241,We want to say we want an award of just compensation.
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3236.241,3239.326,And the just compensation is in dollars and cents?
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3239.326,3242.964,"Yes, it is."
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3243.826,3248.239,You asked the Government giving that money to church.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3248.239,3250.186,What?
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3250.269,3250.744,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3257.097,3257.9,Well --
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3257.9,3260.555,The Lutheran Church that money?
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3260.555,3265.724,"Well, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Synod of the Lutheran Church in America is the respondent here."
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3265.724,3267.365,And that's who should be getting the money.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3267.365,3267.837,That's right.
1978.78-488,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3269.86,3271.987,"Well, that'd be true whenever their property was condemned."
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3271.987,3277.629,"No, the difference is -- I'm not talking about the same amount of 40."
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3287.215,3288.747,That is the cost of the substitute.
1978.78-488,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3292.138,3294.351,"Well, in guess to the millions, it's millions."
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3294.351,3298.082,And the same thing was true of the bath house case in New York.

1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3423.053,3424.059,They weren't new.
1978.78-488,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3424.059,3425.544,They weren't depreciated.
1978.78-488,1,27175,h_ober_hess,,3425.544,3426.267,They weren't new.
1978.78-488,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3624.052,3626.611,"Mr. Barnett, do you have anything further?"
1978.78-488,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3626.611,3630.989,"Well, just a couple of points, Mr. Chief Justice, if I may."
1978.78-488,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3679.61,3686.389,"Well, I thought he -- I thought he cleared that up somewhat when he analogized it to a charitable hospital."
1978.78-488,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3686.389,3686.979,"Well, that's it."
1978.78-488,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3692.289,3694.063,"Well, the public service he is turning to --"
1978.78-488,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3694.063,3703.11,"Yes, to that extent, it is similar to the benefit to the community test of the Court of Appeals and we see those problems with that under the First Amendment."
1978.78-488,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3768.192,3778.679,"How is that different from allowing the national cathedral, which I assume is tax exempt, or the shrine?"
1978.78-488,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3778.679,3791.97,The differences between the tax exemption created by a legislature and this Court saying that this is what the Fifth Amendment requires and that the Fifth Amendment draws that line between non-profit entities and profit-making entities.
1978.78-488,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3806.31,3808.097,That was a giving of public money --
1978.78-488,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3808.097,3808.273,Well --
1978.78-488,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3808.273,3810.407,As distinguished from a recompense --
1978.78-488,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3810.407,3810.817,We would --
1978.78-488,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3810.817,3811.73,-- for a taking.
1978.78-488,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3811.73,3821.25,"Well, we would suggest that, here, when the award would be so much more than the fair market value of the property, that it would amount to more than compensation."
1978.78-488,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3835.38,3839.608,"It might stay on it, but they might not stay in the same business."
1978.78-488,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3839.608,3840.66,"Well, if the --"
1978.78-488,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3840.66,3846.823,"Because you can give them the 740,000 and they could stop the business, couldn't they?"
1978.78-488,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3846.823,3852.993,"Yes, but their theory for getting the 4 or 5 million is that they would stay in the same business."
1978.78-488,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3857.752,3859.718,You say you could hold them to that.
1978.78-488,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3860.786,3864.146,"Well, that's precisely our point, that we could not hold them to that if the --"
1978.78-488,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3864.146,3866.645,Why does he have a right to?
1978.78-488,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3866.645,3874.129,"Well, because under the Court of Appeals theory that would be the basis for giving him that amount of money so that the camps could continue to function."
1978.78-488,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3881.86,3882.512,"Very well, Mr. Barnett."
1978.78-488,2,41037,stephen_r_barnett,,3882.512,3883.201,Thank you.
