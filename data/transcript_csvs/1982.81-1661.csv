1982.81-1661,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.636,We will hear arguments next in General Motors against Devex Corporation.
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,58.411,65.017,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a patent infringement case."
1982.81-1661,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,81.246,84.167,"There isn't much left of the patent issue, is there?"
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,84.167,85.793,"--No, there isn't, Your Honor."
1982.81-1661,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.438,150.139,"Is the question whether it requires it or whether it permits it, or are they the same thing?"
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,150.139,151.469,No.
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,272.466,274.369,Was that the only change that--
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,274.369,282.352,"There are other changes unrelated to this particular item, dealing with attorney fees and things of that kind."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,283.385,285.086,--Was that sentence otherwise changed?
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,285.086,297.018,"Only in connection with the format of the attorneys' fees, yes, but it was not... it didn't have anything to do with the prejudgment interest part of the language."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,300.033,302.205,"No, you take your own course."
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,310.03,311.263,"--Yes, they were, Your Honor."
1982.81-1661,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,315.385,317.229,"After the '46 amendment, what?"
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,318.823,319.525,Same.
1982.81-1661,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,319.525,320.103,Are they allowed as a matter of course?
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,320.103,320.711,Yes.
1982.81-1661,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,320.711,321.947,Notwithstanding it says
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,324.365,325.149,Yes.
1982.81-1661,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,325.149,326.694,And that is allowed as a matter of course.
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,326.694,329.536,"Yes, they are allowed as a matter of course, and I might say, Your Honor--"
1982.81-1661,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,329.536,332.301,I just wonder why interest is in the same category.
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,332.301,343.656,"--Because there is a settled rule before the Act on both costs and interests, and they are together because as to that phase of the Act, it preserved the existing law."
1982.81-1661,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,343.656,345.216,What was the law as to interest?
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,345.216,354.434,"The law as to interest was this Court's Duplate versus Triplex case, which required exceptional circumstances, meaning bad faith conduct of the defendant."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.828,724.844,What if the House version had passed?
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,724.844,731.295,"Had the House version passed, there would be no question that Duplate versus Triplex would be changed."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,731.295,739.433,And didn't the Senate report supporting the bill specifically approve the House version?
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,739.433,741.09,"I don't think it did, Your Honor, at all."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,742.479,744.057,"It adopted the House report, didn't it?"
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,744.057,749.79,"--Well, they rather carelessly quoted it, yes, sir, but I think when you take the whole record--"
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,750.477,752.928,How careless can you get?
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,752.928,756.332,"Well, this careless, if Your Honor please."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,769.249,779.481,"I know, but it was the same... that same report didn't agree with the House version on the attorneys' fees statement, and so they redrafted it."
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,780.152,780.869,--Yes.
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,780.869,784.476,But they certainly didn't change their report with respect to interest.
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,784.476,795.518,"They simply quoted the totality of the House report, and we think that taken in context, Your Honor, that that does not indicate intent otherwise."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,795.518,795.846,"Taken in context, I would think you--"
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,795.846,797.156,"Now, I might add one thing."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,797.156,798.346,--How can you just ignore it?
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,798.346,803.439,"I am not asking that the Court ignore it, but I do think there is a time to take the context--"
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,803.439,806.593,You say there is no evidence that they intended to change the Duplate law.
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,815.403,818.246,"--Well, let me go on just a second if I may, Your Honor."
1982.81-1661,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,850.248,851.278,"Well, Mr. Frost--"
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,851.278,851.949,--Yes?
1982.81-1661,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,851.949,856.87,"--Aro sort of accepted what the House report said, did it not?"
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,856.87,858.539,I think that--
1982.81-1661,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,858.539,859.635,"Was that inadvertent, too?"
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,859.635,861.133,--I think it was.
1982.81-1661,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,862.228,862.774,It was?
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,862.774,863.944,The... What happened was this.
1982.81-1661,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,863.944,865.804,"If it is in line, I made a mistake."
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,865.804,867.115,"No, not at all."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,901.539,903.353,No different from the later Senate report?
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,903.353,904.757,--In that respect.
1982.81-1661,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,906.414,907.818,"And the actual language was,"
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,928.449,943.49,"Well, I think if Your Honor will check it, you will see that for the purpose it was quoted, that is, the question of damages versus profits to the infringer, and that was the only question in the case, the only reason it was quoted, the quotation was perfectly correct."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,943.49,944.161,Let's assume--
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,956.016,959.591,Agreed to on the--
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,959.591,961.155,Or repeated in the Senate report.
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,961.155,965.23,"--Well, I think repeated in the Senate report is--"
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,965.23,966.057,"Well, it adopted the House--"
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,966.057,967.075,--getting us back to that--
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,967.075,968.417,--It adopted the House report.
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,968.417,992.062,"--The Senate report in its first paragraphs states very specifically the changes in the Act, and what you have reference to, Your Honor, is a quotation of the House report in its totality, which is unselective, and it seems to us it has to be taken in the context of the change that was actually made."
1982.81-1661,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,994.702,995.654,Yes.
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,1018.537,1020.302,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1661,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1020.302,1022.175,"Well, then, what are the equities?"
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,1024.534,1028.437,"I think they do, Your Honor, and let me explain."
1982.81-1661,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1028.437,1029.108,Why?
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,1029.108,1035.015,"In the first place, General Motors' conduct was in good faith, not reckless."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1303.202,1303.873,Very well.
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,1324.442,1328.205,I have difficulty with that right off.
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1328.205,1329.441,Do you?
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,1335.61,1336.437,"That's... Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1344.263,1344.856,"But it's damages, isn't it?"
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,1346.512,1348.93,"Well, it's damages, and the statute specifically--"
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1348.93,1350.931,"It is damages, but it is supposed to be measured by how much you are hurt."
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,1350.931,1354.913,"--Well, the statute says not less than a reasonable royalty."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1357.49,1357.915,Yes.
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,1361.148,1363.363,"The other such interest as the court may allow, yes."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1363.363,1367.067,"--But it is still supposed to be compensation and damages, isn't it?"
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,1369.516,1370.721,It's not profits.
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1371.86,1378.532,"Well, it seems to me if you were able to prove, for example, that the plaintiff in this suit, or that your opposition... it was the plaintiff in this suit--"
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,1378.532,1379.062,Right.
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1379.062,1391.212,"--had unconscionably delayed the suit, can anybody claim that during that period that you had injured them, that your client had injured them?"
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,1391.212,1395.928,"That question did not arise, Your Honor."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.928,1396.789,I know it didn't arise.
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,1401.816,1403.988,"Frankly, I hadn't thought about it that way."
1982.81-1661,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.988,1404.487,Okay.
1982.81-1661,0,25330,george_e_frost,,1405.283,1405.551,That is the only answer I can give you.
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1410.812,1424.699,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, plaintiff's position is that the judgment below should be affirmed on two separate grounds, as was found by the courts below."
1982.81-1661,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1449.94,1460.714,Do you think there is room for your second ground under the... Suppose we agreed with you that the statute should be read as though it had the House words in it.
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1460.714,1465.402,"Well, Your Honor, I believe under those circumstances the case ends there."
1982.81-1661,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1465.402,1466.198,"Oh, you do?"
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1466.198,1467.09,Yes.
1982.81-1661,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1488.299,1489.734,Did the court below agree with you?
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1489.734,1491.344,"The court below did say that, Your Honor."
1982.81-1661,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.344,1493.985,Saying that they adopted your first--
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1493.985,1494.593,Position.
1982.81-1661,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1494.593,1495.654,--submission rather than your--
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1495.654,1497.732,"They adopted both positions, Your Honor."
1982.81-1661,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1497.732,1498.606,--Yes.
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1498.606,1511.914,"They adopted... They adopted the... the court of appeals, at Page 336 of the record, if Your Honor please, specifically quoted from the Aro decision."
1982.81-1661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1511.914,1512.585,Right.
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1512.585,1542.588,"And in addition, they held that they were affirming also the exercise of discretion by the trial court, and I would like to go back to the plain meaning of the statute, if I may, and the starting point in every case, as this Court has held in Ernst and Ernst v. Hockfelder, is the language of the statute itself, and indeed, the ascertainment of Congressional intent must rest primarily on the language of the statute."
1982.81-1661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1589.555,1591.57,When did he fix that?
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1591.57,1601.159,That was fixed by the special master pursuant to the parties stipulating as to what the interest rates would be--
1982.81-1661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1601.159,1602.079,In what year?
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1602.079,1603.284,--Pardon me?
1982.81-1661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1603.284,1604.267,In what year?
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1604.267,1606.126,"In every year, Your Honor, because--"
1982.81-1661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1606.126,1607.187,When did he make that order?
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1607.187,1625.086,"--The order was... it was a stipulation that was signed by the parties in November of 1978, and the special master awarded the interest in February of 1980 on his recommendation, and the district court entered judgment in October of 1980."
1982.81-1661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1625.086,1639.065,"Mr. Bender, may I ask, if you looked at the statute just literally for the moment, and left out the ""but"" clause, the ""but in no event"" clause, just had it, damages... leave out the reasonable royalty floor, just said"
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1646.139,1647.219,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1661,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1848.917,1859.224,"Well, suppose that the only language that had appeared in either bill, either the Senate or the House, was the language that is now in the statute."
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1859.224,1861.662,"""Together with interest and costs as may be fixed by the court. """
1982.81-1661,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1861.662,1862.317,"""As fixed by the court""."
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1862.317,1862.789,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1661,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1862.789,1864.474,What would be the ordinary reading of that?
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1864.474,1875.938,"The ordinary reading of that, Your Honor, would be that interest and costs were mandatory except that costs are discretionary as to amount, and interest is discretionary as to rate."
1982.81-1661,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1875.938,1881.029,"Well, why would you say that ""as fixed by the court"" wouldn't apply to interest?"
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1881.029,1882.886,It does apply to interest.
1982.81-1661,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1882.886,1884.621,But only... but you say only as to rate.
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1884.621,1898.43,"Because if Your Honor please, I believe if the... if the Congress intended to make interest and costs discretionary, just as it did with attorneys' fees, they would have worded it this way."
1982.81-1661,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.723,1906.206,"Or it could have said,"
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,1912.64,1918.246,"But, Your Honor, I believe that does take it out of context, because the preamble to that is,"
1982.81-1661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2019.799,2021.799,Or at least that is what Senator Pepper thought.
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2021.799,2023.266,And that is what Senator Pepper thought.
1982.81-1661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2023.266,2024.377,At least.
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2024.954,2026.187,"Yes, Your Honor, and when the bill--"
1982.81-1661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2026.187,2028.577,--That doesn't bind the whole body.
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2028.577,2030.262,"--Well, Your Honor, that's correct."
1982.81-1661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2197.414,2198.241,Mr. Bender--
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2198.241,2201.053,It was being reported as interest from the time infringement occurred.
1982.81-1661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2201.053,2204.975,"--That language you quote on Page 17 of your brief, do you know who wrote that?"
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2207.346,2208.333,"I do not, Your Honor."
1982.81-1661,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2352.665,2360.253,"Of course, you could argue just as well that Congress was dealing with attorneys' fees in 1952, and decided to require them only in exceptional circumstances."
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2364.894,2384.431,"Well, if Your Honor please, what Congress had done with respect to attorneys' fees was change it from discretionary, as it existed in 1946, in 1952 to require exceptional circumstances of an exceptional case, in order to enable a prevailing party to get attorneys' fees."
1982.81-1661,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2416.153,2418.372,"In 1952, was a general revision?"
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2418.372,2419.479,A codification.
1982.81-1661,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2419.479,2420.887,A codification.
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2420.887,2435.069,"And Section 284, which was codified in 1952, provided ""together with interest"" and dropped out the term ""may be"" and said ""as fixed by the court"", and"
1982.81-1661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2684.217,2685.137,"Well, of course, that--"
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2685.137,2688.792,--the offer that was ultimately awarded of three-quarters of 1 percent.
1982.81-1661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.792,2694.274,"--I suppose that is often true, but isn't it true that you did offer a lower rate, your rates to your others was lower, wasn't it?"
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2694.274,2697.039,"No, that was an industry-wide offer at that time, Justice--"
1982.81-1661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2697.039,2698.601,Didn't you settle with other people at a lower rate?
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2698.601,2701.928,--We settled with other people in litigations--
1982.81-1661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2701.928,2702.833,At lower rates.
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2702.833,2704.069,"--and... at lower rates, yes."
1982.81-1661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2704.069,2705.192,Before this offer was made?
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2705.192,2706.319,No.
1982.81-1661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2709.018,2709.91,I see.
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2709.91,2712.831,"There was an industry defense against this patent, Your Honor."
1982.81-1661,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2839.058,2840.528,"How, again, were your damages computed?"
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2843.885,2853.084,".75 of 1 percent of the sales value of the bumpers, which was $1,175,000,000."
1982.81-1661,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2853.084,2863.894,"And some of those bumpers were presumably sold in 1963 and at $100, and if you had gotten your judgment in 1963, you would have gotten 100 1963 dollars."
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2863.894,2864.581,That's correct.
1982.81-1661,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2864.581,2866.846,"But as it is, you are getting 100 1982 dollars."
1982.81-1661,1,41098,sidney_bender,,2866.846,2868.5,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1661,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2971.801,2974.378,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Frost?"
1982.81-1661,2,25330,george_e_frost,,2974.378,2976.893,"Yes, I do have a few things, Your Honor."
1982.81-1661,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3170.894,3171.877,"Thank you, gentlemen."
