2011.11-262,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.57,"We will hear argument next in case 11-262, Reichle v. Howards."
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,8.604,11.639,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-262,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,35.923,42.777,There is just a little bit of noise in the courtroom and I am having a little bit of difficulty hearing your very opening statement.
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,42.777,43.277,Sure.
2011.11-262,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,112.071,113.106,"Well, what was the--"
2011.11-262,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,113.106,113.873,I don't understand--
2011.11-262,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,113.873,114.956,--What was the probable cause?
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,118.927,130.385,"Justice Ginsburg, the Tenth Circuit found that the probable cause that underlied this opinion was a 1001 -- a 1001 violation, lying to a Federal agent."
2011.11-262,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,130.385,130.901,Explain that to me.
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,159.485,161.985,"Well, two points, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.11-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,183.851,203.514,"Do they have to give -- at least when you stop a car, the test is whether there was probable cause, not whether that was the reason that the officer stopped the car."
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,203.514,206.331,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2011.11-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.331,211.935,"There was a broken tail light, there existed probably cause, whether that was the basis on which he acted or not."
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,214.787,216.155,I don't think it is--
2011.11-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,216.155,217.372,--with respect to an arrest?
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,217.372,218.441,"--Yes, with respect to an arrest."
2011.11-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.241,221.476,"So long as they have good reason for an arrest, it doesn't matter."
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,221.476,222.759,--Absolutely.
2011.11-262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,223.676,240.187,"We have never held that in respect to a claim that the real reason the police arrested was retaliation against, for example, a picket sign having an unpopular point of view or a statement having an unpopular point of view."
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,253.614,255.214,--That's right.
2011.11-262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,255.214,255.814,All right.
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,306.147,318.104,"Justice Breyer, I think it has to do with the -- the determination in the -- in the Tenth Circuit and the fact that the -- the Tenth Circuit's decision to extend Devenpeck to these facts was not the subject of a cross-appeal."
2011.11-262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,322.674,323.524,I understand that.
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,378.428,381.13,"Well, let me answer -- answer both of those questions."
2011.11-262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,396.905,397.255,Yes.
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,397.255,397.689,Yes.
2011.11-262,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,397.689,400.024,"And of course, Hartman dealt with prosecutions."
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,434.43,439.732,"Well, I -- certainly, it's different, but the Devenpeck standard--"
2011.11-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.732,440.251,Is it different?
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,448.072,449.357,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
2011.11-262,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,449.357,451.257,"All the time, all the time."
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,458.296,470.771,"And Justice -- Justice Breyer, I think that the difficulty with your -- your hypothetical is, especially with regards to Secret Service agents, who perform, when they are engaging in their protective functions, they're essentially--"
2011.11-262,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,470.771,473.222,"Counsel, that -- that's exactly what Justice Breyer is saying."
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,504.759,505.194,--Sure.
2011.11-262,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,505.194,532.928,"So if that something about you they don't like is that you are wearing an antiwar armband, are we going to let that plaintiff not recover, because somehow we need to protect police officers so much, in the discretionary use of this vast power they have to arrest that we are going to permit them to trample the First Amendment, essentially?"
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,555.876,556.276,Okay.
2011.11-262,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,556.276,564.565,"If we don't extend Hartman, how do we in a principled way deal with the unique needs of the Secret Service?"
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,564.565,569.451,Let me -- let me briefly address the first half of the question and then I will address the second half.
2011.11-262,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,583.111,584.711,"If you are jaywalking, there is probable cause."
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,584.711,590.031,--But probable cause is the Fourth Amendment standard specified by the framers of the Constitution.
2011.11-262,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,590.031,609.111,"But -- but -- what does it have to do with violating the First Amendment, meaning if police officers have discretion and they would not otherwise arrest you except for their dislike of your speech, that's a violation of your right to free speech, isn't it?"
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,609.111,612.463,"Well, I'm -- I'm not sure that that is exactly the case."
2011.11-262,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,630.458,631.542,We can go to that question later.
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,631.542,631.892,Yes.
2011.11-262,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,796.066,798.267,You are not suggesting absolute immunity?
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,798.267,800.969,"No, we are suggesting a qualified immunity."
2011.11-262,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,800.969,802.869,But it's a different kind of qualified immunity?
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,802.869,806.207,It's certainly different from the Harlow type of qualified immunity.
2011.11-262,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,915.512,916.462,"--Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-262,0,41351,sean_r_gallagher,,916.462,917.079,All right.
2011.11-262,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,917.595,919.213,Mr. Srinivasan.
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,919.213,930.688,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-262,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,964.159,967.027,I assume you would include U.S. marshals?
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,967.027,968.11,Yes.
2011.11-262,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,968.11,968.593,F.B.I. agents?
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,969.843,970.412,That's correct.
2011.11-262,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1000.581,1011.472,Does your rule apply regardless of the degree of animus that the agent is alleged to have had as to the particular view being expressed?
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1011.472,1022.078,"--I think it would, Justice Kennedy, because we would have an across-the-board, no-probable-cause requirement of the kind that the Court applied in the retaliatory prosecution context in Hartman."
2011.11-262,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.331,1086.12,Why is there any difference if -- when ordinary policemen are policing an authorized demonstration--
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1086.12,1086.787,Yes.
2011.11-262,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.787,1089.222,--in front of this Court or anywhere for that matter?
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1103.649,1107.018,"That's correct, Justice Scalia, and that was going to be my next point."
2011.11-262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1136.87,1138.905,"Illegitimate -- look, you just used the word ""crowd control""."
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1143.357,1144.993,I--
2011.11-262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1144.993,1160.985,"Do you want the same rule of automatic, you know, immunity -- it's sort of automatic immunity -- when crowd control isn't at issue, where there is a history of persecution of an individual by a particular officer, da, da, da."
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1162.02,1162.87,--I think--
2011.11-262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1162.87,1166.556,"Did you want it absolutely across the board, or are you going to start making distinctions?"
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1166.556,1169.174,"--I -- I would not draw a distinction, Justice Breyer."
2011.11-262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1171.21,1173.01,"I mean, I agree with you about the crowd control."
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1178.947,1180.482,"--Well, I think--"
2011.11-262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1180.482,1181.232,Now how far--
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1201.395,1204.197,"--Right, and I can understand the basis for the nervousness."
2011.11-262,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1214.037,1225.611,Do you have a sense of how many of these First Amendment retaliatory claims in those jurisdictions that permit them -- I know they are more limited -- how many of these cases arise?
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1225.611,1226.361,We do.
2011.11-262,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1241.537,1243.604,And how many arrests are there a year?
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1243.604,1244.989,I don't know.
2011.11-262,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1244.989,1247.524,I'm sure it's in the millions.
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1247.524,1251.159,I'm sure there are scores and scores of arrests.
2011.11-262,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1325.358,1336.415,"Even though -- I think in Hartman, Justice Souter gave two specific reasons, neither of which apply in this context."
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1372.921,1378.825,"--Well, I -- with respect, Justice Ginsburg, I think this case is of a piece with Hartman in two relevant respects."
2011.11-262,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1413.515,1418.902,You might apply the same immunity for selective enforcement based on race?
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1418.902,1420.702,The same immunity?
2011.11-262,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1420.702,1421.354,Yes.
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1421.354,1421.871,No.
2011.11-262,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1441.852,1443.785,"Well, I'm -- I'm aware of the reservation in Whren."
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1448.506,1468.05,"--Well, I think part -- part of the reason is this, that with the First Amendment expressive activity can legitimately be taken into account, precisely because it can manifest a danger, whereas with race in the ordinary case I think the reason why we have these principles in the race context is it's ordinarily not a relevant consideration."
2011.11-262,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.867,1494.867,What -- what about for crowd control?
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1499.104,1511.412,"Well, I think it's the -- the nature, intensity and vehemence with which the First Amendment activity is being engaged in can inform an officer on whether the circumstances present the kind of danger that warrants a law enforcement response."
2011.11-262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1557.81,1573.237,How -- how many cases -- you might know this; you might have information on how many cases over 5 years or whatever period there actually have been against Federal protective officials of retaliatory First Amendment activity.
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1573.237,1574.253,--I -- I don't know.
2011.11-262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1574.253,1576.204,"It would be in the Department, wouldn't it?"
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1577.204,1581.675,"It's potentially there, but I -- I just don't have the answer at my disposal, Justice Breyer."
2011.11-262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1581.675,1586.294,"Do we know that this is not unique, the one before us?"
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1586.294,1591.281,"Well, these -- certainly, we know that these kinds of interactions arise with some frequency."
2011.11-262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1594.566,1602.689,"Well, when you looked up your research for this, did you find any other case in which anyone had ever asserted a First Amendment claim of retaliation for arrest--"
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1602.689,1603.939,--In--
2011.11-262,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1603.939,1607.041,--against a Federal protective official?
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1607.041,1611.278,"--Candidly, I didn't -- we didn't conduct a search with that object in mind."
2011.11-262,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1740.329,1743.531,"May I go back to the probable cause, the question I asked before."
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1766.98,1768.38,"It was not, Your Honor."
2011.11-262,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1778.704,1799.118,"But doesn't it matter that it's something that comes up only in court; it's not something that -- why -- why wasn't the natural one would expect probable cause to arrest because it was an assault or harassment, the actual charges that were made?"
2011.11-262,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1799.118,1806.522,--I don't know the reason that a -- I don't know the -- the precise contours of the harassment charges in State court that were made.
2011.11-262,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1835.741,1836.258,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,1841.528,1844.497,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-262,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1940.441,1942.393,"That's an assault, isn't it?"
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,1942.393,1942.927,--I'm sorry?
2011.11-262,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.927,1947.131,All it takes for an assault is -- is an unwanted touching.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,1947.131,1951.166,"Well, incidental contact is not an assault, and everyone under law--"
2011.11-262,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.166,1951.933,It's not incidental.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,1955.118,1964.426,"--Well, the problem is that the Vice President was on the mall having contact with numerous people, shaking their hands, letting them pat him on the back, telling him what a great job he's doing."
2011.11-262,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.426,1968.461,That's fine and he doubtless didn't consider those contacts hostile.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,1972.347,1973.949,And then--
2011.11-262,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.949,1977.567,"--I mean, just don't tell me that it's -- it's not a crime."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,1979.935,1983.404,"--Well, under Colorado law, he was charged with harassment, and--"
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1983.404,1987.339,"Well, what you've described is not when the person was arrested, right?"
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,1987.339,1987.958,--That's correct.
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1987.958,2000.516,"He was arrested later, when approached by the Secret Service agent, lied about whether he touched the Vice President; at that time, in a non-protected area, was carrying a bag, right?"
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2000.516,2000.949,Correct.
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2000.949,2001.816,And wandering around.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2023.612,2025.797,That's a multi-faceted question.
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2027.999,2034.67,The reason it's multi-faceted is because I'm trying to capture what might have been going through the Secret Service agent's mind at the time.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2034.67,2037.522,"Well, that is part of the point I have to make here, all right."
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2044.559,2048.913,"Well, what was going in a reasonable Secret Service's agent's mind at the time."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2048.913,2049.363,--Right.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2103.047,2111.67,They didn't say -- and also you left out that one of the agents overheard him say he was going to ask the Vice President how many babies he killed that day.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2111.67,2112.236,Right.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2112.236,2113.022,Okay.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2115.705,2116.224,Absolutely.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2116.224,2116.974,That's their job.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2119.676,2120.676,Absolutely.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2120.676,2129.532,"And if something happens to the President, nobody's going to say, oh, you know, what were you doing?"
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2132.5,2133.234,Correct.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2133.234,2134.352,We understand that.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2160.419,2161.153,Absolutely.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2161.153,2161.536,Okay.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2173.977,2175.846,Well that--
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2175.846,2179.048,And I -- I think -- I recognize that it's a problem.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2180.515,2187.403,"--Well, I think you hit on the solution as part of the problem you just expressed, and that is can they stop this individual."
2011.11-262,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2210.852,2218.09,And it wouldn't be a violation of the First Amendment if they only did that because they didn't like the ideas he was expressing?
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2218.09,2219.292,--They are allowed--
2011.11-262,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2219.292,2220.775,Wouldn't that be a violation of the First Amendment?
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2220.775,2227.861,"--They are allowed to take reasonable steps under Terry, under every conceivable case that this Court's ever decided--"
2011.11-262,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2227.861,2232.349,"Even though they're doing it for -- they do it for a racial reason, would that be okay?"
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2232.349,2232.715,--No.
2011.11-262,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2233.865,2234.517,Of course not.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2241.455,2241.905,--It would.
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2263.903,2279.246,"So what you have under your theory, a person should put on his car a bumper sticker that says ""I hate the police"" and every time they are pulled over they will have certainly a plausible case is you violated my First Amendment rights."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2294.673,2302.446,"Well, I think we can look at the -- as I said the arrows in the quiver of the court, to weed out those kinds of cases."
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2302.446,2302.896,"No, no."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2316.436,2322.692,"Well, I mean, litigious plaintiffs are a consistent problem across the board under many contexts."
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2344.689,2347.39,Is that a case that you could state.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2355.83,2356.33,Well--
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2356.33,2357.696,Does that go to trial?
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2357.696,2359.532,"--No, that doesn't necessarily go to trial."
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2361.317,2362.017,Why doesn't it go to trial?
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2369.84,2376.66,"--Well, I mean, these evidentiary questions have to be first of all supported in a pleading with heightened scrutiny under Iqbal."
2011.11-262,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.862,2381.898,--It's not a conclusion.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2399.692,2407.096,"Well, let me give the flip side of that and say if the police officer did stop him because of the bumper stick he should go to trial."
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2408.965,2417.487,"So the only way you could find out is you put in the evidence, here's the bumper sticker and you put the police officer on the stand and you say why did you do it."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2420.439,2428.427,--Theoretically every single person who has ever been arrested for any crime could raise a first amendment retaliation lawsuit.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2453.827,2468.754,"But in the case of the President, if what you are hearing, as you well know, that the combination of disparate political views and risk is unlike other situations."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2487.613,2488.399,--I'm ready.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2488.399,2492.35,"In Hartman, Justice Ginsburg and I dissent."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2492.35,2493.116,Yes.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2493.116,2496.035,And we referred to a D.C. circuit case.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2558.193,2560.311,"Well, let's take a look at the facts of this case."
2011.11-262,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2592.949,2593.416,Excuse me.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2619.116,2619.883,--The evidence?
2011.11-262,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2619.883,2626.087,"So I know collective knowledge is a theory in a lot of cases, but let's deal with the facts of this case."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2627.622,2632.776,"Well, there were discreet First Amendment episodes that occurred in the context of this case."
2011.11-262,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2698.551,2711.193,How does all of that prove your point of animus in light of the undisputed fact that he lied about touching the Vice President?
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2711.193,2711.893,"--Well, again--"
2011.11-262,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2711.893,2712.661,And that's the--
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2712.661,2722.501,"--lying to the Vice President is what we look at on a Fourth Amendment analysis, because what's in Reichle's actual mind under Devenpeck is irrelevant."
2011.11-262,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2752.436,2775.718,"--You do understand that this case is inviting the questions the Chief Justice asked, which, and which has -- Justice Breyer and some of us are concerned about, which is what your adversary has described as First Amendment voicing is going to be a part of many, many arrests."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2775.718,2777.17,--Absolutely.
2011.11-262,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2777.17,2784.091,"How do we draw a line outside of the one that you proposed by your adversaries, that probable cause is the line."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2784.091,2785.707,"Well, that line--"
2011.11-262,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2785.707,2794.263,"That doesn't enmesh the police in a constant barrage of claims that just because they angered a police officer, that's why they were arrested."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2794.263,2797.834,"--Well, first of all there has not been this constant barrage."
2011.11-262,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2812.175,2835.757,"Would you acknowledge that the Secret Service faces a different situation from ordinary police officers in conducting their daily activities, in that Secret Service agents may legitimately take into account First Amendment activity by someone who is in the vicinity of the President or the Vice President in assessing the degree of danger the person presents?"
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2835.757,2852.802,"--This may not help my case, but I will go further than that and I'll say any police officer has an absolute right to listen to what any protester is saying and consider what is being said in terms of assessing the level of threat that that protester poses."
2011.11-262,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2873.882,2894.796,"Again, I -- I don't understand why you -- why you say that they are immune from the charge of First Amendment retaliation for that, but not immune from the charge of First Amendment -- I mean if you say they are doing it on First Amendment grounds for the one, they are doing it on the First Amendment grounds for the other."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2895.33,2900.132,I'm not saying that they are immune on a Terry patdown if it is done in retaliation for free speech.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2911.34,2912.09,Okay.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2939.859,2940.225,Sure.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2940.225,2942.811,"--the same thing, and -- and I've got to do my job."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2948.965,2950.398,I agree with that.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2950.398,2952.6,And he also lied about whether he touched the President.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2952.6,2953.05,So--
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2953.05,2955.869,And he has also been talking about the President killing people--
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2955.869,2957.102,--First order of business--
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2957.102,2957.987,--killing babies and so forth.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2957.987,2960.623,--let's see if he's a threat.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2960.623,2961.039,All right.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2962.456,2967.177,He's supposed to -- if he -- if he has reasonable cause to believe Steve Howards is a threat--
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2967.177,2968.06,"Well, it isn't this situation -- but this situation, I--"
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2968.06,2968.477,--Okay.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2971.762,2973.747,--Nothing there.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2973.747,2974.564,--nothing there.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2974.564,2975.282,"He says, okay."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2975.282,2978.317,"Then they monitor him and they watch him, and -- and that's all."
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2978.317,2981.186,There's a lot of people in that place.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2981.186,2984.654,There is no probable cause to believe he has committed a crime at that point.
2011.11-262,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2984.654,2986.388,"Well, he lied."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2986.388,2987.923,But they didn't know that.
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2995.244,2998.379,"They didn't arrest him until after he lied, right?"
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,2998.379,3000.498,--But it was never in their minds.
2011.11-262,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3042.908,3046.962,When you say that that means that almost all of these cases have to go to trial--
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,3046.962,3047.779,"No, they don't."
2011.11-262,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3047.779,3048.429,--if front of a jury.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,3051.597,3058.001,"Because if, first of all, as I've said, Iqbal requires heightened pleading, not just conclusions."
2011.11-262,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3059.534,3062.218,I engaged in First Amendment -- I engaged in First Amendment activity.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,3062.218,3079.914,"We have a summary judgment standard, where -- and in fact in Butz, this Court held that a firm application of rules of civil procedure will always prevent frivolous claims and meritless litigation from occurring in situations exactly like this."
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3086.901,3092.388,"Well, summary judgment, that's -- you're already been in court a long time when you are talking about summary judgment."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,3092.388,3094.674,"--There is no easy way out of this, unfortunately."
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3096.209,3097.026,"Well, there is an easy way out of it."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,3099.828,3102.945,"--Well, that unfortunately is an easy way out of the First Amendment as well."
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3118.355,3130.18,One thing about your analysis that concerns me is that you seem to have a very black and white view of what is going on in the officer's mind: did you stop -- did you arrest him because of retaliation or was it legitimate security?
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,3153.878,3166.353,"--Well, what I say about that is that -- and again, I know this is not an answer that you are probably going to like, because this means a trial is involved, but this is what juries do on a daily basis throughout this country, in every criminal case."
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3199.574,3231.046,"One reason that I in fact don't like the answer is be -- because what the agent is now going to have to factor, in addition to the hostility of the -- the views, the touching of the Vice President, the lying about it, the wandering around with the bag -- is in the back of his mind -- you know, if I'm wrong, I may be held personally liable in damages for taking some action that some jury somewhere is going to say is based on retaliation rather than my obligation to protect the Vice President."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,3231.046,3234.997,"--Well, I mean, theoretically yes, that -- that could be a problem."
2011.11-262,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3279.209,3288.048,Which -- is there a record of retaliatory arrests by Secret Service agents against people who say things that are critical of the President and the Vice President?
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,3288.048,3292.184,--The -- the only way I know to look for that is on Westlaw or LEXIS.
2011.11-262,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3335.363,3336.713,"Well, we've lost a couple of Presidents."
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,3338.498,3339.181,"Well, they're doing the best they can."
2011.11-262,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3367.417,3369.15,But it's ambivalent.
2011.11-262,2,21124,david_lane,,3383.944,3387.748,"You know, that would be a fact to be considered by the jury."
2011.11-262,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3557.791,3558.375,"Thank you, counsel."
