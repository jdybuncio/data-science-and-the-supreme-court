1978.77-1511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.856,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 1511, Califano against Elliot."
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,18.037,21.979,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,187.423,190.766,"What question, specifically, is not presented?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,190.766,197.873,The question of the adequacy of the new notice forms that the Secretary has developed in response to the Court of Appeals' decision.
1978.77-1511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,197.873,198.608,Right.
1978.77-1511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,198.608,202.448,Whether those forms comply with the Court of Appeals' decision.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,202.448,204.121,Exactly.
1978.77-1511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,204.121,205.982,Is a matter for the Court of--
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,205.982,206.22,That's right.
1978.77-1511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,206.22,210.909,-- appeals are now being controverted in the Court of Appeals.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,210.909,212.855,Right.
1978.77-1511,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,332.054,335.164,Where are you before this is set out with in this?
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,335.164,350.195,They are set out in the appendix to the certiorari petition at pages 155 (a) and 156 (a).
1978.77-1511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,368.692,372.472,"What do you take to mean by that, “without fault?”"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,388.111,405.493,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that the “without fault” language is described in the-- or is defined, I should say, in the Secretary's regulations in 20 CFR 404.507, I believe."
1978.77-1511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,405.493,405.832,How does what--
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,405.832,406.601,And there --
1978.77-1511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,406.601,407.946,-- people matter?
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,407.946,418.439,"And there, the Secretary states that the critical consideration is whether the beneficiary should have known that he was receiving or had received an overpayment."
1978.77-1511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,443.29,447.742,"But that's merely an instruction-- an internal instruction, isn't it?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,447.742,447.922,Well--
1978.77-1511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,447.922,448.939,The $10-a month.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,448.939,449.773,Excuse me?
1978.77-1511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,449.773,453.864,The $10-limit merely binds the staff of the Social Security.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,453.864,455.67,"Yes, that's included in the Claims Manual."
1978.77-1511,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,464.838,469.154,Whose the -- what is the practice as to the burden?
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,481.652,482.755,That's right.
1978.77-1511,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,482.755,489.921,"And that who -- what is the procedure for determining, if you or do you know?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,489.921,490.627,Yes.
1978.77-1511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,522.816,533.219,"And then, I suppose there is-- whichever way the Secret -- if the Secretary decides on recoupment, there's review, I take it."
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,533.219,533.725,"Oh, definitely."
1978.77-1511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,535.758,544.924,"What if the reviewing Court decided that the evidence was absolutely equally balanced, who wins?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,544.924,546.971,"Well, I -- I mean, I don't know because I don't know what the cases have held but I think --"
1978.77-1511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,546.971,550.652,That's why I asked you -- that's why i asked you a while ago what -- who's got the burden.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,550.652,555.571,"I think, in a closed case like that, the Secretary would waive recovery."
1978.77-1511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,555.571,560.318,"So, he then undertakes to prove fault."
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,560.318,568.635,"Before the administrative review, I suppose that the Secretary would have to show that the beneficiary should have known --"
1978.77-1511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,568.635,579.483,"In -- in deciding whether to insist on recoupment, the Secretary then assumes that at whatever procedures he uses must prove fault."
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,581.808,582.157,That's right.
1978.77-1511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,597.812,611.148,"So that, if the person from whom recoupment might be sought, if he's completely silent, the Secretary must still come forward with proof of fault."
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,612.587,613.869,"No, that's not so."
1978.77-1511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.696,625.103,Right.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,625.103,634.861,"If the person does not suggest that he was not at fault, I think the Secretary is justified in proceeding with recovery."
1978.77-1511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,634.861,649.697,"If the check normally was $152 and the recipient gets a check for $1,152 because the computer has stripped its gears or something, that would be a clear case, wouldn't it, that he was at fault in accepting it?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,649.697,656.697,"That's precisely the case and, as a matter of fact, there are a substantial number of cases that are exactly like that."
1978.77-1511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,709.41,714.306,"Well, there are at least two different kinds of errors that can be made, are there not, at least two?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,721.954,722.436,That's right.
1978.77-1511,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,725.839,738.047,"Mr. Buscemi, do I correctly understand that the mere fact that the beneficiary proves that he or she was without fault is not enough to establish the right to retain the money?"
1978.77-1511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,738.047,738.971,That's absolutely right.
1978.77-1511,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,738.971,740.835,I just want to be sure.
1978.77-1511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,740.835,751.45,The beneficiary must also -- the Secretary must also determine that recovery would defeat the purpose of the Social Security Insurance Program or would be against equity in good conscience.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,759.466,782.329,"So that even if there is no financial hardship if the regulations provide, 20 CFR 404.509, that if the beneficiary has relied to his detriment on an overpayment which he was without fault in receiving, then there's no recovery even if it could be recovered without any -- imposing any financial hardship."
1978.77-1511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,782.329,803.845,"Does this record show or do we have to rely, if we need it on Social Security, on HEW reports as to how much a year in each fiscal year is overpaid for one reason or another and how much is -- that is, how much is the area of recoupment?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,803.845,807.666,"Well, the record does show the number of overpayments made in a year."
1978.77-1511,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,836.83,843.678,"When you use the 1.25 million, does that mean that many persons or that many checks?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,843.678,850.725,"That's a little bit unclear, but I think that means that many persons."
1978.77-1511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,926.473,931.748,"Eldridge involved primarily a medical expert opinion evidence, didn't it?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,931.748,932.257,That's right.
1978.77-1511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,946.669,947.98,Expert medical opinion.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,947.98,957.575,"That's right, but the Court did note in Eldridge that credibility of the claimant might well be relevant in the ultimate disability assessment."
1978.77-1511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,970.245,977.747,"Mr. Buscemi, I realize it's difficult when you're peppered with questions from nine people to know exactly what your oral argument will cover."
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,988.0,990.477,"Well, I did plan to say something about that."
1978.77-1511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,992.822,994.039,Use your own judgment.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,996.317,1016.632,"Well, just to be very brief about it, the argument that the Secretary has made in his brief is that this Court in the Salfi case held that 205 (h) -- Section 205 (h) of the Social Security Act precludes other basis of District Court jurisdiction and limits District Court jurisdiction to that provided in Section 205 (g) of the Act."
1978.77-1511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1027.584,1042.944,"I would not prevent us from reaching, in the government's view, the constitutional questions raised by a couple of the named parties, but it would prevent na -- kind of a nationwide class action designated in the Western District of Washington."
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1042.944,1044.935,That is our view of the matter.
1978.77-1511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1072.245,1090.159,"Your brief does not ar -- deal or at least it does -- it dealt very briefly with Section 204, the statutory issue inherent in this case, and neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals treated it."
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1099.732,1101.565,"Yes, I think the answer is quite clear."
1978.77-1511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1106.717,1112.381,"And that doesn't give the Court a license -- any Court a license to ignore the statutory issue though, does it?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1112.381,1132.117,"Well, that's true, Mr. Chief Justice, but I do think that the Court's view of the case is inevitably colored by the briefs that are filed by the parties, and I think that where the claim of the respondents was almost exclusively addressed to the constitutional point, it's not surprising that the Court viewed the case in that light."
1978.77-1511,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1284.093,1293.345,"Well, Mr. Buscemi, isn't it true that almost by hypothesis, one who request a waiver does so on the basis of need, claim of need at least?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1293.345,1295.328,"Well, not necessarily, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1978.77-1511,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1310.617,1316.476,Would the Secretary let that person keep it he had $1 million in the bank?
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1316.476,1320.827,"Well, that's a -- the regulations apparently say that he would."
1978.77-1511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1461.298,1465.179,Could it be that the computers are becoming more accurate?
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1465.179,1466.259,"Well, we hope so."
1978.77-1511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1466.259,1468.678,"Well, I mean, that could be one reason for this."
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1468.678,1469.776,That's right.
1978.77-1511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1469.776,1474.049,"So, what good is it to us, those figures?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1474.049,1493.507,"Well, I think the figures are relevant because they do indicate that the evidentiary hearing sought by respondents is not required in order to make sure that payments are made to those people who deserve them and that overpayments are only recovered from those people who can-- who are supposed to pay them back."
1978.77-1511,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.507,1502.035,"Mr. Buscemi, on those figures, are you giving us figures under the revised regulations or are those that were in effect before the litigation began?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1502.035,1511.43,"Well, the 40,000-figure is a figure that comes from years more recent than those covered by those figures before the District Court."
1978.77-1511,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.868,1574.745,"A related question, I suppose, what do you perceive the issue to be, the constitutionality of the regulations before they were amended or the constitutionality of the regulations after the amendment which would mean, I guess, that we don't have the benefit of the views of the lower Courts on the latter question?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1577.818,1590.289,"Well, I think that the question is the constitutionality of the regulations before they were amended, but the only thing that's been amended is the Claims Manual which deals with the partial adjustment system."
1978.77-1511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1615.305,1618.913,That's quite a difference in terms of the impact on the beneficiaries.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1622.067,1633.473,"That's true, but in practical effect, under the partial adjustment system that was in effect before the Courts below, the Secretary as a general rule did grant partial adjustments that were requested."
1978.77-1511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1646.628,1658.096,"Well, if the issue is the regulations that are no longer in effect, why should we really decide that, if the government no longer has an interest in defending those regulations if it's got an amended regulation in effect now?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1658.096,1666.83,The issue is whether the respondents are entitled to an oral hearing before recoupment begins.
1978.77-1511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1670.648,1675.109,On the waiver issue or on the overpayment issue or on both.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1677.826,1678.416,"Yes, the Court of Appeals for the --"
1978.77-1511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1678.416,1691.053,"And, according to at least one amicus brief here, the -- it's the understanding of that amicus that the respondents aren't even -- aren't defending the Court of Appeals decision on the overpayment issue."
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1691.053,1692.448,"Well, that's also a little bit unclear."
1978.77-1511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1710.738,1713.512,"Well, they can tell us the answer."
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1721.584,1721.885,Exactly.
1978.77-1511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1721.885,1722.629,Involved in it.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1722.629,1723.888,That's right.
1978.77-1511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1723.888,1732.016,"And the response of the Secretary was to say that that's an unrealistic dichotomy and, therefore, is --"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1732.016,1732.439,It's just been providing hearings --
1978.77-1511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1732.439,1734.026,"For the time being, providing hearings for everybody."
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1734.026,1736.589,"In all cases, that's right."
1978.77-1511,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1736.589,1737.464,Can I ask you one other question.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1745.422,1747.414,"Yes, there is no dispute about that in the case."
1978.77-1511,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1747.414,1756.669,"Would you explain to me, is it -- in the Government's view, will there be a greater number of hearings if they come before the reduction takes effect and if it's postponed?"
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1756.669,1769.954,"Well, what's been happening is that there have been personal conferences set up before the recoupment begins, and then the full LAJ hearing has been kept at the time after the beginning of a hearing."
1978.77-1511,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1779.097,1779.59,I'm just wondering.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1790.394,1800.245,"Well, the full LAJ hearing apparently does entail more expense and more delay than the personal conference procedure that's now being used."
1978.77-1511,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1800.245,1804.35,Does it entail more expense if it comes later instead of earlier?
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1806.456,1816.031,"Well, it entails more expense in the sense that the -- it will probably mean that there will be a longer period of time before recoupment begins because it's more difficult."
1978.77-1511,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1828.644,1830.904,But didn't you tell us -- I'm just -- maybe I've got this confused.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1839.161,1843.165,Until there is a decision on the basis of the written submissions.
1978.77-1511,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1843.165,1844.13,I see -- I see.
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1846.851,1847.404,That's right.
1978.77-1511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1861.391,1870.207,And you can comply with the Court of Appeals opinion without extending the full LAJ hearing?
1978.77-1511,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1870.207,1871.716,"Yes, Mr. Justice White."
1978.77-1511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1889.376,1892.652,Very well.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,1897.18,1901.17,"Mr. Chief Justice, may the Court please."
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1947.876,1955.563,"You -- just before you do, you can find the procedures to the right to waiver under the statute --"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,1955.563,1955.982,"Yes, Mr. Justice --"
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1955.982,1957.721,But just to the fact of overpayment.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,1980.597,1982.02,That's correct.
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1982.02,1983.191,We like to understanding?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,1983.191,1983.779,That's correct.
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1992.976,1994.313,Ever -- ever?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,1994.313,1995.877,That's correct.
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1995.877,1998.059,"And -- so, this involves only --"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,1998.059,1998.493,In this case --
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1998.493,2004.486,In the area on the question of whether or not the recoupment should be waived under the statute 404 (b).
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2004.486,2015.896,"It involves only the issues which are the highly subjective credibility issues under the Secretary's own regulations, under his Claims Manual, and all -- and the other instructions of waiver."
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2015.896,2018.308,Particularly -- going exclusively to waiver.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2018.308,2018.655,Only to waiver.
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2018.655,2019.042,Only?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2019.042,2019.287,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2019.287,2022.561,"Yes, thank you."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2022.561,2044.876,"The system for two-and-a half years, in answer to Mr. Justice Stevens' question, has been one which allows three choices: (a) one of written submissions, which exis -- which was the only choice under the earlier system, and for the very small number of recipients who are before you today for whom that is a meaningful and effective means of asserting the waiver question, that's still retained."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.02,2087.476,Perhaps you could help me.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2104.323,2104.779,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2104.779,2106.767,Is the first issue fault?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2106.767,2107.886,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2140.502,2148.343,"But must -- in order to deny recoupment, must the Secretary conclude that the person is without fault?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2148.343,2150.207,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2150.207,2174.445,"And, if the person asking for a waiver presents no evidence whatsoever, he just said “I was without fault,” must the Secretary undertake to prove that he was at fault, or what?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2174.445,2177.563,"That is what Congress has said, Your Honor, under 204 (b)."
1978.77-1511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.854,2217.08,"But, if there is fault, he's absolutely barred from -- he must recoup then."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2217.08,2217.504,That's correct.
1978.77-1511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2217.504,2218.207,If there is fault.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2218.207,2219.863,That's correct.
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2229.086,2231.649,Could you give me an example.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2232.702,2237.692,"A very good example, Your Honor, would be one of the named respondents, Mrs. Yamasaki."
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2276.308,2284.922,What excuse could be offered for taking $200 more than the entitlement?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2284.922,2298.702,"Well, there are many situations, Your Honor, where the Social Security System issues checks, supplemental checks, or true active checks, adjustment checks in many situations where they can be appropriate to keep the money."
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2300.185,2314.425,"On that, do you mean if there's-- if the check is -- if the payment is $200 more than the recipient is entitled to, do you suggest there is any excuse for keeping, and any justification for keeping it?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2314.425,2317.146,"Your Honor, what I'm saying is Congress has made that choice."
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2317.146,2317.31,Well --
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2317.31,2325.801,Congress has said they are going to -- they are vested with this money until the Secretary comes forward and then shows these grounds under 204 (b) to take it away.
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2332.909,2344.077,"Well, do you suggest that either of not Courts below have made a determination or exhibited any great interest in 204 (b)?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2344.077,2349.331,"Well, they have to the extent that 204 (b) is a crucial element in weighing a private interest in this case."
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2362.709,2374.896,"If we accept the figure and for the moment, for hypothetical purposes at least, let's accept it that there's $600 million a year being paid out that should not be paid out."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2387.757,2404.507,"Congress said, Your Honor, in 1939 when it enacted this statute and 1967 when it affirmed it again, that persons who are without fault and against whom recovery calls a hardship will be able to keep the money."
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2426.621,2438.071,"Are you suggesting then, tangentially at least, that Congress contemplated that they would waive $600 million if that is the figure or any such figure?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2438.071,2438.405,Congress --
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2438.405,2440.274,Is that on any grounds?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2440.274,2446.084,"Congress was clearly saying, because they used the words “shall be no recovery,” Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2446.084,2449.277,"To the tune of $600 million, you press it that far?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2449.277,2451.298,"That's what Congress said, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2458.741,2460.626,"So, this is purely hypothetical."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2462.439,2462.691,That's the point.
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2462.691,2470.481,"We may or may not be able to notice it judicially, depending on what the records of the department show."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2470.481,2472.388,"We don't know what the exact figure is, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2492.484,2498.895,Is there any other governmental provision that allowed people to keep money that didn't belong to them?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2498.895,2499.97,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2506.093,2513.884,"Give me one statute that says that where you get money that you're not entitled to, you shall keep."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2513.884,2524.697,"Well, the Civil Rights retire -- Civil Right -- Civil Service retirement statute, the railway retirements statute, and other similar retirement type statutes, also with the right for waiver provisions identical to the --"
1978.77-1511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2524.697,2527.559,"Of waiver but, I mean, it's not automatic."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2527.559,2527.984,"No, sir."
1978.77-1511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2528.507,2529.637,I know it's not.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2533.08,2533.316,"No, it's the same --"
1978.77-1511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2533.316,2537.631,And I tried one time to get a client some money and failed.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2540.767,2542.7,"Well, they are not automatic, Your Honors."
1978.77-1511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2545.497,2548.875,"Well, this language, is that in any of the statute?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2548.875,2560.578,"The waiver language, to the extent that it protects a limited group of people under-- as it did under 204, is applicable or app -- exists in other retirements statutes, yes, sir."
1978.77-1511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2560.578,2561.856,Name one.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2561.856,2568.032,The Civil Service retirement statute and the railroad retirement statute are two examples I can think of.
1978.77-1511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2568.032,2572.407,"The railroad retirement statute says if you're overpaid, you keep it?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2572.407,2575.585,If you are without fault and you are in need.
1978.77-1511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2575.585,2578.959,All without fault?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2583.071,2594.356,"No, Your Honor, what that means is that you did not know or could not -- did not know that the retention of the or acceptance of the overpayment was incorrect or erroneous."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2594.356,2599.554,This would depend to a certain amount on the -- to a certain established amount of the overpayment.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2612.925,2616.842,"Well, some of those factual situations do arise, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2641.888,2655.014,"But if you're used to getting a check for, say, $200 a month and you -- suppose you get a check for $2,200 a m -- the following month, would that support a finding of fault under the regulation?"
1978.77-1511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2655.014,2659.109,I think that would be one element to be considered at a personal confrontation.
1978.77-1511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2694.316,2695.837,But it doesn't say without knowledge.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2711.438,2724.503,"That has generally been our position, Your Honor, and we believe that the certain statute has made that determination because of using the language “fault,” but all I'm saying is that one factor to be considered, we think it should be given very little, if no weight."
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2724.503,2733.834,"If the overpayment is not the fault of the beneficiary, then it's not, whether or not he knew it was an overpayment."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2733.834,2735.219,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2749.139,2749.785,"Enough, enough."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2754.6,2756.107,That's correct.
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2756.107,2761.358,"If an overpayment is a computer error or a miscalculation on the part of the agency, it's not his fault at all."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2761.358,2766.915,And most of the recipients before you today have exactly that situation.
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2766.915,2788.36,"Do you suggest that under -- that there are any circumstances, and if so suggest what the circumstances would be, in which a $200 recipient received $2,200 and recoupment should not be automatic, virtually automatic?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2804.284,2812.487,"If to assessing the credibility of that individual, it is clear that individual was not at fault in generating or accepting that overpayment."
1978.77-1511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2812.487,2814.779,But fault is only one of the criteria.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2814.779,2815.396,Its' the first --
1978.77-1511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2815.396,2827.506,"If has to be without fault and the recoupment must be -- well, it must defeat the purpose of this subchapter or would be against equity in good conscience even if he's faultless."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2827.506,2827.87,That's correct.
1978.77-1511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2827.87,2828.909,He has to satisfy that criteria.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2828.909,2829.669,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2850.812,2852.271,"But, then let me try to apply that."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2888.56,2892.17,"Your Honor, are you presuming in your hypothetical that he is at fault and you're directing it --"
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2892.17,2895.09,Just -- just the facts I've suggested in the hypothetical.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2895.09,2895.91,"Well, in that situation --"
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2895.91,2897.894,"He gambled away the $2,000."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2897.894,2899.848,"I think gambling is actually irrelevant, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2931.194,2938.521,"But if he squandered them away and has no other assets, you say then, under this statute, it would be inequitable."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2946.189,2954.125,"As long as if he has -- if he does not have any other resources or assets, the fact that he has or doesn't have the money, no matter how that occurred is irrelevant, yes, sir."
1978.77-1511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2954.125,2961.517,"Mr. Levin, could you help me with-- I'm trying to find out in my own mind what the constitutional issue is in this case."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2981.76,2982.955,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2982.955,2983.509,It is?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2983.509,2983.66,Absolutely.
1978.77-1511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2983.66,2989.077,"Now, do you understand that the government is asking to have that oral hearing dispensed with?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2989.077,2990.031,Absolutely.
1978.77-1511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2990.031,2991.714,They don't want even the informal hearing.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2991.714,2992.179,That's correct.
1978.77-1511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2992.179,2992.731,I see.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,2992.731,2993.764,That's correct.
1978.77-1511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3012.898,3016.031,If they want a right to change the regulations back to the way they use to be.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3016.031,3017.813,"Perhaps, Your Honor, we don't know."
1978.77-1511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3017.813,3020.745,"Other than that, there's really no issue before us, isn't that right?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3020.745,3021.217,"Well, the --"
1978.77-1511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3021.217,3025.837,"If they said they were satisfied to continue to provide the oral hearing, there will be no dispute."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3025.837,3026.924,"That's right, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3026.924,3030.529,"Well, they wouldn't have petitioned for certiorari, I presume."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3030.529,3032.273,"I don't know why they petitioned for certiorari, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3032.273,3036.118,"Well, I presume because they just answered the Ninth Circuit's opinion."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3036.118,3037.765,I assume so.
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3037.765,3048.467,What -- suppose the named plaintiffs here -- suppose we agree with you to the extent of the interests of the named plaintiffs.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3056.223,3069.738,"The named plaintiffs, Your Honor, in the Elliot proceeding have had their recoupments or action taken regarding their recoupment or their hearings halted pending the disposition of this litigation."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3077.911,3079.841,Then there will be a hearing before there's a recoupment.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3079.841,3081.665,"That's correct, Your Honor, there must be."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3081.665,3087.524,"Well, I thought you said there'd been recoupment hearings going on for two-and-a half years."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3087.524,3094.74,"As to other members of the class asking for -- ironically, not as to most of the named plaintiffs."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3094.74,3102.211,"And suppose we agree with you, what else is involved in the case?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3102.211,3102.691,"Well, from our point --"
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3102.691,3107.522,"With respect to the named plaintiffs, what else do you need besides that?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3107.522,3109.937,"That's the extent of our relief, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3110.841,3112.459,What about the class problem?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3112.459,3118.357,"Well, Your Honor, we believe that the Secretary has raised the jurist -- the class problem as a jurisdictional problem."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3129.276,3141.528,"Well, do you think the remedy the Court of Appeals ordered would be justified without finding that a class had been properly certified?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3141.528,3143.788,"Your Honor, this Court could."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3143.788,3155.838,Could you say the injunction declaring the statute unconstitutional and enjoining it could be issued in behalf of just two named plaintiffs?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3155.838,3159.08,"I think it could, Your Honor, normally."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3189.389,3193.147,But this is by no means peculiar to the Secretary of HEW.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3213.671,3219.508,"Your Honor, first of all, there are two Courts of Appeals who ruled consistently here, the Third Circuit in Mattern versus Califano, and the Ninth Circuit."
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3219.508,3220.835,That's out of 11.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3220.835,3223.819,And there's only two Courts in which the issue has been presented.
1978.77-1511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3281.633,3291.949,It isn't -- why isn't the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue's program of seeking conflicts treat the taxpayers involved the same way?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3291.949,3293.478,"I have no knowledge of that, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3295.776,3300.951,"Incidentally, is respondent Elliot out of the case?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3300.951,3301.984,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3301.984,3303.88,Why -- are you going to substitute somebody for him?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3303.88,3308.006,"You mean, we will take appropriate action to that Your Honor, yes."
1978.77-1511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3309.328,3311.256,You have not prosecuted?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3311.256,3314.111,"No, sir."
1978.77-1511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3382.987,3387.785,"Well, do you think, Mr. Levin, that the changes are -- change the issues in this case?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3387.785,3394.595,"They certainly not provide the pre-recoupment opportunity to be heard, not the evidentiary hearing but the opportunity to be heard as required by the Court of Appeals."
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3394.595,3395.639,And that is the issue.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3395.639,3396.375,That is the issue.
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3396.375,3397.785,And that remains the same issue even though --
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3397.785,3398.072,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3398.072,3398.877,"even if it changes, doesn't it?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3398.877,3399.349,That's correct.
1978.77-1511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3454.159,3469.247,"What's -- if you say that everybody but the named plaintiffs have been getting recoupment hearings in accordance with the decision of the Court of Appeals for two-and-a half years, what's left of the class?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3469.247,3473.758,"Well, people who come forward on an ongoing basis, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3475.171,3477.112,This is a constantly revolving class.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3477.112,3483.675,"That's -- yes, sir, it is because the Secretary issues these recoupment notices daily."
1978.77-1511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3546.129,3562.083,"If we agreed with you and said, on behalf of the named plaintiffs, the named plaintiffs were entitled to a declaratory judgment that whatever that's attacked here was unconstitutional."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3563.68,3567.397,"Your Honor, again, I go back to my answer to a question of Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-1511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3582.906,3589.082,"Like the -- sort of a general, it may or may not be involved in this case."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3596.226,3604.436,"I assume the Secretary would abide by the decision of this Court and, if he did that, we would not need anything further, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3604.436,3612.382,"So ten million or more who received checks every year, several millions perhaps, culminate some of the check act."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3619.648,3621.512,"We have no idea, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3626.43,3630.429,Did you get a copy of the petitioner's reply brief?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3630.429,3631.469,"Yes, we did, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3631.469,3633.42,It is referred to in oral arguments this morning.
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3637.738,3640.657,"Yes, Your Honor, we got it at the last minute also."
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3644.374,3645.133,It goes to the statutory --
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3645.133,3646.124,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3655.766,3657.809,Also the Court of Appeals?
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3657.809,3666.709,"The Court of Appeals recognized it, Your Honor, for the importance of balancing the private interest in this case, recognizing that it was a congressional mandate that there shall be no recoupments only in these certain limited situations."
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3666.709,3672.63,"Yes, the Court of Appeals ignored the claim that the statute itself requires a prior hearing."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3672.63,3673.487,Well --
1978.77-1511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3673.487,3676.569,"And, instead, said the constitution requires one."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3676.569,3677.324,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3704.095,3707.994,"Well, if we affirmed on the statute, would that change your relief?"
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3707.994,3710.029,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1978.77-1511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3710.029,3714.416,"So, I suppose, you could say you're entitled to urge the statutory ground now, here."
1978.77-1511,1,41655,stanley_e_levin,,3714.416,3717.551,"Well, that's what we're doing, Your Honor, and we briefed it thoroughly."
1978.77-1511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3729.158,3729.592,Very well.
