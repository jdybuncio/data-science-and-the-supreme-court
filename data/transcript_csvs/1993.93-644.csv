1993.93-644,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.838,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 93-644, Honda Motor Company v. Karl Oberg."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,10.098,12.409,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-644,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,54.988,57.509,These are State court decisions you're referring to?
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,57.509,58.781,These are State court decisions.
1993.93-644,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,58.781,65.746,What standard is it that those courts use in assessing punitive damages?
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,65.746,69.046,"Well, there's a lot of debate about what the standard... you mean in determining whether a--"
1993.93-644,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,69.046,69.487,Yes.
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,69.487,70.669,--punitive verdict is excessive?
1993.93-644,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,98.266,101.578,"Well, what were the standards employed in the cases you were reciting?"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,101.578,108.042,"--Well, I'm not certain what the standards were, but I don't think it matters for the purposes of this Court's decision."
1993.93-644,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,118.26,126.164,"Well, what standard are you asserting is constitutionally mandated, Mr. Frey?"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,126.164,146.978,"Well, I think it's very important in understanding this question to distinguish between the procedural due process requirement... that is, what procedures must be provided, which is what we're talking about this morning, and the substantive law of damages, which is to say, what law determines how much is an acceptable range of damages on a given set of facts?"
1993.93-644,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,159.997,167.992,"Mr. Frey, would it be sufficient for a State to say, as long as the award is not the product of passion or prejudice, it is not excessive?"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,167.992,170.894,I doubt that.
1993.93-644,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.509,229.514,"The thing about punitive damages review, it seems to me, is that if you're reviewing a verdict for actual damages and talk about passion or prejudice or the weight of it, you've got some fairly concrete things to hang on to... the amount of the medicals, the amount of... cost of maintaining someone who's disabled... but the punitive damage is much, much harder to pin down."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,229.514,248.486,"Well, it may be much harder to pin down, and that suggests that there is a difference between liquidated kinds of damages inquiry and the kind of unliquidated inquiry where you're asking how much pain and suffering the plaintiff experienced as a result of his or her injury, or how much is an appropriate amount of punishment."
1993.93-644,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,287.903,292.484,"Mr. Frey, what are the, then... you said you're not talking about substantive limits today."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,322.696,330.072,"Okay, well, let me see if I can take those in order, and forgive me if I forget some of them, but to start out, I do want to complete the answer to Justice Stevens."
1993.93-644,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,345.501,356.739,"How could we ever tell that if it comports with the, sort of the ultimate substantive standard of bearing at least a reasonable relationship to the facts of the case?"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,356.739,357.468,You would never have to tell that.
1993.93-644,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,357.468,358.089,Pardon me?
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,358.089,359.451,You would never have to tell that.
1993.93-644,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,407.865,419.623,"Well, then, with respect to punitive damages, why isn't any verdict acceptable if it bears the... if it can be said to bear a reasonable relationship to those facts in evidence which would indicate that punitive damages were appropriate?"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,419.623,422.724,Because State law may impose greater constraints than that on punitive damages.
1993.93-644,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,427.978,429.5,"Well, but your argument... then, maybe I'm missing something."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,434.321,437.764,Whatever State law provides--
1993.93-644,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,437.764,440.716,"And State law doesn't provide anything, apparently, for you here."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,440.716,441.838,"--No, no, no."
1993.93-644,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,461.009,466.974,"Your point would be applicable in a compensatory damages review, too?"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,466.974,467.805,Absolutely.
1993.93-644,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.805,477.09,"You contend that that constitutional provision prevents the Oregon courts from even applying passion and prejudice review, don't you--"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,477.09,479.341,We... that--
1993.93-644,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,479.341,489.767,"--and although you don't assert that passion or prejudice review will suffice for purposes of constitutional sufficiency, you deny that there was even passion or prejudice--"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,489.767,490.358,--That's correct.
1993.93-644,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.358,490.938,"--review here, don't you?"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,490.938,491.399,That is correct.
1993.93-644,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,491.399,500.355,"But you don't deny, I take it, that there was at least the possibility of review for that... we'll say that ultimate substantive threshold--"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,500.355,502.378,There is no possibility--
1993.93-644,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,502.378,504.328,--which is required by the Supremacy Clause.
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,504.328,509.223,"--No, I don't... this gets into... this is not the main point in our argument."
1993.93-644,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,521.091,530.557,"I take it, however, that Oregon has not denied you, at least in terms, any substantive... any review under a substantive Federal standard that you claim is applicable."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,530.557,538.485,"--We believe the Oregon courts are without jurisdiction under State law to conduct such review, and we believe we were deprived of that review."
1993.93-644,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,538.485,551.983,"Have they ever come out and said, there is a Federal standard constitutionally applicable to us, but our constitution forbids us to entertain an appeal on that ground?"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,551.983,560.328,"They haven't come out and said it, but they have come out and said that verdicts that are excessive, they lack the jurisdiction, the power, to set aside."
1993.93-644,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,565.402,572.165,Can you tell us what is this constitutionally minimal procedure?
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,580.541,595.042,"The process that we say... well, let's start off with what we get, which is, when a verdict is returned, we get no judge to examine whether the verdict conforms with the substantive law that regulates the size of verdicts."
1993.93-644,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,602.175,610.31,"But you do get a review for no evidence, and you get a review if the judge thinks that the instructions were not adequate."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,610.31,616.405,"--All right, I have two... we get a review for no evidence, which means a review for liability."
1993.93-644,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,673.904,686.723,"Suppose the judge looks at the amount of the prayer in the complaint before the issue is submitted to the jury, and concludes that on this evidence, that maximum amount would be a sustainable award."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,692.165,695.288,I guess I have two things to say about that.
1993.93-644,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,736.575,739.357,"I wonder, would it be constitutionally sufficient?"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,739.357,757.829,"I think it would depend on the rest of the system, but I suppose if the judge actually sat down... well, it depends on the case, I think is the answer, because the judge can't know in advance what the jury's findings are going to be."
1993.93-644,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,768.247,769.777,"But this verdict was a general verdict, wasn't it?"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,776.462,776.792,--Right.
1993.93-644,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,779.565,783.425,"I'm curious to know how far your theory extends, Mr. Frey."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,798.316,822.281,"Well, that raises an interesting question, because we're dealing with an affirmative defense, and that may be different from the elements of the case, but I think I have... if the State substantive law is that you are not liable to pay damages to a plaintiff who was contributorily negligent, I have difficulty with the proposition that a fair system provides no judicial review."
1993.93-644,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,842.697,852.541,"Mr. Frey, why should the constitutionally mandated review be any more than is required in a criminal case, for example?"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,852.541,856.345,I don't know that we're asking for any more than is required in a criminal case.
1993.93-644,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,856.345,859.887,"Well, what do you think that standard is, the Jackson standard?"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,864.179,869.692,"Well, we've spent a lot of time talking about... I think that might be an acceptable standard."
1993.93-644,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,880.782,888.515,Is there any justification for requiring more than would be required on review in a criminal case in a punitive damages case?
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,888.515,889.386,--No.
1993.93-644,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,907.729,911.04,"Well, I would have thought the standard was the one I mentioned in Jackson."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,911.04,935.346,"Well, I'm perfectly willing to accept... I mean, I think the standard on how you assess the facts is you take the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict, and you ask whether any reasonable juror, or any reasonable jury, in light of those facts, could... applying the law to those facts, could come to the conclusion they came to."
1993.93-644,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,942.201,946.265,And you would be satisfied with that... a procedure that provided for that review in this case?
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,946.265,948.345,"--Well, we didn't get that review."
1993.93-644,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,949.815,952.878,"Well, I know, but would you be satisfied with that, because I understood that to be--"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,952.878,953.328,Well--
1993.93-644,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,953.328,954.24,--the implication of what you were just saying.
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,954.24,957.512,--that is the least we feel we are entitled to.
1993.93-644,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1002.981,1012.727,"Okay, but as I understand it, you have not attacked anything but what you deemed to be the procedural deficiency in review of the verdict that comes in."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1017.96,1018.371,That's correct.
1993.93-644,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1018.371,1018.791,Okay.
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1018.791,1019.532,That's correct.
1993.93-644,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1020.033,1028.959,"We've got to take the case on the assumption, I presume, that the remainder of the Oregon system is constitutionally adequate."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1028.959,1035.163,--We... I believe you could fully discharge your duty by saying that it's inadequate in this respect and remanding it.
1993.93-644,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1035.163,1040.858,So you're not saying that the other accoutrements that sometimes operate as checks on juries are necessary.
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1044.901,1050.534,"A remittitur is a device to which defendants object, because it is a substitute for a new trial, which defendants want."
1993.93-644,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1059.97,1070.476,"All right, so you're striking out the remittitur, and you could have... if the judge thinks that the... there should be another jury you could have just limited to damages, that would be all right, too."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1070.476,1073.258,Nothing that we say here today raises that problem.
1993.93-644,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1094.141,1102.349,"And you say that in light of some history that there was a time when the jury even decided questions of law, when at least in some places jury verdicts--"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1102.349,1103.058,Yes.
1993.93-644,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1103.058,1104.089,--were not reviewable?
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1104.089,1106.32,We say that that was an incident of the right of jury nullification.
1993.93-644,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1113.516,1127.554,"What are the best cases you have, Mr. Frey, for the proposition that some judicial review beyond passion and prejudice review was traditional in the American system, or in the English system at the time of the founding?"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1128.986,1132.297,"Well, many of the cases don't refer to passion and prejudice."
1993.93-644,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1137.841,1139.642,"Okay, I'll say... or anything beyond."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1141.054,1144.334,"--Well, if you look at the--"
1993.93-644,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.334,1147.657,"--I want cases that go beyond passion and prejudice, and that's what you're giving me."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1147.657,1153.683,"--Well, I mean... there are... well, the courts don't, I think, analyze the matter that way."
1993.93-644,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.064,1191.968,"Give me your best cases, Mr. Frey, whatever you think they say."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1193.458,1194.908,"--Well, there's your opinion in TXO."
1993.93-644,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1197.351,1200.774,"It doesn't discuss prior cases, either, and it's dictum, and I might have been wrong."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1201.283,1204.966,"--You might have been, but I think you were pretty clearly right."
1993.93-644,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1204.966,1213.47,"To be specific, Mr. Frey, there was a brief... one of the briefs in this case that suggested that maybe this Court was wrong about what the common law was."
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1220.156,1242.679,"I don't... I don't think that that is... it is clear that as the institution of the jury evolved in the 17th and 18th Centuries, one of the essential incidents of that institution was to have judicial review, the power of the judge to send the case to a new jury when the case was... when the decision was--"
1993.93-644,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1242.679,1245.282,But there were at least some decisions made noises the other way.
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1259.812,1260.271,--Well--
1993.93-644,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1260.271,1263.303,"--And especially where the damages are punitive, and therefore very hard to say--"
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1263.303,1264.495,--May I can approach--
1993.93-644,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1264.495,1266.057,--Are you going to give me your best cases?
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1266.057,1267.036,"--No, I don't think--"
1993.93-644,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.036,1268.228,You're not going to give me your best cases.
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1268.228,1268.608,--No.
1993.93-644,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.169,1276.272,You're not willing to select among them just a couple that you think are the tops?
1993.93-644,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1278.165,1279.225,--I don't think I'm... I don't think--
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1586.099,1590.581,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-644,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1705.676,1714.362,"Well, Mr. Tribe, you and your colleague differ very much about what Oregon allows under these cases in the way of review of punitive damages."
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1714.362,1715.714,"Not on this issue, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-644,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1724.089,1727.141,"I would have thought you differed on this point, too--"
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1727.141,1727.962,I don't think so.
1993.93-644,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1727.962,1733.636,"--having read all the briefs, and what if after duly deliberating--"
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1733.636,1734.217,Right.
1993.93-644,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1734.217,1740.011,--we simply cannot decide which of you is right as to the nature of the review Oregon affords?
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1740.011,1755.08,"I think, Mr. Chief Justice, if that were the case, then one would affirm this judgment, because there is no showing that Oregon violates anything that is comprehensible as procedural due process, since Oregon... I mean, I suppose you could say... it depends on what you were unsure of."
1993.93-644,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1795.458,1796.178,I don't know about that.

1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1811.318,1811.878,"No, no."
1993.93-644,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1811.878,1813.541,--we have to assume you haven't been... I mean--
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1813.541,1823.756,"Of course, Justice Scalia, but if it was A or B, and the only thing that might violate the Constitution was C, you wouldn't waste this Court's time figuring out if it's A or B, and that's what I think we have here."

1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1845.872,1847.832,"--Right, Justice Ginsburg--"

1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1850.724,1851.134,--Right.
1993.93-644,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1851.134,1851.775,--and that wouldn't do.

Courtemanche in Oregon, in 1954, which is in our footnote 35, definitively rejects the scintilla rule, says no evidence means no substantial evidence, and the one ambiguity that I've found in Oregon law in this respect is the question whether a trial judge has a sua sponte duty to look at the evidence, even without a request."

1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1923.102,1923.472,No.
1993.93-644,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1956.782,1960.565,And these were both punitive... Van Lom and the other case you're referring to were both punitive damages cases?
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1960.565,1960.906,No.
1993.93-644,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1975.545,1980.06,It's a much different picture when you're trying to figure out actual damages on the evidence--
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1980.06,1980.411,--Sure.
1993.93-644,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1980.411,1981.229,--supporting and then punitive--
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1981.229,1981.549,Right.

1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2011.393,2023.302,"Well, there have been some Oregon cases, some written by Justice Linde, like Andor v. United Airlines in 1987, which have suggested that alternative instructions could be given in cases of some complexity--"

1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2026.584,2033.949,"--Well, I certainly think that if the request were made Van Lom would be strong precedent for there being required, but no request was made."
1993.93-644,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2062.197,2063.088,Could you clarify first to me whether--
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2063.088,2063.257,--Sure.
1993.93-644,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2063.257,2078.429,--you're saying that there can never be an excessive verdict in Oregon because the district judge before... the trial judge before ever giving the case to the jury will set an amount... will make sure that the amount that's sought is not excessive?
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2078.429,2081.471,"No, Justice Ginsburg, I'm not saying that judges do that in every case."
1993.93-644,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2106.459,2117.635,"Mr. Tribe, I dare say that judges of Oregon are not going to thank you for establishing the proposition that they can be asked ex ante, before the trial, to pick a number."

1993.93-644,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2126.49,2130.711,"--anything more than this is excessive punitive damages, and that's really what you think the Oregon system is?"
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2130.711,2132.564,"--Well, Justice Scalia, it's not before the trial--"
1993.93-644,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2132.564,2133.684,I'd find it a very difficult system to administer.
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2133.684,2137.377,"--Well, (a) it's not before the trial, it's after the record is closed."
1993.93-644,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2161.484,2165.694,You're asking them to define obscenity instead of recognizing it when they see it.
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2167.296,2175.171,"I'm asking them to number the page, and they can number it as well before they have perused it as after."
1993.93-644,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2177.473,2179.255,"Yes, but that assumes there's only one theory of liability."
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2185.83,2191.193,"--Well, but Justice Stevens, I really want to focus on the main point, which is the before and after point."

1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2198.546,2198.937,--No.

1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2245.676,2247.218,--To do this advance thing?
1993.93-644,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2247.218,2247.619,Yes.
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2247.619,2249.018,"No, certainly not, Justice Stevens."

1993.93-644,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2299.923,2303.115,"--Well, what you've just read they say is a quote from Van Lom."
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2303.115,2308.741,"That's correct, and that is... that is the deprivation of judicial review of which they complain."
1993.93-644,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2370.231,2376.966,"Well, that's not what he's saying today, so it seems to me that's kind of a waste of time to debate."
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2376.966,2377.567,"Well, it may be."
1993.93-644,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2388.484,2390.277,Except for what they say.
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2390.277,2391.098,--what would meet his theory.
1993.93-644,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2391.098,2396.38,They say it won't be reviewed for excessiveness or weight of the evidence.
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2396.38,2398.732,"Well, excessive or in any other respect opposed to weight."
1993.93-644,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2398.732,2409.297,"I think we could take the supreme court of Oregon at its word here that they don't provide review unless there is no evidence, or for instructions that were given."
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2409.297,2410.489,Justice O'Connor--
1993.93-644,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2410.489,2412.169,I don't see why we should debate that.
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2412.169,2413.18,"--No, I don't intend to."
1993.93-644,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2435.738,2450.524,"Mr. Tribe, what about the broader theory of the petitioner's case, that whatever the State law provides, there must be a procedure to ensure that the jury's verdict conforms to that rule?"
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2452.718,2453.977,I think it is.
1993.93-644,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2453.977,2454.628,--of Mr. Frey's position.
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2454.628,2464.415,"Whatever State law provides we ought to get, and the problem I have with that, frankly, is, you got what State law provided, to some extent by definition."
1993.93-644,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2464.415,2466.065,What about the underlying theory.
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2468.496,2469.758,"Well, I don't think it's sustainable."
1993.93-644,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2469.758,2470.779,--an acceptable constitutional--
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2470.779,2471.639,"I don't think so, Justice Kennedy."
1993.93-644,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2524.323,2530.647,--What about a Federal guarantee that no reasonable juror could have awarded this sum?
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2530.647,2537.803,"I think that, although it's sometimes put in terms of gross excessiveness, is the Federal substantive due process principle."
1993.93-644,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2539.623,2548.249,"Yes, except that if you take the Oregon court at its word on the meaning of its constitution, they can't apply even that."
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2548.249,2551.641,"--No, I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor, I think that is simply not the case."

1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2583.513,2585.083,"--I'm sorry, Oberg."
1993.93-644,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2667.038,2667.747,"Procedural due process, I was talking about."
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2667.747,2669.56,"Procedural... yes, exactly, procedural due process."
1993.93-644,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2700.651,2731.012,"Mr. Tribe, could you comment explicitly on something which I think you've been commenting implicitly on all along, and that is language which is clearly troublesome to some members of the Court, and I think on its face to me, in that quotation from page 3 of the blue brief, in which the Oregon court disclaims the authority to review the evidence as to whether in... the verdict as to whether in any other respect it is opposed to the weight of the evidence?"
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2762.396,2763.434,"I think that's exactly right, Justice Souter."
1993.93-644,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2789.02,2815.388,"Mr. Tribe, do you... what is your support for the proposition, which I think you maintain, that Oregon does apply a passion or prejudice standard, meaning by passion or prejudice, passion or prejudice that is evidenced exclusively by the excessiveness of the verdict, and not aliunde by, you know, some conduct in the jury room or--"
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2815.388,2821.422,"Well, exclusively by he size of the verdict against the backdrop of the record, that is true."
1993.93-644,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2821.422,2822.603,"--Yes, against the backdrop."
1993.93-644,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2822.603,2843.367,"Because in Lane v. Stewart in 1960, a case that they cite for the proposition that there is no such review, what the Court says is, we find that there was substantial evidence to support this verdict, and we reject the idea that we are free to set it aside because its mere size, I take it independent of that evidence, somehow indicates something wrong."
