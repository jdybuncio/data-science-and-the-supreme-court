1989.89-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.622,"We'll hear argument next in Number 89-700, Astroline Communications Company v. Shurberg Broadcasting."
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,21.996,26.65,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-700,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,378.98,391.92,"Mr. Wollenberg, do you think Congress acted under its Fourteenth Amendment, Section 5 powers in this case?"
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,391.92,409.616,"--Justice O'Connor, I find it impossible to comprehend or accept the notion that Congress' powers are somehow greater under Section 5 when dealing with Federal areas."
1989.89-700,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,410.568,413.936,It perhaps acted under its commerce clause powers?
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,413.936,416.905,"--Under its commerce clause, under its spending powers--"
1989.89-700,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.905,423.626,And I suppose even Congress is bound by the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,423.626,458.815,"--Yes, and when we say equal protection component, we have to say component, because this Court, quite properly, read the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment into the Fifth Amendment, just as it has read the Amendments to the Bill of Rights into the Civil War Amendments, and just yesterday there was a jury trial... I'm sorry, an election spending requirement of a state that was subjected to analysis under the First Amendment."
1989.89-700,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,493.388,501.376,"Well, I guess... I guess the FCC, at least, stands before us on the premise that it's furthering a goal of program diversity."
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,501.376,503.928,"--No, I think not, Your Honor."
1989.89-700,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,563.901,605.811,"Well, I thought I heard a spokesman for the FCC at oral argument in the preceding case tell us that the FCC did not rely on some remedial program for prior discrimination, that we should take this case on the basis that the goal of the FCC set-aside here and in the multiple factor policy in the preceding case was to achieve better program diversity through minority ownership."
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,610.097,611.715,I do.
1989.89-700,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,660.796,668.552,"Wouldn't it still be fair to say, then, that diversity of ownership is not an end in itself?"
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,668.552,670.838,I think that's absolutely correct.
1989.89-700,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,733.094,733.794,Mr. Wollenberg--
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,736.363,737.263,--I beg your pardon.
1989.89-700,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,737.263,738.065,It sounded to me--
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,738.065,760.311,"No, I was... working the long way around, perhaps, Justice Kennedy, to say that the reference to the FCC in its function in NAACP v. FPC was, it is different with the Federal Communications Commission, because employment can be important in its impact on programming."
1989.89-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,779.475,787.463,"--Mr.... Mr. Wollenberg, a moment ago you read some language from a Senate report in connection with... was it a 1982 act of Congress?"
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,787.463,788.063,Yes.
1989.89-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,788.063,792.783,"And what did that act provide, so far as minority preferences was concerned?"
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,792.783,799.87,That had to do with granting permission to process competing applications by lotteries.
1989.89-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,799.87,804.257,And is that what was... what was involved in this particular case before us?
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,804.824,805.29,No.
1989.89-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,812.03,817.065,--Was the distress sale policy similarly authorized by Congress?
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,817.065,843.649,"--The distress sale policy was not specifically mandated by Congress... not authorized, mandated by Congress until three successive budget acts, the '87 act, the '88 act and the '89 act, where it was made very clear that Congress, which I, with deference, I think was fully informed... maybe not everyone who voted for it was fully informed, but the relevant people were fully informed."
1989.89-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,848.219,852.421,Congress cut off funding for the Commission's effort to reconsider the policy.
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,852.421,855.19,Not just to reconsider it or to change it.
1989.89-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,895.184,901.938,But... but nothing before us in this particular case depends on the lottery act?
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,901.938,902.304,--No.
1989.89-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.304,903.706,From which you read the history?
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,903.706,904.19,That's right.
1989.89-700,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.396,919.465,But the only statute that Congress passed that has to do with this case is an appropriations act.
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,919.465,920.132,--That has to do--
1989.89-700,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.132,934.975,"And the only law of Congress that binds us here is the law that says the FCC won't use any funds in each of these annual appropriations... and the current one has the same thing, I gather... in order to consider this policy."
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,940.313,948.335,"--It's the only formal expression that... that relates directly to this case, because it said don't change the distress sale policy."
1989.89-700,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,957.174,958.457,When was the Kerner Commission report?
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,958.457,960.292,"--It was about 20 years ago, I think."
1989.89-700,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.292,961.126,About 20 years ago.
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,966.613,967.463,"Well, the FCC--"
1989.89-700,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,967.463,969.565,Which is why Congress passed the appropriations?
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,969.565,978.354,"--Well, the FCC... when you say since that time, the FCC has unquestionably, with different members, been on both sides of the... of the case."
1989.89-700,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1030.121,1034.59,"Mr. Wollenberg, could I... let me tell you the thing that... that most troubles me about this case."
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,1084.541,1086.574,"--Justice Scalia, I can't think of any."
1989.89-700,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1133.422,1133.839,And--
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,1133.839,1136.14,--they may be somewhat isolated in their attitudes.
1989.89-700,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.781,1151.8,"--I'm not worried about proving it, I'm worried about extending that principle to other fields."
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,1151.8,1152.085,--And I--
1989.89-700,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1152.085,1160.506,"And I'd like you to tell me how it can be limited to this one field, once we accept that Congress may predict human behavior on the basis of human blood--"
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,1160.506,1160.941,--And I--
1989.89-700,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1160.941,1162.941,"--for this purpose, why may not it do it for other purposes?"
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,1162.941,1183.871,"--And I respond, Your Honor, on the basis of the special licensing responsibility that means that the people that are put in charge of the air, like the decision in... in Red Lion upholding the fairness doctrine, which is the kind of interference that would... we would all rather question with newspapers."
1989.89-700,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1250.999,1262.056,"Tell me how it's going to help to announce that, yes, indeed race does make a difference, that you can indeed predict how people will act on the basis of their blood, that's going to help the situation of racism that you're concerned about."
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,1262.056,1267.008,--I think only with... only with respect to... to sensitivity.
1989.89-700,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1279.851,1285.689,"Blood, Mr. Wollenberg, blood, not background and environment, isn't that right?"
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,1293.861,1308.454,"--I think the congressional judgment, while not applying to everybody, the congressional judgment is that groups with particular kind of blood were treated rather differently in this country for a rather long time."
1989.89-700,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1342.675,1344.877,Everybody... one point.
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,1356.435,1358.618,"--I'm not talking blood, Your Honor."
1989.89-700,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1358.618,1359.035,Sir?
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,1359.035,1360.537,I said I'm not talking blood.
1989.89-700,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1363.105,1364.855,"Well, is there any difference in blood?"
1989.89-700,0,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,1364.855,1366.791,I'm not aware of any difference in blood.
1989.89-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1409.201,1410.753,"Very well, Mr. Wollenberg."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1415.224,1418.425,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-700,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1456.551,1458.251,You said he was said to be.
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1460.268,1464.687,"The record only reflects that he was said to be Hispanic-American, Your Honor."
1989.89-700,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1470.191,1477.814,Does the FCC policy require more than examining the surname to see if it's Hispanic?
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1477.814,1479.03,"--No, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-700,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1480.999,1490.105,So someone could... a woman could marry an Hispanic and pick up an Hispanic surname and qualify under the FCC policy?
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1490.105,1494.74,In an uncontested situation I believe that would be correct.
1989.89-700,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1494.74,1498.358,"Or vice versa, or vice versa."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1498.358,1500.058,That a Caucasian--
1989.89-700,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1500.058,1504.179,That a Hispanic woman could marry Mr. Smith and not qualify.
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1504.179,1504.562,--No.
1989.89-700,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1522.723,1523.457,But isn't the name--
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1531.513,1533.615,"Well, I would agree with Your Honor."
1989.89-700,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1544.654,1547.958,"So it's determined on the basis of dissent, is that right?"
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1547.958,1555.379,"It would appear to be the case although again, in this situation all that was stated in the application was Mr. Ramirez is an Hispanic-American."
1989.89-700,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1555.379,1560.015,What... what if your... one of your great grandparents was Hispanic.
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1561.232,1562.8,"I could not tell you that, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-700,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.65,1566.519,"There must be some rules about that, mustn't there?"
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1571.121,1572.073,--Not to my knowledge.
1989.89-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.714,1596.872,"Well, Mr. Cole, would you have had an opportunity at some stage in the FCC proceedings to challenge the status of Mr. Ramirez as being a Hispanic had you chosen to do so?"
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1596.872,1601.842,"Conceivably... actually, no, I don't believe that would be the case, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1989.89-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.875,1630.243,"But had you been able to dig up something, you might have had an opportunity to challenge."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1630.243,1634.731,"Had we been able to dig something, we might... presumably we could have disclosed that to the FCC, and we might have made some headway."
1989.89-700,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1648.24,1660.548,"May I... may I just ask you, on the joint exhibit... Joint Appendix 68 there's a chart which shows capital contributions and percentage interests."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1660.548,1661.348,"Yes, sir."
1989.89-700,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1661.348,1682.044,"And I see Mr. Ramirez made a contribution of $210 and had a 21 percent percentage interest and a Mr. and Mrs. Rose had an $830,000 contribution for a 6 percent interest."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1687.965,1695.019,"The way as I understand the partnership setup... and again, this is not my client so it's... all I can tell you is what I understand through the pleadings."
1989.89-700,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1715.616,1718.068,So the percentage interest appears to be ownership equity--
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1718.068,1718.451,--That's correct.
1989.89-700,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1718.451,1719.086,--so far as your understanding?
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1719.086,1719.686,That's correct.
1989.89-700,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1719.686,1720.402,Thank you.
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1722.538,1723.738,That's correct.
1989.89-700,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1799.805,1824.17,"Well, of course, the Court has recognized the need and the possibility of some remedial action for past discrimination or for, in some cases, prima facie evidence of such discrimination."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,1830.891,1844.4,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I have to say I've sat through four separate arguments, four separate presentations this morning to the court, and I think the one lesson that I've learned is that there is no basis for saying exactly what the FCC was doing."
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2045.631,2046.75,May I ask a question there?
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2046.75,2047.233,Certainly.
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2047.233,2064.978,"Supposing two alternatives: one, that all of the broadcast media in the country were owned by white males, 100 percent, and the second hypothesis, that 80 percent were owned by white males and 20 percent were owned by minority groups of various characteristics."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2073.818,2076.436,"We're talking commercial stations, sir?"
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2076.436,2079.804,Just whatever... the whole spectrum that the FCC licenses.
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2079.804,2089.493,"Well, if I may at least initially restrict my... my... my response to commercial stations, in the commercial broadcast area, broadcast programming is market driven."
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2097.283,2101.818,"He said they weren't exclusively, but he said primarily, yes."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2101.818,2104.337,"I would have to get his brief out, but... I... there is--"
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2104.337,2109.074,"Well, in any event, are they entirely market driven?"
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2109.074,2111.191,--I believe so or certainly--
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2111.191,2117.228,So your answer then is you can safely predict there would be no difference between the programs in the two hypotheses.
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2117.228,2119.68,"--I will accept that, yes, sir."
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2119.68,2120.03,Yeah.
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2123.501,2124.034,No.
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2164.126,2164.609,"Of course, there's no doubt."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2171.981,2172.531,--Yes.
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2178.651,2187.591,"Would it be true also, I suppose, if 100 percent of the stations were owned by Democrats and then in the other alternative would be 100 or 80 percent Democrats and 20 Republicans."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2195.613,2197.965,I suppose that would depend on the Republicans and the Democrats.
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2197.965,2202.251,"Well, of course that depends on the whites and the blacks or not."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2202.251,2209.004,"That may be, but again, there is no constitutional problem with... the Constitution is not--"
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2209.004,2216.426,But supposing the Commission went out and that survey and found out they were all owned by Democrats and they decided to set aside a few for Republicans?
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2216.426,2220.062,"--That would raise... that would raise First Amendment problems, but not equal protection problems."
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.062,2222.58,They're just interested in diversity?
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2222.58,2225.716,"Well, the... I'm sorry?"
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2225.716,2233.405,"They're just interested in diversity, I say, and you'd say that's totally irrational to assume that would produce any diversity because everybody's market driven."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2237.773,2252.782,In the Republican-Democrat situation I would suggest that a different standard of review might conceivably apply because again there are no equal protection problems or considerations raised on the face of that hypothetical.
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2253.116,2258.353,I suppose Democrats and Republicans are entitled to be treated equally.
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2258.353,2260.055,--But the Constitution does not mandate that.
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2260.055,2265.69,And does the personnel of the Commission have to be politically... isn't there some requirement that different parties be represented?
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2265.69,2270.844,I believe there is a requirement of at least some... some split.
1989.89-700,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2270.844,2275.148,"There's some reason to think that Republicans and Democrats thinking differently, isn't there?"
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2275.148,2275.748,"Yes, there is."
1989.89-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2369.526,2372.478,"Well, are there some signs in the cable industry?"
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2372.478,2375.097,"--There are minority ownership policies, I believe--"
1989.89-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.097,2388.838,"No, I mean... I mean not... not on the minority basis, but are there set-asides for local stations or local channels or--"
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2388.838,2393.825,--You mean carriage provisions for so that a local cable system will have to carry?
1989.89-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.546,2400.396,--But there used to be?
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2400.396,2402.331,"There used to be, yes."
1989.89-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2402.831,2406.967,Were those unconstitutional do you think?
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2406.967,2410.686,I have not researched or briefed that point.
1989.89-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.757,2421.226,"Well, you were talking about music stations."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2421.226,2428.046,"Well, I had thrown in... used the term white, upper-middle class music stations."
1989.89-700,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2429.065,2459.001,"Mr. Cole, would you have an objection to this if the Commission had set it up a different way, that there is a preference for, let's say, people who are leaders in Hispanic cultural affairs, whether they're Hispanic or not or a preference for people who've taken particular interest and done particular study in black history?"
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2459.001,2462.869,--That would certainly be far less objectionable.
1989.89-700,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.155,2465.288,Would it be objectionable at all--
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2465.288,2466.505,--It might be.
1989.89-700,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2466.505,2471.742,"--And it would be more likely to have a direct effect on what the programming would be, wouldn't it, than just... just the race of the person?"
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2471.742,2472.109,Yes.
1989.89-700,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2480.431,2483.3,But there's no reason to think that this policy is that at all?
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2483.3,2483.75,No.
1989.89-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2531.847,2547.475,"You're not saying that certain types, whether it be, you know, Hispanics, white, upper-middle class, blacks, don't like certain kinds of programs, but you're saying they could be provided by people who aren't necessarily of that... of that group?"
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2547.475,2549.692,"I'm saying two things, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2578.377,2586.1,"May I ask, is it... is it irrational to assume that a greater percentage of black people like that kind of music than the same corresponding percentage of white people?"
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2586.1,2587.217,"--Yes, I would say that is--"
1989.89-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2587.217,2587.817,That's irrational?
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2587.817,2591.171,--That is a presumption which would offend the equal protection clause.
1989.89-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2591.171,2594.456,Even if it were... supposing it weren't a presumption.
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2618.571,2618.871,Sure.
1989.89-700,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2690.001,2704.427,I think your argument is really... I just think it's not true if... if you're saying that there are not some generalizations that could be made validly if you wanted and were permitted to make the generalizations.
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2745.621,2746.337,--Justice Scalia--
1989.89-700,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2746.337,2748.539,"If I had to bet on it, that's how I'd put my money."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2748.539,2751.575,--I'm not arguing that the government can take these into account at all.
1989.89-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2760.931,2764.549,You're saying that the government cannot take those factors into account?
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2764.549,2766.251,That's correct.
1989.89-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2766.251,2788.681,"Well, supposing that there's... that there's... take a community in the southwest and take Justice Scalia's hypothesis where there's an actual survey that... and it happens to be largely Hispanic, that there are 100,000 people there, 80,000 of them prefer mariachi bands and there's no station providing mariachi bands."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2796.537,2814.332,"I suppose it could, but what it can't do is compel that the license which is issued by the FCC go to a Hispanic or Mexican or what... or any particular ethnic group because of the assumption that that ethnic group will provide mariachi music."
1989.89-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2814.332,2827.925,"But it could put in some condition that an applicant, at least be favored... if it, regardless of who the applicant was, if it would be put in some mariachi band music?"
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2827.925,2830.36,From an equal protection point of view I have no objection to that.
1989.89-700,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2843.751,2853.024,"Because the market takes care of it, but before it came to that... that... that conclusion, it had indeed licensed stations on basis of format."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2853.024,2853.424,That's correct.
1989.89-700,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2853.424,2859.962,"What kind of... you know, different kind of music; indeed, different degrees of rap... of rock music."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2862.529,2864.081,That's correct.
1989.89-700,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2864.081,2867.616,"But not on the basis of race, just on the basis of the kind of programming that was promised."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,2867.616,2871.604,That's correct.
1989.89-700,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3011.761,3016.332,Is there any requirement that the station... the property be held for a particular amount of time?
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,3016.332,3016.965,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-700,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3016.965,3018.732,"If it becomes profitable, if it can be sold?"
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,3018.732,3019.201,I'm sorry.
1989.89-700,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3023.068,3027.37,But after one year the new owners are free to sell it?
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,3027.37,3031.008,"That's correct, for whatever dollar value to whomever."
1989.89-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3052.088,3053.838,I would hope that they improved the station immensely.
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,3053.838,3058.742,"--I would hope so, Your Honor, for that amount of money."
1989.89-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3238.04,3239.226,"Thank you, Mr. Cole."
1989.89-700,1,26779,harry_f_cole,,3239.226,3240.009,Thank you.
1989.89-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3240.009,3246.296,"Mr. Wollenberg, you have seven minutes remaining."
1989.89-700,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,3246.296,3248.832,If the Court please:
1989.89-700,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3410.854,3423.346,Did you finish what you wanted to say about the fact that this client of your friend here wouldn't have been considered in any event?
1989.89-700,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,3423.346,3426.031,"No, I hadn't finished, and I thank Your Honor."
1989.89-700,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3438.505,3446.611,"Why didn't that serve to disqualify him completely, without even getting to any of the--"
1989.89-700,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,3446.611,3448.996,"--Well, there was a long, complicated procedure."
1989.89-700,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3463.639,3469.143,"--But he didn't lose... his client... your opposition didn't lose on that basis, I guess."
1989.89-700,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,3469.143,3474.179,"Well, he did in a way, because there were three distress sales."
1989.89-700,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3475.13,3477.03,"Well, on that basis we shouldn't have taken the case."
1989.89-700,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,3477.832,3505.483,"--And when he got to the third distressed sale, which was a distress sale to Astroline, the normal renewal time would come up, but the Commission does not engage in taking competing applications and the Court below held this, when the case is in a hearing status, so that under the distress sale policy, when the Commission approved the distress sale to Astroline, Mr. Shurberg couldn't come in and demand a hearing and no one else could, white or black."
1989.89-700,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3505.483,3511.804,Are you saying that the minority set aside program made no difference in the outcome of this case?
1989.89-700,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,3511.804,3515.421,I think it made no difference in the outcome of what Mr. Shurberg was trying to do.
1989.89-700,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3517.473,3522.294,"Well, but I said, did it make any difference in the outcome of this case, of the award of this franchise?"
1989.89-700,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,3522.294,3531.467,"Well, had the... had there been no distress sale policy, then what would have happened was--"
1989.89-700,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3531.467,3537.804,Couldn't you answer my question a yes or a no?
1989.89-700,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,3537.804,3538.604,--Would you repeat it?
1989.89-700,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3539.337,3539.739,Yes.
1989.89-700,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,3550.095,3563.188,"It made no necessary difference in the outcome as far as Shurberg was concerned, because if there had been no distress sale the Faith Center renewal hearing on qualifications would have gone through."
1989.89-700,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3578.964,3584.602,"You're the plaintiff... I mean, you're the petitioner in this case and you didn't raise any of this in your petition."
1989.89-700,2,33461,j_roger_wollenberg,,3584.602,3585.368,"Oh, no."
1989.89-700,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3673.076,3674.326,"Thank you, Mr. Wollenberg."
