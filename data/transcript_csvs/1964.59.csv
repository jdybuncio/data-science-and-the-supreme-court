1964.59,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,66.848,69.448,That is the taxpayers outside of United States?
1964.59,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,69.448,75.025,"Taxpayers and nonresident, it's a foreign corporation Omar, S.A."
1964.59,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,177.179,178.167,Mr. Oberdorfer.
1964.59,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,178.167,180.045,"Yes, Your Honor?"
1964.59,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,180.045,185.385,The delinquency is in respect to those -- with respect [Inaudible]
1964.59,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,185.385,187.368,That's correct Your Honor.
1964.59,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,191.648,193.031,They didn't get â€“ [Inaudible]
1964.59,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,193.031,204.811,"Well, they will have an opportunity either in this proceeding or in the Tax Court proceeding, which they have instituted for adjudication of the liability if any."
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1538.446,1543.074,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1680.937,1694.157,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1694.157,1694.584,"No, sir."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1695.414,1698.244,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1698.244,1702.935,"No, Mr. Justice White, I suggest that it's a good deal more than a local ruling."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.935,1704.762,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1704.762,1716.931,"The Court of Appeals relied on the New York Rule, which expresses what I believe is a necessary conclusion, if you examine the nature of this property."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1728.022,1731.0,But did the Court of Appeals rely on anything other than the --
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1731.0,1737.859,"Yes, my point sir, is that the Court of Appeals in relying on New York Law was going beyond that."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1756.668,1771.768,"These sorts of rules isn't designed to deal with foreign deposits as against domestic deposits, but in fact, this is much -- that rule would be imposed if the bank is across the street?"
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1771.768,1772.609,It probably would --
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1772.609,1773.447,[Inaudible] --
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1773.447,1773.725,That is --
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1773.725,1780.889,Do you suggest the results in this case ought to be the same as the branch that you are talking about was it in this country?
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1780.889,1781.263,No.
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1787.799,1788.418,Yes.
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1788.418,1805.014,"But I'm not suggesting nor do I think it necessary that be the case, because if the branch were across the street, then the order of this Court would protect the respondent, because it would protect the respondent even if the branch were in a different state, because we --"
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.014,1807.477,[Inaudible] the Court wouldn't present him there?
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1807.477,1808.192,"Well, I do."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1808.192,1809.446,Because of the foreign law?
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1809.446,1815.76,"Yes, Your Honor and as Your Honor is well aware, the foreign law is for the Court to determine."
1964.59,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1902.553,1916.456,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1916.456,1918.245,I'm inclined to --
1964.59,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1918.245,1919.744,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1919.744,1920.418,Sorry.
1964.59,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1920.418,1924.343,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1924.343,1924.839,That is correct.
1964.59,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1924.839,1944.755,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1944.755,1950.559,"Well, I should like to abide by the regulation on that, but I can't."
1964.59,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1958.825,1960.827,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,1960.827,1979.043,"Both, both because once the money is outside the jurisdiction of the Court and deposited, then the taint of its birth, so to speak, the fact that it was spirited out in an effort to avoid taxes, doesn't affect its status in the foreign country."
1964.59,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2007.237,2032.48,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2032.48,2057.322,"That is my point and I'm not saying, Your Honor, that if the bank had participated in the removal of funds as a conspirator, there would not have a liability for that and then it would not be -- not entitled to the protection of equity, but my point is, that if the bank is used as a conduit to move the funds out of the country then the fact that once they have been moved out."
1964.59,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2077.007,2091.318,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2091.318,2092.771,I don't have any --
1964.59,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2092.771,2094.0,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2094.0,2116.614,"I don't have any published figures that I'm aware off, but I can say this with respect to the First National City Bank itself, that unless I'm wrong about one-third of its overall assets, business and alike is in its foreign or overseas division."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.091,2133.803,"Well, it could be an overseas division, it could include deposits by the American companies who have been subject to --"
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2133.803,2147.605,"This is entirely possible, but I'm talking about the amount of foreign currencies, which the American banks accumulate so to speak by going out and doing business in the foreign country subject to those laws."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2164.197,2181.514,But I feel that if the Internal Revenue Service proceeds against the main office of the branch to sequester or to enjoin the paying out of funds that the bank may have in anyone of its hundred branches in this country.
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2181.514,2182.246,Yes.
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2182.246,2200.699,"If you say that's part of an injunction that is justified, I mean that the Court would have power to enter it, I think if you would say that this is the -- that the main office is an appropriate place to latch on to whatever kind of property this is and wherever it maybe located."
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2200.699,2205.38,"Well, I think that is so, I would not myself regard --"
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.38,2219.436,"If that is so then, the only difference is this case is that the depositor happens to be or that the branch happens to be located abroad and you have just the extra problem of double liability."
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2219.436,2220.597,"Well, it's double liability."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.778,2227.994,But it doesn't have anything to do with where property is located or what kind of a debt it is or anything like that?
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2227.994,2228.786,"Yes, I think --"
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.786,2229.935,"Well, it couldn't have?"
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2229.935,2231.852,"Well, I think it does, because as I was about to say --"
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.852,2235.019,"Otherwise, this Court could never do it in the case if the branch is in this country?"
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2235.019,2235.685,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2249.574,2251.786,But not before it has any power to do it?
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2251.786,2265.074,"Well, at this point, once again, I'm basing my argument Your Honor on the fact that it is inequitable for the Court to attempt to extend its power beyond its borders, not on the question of power."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2265.95,2267.319,"So, it's an equity question?"
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2267.319,2268.261,It's an equity question.
1964.59,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2317.377,2329.324,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2329.324,2331.777,I'm not sure that my client would let me be here.
1964.59,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2348.162,2350.911,"Mr. Harfield, you may continue your argument."
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2350.911,2374.996,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, may it please the Court, I would like to devote myself presently to the question of the in rem jurisdiction or a lack of it, but before doing, I'd like to revert to the question, which the Chief Justice put just before the recess as to whether we would be here if there were jurisdiction over Omar."
1964.59,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2476.575,2490.989,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2490.989,2491.245,Yes.
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.787,2549.253,"Mr. Harfield, [Inaudible]"
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2549.253,2573.009,"The new regulation as I read it Mr. Justice White provides that the commissioner before he applies to the Court must in his own mind determine that there is jurisdiction or if there is not in his judgment personal jurisdiction, then he must determine that there has been a removal of property."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.446,2583.196,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2583.196,2591.529,"Well, there is another provision of the regulation, which says that the hence forward was not the case here."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2603.61,2615.836,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2615.836,2618.425,I just don't know.
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2618.692,2621.395,"Anyway, [Inaudible]"
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2621.395,2655.005,"Well, returning that point, if the service is made broadside, the problem which the bank faces is that it is going to have to determine at its peril whether or not there is a violation of law in any country where there may possibly be property of the taxpayer, the alleged taxpayer."
1964.59,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2756.111,2758.138,Why is that the case [Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2758.138,2787.229,"Because in this case Your Honor, the bank is subject abroad at the place where the property is payable or returnable to an obligation of repayment, which is immediate and if the bank in reliance or in compliance with the order of the Court breaches that obligation, then the moment of breach fixes its liability and the fact that this is only a temporary injunction, doesn't relieve it."
1964.59,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2787.229,2790.894,"Fixed its liability for what, it's already reliable for the funds?"
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2790.894,2791.432,That's right.
1964.59,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2804.628,2807.291,But is it any more than it was before?
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2807.291,2810.971,"It is a different kind of liability, let me make this as the illustration --"
1964.59,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2810.971,2813.843,"Well, I'm getting at it is what's the damage?"
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2813.843,2824.167,"The damage maybe the amount of money, it will certainly be the amount of money plus interest for the delay and it may very possibly be for consequential damages."
1964.59,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2854.06,2858.085,Does it appear which kind of account is it kept in the bank then?
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,2858.085,2865.045,There is no indication in this record Your Honor as to the nature of any particular accounts.
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3132.37,3145.326,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,3145.326,3179.31,"MIt's a different question and yet the thing that runs through it becomes a nominator of it is that if the bank cannot be obliged and should not be obliged to payout and dispose of the money abroad by reason of a pressure put on its head office then the lesser restraint is equally objectionable, because it doesn't really make any difference whether you call this an injunction or a lien or a levy, in every instance it is an effort by pushing on the bank here to passing on the property there."
1964.59,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3179.31,3217.398,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,3217.398,3220.553,"Well, assuming those and of course I do, assuming the accuracy of those, --"
1964.59,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3220.553,3221.693,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,3221.693,3222.407,Assuming the accuracy of --
1964.59,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3222.407,3229.572,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,3229.572,3235.269,"That there was a danger, a continuing danger that the funds were being taken out of the country."
1964.59,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3235.269,3242.682,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,3242.682,3255.258,"Well, I think that the -- and I do have a concern in the Government's ability to collect these and I think that the government has demonstrated that it has an ample opportunity to do this, ample power to do it."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3431.281,3474.674,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,3474.674,3484.001,"I think it would necessarily cover that, because in the case of the American Company, there is the power to reach that company and direct that company."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3484.001,3487.781,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,3487.781,3488.574,"The argument, that's right."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3495.843,3514.358,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,3514.358,3514.989,I would say that --
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3514.989,3516.602,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,3516.602,3519.541,"It should be entered against the company, that is correct Your Honor."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3519.541,3524.23,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,3524.23,3529.508,"Well, if it were entered against the company that would control it and would leave the bank protected."
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3529.508,3537.743,[Inaudible]
1964.59,1,27192,henry_harfield,,3537.743,3541.494,It would have to sue for not having done that.
1964.59,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3541.494,3545.778,Mr. Oberdorfer.
1964.59,2,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,3545.778,3568.666,"Mr. Chief Justice, we are of course sensitive to the fact that this is a proceeding in equity and Mr. Harfield framed the question in terms of equity."
1964.59,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3821.013,3833.192,"Mr. Oberdorfer it seems if this was a Court of equity, I suppose the Court could have attached any conditions of -- reasonable conditions which it chose to the issuance of its restraining order or injunction."
1964.59,2,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,3833.192,3834.449,"It's correct, Your Honor."
1964.59,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3834.449,3846.81,"Do you suppose it could have gone so far as to provide that, if you the government wants this injunction, you shall be required to hold the bank harmless and indemnified for any possible double liability?"
1964.59,2,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,3846.81,3856.914,"There would be a precedent for that, Your Honor, at least the legal basis for that kind of condition in this McGrath against City Service case decided by this Court."
1964.59,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3863.219,3864.822,"Well, if there is --"
1964.59,2,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,3864.822,3871.381,"But if the Court entered an order like that, it certainly would have the power to in a proceeding inequity, we would oppose it."
1964.59,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3871.381,3876.364,"But you could just say, if you want your injunction, those are the conditions to go with it?"
1964.59,2,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,3876.364,3877.408,Indeed so.
1964.59,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3877.408,3886.631,"And if as you were arguing the risk is very slight, that wouldn't be much of a very onerous condition?"
1964.59,2,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,3886.631,3896.681,"That cuts both ways. It might cause the bank to resist less vigorously than it might otherwise resist it, if it were put upon in Uruguay."
1964.59,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3896.681,3901.531,[Inaudible] with reference to the location of our banks in the that country?
1964.59,2,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,3901.531,3906.491,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1964.59,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3906.491,3917.713,"Mr. Oberdorfer, do you have any doubt or â€“ what is the situation of this litigation in regard to the new regulation?"
1964.59,2,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,3930.889,3939.514,"We think that -- I haven't thought this through, we think he's -- that he's complied with the regulations."
