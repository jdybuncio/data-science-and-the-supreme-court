1980.79-886,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.82,"Thank you gentlemen, the case is submitted, we will hear arguments next in Upjohn Company v. United States."
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,51.866,55.485,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-886,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,333.299,335.151,By the SEC or by your client?
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,335.151,337.186,--It was submitted by my client.
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,373.793,380.347,"Is it your submission, Mr. Gribbon, that both items requested were work product?"
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,380.347,382.299,Yes.
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,382.299,384.251,I know we're part in that aspect of the case now.
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,384.251,387.119,They're both work product and both covered by the privilege.
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,395.356,400.11,"I know we're talking now about the privilege, not about work product."
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,400.11,400.36,Yes.
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,400.36,412.401,"And since I've already interrupted you, quite apart from what the scope of the privilege may be in this context or any other, who is the beneficiary of the privilege?"
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,412.401,413.751,The corporation is the beneficiary.
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,413.751,414.251,The client?
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,414.251,415.936,The client; the corporation.
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,415.936,417.036,"Not the lawyer, the client?"
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,417.036,417.703,Yes.
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,419.471,421.138,So only the client would--
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,421.138,422.957,--Only the client can assert the privilege.
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,425.892,428.094,--But the lawyer is the beneficiary of the work product?
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,428.094,430.279,--The lawyer is the beneficiary of the work product.
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,433.512,433.679,Right.
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,442.868,452.992,"The record shows it to this extent, at the time the summons was issued some 25 of the 86 interviewees had been talked to by the Service."
1980.79-886,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,464.883,468.669,So that the Service has found a way to get to them?
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,468.669,470.102,"Well, they should have."
1980.79-886,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,543.733,545.435,"Mr. Gribbon, one minor detail."
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,547.121,547.921,Yes.
1980.79-886,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,549.387,550.989,But no answers yet?
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,550.989,552.123,--No answers.
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,665.012,675.887,"If Mr. Thomas, even though he'd gone to law school were, say, vice president in charge of personnel, and had sent out this questionnaire, would--"
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,675.887,677.606,I don't think the privilege would apply.
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,677.606,680.041,--So when does it apply?
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,680.041,682.274,When he's acting in his legal capacity.
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,682.274,683.743,Not to any--
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,683.743,686.278,Not in non-legal capacities.
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,700.252,703.002,"--Well, tell us what the factual situation is."
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,704.62,704.837,NO... and advice.
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,704.837,707.322,"That was the purpose of the inquiry, wasn't it?"
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,713.643,718.464,"I think conceivably, at least as far as human beings are concerned--"
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,718.464,723.867,"Even though that vice president might be a member of the bar somewhere, he wouldn't be acting as a lawyer."
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,725.583,743.345,"--But I think that Mr. Thomas as a trained lawyer and the Company's chief lawyer, particularly with the assistance of outside counsel, was in a far better position to ask the right questions and to get the answers, and to formulate what was necessary for him to give the corporation truly decent legal advice."
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,743.345,744.531,Weren't they factual inquiries?
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,744.531,760.791,"They were factual, largely, but inquiries as to when did you do it, who was present, were you aware of the laws, things of that kind, the very things that a lawyer would do when a client walks into the office and says, I may be in trouble here."
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,760.791,761.791,Other people might do it too.
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,761.791,767.294,"But I don't think they do it as well, Your Honor, and that's why the privilege has been given to the lawyer and not to the financial adviser."
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,767.294,769.896,"What did you do, and when did you do it?"
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,769.896,777.518,"No, that's a preliminary question, but in asking him what he does he maybe comes up with something."
1980.79-886,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,785.858,791.845,Are you saying that the first thing a lawyer should do when he is confronted with a problem by a client is to get the facts?
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,791.845,792.728,"I am, Your Honor."
1980.79-886,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,792.728,799.832,And then he can't have any opinion about the law until he has some facts to which to apply the law?
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,799.832,803.919,Or any opinion he has about the law without the necessary facts isn't worth very much.
1980.79-886,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,803.919,827.518,"Mr. Gribbon, what if the general counsel without the authorization of the board simply felt that there's something wrong here and I'm going to blow the whistle on this board because I think they're covering up some stuff, and went around and conducted exactly the same interviews?"
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,829.585,837.641,"If he was acting for the corporation and I think in the case you have given he would be acting for the best interests of the corporation, I think the corporation would have the privilege."
1980.79-886,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,848.014,862.172,What would happen if you get two corporations and one gets his general counsel to do it and another one gets its vice president who is not a lawyer to do the exact same thing?
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,865.643,873.314,I think the indications are that in that situation where a senior official not a lawyer did the job that no privilege would attach.
1980.79-886,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,873.314,884.204,And then the next corporation did the exact same thing with a man who happened to be a member of the bar?
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,884.204,886.639,More than a member of the bar?
1980.79-886,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,886.639,887.789,The same question now.
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,887.789,888.623,A trained lawyer.
1980.79-886,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,888.623,891.358,The same questionnaire.
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,891.358,893.377,"But I say... well, it might be or it might not."
1980.79-886,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,894.377,895.845,To the client it would be the same.
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,895.845,897.678,"--Well, if you'd--"
1980.79-886,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,897.678,900.047,"If you buy that, you're going to be in trouble."
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,903.099,909.819,"--If a finance president can do exactly the same job that a trained lawyer can do, then I have to go along with your answer."
1980.79-886,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,924.012,928.114,I'm glad to see somebody else recognize the difference between a lawyer and a member of the bar.
1980.79-886,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.249,936.986,"Mr. Gribbon, supposing when he got all through when his investigation, he said to the president, my advice to you is to fire the ten branch managers."
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,939.672,945.076,--I think the privilege would survive as to the communications.
1980.79-886,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.134,967.107,"What I'm really inquiring is, how do we know whether the advice that this executive, who is both a lawyer and an executive, gives is properly considered legal advice, because it may well be kind of a blend of management and legal advice?"
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,967.107,971.909,"--Well, I suppose that's probably true even if an outside counsel had done it entirely."
1980.79-886,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.618,1024.058,"But this is... this wasn't the rationale below, I take it, whether it was legal advice or not?"
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1024.058,1024.441,No.
1980.79-886,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.441,1027.676,But the Government would like to make it--
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1027.676,1032.462,The Government now feels that they'd like to back away from the scope question by saying it wasn't legal advice.
1980.79-886,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.988,1052.142,"--Do you think the Government is entitled to make, as a respondent entitled to make this argument?"
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1053.526,1055.66,I think they're probably entitled.
1980.79-886,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1060.481,1062.599,Unless it would expand their relief.
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1062.599,1066.301,"No, I don't think it would, necessarily."
1980.79-886,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1075.991,1083.93,"Well, they couldn't rely on it at all if they had not preserved it on their appeal from the District Court to the Court of Appeals."
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1083.93,1087.898,"Well, they didn't, they didn't preserve the matter of whether it was legal advice."
1980.79-886,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1308.508,1317.28,Do you think it would have a tendency to lead lawyers to write less and have long distance telephone calls more?
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1317.28,1318.897,"I think it would, Your Honor."
1980.79-886,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1484.105,1488.408,"Well, isn't there tension in more ways than one here, isn't there?"
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1501.549,1502.835,--I think that's right.
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1603.615,1612.388,"The privilege generally covers both the communications from the client to the lawyer as well as the advice that the lawyer gives the client, isn't that correct?"
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1616.256,1620.31,"--Generally speaking... yes, on the theory that the lawyer can't really give the advice without incorporating some of the facts."
1980.79-886,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1620.31,1621.093,Without having factual knowledge.
1980.79-886,0,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,1633.451,1633.951,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-886,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1732.198,1746.29,Mr. Wallace?
1980.79-886,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1746.29,1751.092,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-886,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1843.102,1851.458,Doesn't the privilege extend to any agent of a client who's acting as an agent of the client?
1980.79-886,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1851.458,1852.81,Acting as an agent.
1980.79-886,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1876.841,1878.007,Imparting his own impressions.
1980.79-886,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1878.007,1882.292,--himself... imparting his own knowledge that the client may not know.
1980.79-886,2,20887,daniel_m_gribbon,,3596.96,3598.496,May it please the Court:
