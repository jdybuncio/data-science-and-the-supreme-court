2018.17-1471,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.44,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-1471, Home Depot versus Jackson. Mr. Barnette."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,7.44,19.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Home Depot is a defendant under any reasonable construction of that term and, in fact, that's our only role in this case."
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,70.8,94.28,"I'm not quite sure, putting this outside the class action setting, generally, all defendants have to agree to removal and with some other limitations. If you're now an additional defendant to the action, why do you -- why don't you need Jackson's approval to remove? And he's not approving because he's opposing you."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,94.28,95.36,"I don't expect he would, Your Honor."
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,127.12,127.96,But that's not true.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,127.96,128.8,Presume --
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,128.8,133.4,All defendants don't have a shot at removal.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,140.64,141.4,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,141.4,147.28,So not every defendant individually has a right to removal.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,147.28,153.68,"Your Honor, in Shamrock Oil, the Court looked at that history, looked at -- basically, Congress had said plaintiffs can't remove."
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,166.24,173.88,My point still remains that the statute by its own form doesn't guarantee the power to every defendant to remove.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,173.88,180.6,"So, in Shamrock Oil, the Court, Your Honor, held because of this binary selection that Congress has made, you're either a plaintiff or a defendant."
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,180.6,181.84,"Well, how about in a -- how about --"
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,181.84,183.24,"If you're the plaintiff, then you're not the defendant."
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,183.24,192.92,"If your theory is this right of removal, how about an involuntary plaintiff? Under Federal Rule 19(a)(2), some people can be made involuntary plaintiffs."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,196.04,196.68,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,197.4,197.8,Would there be --
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,197.8,198.76,-- is given to the defendant or the defendants --
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,198.76,199.36,They never had a chance --
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,199.36,201.04,-- under 1441(a).
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,201.04,203.28,They never had a chance to pick a forum.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,206.52,207.04,So the Shamrock --
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,207.04,212.92,"Which is that everybody should have one opportunity to choose their forum, correct?"
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,212.92,216.88,A defendant -- the defendant or the defendants is entitled to remove under 1441(a).
2018.17-1471,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,233.64,233.68,So --
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,233.68,236.6,This Court in Merchant Heat & Light said you step into the role of the plaintiff.
2018.17-1471,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,236.6,255.0,"So, counsel, if I understand your answer to Justice Sotomayor, it's that counterclaim defendants count as defendants for purposes of 1441, but plaintiffs don't, even though they -- counterclaim defendant -- plaintiffs don't, even though they're the original defendant."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,255.0,255.32,It -- it --
2018.17-1471,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,255.32,277.84,"Now how can it be that the word ""defendant"" expands and contracts like that? I -- I could understand an argument that everybody who's a defendant in any claim in the case might count as a defendant for purposes of 1441, but what I can't abide or understand at least is how the word ""defendant"" could -- could be so Procrustean as to just happen to fit you."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,277.84,284.64,"Your Honor, just to briefly adjust what you said in your question, if I may, we're not saying counterclaim defendants."
2018.17-1471,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,301.92,302.8,But -- but -- but that doesn't --
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,302.8,304.6,"If you're not a plaintiff of any sort, you have to be a defendant."
2018.17-1471,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,304.6,313.72,"Counsel, that still just -- I got it, but that doesn't answer the question, though, all right? You're saying that the plaintiff here is no longer -- doesn't qualify as a defendant --"
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,313.72,313.8,Correct.
2018.17-1471,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,313.8,317.64,-- even though the plaintiff in this claim was the original defendant.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,322.44,338.88,"Again, because, as this Court said in Merchant Heats & -- Merchants Heat & Light, excuse me, once you file that additional claim, third-party claim, you then -- that original defendant steps into the role of plaintiff. And just like any other plaintiff, like the original plaintiff, like this defendant-plaintiff, those parties just go along with the removal."
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,341.04,346.88,Does your theory fall apart if we don't accept your claim-by-claim analysis? You approach this claim by claim.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,366.56,386.24,"Your Honor, you're correct, 1441 and 1453 talk about -- I'm sorry, 1332 talk about removing the civil action -- and 1446 -- but the point here is this Court held very clearly in Exxon -- Exxon versus Allapattah you have to look at the claims within the civil action to determine jurisdiction. Rule 8 is a short and plain --"
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,386.24,386.88,That's different than --
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,386.88,388.84,-- statement of a claim entitling you to relief.
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,395.76,401.24,"The removal -- the removal statutes say you look at the cost -- you look at the action, not the claim."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,401.24,406.68,"Well, 1446(b) says that once there's a claim that establishes jurisdiction, that's when you have 30 days to remove."
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,409.2,410.4,But it's so --
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,410.4,411.36,-- the overarching matter or lawsuit.
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,411.36,418.84,"You don't have a right under your theory to -- well, you have a right that you don't have normally."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,434.6,440.76,"Your Honor, this case is a qualifying class action under CAFA that, by definition, is within the original jurisdiction of the district courts."
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,441.04,441.08,No.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,447.28,448.88,The claim we removed is the class action.
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,450.76,451.8,"Well, that is true, but --"
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,451.8,453.12,"So we're not a counterclaim defendant, if I could point that out."
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,453.12,463.88,"But, under your theory, if there's a counterclaim defendant and it's not filing an original action, you could still remove?"
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,463.88,465.64,"I'm sorry, could you repeat that, Your Honor?"
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,465.64,473.48,"Is it -- if you're looking at the claim, if you're a counterclaim defendant, are you looking at the original action or are you looking at your action or your --"
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,473.48,474.96,We're looking at the claim that's being removed.
2018.17-1471,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,497.28,522.56,"But, Mr. Barnette, as -- as Justice Sotomayor was saying, 1441(a), which is the principal removal statute, says that a civil action, not claims, but a civil action can be removed where the district courts have original jurisdiction. And what I've always taken that to mean is that to look for original jurisdiction, you look to the plaintiff's complaint, the original plaintiff."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,535.48,543.32,"Again, Your Honor, this class action qualifies under CAFA, which establishes that it's within the original jurisdiction of the district courts."
2018.17-1471,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,543.68,569.32,"Well, your claim might be under the original jurisdiction of the district courts if it had -- or not your claim but the claim to which you are defendant, if that had started the lawsuit. But that didn't start the lawsuit. The lawsuit, the civil action, was started by a claim that's completely non-federal in nature. And you look to the original claim to decide whether the courts have original jurisdiction, don't you?"
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,569.32,585.24,"Your Honor, this is a somewhat unusual situation, although it's becoming increasingly less unusual because these class actions keep getting filed. But, to your point, Mr. Jackson essentially filed a new civil action in the existing case. Rule 3 says a civil action commences with the filing of a complaint in court."
2018.17-1471,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,585.24,620.68,"Well, it might be unusual, and it might be that the rules weren't contemplating this situation, although I don't really think that that's true, because the rules contemplate very liberal joinder and of all parties. But, regardless, the rule is the rule. And the rule says, when you try to figure out removal, you look to whether the court, the federal court, would have original jurisdiction of the case. And to do that, I mean, I have to say there's only one -- one place to look to decide whether original jurisdiction exists, and that's to the plaintiff's original complaint."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,620.68,622.96,"Respectfully, Your Honor, I don't believe that's what the statute says."
2018.17-1471,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,643.28,652.12,"I mean, the question is you would -- you would be right if this claim started -- excuse me, if this action started with the claim against you."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,673.88,681.44,"Your Honor, I would agree with that analysis if 1441(a) said only claims brought by the original plaintiff or only the original defendant can remove, but it doesn't say that."
2018.17-1471,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,681.44,682.2,"Well, it said --"
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,682.2,684.12,All it says is original jurisdiction.
2018.17-1471,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,686.8,690.56,"I mean, to -- to -- I'm repeating myself, but to decide whether --"
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,690.56,691.48,"Sorry, I feel like I am as well."
2018.17-1471,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,691.48,694.0,"-- original jurisdiction exists, you look to the original claim."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,696.76,715.88,"Well, Your Honor, again, we don't think that's -- we think that's an atextual reading of the statute. I would also point out that the other side has said the sort of unanimous view of the lower courts that you can only have the original defendant remove and you can't look beyond that. Actually, the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits have allowed additional party defendants, new defendants added to cases to remove."
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,738.24,738.84,Are you -- are you --
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,738.84,739.36,They can't -- sorry.
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,739.36,759.28,"Listen, I -- there is -- what I'm about to say has some flaw, and I'm trying to figure out what it is because they don't really make this argument, and, therefore -- but -- but I -- it stopped me and I wanted to see what the answer was. All right."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,763.08,763.96,Correct.
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,763.96,764.48,Okay.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,796.4,798.52,"Or a state court equivalent, Your Honor."
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,798.52,801.56,But that wasn't a class action.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,817.16,817.92,"Yeah, we didn't bring a counterclaim at all."
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,817.92,821.76,"No, no, no, no, it's somebody, the -- I'm sorry, the other -- the other -- the plaintiff did."
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,830.72,838.48,"But -- but, look, A sued B, and A is the plaintiff and B is the defendant, and then B sued you."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,838.48,839.04,Correct.
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,839.04,843.32,"So you're C, okay, over here."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,855.64,857.12,"Yes, we don't --"
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,857.12,859.0,"I don't think he did, did he? Where does it say he did?"
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,859.0,859.36,I think we clearly --
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,859.36,860.96,What he did was he filed a --
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,860.96,863.24,I think we clearly did under CAFA.
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,863.24,873.92,"He says he brings -- that's what he says, but he's bringing within the rules -- he's bringing within the rules, what is it called, a third-party claim?"
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,873.92,878.2,"Again, Your Honor, there's a lot of shorthand that's involved in this and, unfortunately, it's just generally inaccurate."
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,881.32,882.16,Forget what you're not.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,889.92,890.0,Or a --
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,890.0,897.64,-- did the person who filed the class action whose name happens to be B -- (Laughter.)
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,897.64,903.52,-- did that person file a civil action under Rule 23?
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,903.52,904.08,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,904.08,905.48,Yes? How do we know that?
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,905.48,918.48,"I would -- I would turn the Court's attention to Dart Cherokee, where you ran through the CAFA analysis on the slip opinion at page 2 and said 1453 directs you to 1332(d), as you noted. We look at (d)(1) for the definitions of class actions."
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,918.48,918.56,Yes.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,918.56,920.96,That's a filing under Federal Rule 23 or a state equivalent.
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,920.96,922.68,It is? Where does it say that?
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,922.68,924.4,In 1332(d)(1).
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,924.4,931.48,"No, no, no, I know. Where does it say the rule that when a defendant files a class action, namely B --"
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,931.48,932.44,What they're --
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,932.44,953.2,"-- against C, that that is an action filed, a civil action, because civil actions are usually filed by plaintiffs, where does it say that that action filed by B is a civil action filed under Rule 23? That's a simple question."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,953.2,957.96,A couple things. 1332(d) just refers to a filing by a representative party.
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,964.92,966.2,Why are you still not giving direct answers?
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,966.2,967.68,"In the civil action, he was defined as B2."
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,967.68,972.84,Because what he says is -- it says a civil action --
2018.17-1471,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,972.84,983.6,The argument is that what Mr. Jackson filed against you was not a civil action filed under Rule 23.
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,983.6,985.68,That's right. Exactly.
2018.17-1471,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,986.76,1033.0,"And if that is the case, then I don't know what rules would govern this claim that Jackson filed against you. Is this some kind of class action that is -- is this some sort of suit that is sort of like a class action, but it's not under Rule 23, so none of the requirements of Rule 23 would apply? I mean, the argument is -- it's a clever argument, comes out of I don't know where -- the argument is, no, it's not, he didn't file a class action against you under Rule 23, but, when the court adjudicates this action, it should apply the rules that -- it should apply the Rule 23 rules."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1033.0,1040.4,"Your Honor, again, I would just point the Court to Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which says a civil action is commenced by filing a complaint in a court."
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1040.4,1040.6,Exactly.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1040.6,1043.52,He filed a class action complaint in court against Home Depot.
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1043.52,1044.6,"No, no, that's the problem."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1044.6,1045.72,That commences the civil action request.
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1045.72,1046.28,That's the problem.
2018.17-1471,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1046.28,1052.96,"Mr. Barnette, under your theory, every time one party joins another party, we would have a new civil action."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1052.96,1053.28,"No, the --"
2018.17-1471,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1053.28,1053.84,But we don't.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1064.6,1065.72,"Your Honor, that's not our position."
2018.17-1471,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1072.0,1104.64,"So you're -- you're -- you're -- you're -- you're excluding one kind of claim, which is the claim against an original plaintiff, but there -- there can be many, many parties under the -- the federal rules and there can be counterclaims and there can be cross-claims and there can be impleaders and there can be all kinds of arrows going in every which direction. And you're suggesting that every one of those is a new civil action under Rule 1441(a), which is the one that I'm focusing on, and I'm suggesting that that's wrong."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1109.6,1111.28,"No, Your -- Your Honor, respectfully, we disagree."
2018.17-1471,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1133.4,1133.64,Mr. Barnette --
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1133.64,1134.0,That's all that happened here.
2018.17-1471,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1134.0,1147.2,-- you're suggesting that we should look at this case as though the original claim never occurred and we should pretend that the claim started with the original defendant. But the case did not start with the original defendant.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1171.6,1178.16,The plain language of 1441 and CAFA give us original jurisdiction over this claim.
2018.17-1471,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1178.16,1178.88,"Over the claim, but --"
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1178.88,1178.96,And we -- we would --
2018.17-1471,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1178.96,1182.84,-- but 1441 does not speak in terms of claims.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1182.84,1183.12,Right.
2018.17-1471,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1197.4,1206.16,"Yeah, but the reason why claims are -- are there is that's to deal with a plaintiff that's bringing three claims and one of them raises a federal question and two of them don't."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1229.28,1232.64,"Respectfully, Your Honor, that's not what 1441(a) says."
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1362.56,1388.88,"Can I ask a question about -- because it is important to me -- about how lower courts have interpreted things for decades now since Shamrock. Basically, your argument has been rejected by virtually every district court. Not surprising it hasn't gone to the circuit courts because you generally can't appeal a remand."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1388.88,1390.64,"Pre-CAFA, that's correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-1471,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1390.64,1426.32,"That's correct. So, to me, doesn't that have some force? Couldn't and shouldn't I presume that, given the state of the law, which was unanimity on this question, why shouldn't I presume Congress, in -- in creating this class action statute, removal, and in addressing these questions over the years, wouldn't have understood that this was the state of the law? That your position was not accepted?"
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1426.32,1430.52,"Well, again, Your Honor, that's actually not an accurate state of the law."
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1481.04,1486.76,"I hate to do this, but let me do the -- I don't hate that much. If you have something else important to say, I'll figure it out."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1486.76,1488.04,"No, go ahead, Your Honor."
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1488.04,1488.36,"I mean, I --"
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1488.36,1489.84,"Not as important as what you're going to say, I'm sure."
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1489.84,1490.36,Not -- (Laughter.)
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1490.36,1493.16,"No, that is not likely so."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1497.8,1498.0,I'm sorry?
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1498.0,1499.84,I don't think I -- I've shown you what I'm doing.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1507.44,1509.08,A qualified class action --
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1509.08,1509.4,"No, wait."
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1511.64,1512.12,All right.
2018.17-1471,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1512.12,1514.84,I don't want to interrupt your rebuttal time.
2018.17-1471,0,63088,william_p_barnette,,1514.84,1515.44,All right.
2018.17-1471,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1517.4,1523.44,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bland."
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1523.44,1555.04,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court: Since -- the original jurisdiction idea has really been set forth here and Justice Sotomayor correctly pointed out that the case law under 1444(a) is virtually unanimous in our behalf, and what my friend says is that actually there's a division among the case law, that the Fifth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit disagree. The Fifth and Eleventh Circuit cases, Your Honors, are talking about a different statute."
2018.17-1471,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1575.2,1587.2,"Well, but it -- it -- 1446(b), which is setting forth the procedures for removal, it refers to the notice of removal of a civil action or proceeding."
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1587.2,1589.0,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1471,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1589.0,1592.4,"Well -- so it doesn't have to just be a civil action, does it?"
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1592.4,1592.72,Well --
2018.17-1471,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1592.72,1613.0,"However you want to conceptualize it, it seems to me that you might conceptualize it as including what would otherwise be a freestanding proceeding, such as the one that -- where B sued C, but then it also talks about a proceeding. And even if you don't think that's a civil action properly conceived, it's certainly a proceeding of some kind, isn't it?"
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1613.0,1643.88,"Well, I -- I don't think it's a -- a proceeding is not an action over which you'd have original jurisdiction under 1441(a), and as I understand the relationship between 1441(a) and 1446, Your Honor, 1441(a) is -- is the part of the removal statutes that says here are the types of -- here -- here are cases over which there's removal jurisdiction. And then 1446 are the procedures that go through -- you have to have -- everyone has to agree and you have to do it within so many days and this sort of thing."
2018.17-1471,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1643.88,1647.0,"Well, do you think those procedures apply to 1441(a)?"
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1647.0,1657.84,"They -- they do apply to 1441(a) except where they've been amended by CAFA, but 1441(a) is where the grant of original jurisdiction -- or where the grant of jurisdiction comes from."
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1754.56,1767.16,"But what you're arguing is not based on the language, not based on the term ""original jurisdiction"" in 1441. It's based on the well-pleaded complaint rule. Am I right on that?"
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1767.16,1768.96,"Actually, Your Honor, I don't think you are right."
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1787.44,1787.72,Yeah.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1788.12,1789.2,But -- but -- but -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1790.08,1790.72,"No, go ahead."
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1790.72,1791.0,Okay.
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1807.52,1813.76,"Yeah, but you're saying -- you're -- you're -- there would be original jurisdiction if this claim were in the case at the beginning."
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1819.12,1819.72,"Yeah, that's right."
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1819.72,1822.0,"So you're reading that into the text, and you make --"
2018.17-1471,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1822.0,1823.56,"Well, original is at the beginning, isn't it?"
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1823.56,1824.16,No.
2018.17-1471,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1824.48,1825.96,It's jurisdiction at the beginning from the original complaint.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1825.96,1827.6,I -- I totally agree with you. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1827.6,1830.28,You agree with Justice --
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1830.28,1831.16,Yes.
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1832.08,1835.68,-- with Justice Kagan's answer to my question? (Laughter.)
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1835.68,1840.28,"There -- there -- I don't -- I -- I feel like I'm making a TV commercial, but there's only one original."
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1845.4,1848.16,"Well, this is -- this is -- this case is very, very complicated."
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1863.48,1874.52,"No, because, in -- in the context of 1441(a), defendant is, in that setting, is a defendant in a civil action where there is original jurisdiction."
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1874.52,1874.76,Okay.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1879.6,1880.12,They're -- they're --
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1880.12,1881.8,They are some kind of defendants.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1881.8,1885.32,There -- there are lots of colloquial ways in which they would be termed a defendant.
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1888.4,1888.56,Yeah.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1901.64,1909.24,"Shamrock Oil was the first case to look at a counterclaim defendant from this Court, yes."
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1909.24,1909.44,Right.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1930.8,1936.0,"Well, first, I want to -- Shamrock Oil is -- is ultimately looking at -- at the text."
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1958.04,1958.36,Right.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1959.48,1961.88,Citibank could never have brought this case in federal court.
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1968.52,1969.76,"Yeah, but Citibank is gone."
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2012.88,2022.0,"There -- there -- there are a number of premises, Your Honor, with which I strongly disagree. So, first of all, CAFA doesn't change what 1441(a) says."
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2057.88,2058.84,Since when are law review --
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2058.84,2059.88,-- we're worried this is going to be a lot of our problem.
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2059.88,2061.0,Since when are law review articles peer reviewed?
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2061.0,2062.16,"You know, that's a good point."
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2062.16,2063.44,Who are they -- who are they reviewed by? (Laughter.)
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2063.44,2064.28,You're totally right.
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2066.52,2067.36,They should be -- maybe they should be peer reviewed.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2067.36,2068.76,"Law review articles are student reviewed, they're not peer reviewed."
2018.17-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2069.72,2072.28,I'm fine on law review articles. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2072.28,2074.04,But I have a question.
2018.17-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2105.04,2115.96,"-- is that I think they can't get into federal court without 1453 because not all defendants agree with them, or there are a variety of reasons they need 1453. Is that right?"
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2115.96,2117.6,So I -- I -- I agree that they cannot get in --
2018.17-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2117.6,2119.0,"No, I'm just saying, is that right?"
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2119.0,2119.6,It is.
2018.17-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2119.6,2119.92,Okay.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2201.92,2203.12,"You're right about that, yes."
2018.17-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2203.12,2205.32,"If I'm right about that, why didn't you make that argument?"
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2205.32,2241.4,"Because 1453 is essentially -- 1453 amends and changes essentially some of the provisions of 1446 that the Chief Justice was talking about. Essentially, they track each other. 1446 sets out the rules for removal, and then there were several rules around CAFA where -- where the -- where Congress was concerned that there were abuses, that cases were being -- were being kept in state court that should be in federal court, so just for class actions, 1453 changes some of the procedural rules. So you no longer require unanimity in all the defendants."
2018.17-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2251.0,2257.32,"Nobody says it is. All I'm saying is, do they need 1453 to be able to remove?"
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2257.32,2258.64,"For -- for CAFA, yes, they do."
2018.17-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2258.64,2259.08,Okay.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2259.08,2259.4,And they -- and they --
2018.17-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2259.4,2265.04,"And I look to who does it cover, and it covers a class action as defined in a different statute."
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2293.28,2314.68,"Well, I think -- I think that we were focusing on -- on 1440(a) as the grant of removal jurisdiction, 1446 as the procedures, and 1453 not as a new grant of removal jurisdiction but just more procedures. And so, to the extent that there's just no original jurisdiction over a civil action under 1440(a), we think that's the end of it."
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2324.04,2324.8,But I think that --
2018.17-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2324.8,2325.6,I wasn't trying to help you.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2326.2,2331.72,But I do think that 1440(a) is -- is where -- where this case starts and ends.
2018.17-1471,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2501.96,2502.76,I -- I have -- I have --
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2502.76,2539.44,"Well, perhaps it's not possible to decide this case in a way that doesn't go as -- doesn't effectively decide all these other different situations that you've -- you've posited, but if we look just at what happened here -- and this -- and this involves not -- I mean, this implicates not just the original removal statute but CAFA, is there any good reason why a claim like this, if you accept CAFA, why this should be -- should not be removable to -- to federal court?"
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2539.44,2542.56,"Yes, Your Honor, because CAFA is a balancing act."
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2551.52,2567.12,"When you think CAFA said, well, if -- if a claim like this is filed originally in federal -- in state court, it can be removed, but if it comes into the state court in this strange sort of back-door way, then it has to stay in state court."
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2571.12,2580.12,"So, first of all, I -- I do think it's possible because, as Justice Sotomayor said earlier, I think that you assume that Congress knows the backdrop against which it's -- it's legislating."
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2599.16,2601.04,"Well, I mean, that's -- I mean, that's based on the --"
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2601.04,2601.72,Congress could have done it.
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2601.72,2605.6,-- the idea that they -- they -- they were aware of these district court cases.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2607.52,2608.12,That's -- that's correct.
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2608.12,2612.04,"And they said, well, okay, we -- we want to accept that."
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2612.04,2612.24,Right.
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2612.24,2613.48,"I mean, that's --"
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2613.48,2619.52,"I mean, it's quite possible that Congress never thought of this because it just wasn't really a very big problem and it wasn't one of the issues that came up in the hearings."
2018.17-1471,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2635.24,2636.32,Is Home Depot -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2639.12,2640.88,"No, Your Honor, because --"
2018.17-1471,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2640.88,2643.36,And what -- what is it then?
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2643.36,2647.88,It's -- it's a -- it's a counterclaim or third- -- third-party claim defendant.
2018.17-1471,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2650.52,2653.24,"So, when it says any defendant, that doesn't include --"
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2653.24,2654.32,"Right, because --"
2018.17-1471,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2654.32,2655.44,-- that kind of defendant?
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2655.44,2662.72,"Right, because the word ""defendant"" in the removal statutes has this -- has this fixed meaning from 1440(a)."
2018.17-1471,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2676.88,2687.44,"Well, but that still means that a brown rabbit is a rabbit. In other words, when you were describing what they were, you said a counterclaim defendant or a third-party defendant, it's a type of defendant."
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2691.88,2699.12,"It's a type of defendant in a colloquial way, Your Honor, but I don't -- I disagree with the concept that it's a type of defendant for purposes of the removal statutes. I think for --"
2018.17-1471,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2699.12,2708.84,Where do people speak colloquially of third-party defendants? (Laughter.)
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2708.84,2709.32,Yeah.
2018.17-1471,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2709.32,2711.0,Which was not necessarily meant that way.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2714.84,2715.44,Right.
2018.17-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2775.56,2780.2,"But it -- that does say -- I mean, you know, you heard his policy argument."
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2810.92,2811.4,On the policy?
2018.17-1471,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2811.4,2814.64,On the policy and on the brown rabbit analogy.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2814.64,2815.96,Okay.
2018.17-1471,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3008.32,3028.64,"Well, they could have been -- they surely -- they could have been more specific in a way that favors Home Depot. They also could have been more specific in a way that favors you, right? It's pretty hard to argue that when they said any defendants, they said we're going to say any defendants because we don't want to include the kind of defendant that Home Depot is."
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,3028.64,3060.12,"Well, it's in a sentence where, if you look at the sentence as a whole -- if you look at the sentence as a whole, it says ""class action may be removed in accordance with Section 1446 without regard to whether any defendant is a citizen of the state in which the action was brought, except that such action may be removed by any defendant without the consent of all defendants."" When they used the word ""any"" there, they mean each and every."
2018.17-1471,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3086.76,3089.04,"Why isn't -- okay, each and every."
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,3096.0,3109.48,"Because what -- what their -- what the point of what they're saying is they're saying each and every defendant has a separate right to decide that they want to remove the case to federal court, that you don't have to have unanimity. And the Congress said the point of what we're aiming at here in the -- in the Senate report was to avoid unanimity."
2018.17-1471,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3109.48,3112.32,"Well, it still works with respect to Home Depot."
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,3112.32,3123.12,"I -- I -- with respect, Your Honor, it -- it's -- it is a -- a -- a -- a procedural change -- it -- that -- that -- that -- that tracks part of 1446 and says this doesn't apply here."
2018.17-1471,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3144.64,3150.36,"Is what you're saying, Mr. Bland, that 1446 changes a number of the procedures by which you can remove? It does not, it never before --"
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,3150.36,3152.44,1453 is the CAFA one.
2018.17-1471,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3152.44,3153.6,1453.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,3153.6,3155.76,1453 changes 1446.
2018.17-1471,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3155.76,3156.04,Right.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,3156.04,3156.64,"Sorry, but otherwise you're --"
2018.17-1471,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3156.64,3157.44,Exactly right.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,3157.44,3157.72,Sorry.
2018.17-1471,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3157.72,3161.8,I'm confusing things in an effort to make them more clear. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,3161.8,3162.52,That's my life.
2018.17-1471,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3162.52,3178.0,So 1453 changes a number of the procedures in 1446 so that there are different procedures in CAFA suits as to removal. 1453 does not -- does not purport to and simply does not affect the grant of removal jurisdiction.
2018.17-1471,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,3183.48,3193.0,"Yes, exactly, Your Honor. And so, if there are no further questions, that is -- that's exactly right, and if Congress wanted to change it, they could have. Thank you so much, Your Honors."
2018.17-1471,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3193.0,3197.52,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Barnette."
2018.17-1471,2,63088,william_p_barnette,,3197.52,3208.56,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A couple quick points, Your Honors. The compromises that were done in CAFA were on things like is the amount in controversy going to be $1 million or $10 million and they set it on $5 million."
2018.17-1471,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3268.64,3269.84,"Thank you, counsel."
