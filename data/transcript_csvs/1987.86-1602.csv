1987.86-1602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.8,"We will hear argument next in Number 86-1602, United Savings Association of Texas versus Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Inc.--"
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,63.983,72.619,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,143.726,148.848,"Mr. Cohn, were you representing the client in the proceedings below?"
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,148.848,149.309,Yes.
1987.86-1602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,149.309,161.367,And was a petition ever filed with the Bankruptcy Court for relief from the stay under Section 362(d)(2)?
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,161.367,162.168,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-1602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.672,174.877,I just wondered why no petition was filed for relief from the stay.
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,174.877,177.639,"Well, it was a petition for relief from the stay, Your Honor."
1987.86-1602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.901,210.37,Did the debtor have any equity in the property here?
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,210.37,210.921,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-1602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,210.921,211.732,"No, I didn't think so."
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,211.732,213.203,The debtor does not have equity in the property.
1987.86-1602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,213.203,213.343,Right.
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,213.343,216.074,And that was one of the findings of the Bankruptcy Court.
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,248.528,254.183,How long can that cost continue to be extracted from the creditor?
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,265.04,268.503,"No, Your Honor, (d)(2) does not set forth any kind of specific standard or time limit."
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.503,270.403,I'm sure nothing specific.
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,275.108,283.532,At some point it has dragged on so long and there is no little hope of any kind of reorganization that the Bankruptcy Court might terminate the stay on other grounds.
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,290.097,291.709,Do you think it can go on for two years?
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,291.709,294.27,"I have seen cases that have, Your Honor."
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.27,295.272,Should they?
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,295.272,305.24,"Normally not, Your Honor, but they should, and I think it is important to focus, in answering the question posed by this case, not on the single asset case."
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.726,355.756,"The only point I am making is that there is some outside limit that is introduced elsewhere in the Code upon how long the creditor has to eat the interest, in effect."
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,355.756,358.878,"I hate to be difficult, but I think the answer is yes and no."
1987.86-1602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,417.707,418.987,May I ask a question there?
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,422.61,424.46,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,424.46,437.079,"One of the rights you seek to protect is the right to get the benefits out of a foreclosure to which you have a legal entitlement, which may be better than having the debt paid according to its original terms."
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,442.032,448.086,"Well, I believe the oversecured creditor is protected, because... and this is one of the confusing things about the Opinion of the Court below."
1987.86-1602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,468.64,471.164,But he doesn't get the same benefit that the undersecured creditor gets.
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,471.164,471.763,He absolutely does.
1987.86-1602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,476.948,477.149,Yes.
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,477.149,478.127,And he is entitled to eventually--
1987.86-1602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,478.127,479.339,But he doesn't get the 12 percent rate.
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,482.031,489.167,"--We get 12 percent but not, if the debtor elects, under Section 1142, to reinstate the debt according to its terms."
1987.86-1602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,513.842,514.644,Not if he doesn't have the money.
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,514.644,519.818,"Well, if he doesn't have the money, then the debtor's interest and property is not being adequately protected."
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,519.818,524.202,So the other track disappears and you get 12.5 percent.
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,524.202,526.523,"That is correct, Your Honor, if the debtor can pay it."
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.854,533.238,"Favoring you over the oversecured creditor, which is Justice Stevens' point."
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,533.238,538.961,"It doesn't favor us because at the end of the case, you are eventually going to have the same result."
1987.86-1602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,569.672,572.755,He does not get to keep the overage.
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,578.0,588.104,"At most real property foreclosure sales, and certainly in Texas, the lender bids it in, and it is very difficult to find other buyers, and the lender effectively ends up owning the property."
1987.86-1602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,588.104,594.76,"If the property is substantially oversecured, if the debt is substantially oversecured, presumably the property would sell for more than the obligation."
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,594.76,595.911,If it is substantial enough.
1987.86-1602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,595.911,596.991,Yes.
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,596.991,598.162,It depends how much the gap is.
1987.86-1602,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,598.162,611.152,"And it is true, isn't it, that the oversecured creditor would, at the end of the line, get the contractual interest, not the amount of interest that you say the undersecured creditor might be entitled to get?"
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,611.152,611.953,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,729.578,734.77,He just took his security and foreclosed and thumbed his nose at the Bankruptcy Court.
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,734.77,749.0,"That is correct, Your Honor, because the cases under the Bankruptcy Act uniformly held that except in certain very limited circumstances where the secured creditor for some other reason was protected, the secured creditor was entitled to take back his property if the debtor had no equity in it."
1987.86-1602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,783.374,791.151,And then the secured creditor would have had whatever value there was in the security and used that money at whatever market rates?
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,791.151,792.934,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,834.292,843.659,"Well, the Code, as opposed to the Act, has disadvantaged the secured creditor in one degree, anyway."
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,858.561,860.112,I think it was a change in methodology.
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.386,867.858,"Oh, but it is a disadvantage not to be able to take your property and leave."
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,873.09,875.933,Not if you are being compensated for the cost of delay.
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.897,889.202,"Having your property is quite different from having some judge's estimation that you have gotten something as good as your property, isn't it?"
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,889.202,890.083,Yes.
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,890.774,905.805,"My point is that we all agree that the secured creditor is being disadvantaged by the Code and the question is, in addition to disadvantaging him to this degree, did the Congress, moreover, want to deprive him of the ability to make use of the time value of his money?"
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,905.805,906.914,I think very clearly not.
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1118.942,1127.38,"Mr. Cohn, can I ask you about some of the structural problems with the other portions of the statute that the interpretation you are putting on this creates?"
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,1127.38,1127.838,--Certainly.
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.838,1136.226,Subsection 362(b) provides for... you are moving under (d)(1).
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,1136.226,1137.375,Yes.
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1137.375,1145.081,"Which says the automatic stay can be terminated for cause, including the lack of adequate protection of an interest in property."
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,1158.481,1162.205,"Yes, although the question is phrased a little bit differently."
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1162.205,1166.264,"Nonetheless, you are saying that that comes to the same thing."
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,1225.007,1231.103,"I think the mistake in that analysis is that adequate protection, the (d)(1) section, is not directed just to this."
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.872,1243.74,"Well, (d)(1) isn't written just for this."
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,1245.713,1250.685,(d)(2) is not necessarily limited to a single asset case.
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.526,1296.507,"Give me an example, specifically."
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,1296.507,1299.549,I think an example would be... I can think of more than one.
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1323.326,1324.899,"No, I want the opposite."
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,1329.513,1332.385,--It might be a different kind of relief.
1987.86-1602,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.754,1340.87,"A case where you would be entitled to relief under (d)(2), you wouldn't be entitled to relief under (d)(1) anyway."
1987.86-1602,0,26659,h_miles_cohn,,1340.87,1354.52,"It would be the situation, I'll give you an example, where the creditor comes in and says we will offer you adequate protection by giving you a lien on other property or by paying adequate protection payments or doing something that meets the requirements of (d)(1)."
1987.86-1602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1391.255,1392.757,"Thank you, Mr. Cohn."
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,1395.038,1406.285,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1471.823,1476.386,"But the dramatic change has been the automatic stay, really."
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,1476.386,1482.64,"Not so, because there was an automatic stay pursuant to 1144, in prior law."
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1482.64,1490.056,I had a fair amount of experience representing creditors in bankruptcy under the Act and you just didn't have to put up with all this stuff.
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,1500.661,1513.881,"Well, I beg to differ with the Court, but at some point there was a time when in order to get an automatic stay effected, a debtor had to take affirmative action to do so."
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1536.495,1542.339,"Well, my private practice ceased in 1969 so that perhaps I just missed the Bankruptcy Rules."
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,1542.339,1544.94,I think perhaps that may be the case.
1987.86-1602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1546.562,1549.845,At least there was an understanding on reorganization.
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,1549.845,1551.255,"--Oh, yes, there was."
1987.86-1602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.887,1562.912,"But nevertheless, if a secured creditor was undersecured, what happened?"
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,1562.912,1599.687,"Oh, the case law is very clear from prior tot he enactment of the Bankruptcy Code under a steady stream of cases beginning with Sexton v. Dreyfus and ending with Nicholas, and then from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, starting with In re Murel, Third Avenue Transit, followed by Yale Express and Bermec, that the undersecured creditor was entitled to protection against the depreciation in the physical value of the property, not for lost opportunity costs."
1987.86-1602,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1913.777,1917.83,Isn't that the way Hand used it?
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,1917.83,1918.481,"No, clearly not."
1987.86-1602,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.272,1936.525,I didn't ask whether it was limited to the confirmation process.
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,1941.47,1942.241,"No, it was not."
1987.86-1602,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.241,1942.96,It was not?
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,1942.96,1943.451,It was not.
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2244.968,2250.774,Is United Savings getting any interest payments during the bankruptcy?
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2250.774,2253.737,"United Savings is not getting any interest, per se."
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2260.112,2266.205,And the reason it is not getting any interest is because of the bankruptcy proceedings?
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2266.205,2278.925,"The reason why it is not getting any interest at this time is because of the stays that have been entered on the District Court level and then on the Fifth Circuit Court level, staying the effect of the Bankruptcy Court's Order."
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2278.925,2283.199,"Yes, and of course, the Fifth Circuit has reversed the Bankruptcy Court's Order in effect."
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2283.199,2286.632,"Yes, that's correct, and so a stay is no longer necessary."
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2286.632,2295.978,"If the Fifth Circuit's view prevailed, United Savings will continue through the proceeding without receiving any interest on its debt."
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2295.978,2297.24,No question about that.
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2310.079,2317.945,"The question I asked was whether United States was receiving interest, and you have answered it by saying no, it isn't receiving interest."
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2317.945,2319.025,It is not receiving interest.
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2382.039,2388.603,"This case may be an egregious example of extension, because of litigation of important issues, as you suggest."
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2388.603,2388.844,Correct.
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2388.844,2400.751,"But under the rule held by the Fifth Circuit, secured creditors such as United States Savings would not get interest pending the bankruptcy."
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2400.751,2401.262,Correct.
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2618.957,2624.202,"The bankruptcy law has always distinguished sharply between secured creditors and undersecured creditors, hasn't it?"
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2624.202,2638.161,"In certain circumstances, yes, but the Bankruptcy Code has never distinguished secured creditors and undersecured creditors based on the ability to receive lost opportunity costs."
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2638.802,2644.576,"Well, supposing, though, that this bankruptcy is ultimately dismissed."
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2649.009,2649.36,United Savings.
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2649.36,2657.014,"United Savings, entitled to get accrued interest out of the security as well as principal?"
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2657.014,2660.617,"At that time, it becomes moot, because it has the security, it has the collateral."
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2664.18,2666.283,Unless you're talking about how much it's bid in at.
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2666.283,2674.799,The amount that it will bid in will not be affected by this case or by our interpretation of Section 361.
1987.86-1602,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2682.894,2686.046,It will be a moot point.
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2689.178,2691.25,There is no question that it would be out that interest.
1987.86-1602,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2691.25,2692.169,You may consider it moot.
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2692.169,2693.962,There's no question about this.
1987.86-1602,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2693.962,2695.782,The good people at United Savings won't.
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2695.782,2695.932,This is a very unusual case.
1987.86-1602,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.932,2696.914,Pardon?
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2696.914,2699.324,"This is a very unusual case, because it has taken so long."
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2719.539,2721.99,"But they still would have been out six months' interest, wouldn't they?"
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2721.99,2725.272,Questionable.
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2725.272,2730.325,They would have been out the interest for however long the proceeding was in bankruptcy.
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2730.325,2738.54,"That assumes they would have taken the property into their REO Department and immediately sold it, which may or may not be the case."
1987.86-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2901.004,2904.124,May I ask you one question?
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2904.124,2904.424,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2904.424,2906.417,I hesitate to interrupt.
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2926.011,2926.699,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2926.699,2927.12,You do.
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2931.905,2932.225,No.
1987.86-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2937.15,2937.291,Yes.
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2937.291,2948.307,I don't believe that the concurring opinion adopted the idea that in some cases it was allowable and in some cases it was not.
1987.86-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2948.307,2948.457,I thought it did.
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2949.899,2954.541,I don't think that was the case that--
1987.86-1602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2954.541,2960.686,I don't' think it is entirely clear in the majority Opinion whether they agree completely with your view either.
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,2963.15,2963.758,--Right.
1987.86-1602,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2998.853,3003.157,"Well, it took the Eighth Circuit and it also took Chief Judge Clark."
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,3003.157,3013.564,"I am not certain that Chief Judge Clark, in his... I would have to read that concurring opinion again."
1987.86-1602,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3027.425,3031.388,"Well, I thought otherwise, and like Justice Stevens, I will have to read it again."
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,3031.388,3053.804,"Finally, I would like to point out two things out of the legislative history that are amusing, if not interesting."
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3174.382,3176.723,"Mr. Simon, your time has expired."
1987.86-1602,1,35151,leonarad_h_simon,,3176.723,3177.334,--Thank you.
1987.86-1602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3177.334,3180.196,"Mr. Cohn, you have seven minutes remaining."
1987.86-1602,2,26659,h_miles_cohn,,3180.196,3195.837,"I would like to begin by responding to Justice Stevens' question and just make clear what our position is on the Briggs issue, also."
1987.86-1602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3269.026,3278.713,"Mr. Cohn, do you agree with your opposition as to the status of the secured creditor before the Code was adopted?"
1987.86-1602,2,26659,h_miles_cohn,,3288.49,3289.99,"No, I don't agree with the way he sees it."
1987.86-1602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3301.108,3302.64,I know.
1987.86-1602,2,26659,h_miles_cohn,,3304.34,3304.701,Yes.
1987.86-1602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3305.872,3306.203,For which you made the motion.
1987.86-1602,2,26659,h_miles_cohn,,3306.203,3308.246,--There are two different periods of time.
1987.86-1602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3312.227,3312.477,Right.
1987.86-1602,2,26659,h_miles_cohn,,3312.477,3318.402,And there may be different standards or different rules of law involved at such point as the Plaintiff's reorganization is confirmed.
1987.86-1602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.402,3331.14,"Before the Code, would your client have been entitled to recognition of the time value of his interest in the property?"
1987.86-1602,2,26659,h_miles_cohn,,3331.14,3332.041,Yes.
1987.86-1602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3332.041,3334.392,"In this very case, in a case exactly like this?"
1987.86-1602,2,26659,h_miles_cohn,,3334.392,3334.662,Yes.
1987.86-1602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3344.93,3347.602,"There wouldn't have been, no, because there was no provision like that."
1987.86-1602,2,26659,h_miles_cohn,,3347.602,3354.276,"No, but I believed there would be protection for time value because the Court would have terminated the stay and given the creditor his property back."
1987.86-1602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3354.276,3356.007,With no equity?
1987.86-1602,2,26659,h_miles_cohn,,3356.007,3359.169,"Yes, if the debtor had no equity in property."
1987.86-1602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3359.169,3359.82,It didn't have to.
1987.86-1602,2,26659,h_miles_cohn,,3359.82,3365.093,"Yes, as I read the cases which are cited in the briefs, where the debtor had no equity in property."
1987.86-1602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.093,3366.314,In a reorganization?
1987.86-1602,2,26659,h_miles_cohn,,3366.314,3367.776,In a reorganization case.
1987.86-1602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3383.157,3388.95,"So you just say the cases that he cites to the contrary, he just mis-cites them, or they didn't hold that, or what?"
1987.86-1602,2,26659,h_miles_cohn,,3388.95,3390.602,I think they are inapposite.
1987.86-1602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3523.282,3537.831,"Assume we come to the conclusion, erroneous, I'm sure you think, that the secured creditor, prior to the adoption of the Code, would not have had the time value of his money and would have been deprived of it."
1987.86-1602,2,26659,h_miles_cohn,,3546.656,3547.067,Absolutely.
1987.86-1602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3554.602,3557.665,So what the law was before doesn't govern what the law is now?
1987.86-1602,2,26659,h_miles_cohn,,3557.665,3558.296,"No, absolutely not."
1987.86-1602,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3594.06,3595.262,"Thank you, Mr. Cohn."
