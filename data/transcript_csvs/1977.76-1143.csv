1977.76-1143,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,99.918,"We hear arguments next in 76-1143, Secretary of Labor against Barlow."
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,105.281,109.617,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1977.76-1143,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,239.026,249.921,"Would you indicate briefly, Mr. Solicitor General, the scope of that inspection, that is -- does it go just the machinery or books, records and files?"
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,249.921,258.478,"It would be limited to the premises, the work premises, occupied by Barlow's employees."
1977.76-1143,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,274.156,281.898,"General McCree, did the super session that you just referred to have any substantive consequences or was it just a change in name?"
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,281.898,284.769,"To the best of my knowledge, it's just a change of name."
1977.76-1143,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,333.429,341.99,Are there any specific criteria that are relied upon by their regional offices to make these decisions?
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,341.99,361.639,"Yes, if the Court please, the regional officers received the reports to which I made reference and determine then which industries produce the greatest number of industrial injuries and occupational disablements."
1977.76-1143,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,375.253,402.539,"Those schedules of public information, what I'm interested in with five million businesses subject to the Act on 80,000 inspections made last year is what guidelines or objective criteria, if any exist, that control the exercise of discretion by the individuals who decide whether this business or that business is to be inspected?"
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,402.539,416.633,"If the Court please, there is a -- there is a publication to which I'd like to reference, if I may."
1977.76-1143,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,551.921,562.418,"I suppose you would concede, Mr. Solicitor General, in this setting, the search warrant could not have been had on any specific -- any probable cause?"
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,562.418,564.121,We do concede.
1977.76-1143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.594,607.761,"But along with your facts, I take it that the entry was refused?"
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,607.761,609.958,"Entry was refused, if the Court please."
1977.76-1143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,609.958,613.547,"And that is -- that is not a crime or illegal, I take it?"
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,613.547,619.371,There is no criminal sanction attached to that nor does any civil penalty result there from.
1977.76-1143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.371,621.294,And what does the regulation say about it?
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,621.294,642.889,"Well, the secretary has adopted a regulation that provides in summary that the area and Assistant Regional Director and the Regional Solicitor shall promptly take appropriate action including compulsory process if necessary."
1977.76-1143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,679.661,685.343,And what does the United -- what does the United States -- what does the inspector submit to the Court to get such an order?
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,694.543,708.933,That is essentially the representation he makes to the Court and the Court in this case issued an order to show cause which permitted the employer to appear and assert any objection he might have.
1977.76-1143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,708.933,714.024,So it is more than the equivalent of a search warrant if you could've gotten a search warrant on this for this reason?
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,714.024,719.765,Considerably more because it's an adversary proceeding and the search warrant of course is ex parte.
1977.76-1143,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,719.765,722.831,"Well, it's both more and less isn't it, General McCree?"
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,735.954,748.913,"I obtained -- well if the Court please, we've suggested that a reasonable inspection scheme is the prerequisite for the issuance of an inspection warrant."
1977.76-1143,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,748.913,748.959,In an order -- of an order.
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,748.959,749.469,An inspection warrant --
1977.76-1143,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,749.469,752.311,-- of an order simply that under the statute is the --
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,752.311,757.395,Or an inspection warrant under Camara and See.
1977.76-1143,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,761.806,763.174,And on this firm.
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,763.9,765.059,But it wasn't necessary --
1977.76-1143,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,765.059,768.236,"No, that's -- that's the issue really in this case, isn't it?"
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,768.236,785.017,"But if this had an application been made for a search warrant, if the Court please, we suggest that that would have been the representation that would have been made to the magistrate ex parte and he would have issued --"
1977.76-1143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.017,785.9,Camara and See type.
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,785.9,787.338,Camara and See type.
1977.76-1143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,811.743,815.57,But what under -- what under your submission could the employer say?
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,815.57,841.523,"Well, as a matter of fact, the employer did say that he was entitled to the protection of the Fourth Amendment and that his premises could not be entered for that reason and I have the transcript and the Court inquired of the employer whether he wanted to show any reason why he shouldn't come in response to it."
1977.76-1143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.387,844.456,Well --
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,844.456,857.478,He never contended that there was no rational scheme of inspection which is the criterion set forth in Camara and See as a basis for the issuance of a search warrant.
1977.76-1143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.478,861.344,"And under your submission, that's about all what he could say?"
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,873.298,878.079,"Indeed, that's all he could say and he almost said that, but he didn't quite."
1977.76-1143,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,878.079,880.749,"Or he might have said it's harassment, he was here yesterday."
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,882.567,883.936,"Yes indeed, he might have."
1977.76-1143,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,885.498,891.992,"He wouldn't concede that this was a sufficient basis for entering this, Mr. Barlow's home, would you?"
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,895.004,896.536,"Oh, we don't argue that at all."
1977.76-1143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.381,914.101,And you don't take it that -- you don't say that the authored -- the court authorization would authorize entry in any other part of the premises?
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,914.101,914.499,"Oh, it did not."
1977.76-1143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,914.499,916.587,Or searching a desk or anything else?
1977.76-1143,0,36305,mccree_jr,,916.587,942.726,"It was carefully restricted and I have a copy of the order here, and it was carefully restricted to that part of the premises occupied by the employees that it'd be conducted during regular working hours or at other reasonable times within reasonable limits and a reasonable manner and it incorporated the regulations which strictly circumscribes."
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,1755.07,1760.254,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1977.76-1143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1818.107,1819.215,Or even enter.
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,1819.215,1822.004,"Or even enter, or even enter."
1977.76-1143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1882.382,1885.836,"Mr. Runft, before you get to that case, just so I follow your argument correctly."
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,1895.422,1904.013,"I believe, Justice Stevens, that there would have to be a showing of probable cause as set forth and as detailed in the Camara case."
1977.76-1143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1904.013,1912.219,"As to the probable cause, as to the particular business establishment or the probable cause to believe that some businesses like this maybe dangerous."
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,1912.219,1924.028,"I believe they would have -- there would have to be, in any case, some showing as to the particular business even, for example, in the case part in Camara, where you have an area, an area inspection."
1977.76-1143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1939.882,1950.83,"Your submission is that there is no right on the part of the Government and inspector to enter without probable cause to believe there was some violation of the statute within the premises, that's your submission?"
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,1950.83,1955.817,"It is my submission, Justice Stevens, but I do hold that there is a middle ground."
1977.76-1143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1957.777,1960.088,"-- your submission, that's not quite that extreme you want to make?"
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,1960.088,1963.197,"Yes, not as extreme as in the Camara case, perhaps."
1977.76-1143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.021,1985.676,"Well, do you think he has to have some suspicion that there is a violation?"
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,1988.943,2006.75,"Well, I believe the suspicion might arise from some or the factors such as the nature of the industry, such as the industry wide accident rate, for example, such as, perhaps, complaints of workmen and so on."
1977.76-1143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.66,2056.525,So I take it then there will be some industries that's low into the scale that they can enter without traditional probable cause?
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2056.525,2057.909,"I would say, that would be a question."
1977.76-1143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2100.608,2119.482,"Supposed, the statute had expressly given a Court jurisdiction to issue some sort of a piece of paper, a search warrant or something or an inspection warrant and that -- before you even go the premises."
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2131.622,2133.421,I would not.
1977.76-1143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.421,2139.605,What was the -- what was the shortcoming of the submission to the Court in this case?
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2139.605,2160.086,"The shortcoming of the submission to the Court in this case, Justice White, was simply that the United States attorney presented the fact that the Barlow establishment was an employer, the workers are employee there and that it fell into the jurisdiction of OSHA, that was the --"
1977.76-1143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2160.086,2161.956,So you just relied on the statute straight up?
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2161.956,2164.446,"Truly on the statute, that's all."
1977.76-1143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2201.554,2208.282,"Mr Runft, one is ex parte and the other is not."
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2212.222,2213.604,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1977.76-1143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2228.314,2230.787,"And you could then suppress, move to suppress."
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2230.787,2233.95,One can move across the warrant later.
1977.76-1143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2263.844,2265.204,Do you use the words search?
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2269.083,2274.966,"Mr. Chief Justice, I take the position that -- and I believe the Court has stated that this is anonymous."
1977.76-1143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2278.248,2280.731,"Well, I wonder if that's your views of the term."
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2280.731,2283.708,"Yes, I use them anonymously."
1977.76-1143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2286.183,2290.526,"You don't open any doors, do you?"
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2292.992,2295.482,I supposed -- you mean once you get into the building?
1977.76-1143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2295.482,2296.461,Yeah.
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2302.006,2302.314,"Well, in this particular --"
1977.76-1143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2302.314,2305.866,Is there anything more than eyeball search?
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2305.866,2306.734,"Yes, there is."
1977.76-1143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2306.734,2310.187,I thought it was restricted in the sense specifically in it.
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2310.187,2321.378,"If I could refer the Court to Exhibit A of the appellee's brief, we've set forth as exhibit A, the compulsory order of the Court in Idaho."
1977.76-1143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2321.544,2326.418,"Let's not just -- to me, that's not involving what I'm talking about."
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2326.418,2326.591,I see.
1977.76-1143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2326.591,2331.704,I'm talking about the right when he went there to go in without going to Court.
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2342.647,2343.865,That is correct Justice Marshall.
1977.76-1143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2343.865,2344.889,That's what I thought.
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2344.889,2345.747,Yes.
1977.76-1143,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2425.683,2434.765,"Mr. Runft, you make the point that to require the Government to secure a warrant would be no real burden on them."
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2436.321,2437.494,Yes.
1977.76-1143,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2441.777,2451.169,"Well, to the extent that you are right about that then what shows content for is no real protection to you, is it?"
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2451.169,2461.493,"Well I believe ti would be on this, Justice Stewart, because the secretary would have to carry the burden of making a probable cause showing --"
1977.76-1143,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2461.493,2488.143,"But in -- in the answer of the questions of my Brother White, I thought I understood you to say that all of the Government would have to show would be something along the lines of what was required in Camara and See i.e., that this is -- this is a statute duly enacted by Congress and signed by the President, it's a valid federal law that authorizes inspections of any place of business and he shows that."
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2498.109,2501.824,"If I may, in answer to that, it may not be enough."
1977.76-1143,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2507.797,2509.112,"No, no, what circumstances?"
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2509.112,2510.766,"Well, for example."
1977.76-1143,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2583.41,2585.039,This establishment or this industry?
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2585.039,2587.354,"This -- well no, in this particular establishment."
1977.76-1143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2597.007,2614.721,-- that supposed the application for the warrant presided that the accident rate was three times the rate of all other comparable people using the same kind of machinery that produce the same kind of goods in that area.
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2622.643,2630.745,"What I understand, Mr. Chief Justice, that that warrant regarding this aggravated accident rate referred specifically to the entity that was to be searched."
1977.76-1143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2675.301,2676.108,How about Camara?
1977.76-1143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2677.752,2682.483,It required no more than a showing of the rational area inspection program.
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2684.854,2708.59,"If I might -- that -- that is correct, Your Honor, except that the probable cause to issue a warrant must exist if reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an area inspection are satisfied and it is that word reasonable."
1977.76-1143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2738.825,2752.519,"Well, I hear you have a statute that purports to a -- to be concerned with the health and safety of conditions in all plants all over the United States with certain demand of exceptions."
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2782.393,2794.455,"I believe the answer to that lies, if I may, in the -- in the fact which has been brought out in number of opinions versus -- the Brennan versus Gibson Products opinion."
1977.76-1143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2905.552,2911.151,I'm trying to test out this showing on getting a warrant.
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2958.722,2965.846,"I believe that it would form objective evidence perhaps sufficient to do it, Your Honor, yes."
1977.76-1143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2965.846,2977.719,"And you say that's the kind of evidence, objective evidence that the Government must furnish in order to make the inspection."
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,2977.719,2984.111,"I would like to answer the question yes or no, Mr. Chief Justice, but I hesitate to do so for this reason."
1977.76-1143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3040.616,3051.758,Wouldn't the Judge asked all of those questions in this case and insisted on answers?
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,3051.758,3053.723,"He could have, Your Honor, but he didn't."
1977.76-1143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3054.486,3060.502,And couldn't -- and couldn't you had asked him to ask them?
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,3060.502,3067.686,The question was asked by me and he said this is a -- this is not a matter of warrant.
1977.76-1143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3078.052,3082.276,"I'm not quite, but you didn't make an offer of proof?"
1977.76-1143,1,32572,john_l_runft,,3082.276,3083.091,Yes.
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,3519.736,3536.576,"I would think not, if the Court please, and I would amplify my answer by pointing out that the secretary by regulation forbids the inspectors to search for matters other than those set forth in the regulation."
1977.76-1143,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3538.58,3557.774,"What if without searching, the inspector, OSHA inspector observed that predominantly they were Mexican, Americans, let us say, or any other alien group who could not speak English as he would observe objectively, first hand."
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,3560.902,3561.79,I would think not.
1977.76-1143,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3578.406,3597.497,"But my point is not whether it is true, but rather they may report that objective fact which they observe that 90% of the employees were appeared to be Mexican-Americans, or Cubans and 90% of them could not respond to questions put to them in English."
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,3597.497,3608.275,"If the Court please, there is a regulation that forbids the inspector from doing just that and I would expect them to abide by the regulation."
1977.76-1143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3742.621,3763.095,"Oh, Mr. Solicitor General, it seems to me that the secretary here with these regulations has indicated that -- that -- well, we'll just give him notice and he instructed his inspectors that if he refused entry, don't break in and take advantage of a -- of an unannounced entry, we'll have to go to Court."
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,3763.095,3766.916,"If the Court please, he first instructs his inspector to seek entry --"
1977.76-1143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3766.916,3767.523,"Well, I know, but he --"
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,3767.523,3769.819,-- without notice and they're even cohobations.
1977.76-1143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3769.819,3778.146,"Well, I know, but then he -- but then he permits him to be turned away and tells him that he is turned away to go to -- to go to Court."
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,3778.146,3792.976,"If the Court please, there are regulations which forbid giving advance notice of the intent to inspect, and they're even penalties on the employees who are disclosing the intention of inspecting."
1977.76-1143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3811.259,3817.397,"Well, it is the rare case when he has turned -- it is the rare case that he's turned down and all."
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,3817.397,3828.662,"It is -- it is the real the case that he's denied the right and we hope if this Court upholds the statutory scheme, it will be even rarer."
1977.76-1143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3828.662,3841.982,"Well what if -- what if the Court upholds that the -- and the person who -- the owner of the business establishment tells -- still says, “Don't come in,” and he's still not subject to any sanction?"
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,3841.982,3864.818,"Well, the -- the statute has not provided a sanction and then we suspect the secretary, again, would direct his inspector or he would threw his inspector, go to Court to get an order so that he might use the power of the Court to uphold the law and then, of course, the contempt citation would be sought if he refuse to obey it."
1977.76-1143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3868.317,3874.652,"If we -- if we agree with you -- if we agree with you, the secretary is left indecisive with the positioning he is now."
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,3874.652,3879.138,"Well, I -- I think he is in the case of recalcitrant persons."
1977.76-1143,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3890.826,3905.732,"In your view and the government's view, I suppose the unannounced investigation is parallel to the unannounced investigation that the bank examiners, for example, make?"
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,3905.732,3909.105,There are certainly parallels.
1977.76-1143,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3924.18,3933.26,"But the banking laws do prevent some sanctions for banks who -- if they turned -- turned away a bank examiner, do they not?"
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,3933.26,3949.044,"Well, if the Court please, I think the Congress has had more experience with regulating banking enterprises than it has safety and health which is an important matter in the nation's agenda of affairs that it's just adverted to recently."
1977.76-1143,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3949.044,3960.81,"Well, their differences in degree of pervasiveness of state regulation of banks and the congressional regulation of all employer establishments by OSHA, are they not?"
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,3960.81,3962.596,"Of course there are, Your Honor."
1977.76-1143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3962.596,3970.251,"And you justified your position primarily because of the existence of this basic federal statute, isn't it correct?"
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,3970.251,3971.501,That -- that's correct Your Honor.
1977.76-1143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3971.501,3979.792,"Now, what if Congress should pass a Housing Safety and Health Act?"
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,4008.402,4010.586,"Well, that presents a much more difficult question."
1977.76-1143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4010.928,4012.409,"But the argument would be the same, wouldn't it?"
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,4012.409,4024.691,"Well, my argument might not be the same because this Court is for a long time recognized that the very core of the interest to privacy is the residence of a person."
1977.76-1143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4072.549,4085.528,"But in the absence of this general legislation, you wouldn't claim for a moment that a federal agent could just enter anybody's, any employer's premises upon request, would you?"
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,4085.528,4086.918,I would not at all and the absence of --
1977.76-1143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4086.918,4089.76,"So, this is reasonable because of the legislation?"
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,4089.76,4091.63,Because the Congress has made a legislative determination.
1977.76-1143,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4091.63,4096.078,"And in my hypothetical case, it would not be equally reasonable because of the legislation?"
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,4096.078,4106.439,"Well, the Congress can legitimize certain things by its legislative act, so long as it's consistent with the Constitution of the United States."
1977.76-1143,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4132.867,4139.938,"But most of those -- so if an apartment building are now doing inspection about fire inspectors, are they not --"
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,4139.938,4140.14,I would think so --
1977.76-1143,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4140.14,4141.509,"-- just generally, everywhere?"
1977.76-1143,2,36305,mccree_jr,,4141.509,4149.502,"I would think so, but they're open generally to the -- to the public, I suspect, to delivery persons and so forth."
1977.76-1143,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4167.082,4168.434,Thank you gentlemen.
1977.76-1143,3,32572,john_l_runft,,4169.196,4170.519,Thank you.
