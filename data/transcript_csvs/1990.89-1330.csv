1990.89-1330,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.522,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-1330, the International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots v. Timothy A. Brown."
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,11.808,15.593,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.977,156.016,"Mr. Pierson, I take it that the court of appeals did not reach the question of whether the district court was correct in finding the union rule unreasonable?"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,156.016,156.535,--It did not.
1990.89-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,163.356,166.058,"And if we thought the rule were unreasonable, I guess we would--"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,166.058,175.08,"--Well I, I submit that this is not the proper forum to determine the reasonableness--"
1990.89-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.08,176.38,--You think it should be remanded--
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,176.38,176.814,--Yes.
1990.89-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.814,181.834,"--to the court of appeals for that determination if, it has to be taken into consideration?"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,181.834,182.384,That is correct.
1990.89-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,196.843,204.766,"Well, apart from the rule, do you think there is anything unreasonable about the respondent's request to communicate before the convention?"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,204.766,212.337,"--Our position in this case is based solely upon our election procedure, and we contend that the request--"
1990.89-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.337,219.591,"Well, my question is do you think there is anything unreasonable about that request, apart from the union's rule?"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,219.591,242.439,"--If we were litigating this case in another union that did not have that provision in the constitution, then... well, let me back up for a moment, because this gets to one of the problems in the distinction between the Fourth Circuit's approach and the Third Circuit's approach, which is that a request is not reasonable or unreasonable in a vacuum."
1990.89-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.466,263.603,"Well, if the union didn't have a rule, I suppose it certainly is possible to answer that question."
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,263.603,264.17,--If... that is correct.
1990.89-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.17,269.424,"And my question to you is, absent the rule, is there anything unreasonable about the request?"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,269.424,281.897,The... we do not take the position in this litigation that we... his request is unreasonable separate and apart from its relation to the union's rule.
1990.89-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,281.897,289.17,"What level of scrutiny do you think we need to apply in evaluating the union's rule, if it has to be taken into consideration?"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,289.17,316.487,"It seems to me that the Court should look at the circumstances of the promulgation of the union's rule, the circumstances of the union's election procedure, that is, whether there has been abuse of the type that LMRDA was intended to combat, entrenched incumbents who abused channels of communication with the membership, and also--"
1990.89-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,316.487,319.872,"Well, is it a level of scrutiny of rationality, in effect?"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,330.312,354.362,"--Well, I would say that rationality is one aspect of it, but I would also say that if there is a showing that the rule was adopted solely to impair the rights of candidates to communicate with the membership... now, I suppose that's an aspect of rationality because it goes to the question of what were the reasons for adoption of the rule and the circumstances of the adoption of the rule."
1990.89-1330,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,551.237,558.224,"Mr. Pierson, here we're talking about a very small fraction of what would be covered by union rules."
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,577.804,590.612,"Well, the... the union power to regulate the election procedure might affect campaign requests in a number of ways."
1990.89-1330,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,608.074,610.776,"Well, but, what... what burden would there be on the union?"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,610.776,613.727,"In this particular case, Your Honor?"
1990.89-1330,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,613.727,614.16,Yes.
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,614.16,619.631,"Well, this case is not simply about, from the MM&P's standpoint, Brown's request for literature."
1990.89-1330,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,620.114,620.731,"Well, it is."
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,628.403,638.609,"--I know, but what I mean to say is this, that Brown was not the only candidate running for office in the 1988 election, and the presidential election was not the only election being held there."
1990.89-1330,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,664.41,672.932,"Well, what sort of... let's apply a [inaudible] rule that you have to... the only thing you can claim for yourself is what others could claim equally, without hurting anybody."
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,681.872,694.096,--Simply that it would impose a greater burden upon the union to grant those requests at a time before it has made the determination as to who is a bona fide candidate.
1990.89-1330,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,694.096,700.749,"Well, so... you're saying that, what, is it time spent by union employees that would be the burden?"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,700.749,703.618,"That's not... no, we're not saying that's the sole burden, Your Honor."
1990.89-1330,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,723.115,725.651,How do you define bona fide candidate?
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,725.651,735.506,We would... the MM&P constitution requires that candidates meet a number of requirements at the time they are nominated in order to be eligible.
1990.89-1330,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,750.849,758.038,"Well, but these candidates, people who don't qualify, will ultimately be filtered out at some stage of the proceedings."
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,770.946,778.35,"Well, it seems to me that there is an institutional interest in seeing that the right is not abuse."
1990.89-1330,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,811.921,822.712,"Well, you say, in other words, that only someone who can meet all the union's rules for nomination is entitled to have the campaign literature distributed?"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,822.712,843.875,"--I am saying that the rule in this case, because it provides for the distribution right at a time when the ballot committee, an independent organization of rank and file members, has determined who is a candidate, that it is reasonable to draw the line there."
1990.89-1330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.295,916.59,"Mr. Pierson, I... do you... is it your position that it's not even a close question, that the language couldn't be interpreted the way Mr. Brown wants to interpret it?"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,916.59,918.173,The language of the statute?
1990.89-1330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.173,918.542,Yes.
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,944.324,944.924,I appreciate that.
1990.89-1330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.526,956.465,"--why shouldn't we take the Secretary's interpretation, which I... which I gather has been consistent, and why shouldn't we simply apply Chevron to his interpretation of this provision?"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,956.465,962.369,Well that requires us to answer the question of what is the Secretary's interpretation.
1990.89-1330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1034.084,1037.118,The Secretary has filed a brief here that supports Mr. Brown.
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1045.539,1048.241,"It does come within his administration, Your Honor."
1990.89-1330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1079.779,1101.026,"Mr. Pierson, one of the points made on the other side was that Mr. Brown wanted other potential candidates to know in advance that he was serious in running himself, so that others in effect might stand by and not declare themselves, as long as they knew someone who espoused their position was going to run."
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1104.895,1111.501,That is certainly a possible interest of a candidate--
1990.89-1330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1111.501,1111.768,All right.
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1111.768,1114.953,--in requesting a right to distribute literature.
1990.89-1330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1115.453,1116.603,So that the... I'm sorry.
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1116.603,1127.427,--I do take exception to any factual findings in this case because of the nature in which the case was tried in the district court and the fact that the district court would not permit us to put on evidence.
1990.89-1330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1130.795,1131.245,Okay.
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1154.328,1156.113,"That would be fair to say, Your Honor, yes."
1990.89-1330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1156.113,1184.716,"So, the upshot of those two points is that if Mr. Brown and others like him are allowed to come forward and circulate literature at the time that they want to do it, there is reason to believe that challenges to incumbent union leadership will be stronger challenges, and conversely, that the union leadership would have an interest in preventing challenges of such strength by the very rule that we have in this case."
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1185.649,1194.322,It is fair to say that the incumbent leadership would have an interest in denying such challenges.
1990.89-1330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1194.322,1199.475,They want a scattering of candidates rather than one or two strong candidates against them.
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1199.475,1206.129,"But we... where I take exception to your question, Justice Souter, is when you say"
1990.89-1330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1227.293,1241.052,"But it's still the case, isn't it, that the... that however adopted, this rule tends to favor incumbents, as against the rule, or lack of rule if you will, that the petitioner would have?"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1241.052,1251.074,Any type of rule might favor incumbents or favor insurgents.
1990.89-1330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1251.074,1252.943,"But this one in fact has a definite tendency to do that, doesn't it?"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1252.943,1260.68,I don't know that that's a finding or a conclusion that the Court can reach upon the state of this record.
1990.89-1330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1273.857,1286.747,"Well, I'm not saying that it was necessarily adopted with that motivation on the part of any individuals or segment of the union, but it seems to me that that is its natural tendency, and I'm not sure that we need fact finding for that purpose."
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1286.747,1298.222,It seems to me that it also could be said that any rule that places any restriction upon the right to distribute literature could favor incumbents.
1990.89-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1394.886,1396.619,"Mr. Pierson, you carefully leave out"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1416.316,1431.059,"Well that, that would have other problems, though, because such a rule would then place in the hands of the incumbents, that is the union's officers, the duty of determining on a case-by-case basis whether a request was reasonable or unreasonable."
1990.89-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1431.059,1431.659,"Well, what's so hard about that?"
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1438.463,1448.437,"Well, it does seem to me that no one in this case, including the respondent and the United States, has contended that there are not some unreasonable requests, that the statute does--"
1990.89-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1448.437,1450.639,"Sure, I say there are, but you don't have to distribute then."
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1454.838,1457.79,--The statute compels you to do that.
1990.89-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.79,1458.19,Right.
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1458.19,1461.592,"The statute does not tell you how to do that, but the statute does compel you to do that."
1990.89-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.592,1462.194,That's right.
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1462.194,1462.727,Yes.
1990.89-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1462.727,1464.177,I don't understand your point.
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1470.198,1489.511,"Well, what I was saying was that there are a number of ways in which a determination could favor the interest of an insurgent candidate, but that democracy is not simply equivalent to whether the insurgent candidate is hindered or helped."
1990.89-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1503.069,1505.438,I don't understand them to... arguing that.
1990.89-1330,0,45864,w_michel_pierson,,1519.613,1530.421,"Well, they are saying that any rule... that any interpretation of the statute that gives any sway to a union rule necessarily favors incumbents."
1990.89-1330,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1546.781,1547.967,"Very well, Mr. Pierson."
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1549.9,1552.919,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1598.649,1607.588,"Mr. Levy, in your first suggestion as to how the rule should be... the statute should be interpreted, you say that is the request reasonable in the light of all the circumstances."
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1611.29,1634.573,"I think there are circumstances in which the existence of a union rule is something that it would be useful for the court to consider, and indeed, although the district court focused squarely on the reasonableness of the union rule, even the court of appeals took note of the union rule and also noted that it had an adverse effect on the ability of insurgents to run for office."
1990.89-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1634.573,1645.546,"I mean, supposing there's a request for literature distribution as of July 1, and the union rule says we're not going to distribute any until July 10, and the election is a year away."
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1648.915,1655.402,I don't know that the existence of the rule would affect the reasonableness of the request.
1990.89-1330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.575,1705.835,"What if the union rule says requests to distribute... it's a big job... requests shall be in writing to prevent any confusion, and a particular candidate comes up and orally tells the president of the union I'd like to have this mailed out?"
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1705.835,1718.928,--It seems to me that that kind of a rule goes to the union's administrative burden in dealing with a request and possible ensuing litigation--
1990.89-1330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1718.928,1719.211,Right.
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1725.998,1736.204,"--We want to make as few mailings as possible, I would argue, is not an admissible reason for not making particular mailings."
1990.89-1330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1737.723,1740.342,"--I see, so some rules are okay and some rules are not okay?"
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1751.733,1773.246,"--I believe that with respect to that hypothetical, that given the union's need to be sure... I don't know what the union's argument for that particular rule would be."
1990.89-1330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1773.246,1775.348,So it depends on how good the union's argument is.
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1778.883,1780.049,"No, our position is this."
1990.89-1330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1892.738,1893.738,I don't know either.
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1894.388,1905.613,One point before I turn to how I would answer the question that I posed at the beginning with respect to the factual posture of the case.
1990.89-1330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.646,2161.931,All of that goes to show that this is an unreasonable union rule.
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,2161.931,2162.448,--No.
1990.89-1330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.733,2166.55,Isn't that your real complaint here?
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,2174.238,2189.165,"--As we argued in opposing cert in this case, this case can be disposed of on the ground that it is a patently unreasonable rule, and maybe you should wait for a better case to decide this question of whether you look at the reasonableness of the rule or the reasonableness of the request."
1990.89-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2314.681,2346.283,"Mr. Levy, the Secretary says that she is entitled to deference in interpreting the statute, and yet one of her regulations says that in order to avoid charges of disparity of treatment among candidates, it is advised that a union inform all candidates in advance of the conditions under which distribution will be made, and promptly advise them of any change in those conditions."
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,2398.649,2400.584,Let me answer that question in two ways.
1990.89-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2431.037,2433.389,"Well, that might mean if you change your rule, let us know."
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,2433.389,2477.518,"--The second point... the second point is that, with respect to the kinds of procedures or rules, if you were, that you are describing, those kinds of rules, because they deal with administrative burdens which have to be handled some way in connection with any request, given the statutory, for example, requirement of payment for the mailing, my arguments about adopting a non-deference to the union rule approach because it would disserve the purpose of the statute would not apply to those kinds of rules."
1990.89-1330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2571.63,2583.537,"You would rather have the challenger fight each request case by case instead of being able to proceed under a rule which, if he complies with, he knows that his request will be deemed to be reasonable?"
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,2583.537,2585.62,There is going to be a rule in either case.
1990.89-1330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2585.62,2586.989,Why is there going to be a rule?
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,2586.989,2587.672,Whether it is--
1990.89-1330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2587.672,2597.278,"If I were... if I were union management with the bad motivations that you posit, I simply wouldn't have a rule, and say okay, you want to do it this way, we'll judge case by case whether it's reasonable."
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,2598.797,2618.008,"--There is going to be a rule in either case because the rule is going to be set by the union leadership, or the rule is going to be set by common law adjudication of all of these cases, or the rule is going to be set... the rule of what is reasonable is going to be set perhaps by the Secretary's regulations."
1990.89-1330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2653.597,2663.239,But don't you want to concede that the rule should be given deference so long as the rule does not have a tendency to disfavor insurgents?
1990.89-1330,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,2663.239,2679.332,"I don't know that it's the tendency to favor... to disfavor insurgents that's necessary, because if that's the rule, then every time somebody comes in with a challenge to your denial they have to prove the tendencies are the general rule in the context of a preliminary injunction hearing."
1990.89-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2679.332,2683.134,"Thank you, Mr. Levy."
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2685.569,2698.912,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1330,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2740.286,2773.04,"Mr. Feldman, I hope in the course of your remarks you will tell us exactly what it is we need to defer to the Secretary on, and whether there is room in this scheme for union regulations of such things as all requests will be made in writing, they will be made 2 days in advance of the date for mailing, and it will include... you will have to pay us in cash or postal money order, or something of that sort, in advance."
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2773.04,2775.376,"Okay, let me take the first question first."
1990.89-1330,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2860.898,2877.277,"Well, the fact is it's desirable for everyone to know requests have to be made in writing or not, they have to be accompanied by payment or not, they have to give at least X number of days' or hours' notice or not."
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2878.994,2879.812,"--Yeah, well--"
1990.89-1330,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2879.812,2887.3,"Now, does the Secretary leave room for a union to establish those administrative requirements by rule?"
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2887.3,2890.184,--I think the answer is yes.
1990.89-1330,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2890.952,2906.129,"And if so, and a court is faced with, or a union, with deciding whether a request for campaign mailing is reasonable, should it take into consideration the existence of that kind of rule?"
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2906.129,2910.748,--I think the existence of the rule can be helpful in a number of different ways.
1990.89-1330,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2929.661,2931.828,And the Secretary thinks that's appropriate?
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2931.828,2932.379,Yes.
1990.89-1330,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2932.379,2943.569,"And is not asking us to not interpret it... well, is not telling us that those kinds of rules may not be considered."
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2943.569,2947.456,In fact we are not saying... we are saying all rules can be considered.
1990.89-1330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2968.97,2970.988,Let's take a concrete case.
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2982.527,2985.748,--I think--
1990.89-1330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2985.748,2988.617,"You know, I'd say, gee, that's pretty unreasonable."
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3001.008,3003.96,"--I think... well, in each case the question is whether the request was reasonable."
1990.89-1330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3005.61,3009.781,"Well, the request is thoroughly reasonable if the rule doesn't exist, but given the rule, it seems unreasonable."
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3009.781,3015.934,"--The question... I think that first the question is whether the... if the election were held on July 6th, such a rule--"
1990.89-1330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3015.934,3016.317,"No, no, no."
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3018.986,3019.652,--If you're talking about the election--
1990.89-1330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.652,3021.421,The election is in October.
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3022.588,3026.473,"--Well, if there is a genuine administrative constraint that the union is operating under--"
1990.89-1330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3026.473,3028.325,No administrative constraint--
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3042.668,3044.202,--The answer is yes.
1990.89-1330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3064.831,3065.831,There's no constraint.
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3099.852,3100.469,That is right.
1990.89-1330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3100.469,3101.336,Why don't you say it clearly?
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3101.336,3102.671,"Okay, but with one exception."
1990.89-1330,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3168.713,3189.527,"Well, if we determine that you look first to the reasonableness of the request, that's the focus of the statute, and that one factor in the calculus of reasonableness is to look at the union rule and to look at its reasoning and its purpose, if that's what we hold, do we have to remand in this case?"
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3189.527,3195.263,I am not sure... if you agree with us that the--
1990.89-1330,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3195.263,3199.667,"Well, as I understand the court of appeals, it said we look just to the reasonableness of the request."
1990.89-1330,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3218.713,3224.7,"--I don't think you have to remand, and I guess I also don't read the court of appeals' opinion to quite have said that."
1990.89-1330,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3266.091,3267.341,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
1990.89-1330,3,45864,w_michel_pierson,,3269.46,3272.994,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1330,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3443.539,3445.023,"Thank you, Mr. Pierson."
