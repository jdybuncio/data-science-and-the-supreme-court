1974.73-1708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.205,"We'll hear arguments first today in number 73-1708, Burns against Alcala."
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,15.585,22.914,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,219.797,223.191,"When you say obligation, do you mean legal obligation?"
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,223.191,223.922,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1708,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,845.881,859.963,"General Turner, as I understand your opponent's contention is that if it could be allowed even as an option it must be under that statutory grounds and therefore it would be mandatory?"
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,859.963,860.853,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1708,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,878.346,882.459,"Well, then you disagree with the HEW position that it is optional?"
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,882.459,884.616,"Yes sir, I do."
1974.73-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.983,899.036,"Well, do you agree when the Wisdom holding that the regulation is invalid because statute does not cover fetuses and an unborn child?"
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,901.904,902.421,Oh!
1974.73-1708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1023.834,1031.425,Let me stop you for a little minute here Mr. Attorney General to this option.
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1051.318,1066.62,"Well, all I can say in that regard is Your Honor that in Wisdom they found and they cited that the Government's briefs and here, the Government has filed an amicus brief to conclude it."
1974.73-1708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1066.62,1087.639,"What I'm addressing myself to is the argument that there has been an administrative of interpretation that this is a rather unique form of administrative interpretation when the agency said, it was optional by which I take it then it was up to the states to do it whichever way they wanted to do it."
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1087.639,1088.828,Yes sir.
1974.73-1708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1090.243,1103.037,Does that necessarily in your view preclude an interpretation by the agency that the statute required it if they said it was optional?
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1103.037,1105.938,"Well, I suppose not."
1974.73-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1119.315,1136.303,"Well, the Government thinks perhaps the regulation is a valid regulation because it feels not with whether or not if she does have the child but whether or not there are circumstances under which a pregnant woman that she care for?"
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1136.303,1138.15,"That's true, the Government does say that it's a --"
1974.73-1708,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1138.15,1139.756,"You apparently, you disagree with that?"
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1139.756,1153.119,"Yes sir, I do disagree with the part that says it's optional but I do agree with the Government that the HEW has never really determined that the statute thought but the statute included the unborn."
1974.73-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1153.119,1167.293,"Well, what the Government says as I read them that the option was not based upon any understanding of the fetus is a child but was based only on something in favor of needy pregnant women."
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1181.42,1184.084,I can't -- I agree with the Second Circuit.
1974.73-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1184.276,1190.26,The Government agrees with you too that on the statute the fetus is not a child and --
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1190.26,1190.893,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1190.893,1194.52,"-- but nevertheless, aid can be given as Mr. Justice Brennan suggested."
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1194.52,1199.726,"Yes sir, but there is no -- nothing in the statute that says that that can be done and they can't simply --"
1974.73-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1199.726,1202.325,"We care about the letter issue, do you?"
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1202.325,1203.613,"Well, no Your Honor --"
1974.73-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1203.613,1206.741,Suppose you care is that Iowa shouldn't be force to do it.
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1206.741,1216.03,"Well, I care in the sense that I represent the taxpayers of Iowa and they pay taxes to the federal government and there is no allowance for this."
1974.73-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.733,1219.561,"Well, that is -- that maybe but is that the --"
1974.73-1708,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1219.561,1220.783,It's not the issue here.
1974.73-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1220.986,1222.744,What the issue before us?
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1222.744,1225.48,Perhaps not one it's really boiled down to it.
1974.73-1708,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1225.48,1241.131,Because is Massachusetts against Mellon about 50 years ago we decided that a state didn't have the sort of interest on behalf of its tax payers that enable that the challenge or regulation of the federal government doesn't prevent you obviously from expressing your opinion --
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1241.131,1243.057,Yes sir.[Laughter]
1974.73-1708,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1446.058,1451.569,But a woman can be said to be “great with child” that's a very common expression?
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1451.569,1452.859,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1477.507,1490.136,Is it of many interest that in relation to this that the Court has held that a fetus and embryo is not a legal person?
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1490.136,1498.475,Yes sir and I'm going to get to that certainly and I hope I have time here to get to that.
1974.73-1708,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1530.625,1532.437,Within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment?
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1532.437,1534.298,Yes sir.
1974.73-1708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1620.722,1621.578,Thank you Mr. Attorney General.
1974.73-1708,0,40609,richard_c_turner,,1621.578,1623.864,I'll save the rest of my time if I have any.
1974.73-1708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1632.804,1633.989,Mr. Bartels.
1974.73-1708,1,38785,robert_bartels,,1633.989,1637.746,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1708,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1707.217,1718.219,You -- I take it that you agree that the present departmental regulation is invalid in either event.
1974.73-1708,1,38785,robert_bartels,,1721.046,1725.084,That's correct Your Honor it cannot be optional.
1974.73-1708,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1770.182,1785.136,"Upon the regulation, a state that opts to pay the pregnant mother, how is the computation of the payment made as if she had a child, as if the child had been born or how is it done?"
1974.73-1708,1,38785,robert_bartels,,1785.136,1801.383,Your Honor that varies from state to state and there is nothing in the Act that requires the states to pay any set amount of assistance to anybody and certainly within the confines of Dandridge versus Williams.
1974.73-1708,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1809.041,1816.77,"What I'm getting at whatever the state program maybe how is it done, is it done as if the child had in fact been born?"
1974.73-1708,1,38785,robert_bartels,,1816.77,1825.351,Your Honor in some states an unborn child is regarded as identical to a born child in terms of the man of assistance.
1974.73-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1845.377,1849.999,Wouldn't there be some difficulties with that under Townsend against Swank?
1974.73-1708,1,38785,robert_bartels,,1861.88,1864.277,"Yes, Your Honor I think they could."
1974.73-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.06,1881.879,But that's a constitutional holding Townsend against Swank rested on notions of eligibility under the Social Security Act?
1974.73-1708,1,38785,robert_bartels,,1881.879,1892.506,"Your Honor, in terms of eligibility for some AFDC assistance the states may not distinguish between born and unborn children."
1974.73-1708,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1922.847,1932.31,You do not think that the existence of the federal contribution requires a uniform treatment on this subject throughout the United States?
1974.73-1708,1,38785,robert_bartels,,1932.31,1933.871,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1708,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1939.992,1946.12,How is this kind of a context however as Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggested?
1974.73-1708,1,38785,robert_bartels,,1946.12,1946.896,"Your Honor, no --"
1974.73-1708,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1946.896,1954.672,Is there any case which you rely on specifically other than Dandridge that you referred to which (Voice Overlap)?
1974.73-1708,1,38785,robert_bartels,,1954.672,1967.578,"Well, Jefferson against Hackney again says that the states have this wide latitude in terms of distinguishing amongst various groups within the welfare system in terms of the amount of assistance that's paid out again."
1974.73-1708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1978.861,2000.07,"Supposing you win here Mr. Bartels, can the State of Iowa then say, “Well, we recognize the Supreme Court's decision and we're going to allow $50.00 a month for each child in SR living and $1.00 a month for each child that's unborn.”"
1974.73-1708,1,38785,robert_bartels,,2000.07,2031.222,"Your Honor, I don't think I can give a direct answer to that except to say that the state could I think make distinctions between now $1.00 might not be reasonable in terms of the amount of assistance it's granted and some of the material in addendum C to the respondent's brief indicates that in terms of how much an unborn child needs by way of additional assistance as opposed to a born child may not be so different."
1974.73-1708,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2050.79,2054.746,Does the statutes say something about reasonable?
1974.73-1708,1,38785,robert_bartels,,2054.746,2059.665,"No, Your Honor that would really be a constitutional question as the statute simply leaves to the states."
1974.73-1708,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2059.665,2063.534,But where in the Constitution do you find some unreasonable?
1974.73-1708,2,17996,bryce_e_roe,,2063.534,2066.235,"In the Constitution, Your Honor?"
1974.73-1708,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2075.638,2077.179,Unless that's what it says.
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2077.179,2077.73,Pardon?
1974.73-1708,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2077.73,2080.139,"It's not what the Constitution says, does it?"
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2080.139,2089.083,It's not what it says direct Your Honor but that's what I understand to be the traditional standard of equal protection review.
1974.73-1708,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2089.083,2094.993,I think that the age of the fetus makes no difference in your submission?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2094.993,2098.061,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.269,2154.448,What possible justification would viability have as a point to qualification?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2154.448,2156.527,"Well, Your Honor I'm not really sure."
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.945,2183.994,"The fetus as a child within the meaning of the statute just as much so prior to quickness or prior to viability as it is after, is it not?"
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2183.994,2196.384,"Yes Your Honor, I think that's right although again that the terms of the statute are admittedly ambiguous and there was room to interpret those terms within the purposes and in light of the purposes of the statute."
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2196.384,2200.32,When you say admittedly does your opposition concede that?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2200.32,2203.868,"I'm saying admittedly from my point of view, Your Honor."
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.868,2207.986,"Professor Bartels, you're familiar of course of the Federal Income Tax Code?"
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2207.986,2209.568,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2209.568,2223.522,Do you get any comfort or discomfort from the fact that it is a fact that a dependency exemption has never been allowed for a “child” prior to birth?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2223.522,2226.624,"Your Honor, I don't think that has much to do with this case."
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.687,2246.073,Like that is so because you don't cite it but [Laughter] on the other hand for purposes of this subtitle I'm reading from 152 of the Code the term “dependent” means any of the following individuals: (a) a son or daughter of the taxpayer.
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2250.112,2262.78,"Your Honor, again interpreting this Act one has to look at the purposes of the AFDC program and those purposes are very, very different from the purposes of the Internal Revenue Code."
1974.73-1708,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2262.78,2272.281,"Well, the Internal Revenue Code undertakes at least to give -- to take into account that there are some expenses in rearing children, does it not?"
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2272.281,2273.158,That's correct Your Honor and --
1974.73-1708,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2273.158,2276.996,And the welfare system does the same thing?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2276.996,2278.272,That's correct Your Honor although --
1974.73-1708,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2278.272,2285.36,As Mr. Justice Blackmun has pointed out there's a different approach in the General Revenue Code and the Social Security Act?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2285.36,2289.097,"Your Honor, I think that in terms of the distinction there are at least a couple of points."
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2401.282,2411.519,Do you say that HEW in some other cases in District Courts had taken a position that the statute included the fetus?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2411.519,2423.161,"Your Honor, the only other amicus brief that I'm very familiar with by HEW is in Wilson versus Weaver I had a little bit of trouble understanding exactly --"
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2423.161,2424.364,What court was that?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2424.364,2433.699,That was in the District Court -- Northern District of Illinois Your Honor and that brief I guess was also adopted by in the Fifth Circuit in Parks versus Harden.
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.604,2514.181,"I gather you would agree if the Act as written does not fair the interpretation that the fetus is included as a child, then that the regulation is invalid?"
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2514.181,2525.007,"That's correct, Your Honor if an unborn child is not a dependent child within the terms of the Act there are simply no authority on that that Act to make payments with regard unborn children."
1974.73-1708,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2576.998,2582.214,Are there programs developed by Congress for prenatal care?M
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2582.214,2589.026,"Your Honor, the only other program it specifically aims at that is Title V of the Social Security Act."
1974.73-1708,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2589.026,2592.641,"So, that certainly suggests that they're not unaware of the problem, doesn't it?"
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2592.641,2599.837,"Well, Your Honor I think that Title V is significant and that it shows that Congress was aware that prenatal care was necessary but --"
1974.73-1708,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2599.837,2607.132,But being aware of it they have not extended it in this Act except by implication that you're arguing?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2607.132,2609.453,"Well, Your Honor two things about that."
1974.73-1708,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2712.924,2718.039,Back in those days it was aid to dependent children also was an aid to families with dependent children?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2718.039,2719.481,"That's right, Your Honor."
1974.73-1708,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2739.562,2748.785,"Even when it was aid to children as distinguished from aid to families but the payments were always made to the parents, would they not?"
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2748.785,2748.892,Oh!
1974.73-1708,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2749.806,2754.842,"So that, do you read much significance into that statute?"
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2754.842,2756.518,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2970.919,2976.119,"Is that May of 1941 opinion, is that the first?"
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2976.119,2978.816,"That was the first sort of official opinion, Your Honor."
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2979.896,2981.145,Before that even?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2981.145,2981.582,Pardon?
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2981.582,2983.725,Before that even had the --
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,2983.725,2987.911,It was under consideration much earlier than that.
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3001.355,3006.985,Do we know whether this letter advice was acted on?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,3006.985,3028.37,"Yes, Your Honor that that was the ordered exception to the Wisconsin program was overruled and one of them at the memoranda there indicates that although they weren't going to make a formal policy that the Wisconsin decision would be precedent for future audits."
1974.73-1708,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3028.37,3034.569,Since the addition of whatever it is 8 (b) (10).
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,3041.418,3041.882,That's correct.
1974.73-1708,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3041.882,3047.342,"And apparently HEW doesn't like that regime, they still what the states to have options?"
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,3047.342,3048.67,They seem very in that system --
1974.73-1708,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3048.67,3050.864,To find some kind of authority to give it to them.
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,3051.198,3056.491,That's correct Your Honor and I -- there is simply is no authority in the Act for that kind of an optional program.
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3056.491,3060.442,Do we have any idea who weighed the Smith was in 1941?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,3060.442,3063.881,He was a general counsel to the Bureau of Public Assistance Your Honor.
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3063.881,3067.228,That seems to be address to the Assistant General.
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,3072.311,3072.773,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3081.79,3085.416,Do you (Voice Overlap) with the general counsel would've provisions with Bureau said within the (Voice Overlap)?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,3085.416,3089.467,"Yes, Your Honor there was a Child Welfare Bureau I think and he may have been general counsel to them."
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.467,3094.057,And this letter refers to an earlier lengthy memorandum that he wrote with that?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,3094.057,3101.128,The lengthy memorandum Your Honor is set out for the most part in the addendum I that follows immediately in memo to Ruth Blakesley.
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3101.128,3102.746,That's 1939?
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,3102.746,3105.378,Right.
1974.73-1708,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3167.061,3170.457,For this we had no HEW in that inquiry.
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,3170.457,3176.785,"Your Honor, the Bureau of Public Assistance which I believe was a division of the Social Security Board at that time --"
1974.73-1708,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3176.785,3177.589,Oh!
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,3179.358,3186.213,-- was the administrator of the Act.
1974.73-1708,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3296.038,3332.916,"Mr. Bartels, in Townsend against Swank and this is something that you were asked about earlier during your argument it was held that college students were required to be included yet I gather as eligible -- yet I gathered from your argument that Indiana in that case would've been perfectly free to say, sure they are included then everybody else is going to get a hundred dollars a month and college student are going to get $5.00 a month because we think there's a rational distinction and in fact, just argue the same thing they argued here and were turned down on legislative intent."
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,3332.916,3348.204,"Your Honor, I think that the states could make rational distinctions among these groups and if the needs of college students were rationally arguably less than others then there could be a distinction made between the two groups."
1974.73-1708,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3348.204,3351.235,"So, they only do whatever restrictions there maybe in the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,3351.235,3352.887,Yes Your Honor.
1974.73-1708,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3359.28,3365.713,When 402 (a) (10) just means that everyone who's eligible has got to get something.
1974.73-1708,3,38785,robert_bartels,,3370.817,3398.336,That's right Your Honor in Dandridge versus Williams that the children who were born into the family that already has 10 children are eligible and that assistance must be paid to them but this Court held that a ratable reduction or flat grant top was all right because the needs of the 11th child are in effect less because of the economies of scale within the family.
1974.73-1708,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3408.014,3411.263,"Mr. Attorney General, you have about three minutes left."
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3411.263,3417.116,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1974.73-1708,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3417.116,3423.179,"Mr. General do you -- what kind of money you're talking about in terms, say Iowa, is there any idea?"
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3423.179,3438.052,No I don't Your Honor except there's one case that indicated that in Georgia I think that it might mean as much as $6.8 million in that state.
1974.73-1708,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3481.58,3487.768,That sounds primarily for (Voice Overlap) not for food or sustenance but just for prenatal care.
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3487.768,3489.326,Prenatal care.
1974.73-1708,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3489.836,3494.653,"Does that include food, rent and (Voice Overlap)?"
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3494.653,3497.407,That I don't know Your Honor and I'm not familiar enough.
1974.73-1708,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3497.407,3498.532,(Voice Overlap) isn't it?
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3498.532,3505.614,"Yes, but prenatal care could also include medical service I suppose."
1974.73-1708,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3513.376,3516.826,Not very much of food and clothing is included?
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3516.826,3542.384,"Yes but perhaps -- well, I again repeat that when Title V specifically speaks to matter such as prenatal care, you have to consider it seems in the light of Title IV which does not mention anything about prenatal."
1974.73-1708,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3592.6,3595.779,To disapprove that sort of practice would you?
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3595.779,3596.716,"What's that, Your Honor?"
1974.73-1708,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3596.716,3600.538,"You wouldn't want us to forbid that sort of practice, would you?"
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3600.538,3603.961,Of correcting in a typographical error?[Laughter]
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3603.961,3614.829,"No, but to say that it played no part in his opinion it seemed to me he stressed that in his opinion by underscoring it."
1974.73-1708,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3614.829,3625.35,Do you -- would I take it that exception was a judicial opinion that was based on a reading of parental when it turned out that the correct reading was prenatal?
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3625.35,3631.611,"Yes sir, but the statute says parental and not prenatal clearly and the judge recognized that."
1974.73-1708,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3631.611,3641.455,"That could be more than a typographical misapprehension on the part of the Court, would it not to confuse those two?"
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3641.455,3647.694,I can't speculate on what was in the Court's mind when that was done.
1974.73-1708,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3687.631,3690.443,It weren't in the record in the District Court?
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3690.443,3693.8,I don't believe that's in the record Your Honor.
1974.73-1708,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3706.251,3714.696,"Well, I suppose too that outside to the City of Washington where they have no access to congressional record."
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3721.796,3725.767,I think you should properly do that if there's a question about the statute.
1974.73-1708,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3725.767,3729.028,Mainly if he's irrelevant may we rely on this?
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3729.028,3731.187,If they are relevant maybe but --
1974.73-1708,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3731.187,3733.76,You don't even know whether they are authenticated I take it.
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3733.76,3735.14,I don't Your Honor.
1974.73-1708,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3735.994,3739.946,"Mr. Attorney General, did you see the record in this case in the District Court?"
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3739.946,3741.589,"No sir, I have not."
1974.73-1708,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3743.509,3746.309,So you can't say whether or not the regular or not?
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3746.309,3748.889,I cannot Your Honor.
1974.73-1708,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3750.215,3751.622,When you first find out (Voice Overlap)?
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3751.622,3756.503,"-- I could ask counsel, Mr. Professor Bartels."
1974.73-1708,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3759.638,3765.784,"You usually don't print things in appendix to agree that they are printed in an appendix, the joint appendix."
1974.73-1708,4,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3770.662,3773.311,Yes sir and perhaps the Court will consider.
1974.73-1708,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3809.688,3811.141,Thank you gentlemen.
