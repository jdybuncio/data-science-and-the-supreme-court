1957.67,0,30061,jerome_f_dixon,,16.732,19.644,May it please the Court.
1957.67,1,36896,melville_c_williams,,1830.648,1835.737,May it please the Court.
1957.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2093.638,2108.925,"I suppose -- I supposed if that Act you've just spoken have those incorporated in the Act the fact that it was an amendatory acts of the original act, it would have some bearing wasn't it?"
1957.67,1,36896,melville_c_williams,,2108.925,2112.431,"No, Your Honor not if it just said amendatory."
1957.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2171.89,2192.196,Well does that lead you -- lead you to the conclusion that when Congress says this is an amendatory act of another act that it is up to the court to pick and choose what part is amendatory and what part of the new act becomes a part of the old act?
1957.67,1,36896,melville_c_williams,,2192.196,2203.879,We think it is up to the court if we think that the guide to the court to determine what becomes part of the act and what is merely amendatory and not part of it is found in Section 1 of the Clayton Act.
1957.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2355.366,2360.307,Does any part of this Act become a part of the Clayton Act?
1957.67,1,36896,melville_c_williams,,2360.307,2364.702,"Yes, Section 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act clearly becomes a part of the Clayton Act."
1957.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2364.702,2370.074,What are the guide posts for us to determine -- what are the guide posts for us to follow --
1957.67,1,36896,melville_c_williams,,2370.074,2381.7,Well the guide -- the guide post as I see it -- I'm trying to think of what other means Congress could use to indicate it wanted a new law to become part of the Clayton Act.
1957.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2422.232,2423.921,Then where does that lead you here?
1957.67,1,36896,melville_c_williams,,2430.135,2431.298,Only Section 1.
1957.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2439.699,2441.402,Neither 2 nor 4?
1957.67,1,36896,melville_c_williams,,2441.402,2443.947,2 nor 4 and not become part of the Act.
1957.67,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2461.375,2472.35,"As a matter of fact, Section 1 doesn't become a part of the Clayton Act anymore than 2, 3, and 4 but Section 1 provides Section 2 of the Clayton Act probably amended so and so."
1957.67,1,36896,melville_c_williams,,2472.35,2474.384,"Yes, you're right."
1957.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2495.419,2498.166,"2 and 4 were not in quotation marks, were they?"
1957.67,1,36896,melville_c_williams,,2498.166,2500.308,No and neither was 3.
1957.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2500.692,2507.995,How do you -- how do you differentiate between 2 and 4 and -- from one end and 3 on the other?
1957.67,1,36896,melville_c_williams,,2507.995,2515.562,We don't -- we say that none -- neither 2 or 3 nor 4 became part of the Clayton Act.
1957.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2515.562,2518.47,Are they all amendatory of it?
1957.67,1,36896,melville_c_williams,,2518.47,2521.336,Section 3 is not amendatory of the Clayton Act.
1957.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2522.278,2522.636,All right.
1957.67,1,36896,melville_c_williams,,2528.696,2533.195,The Section -- Section 2 is merely a temporary legislation.
1957.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2596.772,2599.797,Well you said it was amendatory but not a part of it.
1957.67,1,36896,melville_c_williams,,2599.797,2603.123,"I don't think that Section 2 is even amendatory, Your Honor."
1957.67,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2681.614,2683.509,I think you've stated your position.
1957.67,1,36896,melville_c_williams,,2683.509,2686.444,Thank you.
