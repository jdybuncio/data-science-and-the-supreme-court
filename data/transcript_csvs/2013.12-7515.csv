2013.12-7515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.654,"We will hear argument next in Case 12-7515, Burrage v. United States."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,7.554,11.222,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-7515,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,114.037,139.921,"How would you respond to the hypothetical that the government poses on 24 of its brief, that it's the three drops of poison, each defendant puts in one drop, one drop will not do it, three drops will, and none of them would be chargeable because it takes three drops?"
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,139.921,143.789,"Well, I would disagree with the premise that they are not chargeable."
2013.12-7515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,160.333,166.403,But you would if -- if you knew that there were two drops in and you added the third drop after the two drops.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,166.803,168.17,Then--
2013.12-7515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,168.17,168.67,I'm sorry.
2013.12-7515,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,171.372,173.738,Three -- three drops.
2013.12-7515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,173.738,175.521,--It takes three.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,175.521,181.658,"--In the government's -- in the government's hypothetical, each person individually puts in one drop and you need three drops in order to -- to kill the person."
2013.12-7515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,181.658,182.008,All right.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,190.014,193.4,"That would be correct, that there would be but-for causation."
2013.12-7515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,193.4,194.984,But each one is the third person.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,204.523,205.49,Well--
2013.12-7515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.49,216.748,"As I understand -- as I understood the evidence in this case, the experts testified they could not say that he would not have died but for the cocaine."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,216.748,218.1,--That's--
2013.12-7515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,218.1,230.075,That's quite different from this case where what is put to you is he -- you could say he would not have died but for the drop that each one of them put in.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,230.075,231.891,"--Yes, you could say that."
2013.12-7515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,233.11,234.91,So why isn't that but-for causation?
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,234.91,237.744,--It's a form of but-for causation that I think--
2013.12-7515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.744,241.146,I don't care if it's a form of but-for causation.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,242.232,244.115,--It -- it can be.
2013.12-7515,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,255.754,257.356,"Well, I thought the hypothetical was a bit different."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,269.93,270.848,Correct.
2013.12-7515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,296.331,300.535,"But part of your argument is that but-for causation isn't sufficient, right?"
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,302.218,303.237,Correct.
2013.12-7515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,303.237,303.82,Is that your argument?
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,303.82,304.67,That is our argument.
2013.12-7515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,304.67,317.661,"Now, give me an example of a situation where a heroin dealer deals -- sells drugs to somebody, and foresees that the drugs that are sold will cause death?"
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,317.661,321.03,"Well, I think you can look to the actual case law."
2013.12-7515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,337.524,339.409,Those are very unusual circumstances.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,347.013,348.865,"--No, I disagree with that."
2013.12-7515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.507,364.542,I think “ foreseeability ” is the wrong word.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,395.994,401.415,Both scope in the risk and foreseeability are versions of saying proximate cause.
2013.12-7515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,414.656,417.275,I think this is all being sort of tied up together.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,452.264,472.511,"--Our position is -- I agree with you, Justice Sotomayor, that the main issue is this but-for causation issue, that if we are correct that but-for causation should be read into a criminal statute, as we believe it should under these circumstances under this statute, that the appropriate question is whether, but for the heroin, they would have died."
2013.12-7515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,472.511,472.761,All right.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,513.419,517.473,"Yes, and I don't think you need to look to causation to get to that answer."
2013.12-7515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,517.473,520.925,And what do we look to if we are not looking to causation?
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,520.925,528.262,"Well, if each individual person in the poison hypothetical is working together and knows about the other people, then you have conspiracy liability."
2013.12-7515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,535.684,550.961,"Why does it matter if you know that three people have -- three people hate someone and they are acting independently, each one intended to kill the guy and, you know, that the other two joined in was lovely, but we don't know which drop did it."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,552.713,555.681,--In that particular hypothetical then the--
2013.12-7515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,555.681,556.531,There is no conspiracy.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,556.531,557.214,--There's no conspiracy.
2013.12-7515,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,557.214,559.181,How can we save this case if there is no conspiracy?
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,559.181,564.885,"Then you have attempt liability, and those people would still all be criminally liable for attempted murder."
2013.12-7515,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,564.885,574.174,"The Model Penal Code, the Brown Commission, everybody says this is a famous law school hypothetical, I thought you would never find it in reality."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,621.723,624.289,"Yes, Justice Breyer, there is an answer to that."
2013.12-7515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,665.083,667.035,What is substantial factor?
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,679.674,685.162,"--That is our position, that substantial factor is appropriate when it would have been a but-for cause."
2013.12-7515,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,692.5,699.837,"So when you use that language of “ substantial factor ”, what you really mean to point to is independent sufficiency?"
2013.12-7515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.324,706.657,Right.
2013.12-7515,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,706.657,711.042,--that either is the but-for cause because of the fortuity of the second act?
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,711.042,711.692,Correct.
2013.12-7515,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,715.846,719.315,So you don't mean that to go any further than independent sufficiency?
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,719.315,725.385,"We do not mean it to go any further, and I don't believe that the case law or the treatises take it any further."
2013.12-7515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,727.737,729.37,It's a strange terminology for it.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,733.657,734.274,--We agree.
2013.12-7515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,734.274,738.126,You can be a substantial factor without being independently sufficient.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,738.126,748.067,"You could under the common use of the word “ substantial factor ”, but at least “ substantial factor ” would have been better language than “ contributes to ” or “ plays a part in ” that this jury heard."
2013.12-7515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,748.067,748.65,Marginally.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,748.65,758.523,It would at least give us the opportunity to argue that the heroin was not the substantial factor to a jury in a factual question if “ substantial factor ” does not mean independently sufficient cause.
2013.12-7515,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,787.958,800.365,"You do agree that, that an overdose -- there is a foreseeable risk that someone who purchases heroin will overdose, there is a foreseeable risk of that?"
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,800.365,810.056,"--I concede that in a heroin case, that is a question for the jury, that you would charge foreseeability or proximate cause to the jury in those circumstances."
2013.12-7515,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,810.056,813.841,I guess here's what the government might say back to you.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,857.704,867.243,And I would agree that that's their argument and that's an argument that should be presented to Congress to amend the statute to incorporate language that addresses that.
2013.12-7515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,884.269,890.006,"Well, let's compare what -- the situation that Justice Kagan just described with this situation."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,923.327,935.051,"Well, in the absence of language to the contrary, this statute actually says, the use of this substance, the substance sold by the defendant results in a death."
2013.12-7515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,943.807,944.357,"Well, I understand that."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,957.831,966.437,Because Congress would want to target a situation where there has been proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's actions were the cause of the death.
2013.12-7515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,966.437,969.708,"Well, for -- for any crime, there are two things."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1005.731,1008.249,That would be true.
2013.12-7515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1027.561,1029.83,"Well, it said -- the statute says results, right?"
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1029.83,1030.613,Correct.
2013.12-7515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1030.613,1033.648,And so we're asking about results.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1043.004,1045.522,I believe that would be a jury question.
2013.12-7515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1045.522,1046.541,"No, no, no."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1049.676,1057.497,"It would be if he takes the heroin, and the heroin is the cause of the death, then, yes, it's a but-for cause."
2013.12-7515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1068.638,1068.804,All right.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1085.013,1092.253,Not as a matter of law and not to the degree that the Solicitor General urges that it's a per se foreseeability.
2013.12-7515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1106.677,1108.363,"Well, the question is what the legal standard is."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1126.158,1130.459,The rule is the language of the proximate cause instruction that you give them.
2013.12-7515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1142.6,1147.504,"And I would say, my goodness, if only 1 percent overdose, that -- that isn't very foreseeable."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1189.081,1200.289,"Well, in that circumstance, in our specific factual circumstance, each individual person that supplied any of the drugs to the victim in this case would be equally liable."
2013.12-7515,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1200.289,1207.81,"Well, one was -- the heroin was illegal -- was not -- the selling of a sleeping pill is not illegal."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1213.93,1219.684,"Selling sleeping pills can be illegal if they're sold to someone that does not have a prescription, if they're sold on the street."
2013.12-7515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1246.001,1247.703,I don't see how this foreseeability test would work.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1264.796,1267.85,There are certain facts that could be read to a jury.
2013.12-7515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1272.568,1274.087,"Well, what sort of facts?"
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1297.366,1310.608,"--Well, I think you could look directly to the Eighth Circuit's opinion in the Macintosh case and the factors in that case where that particular person manufactured methamphetamine and specifically said, I do not want my methamphetamine to go to this person."
2013.12-7515,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1325.451,1325.668,No.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1332.239,1334.724,"--Well, I -- I don't think there can be a checklist."
2013.12-7515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1353.787,1360.624,Do you have any -- what type of heroin user is more likely to overdose and suffer death?
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1365.093,1367.962,There are no facts in the record that reflect that.
2013.12-7515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1436.355,1439.091,I -- I just want to get your position as -- as a matter of law.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1459.568,1464.105,--It would be our position that there could be liability if properly instructed to a jury.
2013.12-7515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1464.105,1467.557,But it's just up to the jury to decide whether it was foreseeable or not.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1467.557,1468.124,Correct.
2013.12-7515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1468.124,1481.75,"And you cannot say, as I -- as I think I say, that if you sell cocaine and if it is without a doubt the but-for cause of somebody's death, you're liable under this statute."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1482.933,1483.852,We disagree.
2013.12-7515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1494.558,1495.56,"Yes, but in the civil--"
2013.12-7515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1495.56,1497.926,"No, but in a civil context -- excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1506.116,1508.634,"In a civil context, when it's explicit--"
2013.12-7515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1508.634,1521.96,"A drug company if it -- if it doesn't take proper steps, it is liable even if 1 percent of the users are adversely affected."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1523.643,1529.647,--You -- in a strict liability circumstance would have a statute which writes in strict liability.
2013.12-7515,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1531.833,1534.016,May I just clarify before you're finished.
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1559.966,1565.82,Only in the circumstance where you have two independently sufficient causes do you -- do you reach that question.
2013.12-7515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1579.497,1580.33,"--Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-7515,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1580.33,1586.484,"--Well, are you then saying except for the heroin ingestion, the death would not have occurred?"
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1586.484,1598.975,"The -- that's the primary argument, that except for the heroin that -- the factual basis of this case is that, if you remove the heroin, the doctors are saying he still might have died."
2013.12-7515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1600.925,1601.525,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-7515,0,15767,angela_l_campbell,,1601.525,1602.01,Thank you.
2013.12-7515,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1602.01,1610.114,Mr. Horwich.
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1610.114,1613.149,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1638.616,1639.199,So Mr.--
2013.12-7515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1639.199,1648.238,"So one little -- one little grain of heroin that you discover is in the body, and that person's going away for whatever it is, 20 years?"
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1648.238,1650.507,"No, I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1696.817,1703.722,"--Well, Mr. Horwich, I mean, it seems to me that the dispute before this Court is this: You have somebody who's taken five drugs."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1742.614,1757.04,"I -- I think probably yes, although let me -- let me explain that we -- why we see the nature of the expert testimony as actually different than what you're describing there."
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1757.507,1758.657,"Well, take mine."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1758.657,1758.923,--Yes.
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1758.923,1759.857,Because I think that that's actually--
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1759.857,1760.357,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1805.3,1812.723,"--Yes, and he might have died even without the heroin, because all the other substances might have been perfectly adequate to cause death."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1827.9,1833.904,"Well, the experts here of course did testify specifically that the heroin did contribute to the death."
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1834.354,1837.941,"Well, again, that question of words, the experts were very careful to say:"
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1852.95,1859.704,--I guess -- maybe I can respond to that with a perhaps more conventional hypothetical.
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1892.541,1897.145,"It's a bad sign that you're using the hypotheticals rather than the facts of your case, you know?"
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1924.645,1931.649,--I don't think -- the experts here did not testify in probability figures in that way.
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1943.374,1947.242,"They said it contributed to the set of drugs, but they didn't say that it contributed to the death."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1968.157,1979.799,"That -- and it is that aspect of the testimony which is why we concede that if you apply a but-for test, that testimony does not establish a but-for test."
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1979.799,1981.865,"Well, how much more likely does it have to make it that he would die?"
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1982.881,1983.464,It's not a--
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1983.464,1984.464,How about 30 percent?
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1984.464,2006.762,"--The relevant question is in a contributing cause analysis, at least in the first instance, setting aside the substantiality question that the Chief Justice's hypothetical raised, the basic question of the contributing cause analysis is whether the drug in a case like this contributed to the physio -- the internal physiological effects that culminated in the death."
2013.12-7515,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2056.61,2059.645,"Before -- Mr. Horwich, before we leave this hypothetical--"
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2059.645,2059.945,Yes.
2013.12-7515,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2059.945,2060.812,--may me ask you this.
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2119.016,2148.62,"I -- I can't represent to be informed enough about sort of the range of cases, but I think the testimony in this case is actually informative on that point, because there are a number of uncertainties to which the -- the -- the experts testified that show why it is, from -- why it is, from their point of view, essentially impossible to disentangle the effect of one drug and another drug when they're having the same effect on the body."
2013.12-7515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.412,2177.903,So Congress -- Congress supposedly knew that and -- and could have written a statute so that you're -- you're liable if you are a contributing cause of -- of the death.
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2186.925,2187.809,"--Well, we -- we--"
2013.12-7515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2187.809,2192.246,Why -- why should “ result in ” not -- not mean but-for causality?
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2192.246,2199.833,"--Well, we -- we would take Congress to have been incorporating the rules settled on generally in the criminal context--"
2013.12-7515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.833,2200.502,Why?
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2200.502,2201.252,--for this sort of problem.
2013.12-7515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2201.252,2207.339,Why -- why does “ result in ” refer -- refer to what -- what we do in the common law?
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2226.15,2228.586,"Well, we do take it to mean causes."
2013.12-7515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2269.496,2270.246,I accept that.
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2270.246,2281.902,"And so, Justice Breyer, that's what's going on in -- in the treatises that then say, well, in these other cases, we're going to -- we're going to say, well, these independently sufficient tests, that applies as well."
2013.12-7515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2281.902,2297.229,"Well, here -- here I accept that -- first of all, there's no problem with intent for me for the reason Justice Scalia pointed out, that anyone who sells heroin to someone is reckless, at least, in respect to the possibility of a death resulting."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2314.691,2315.641,"Well, I think--"
2013.12-7515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2315.641,2323.295,"And the model Penal Code did express itself on what they call, in the Brown Commission, concurrent causes, all right?"
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2341.858,2342.191,--Yes.
2013.12-7515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2342.191,2342.858,All right?
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2403.279,2403.646,I do.
2013.12-7515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.758,2424.008,It depends on what you mean by substantial.
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2424.008,2424.508,"--Well, I think--"
2013.12-7515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2424.508,2429.66,Opposing counsel says substantial means that it would independently have sufficed.
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2429.66,2431.011,"--Well, I think -- I think that's right."
2013.12-7515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2431.011,2433.213,"If that's what you mean by it, we'll all cheer."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2436.231,2437.948,"Well, it's not what -- it's not what we mean--"
2013.12-7515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2437.948,2439.95,"That's not what was found in this case, right?"
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2439.95,2452.691,"--Well, I would point out -- I would point out that -- I mean, I'm reading from the Washington State Christman decision, which is the only decision that the parties have cited that's actually -- factually deals with this scenario and it says,"
2013.12-7515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.747,2467.466,That -- that's what you call a substantial factor?
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2472.77,2477.155,"--No, because we think it does -- we think it does have to be substantial."
2013.12-7515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2479.574,2481.857,"--Well, then -- then you don't agree with that -- that stuff that you just read point."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2481.857,2483.876,"--Well, all parties whose actions substantially contributed to the outcome."
2013.12-7515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2483.876,2491.046,So then you -- you're saying that the government's position is that contributing factor should be a substantial contributing factor; you're happy with that.
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2491.046,2494.417,I think -- I think we would not -- we wouldn't have an objection if the Court states that as the law.
2013.12-7515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2499.986,2501.687,"Well, what is substantial?"
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2504.272,2505.122,"Well, I think substantial--"
2013.12-7515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.122,2506.238,"--5 percent, what?"
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2506.238,2511.359,"--substantial -- I wouldn't put it -- well, I would put it in relative terms, right?"
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2521.396,2521.562,So is that the question?
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2537.439,2549.729,"--Well, we know that it can -- we know two things; one, it causally contributed in a way that, say, the marijuana did not contribute to what the experts are testifying was the physiological process."
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2550.613,2551.379,But -- but maybe not to the death.
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2551.379,2560.902,"--of the things that contributed to that, we would agree that the insubstantial, the one pill out of a thousand hypothetical, would certainly not be substantial."
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2564.97,2572.291,And is the one question is -- is how this all relates to the “ beyond a reasonable doubt ” instruction in criminal cases?
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2604.762,2605.812,--I disagree with that.
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2621.291,2622.741,But the statute -- the statute says did it result in death.
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2641.97,2657.83,"I -- I think that there is going to be testimony about probabilities and likelihoods that will inform the substantiality question, but it's not a question of likelihood that it -- that it contributed to the central nervous system depression that killed the victim here."
2013.12-7515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2660.349,2670.471,"If you wanted to incorporate in the statute your friend's understanding of but-for cause, what word would you use that would be better than “ results ”?"
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2670.471,2674.439,"Well, I would -- you could use but for or accept."
2013.12-7515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2674.439,2674.823,"Well, I know."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2677.458,2678.591,Or solely.
2013.12-7515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2712.312,2716.515,"Mr. Horwich, just if I could get back, that is the instruction on proximate cause."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2716.515,2717.265,Well--
2013.12-7515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2717.265,2720.401,What about the but-for cause?
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2720.401,2728.173,"--Well, the way they are structured for -- in Petitioner's submission, it's -- it's sort of built into the proximate cause instruction."
2013.12-7515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2750.354,2760.309,"No, but it doesn't say -- the one they quote in their brief, all they wanted the judge to say was it could be -- they say, you are right, proximate cause, but they're interested here in is it a cause at all."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2787.293,2797.666,"--That is a convenient excerpt from the instruction on 238, but the other part of the instruction insists that except for the cause the death would not have occurred."
2013.12-7515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2798.349,2805.419,I agree with you the language -- their position now is not that it's enough that it's an important factor.
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2826.599,2831.486,"--Well, certainly, certainly they can pull up cases that say that."
2013.12-7515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2852.667,2856.902,"Just to get back to it, you were reading from the proximate cause instruction."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2872.897,2880.401,"Well, we wouldn't -- we don't disagree that a court could just use the unadorned statutory language."
2013.12-7515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2896.113,2897.396,What do you want us to say?
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2937.856,2938.873,"Well, I think the Court--"
2013.12-7515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2938.873,2956.751,"--that I hesitate to go backwards from the very vague and open language, substantive, substantial versus contributing, and just sort of why not just say substantial and leave it there and let the lower courts figure it out, so we don't confuse the entire bar and the entire Congress and everything."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2956.751,2956.834,--Yes.
2013.12-7515,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2957.934,2958.367,I am.
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2958.367,2962.419,--I think you could write a decision that says the right instruction here is substantial factor.
2013.12-7515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2969.673,2977.095,"Because of that imprecision, some poor devils will have to go to jail for a longer period than otherwise, you know."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2977.678,2980.88,"Well, I this isn't -- I think this isn't something that would catch Congress by surprise."
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2988.067,2992.521,"Mr. Horwich, I just don't understand what “ substantial factor ” means in the way you are using it."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3015.72,3024.909,The situations that we're talking about here are ones in which nothing would be a for cause of the death and nothing would be independently sufficient to cause the death.
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3025.692,3035.632,"So it's not a substantial factor in causing the death, because that assumes that it actually played a role in causing the death and you can't say whether it played a role in causing the death."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3037.234,3038.434,--I disagree with that.
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3042.218,3045.403,"In the sense of if it hadn't been there, the death would not have occurred."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3045.403,3047.605,--That's true.
2013.12-7515,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3047.605,3048.505,"You can't say that, that's the point."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3048.505,3063.013,"Well, that's true, but I don't think, to take my example of the assailants, the three assailants beating the victim to death, I think it would be very strange to say that none of those assailants played a role in the victim dying, none of them contributed to the victim dying."
2013.12-7515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3092.615,3102.406,"The problem with your hypothetical, it's the sort of thing where there's no way that a doctor could say three people beat the guy up, which one threw the fatal punch."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3112.945,3125.338,"Yes, I think that's right, but I can imagine a doctor similarly testifying in the three assailants situation to exactly that point."
2013.12-7515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3128.54,3139.596,"But if you can't put -- but my point is that they would not be able to tell you in any case, where here they can tell you in every case whether it's clear that the heroin caused the death or not."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3139.596,3147.619,"That may be true, but there will be cases in which no single drug caused the death and yet the victim died."
2013.12-7515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3149.371,3149.62,Right.
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3164.563,3166.463,It does.
2013.12-7515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3179.49,3186.244,"What result if a heroin dealer persuades a first time user to please try heroin, it's wonderful."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3201.769,3202.688,Contributing cause there?
2013.12-7515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3208.007,3208.557,"No, no."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3210.775,3211.459,Okay.
2013.12-7515,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3224.019,3234.057,"What about you give the guy a heroin and he drives away, but as a result of using it he's driving under the influence, has an accident and is killed?"
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3238.376,3243.596,"We think in that situation, certainly factually, causation in fact, it does."
2013.12-7515,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3259.358,3259.725,I'm sorry.
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3271.883,3282.671,"So in proximate cause, our basic point on proximate cause in an overdose situation is that you already have the indicia you need to know that this is the harm for which Congress wants to hold the defendant responsible."
2013.12-7515,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3283.504,3293.31,"In one other case -- there has been one other case, but you are suggesting that there are cases in which there might be a proximate cause problem, you just--"
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3293.31,3294.745,--Absolutely.
2013.12-7515,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3294.745,3296.095,--as you just said to Justice Kennedy.
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3307.068,3309.202,"Well, I -- I have to disagree with--"
2013.12-7515,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3309.202,3313.139,"Because in -- in the vast majority of cases, it won't be a problem."
2013.12-7515,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3313.139,3318.61,--I guess I have to -- I guess my answer to your hypothetical has to be to disagree with the idea that this is an element.
2013.12-7515,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3348.462,3349.462,So foreseeability--
