1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,33.457,42.519,Mr. Chief Justice Warren and Honorable Justices of this Court.
1967.71,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,257.293,259.901,Aren't you going to argue the mootness question?
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,259.901,261.819,"I will sir, on my reply."
1967.71,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,261.819,263.145,Oh!
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,263.145,263.149,I'm not (Voice Overlap) --
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,263.149,263.521,I'm not sure (Voice Overlap) --
1967.71,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,263.521,264.955,I think that's very important.
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,268.46,269.008,"I see, sir."
1967.71,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,269.008,270.363,-- is clear.
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,270.363,270.406,Alright.
1967.71,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,270.406,278.935,Very much this and that -- I don't mean you have to do it right now but I mean before you sit down I'd like to hear that face of your case.
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,278.935,281.55,"Alright, sir."
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,360.755,364.331,"Well, are you -- you're arguing now the merits, the search and seizure claims, is that it?"
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,364.331,364.999,"Right, sir."
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,364.999,367.91,"Now, that was reviewed in the Court of Appeals?"
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,367.91,370.578,"No, sir, it was not reviewed in the Court of Appeals, it dismissed the appeal."
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,370.578,374.356,Does -- should we reach that question at all here if the Court of Appeals has never looked at it.
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,381.686,381.943,"No, sir."
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,381.943,390.133,"You didn't have it -- oral argument, it dismissed your petition in to -- hear it in forma pauperis, but you at all -- but didn't state and you both submit papers at that time?"
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,390.133,391.183,"Yes, sir, we did."
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,391.183,393.238,So you had briefs but no argument?
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,393.238,395.082,"We had affidavits, sir."
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,395.082,396.845,Affidavits and some legal argument --
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,396.845,398.013,Right.
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,398.013,398.61,-- in them?
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,398.61,399.734,"In them -- that's right, sir."
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,399.734,403.899,"So they were in effect briefs, and so this was sort of a (Inaudible) appeal?"
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,403.899,405.194,"Right, sir."
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,405.194,406.889,But the Court did reach the merits?
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,410.173,412.874,It did because it dismissed the appeal.
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,413.862,420.181,"So it -- in effect, it allow it to -- would you accept that as a ruling on the merits of the search and seizure claim?"
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,420.181,421.693,"I would say so, sir --"
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,421.693,421.851,So that --
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,421.851,423.724,"-- because, Mr. Justice White, the --"
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.724,430.228,"So, that you're not making any claim that there wasn't -- that you were cheated out by an appeal in the Court of Appeals?"
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,430.228,431.285,"No, sir."
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,435.881,438.279,"This isn't a Nowakowski case, is it or anything like that?"
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,438.279,441.016,"No, I'm alleging this Judge."
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,441.016,448.8,Do you think it's alright to the Court of Appeals to have just summarily acted on your briefs and affidavits and rule on the merits for the search and --
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,448.8,453.161,"I don't think so, if Your Honor, please because I believe that they should have --"
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,453.161,455.754,"Oh, I know you disagree with them with the result they reached?"
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,455.754,456.76,"Not at the result, sir."
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,463.396,463.923,"Well, they did, did they?"
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,463.923,467.513,-- from the District Court to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,467.513,472.825,"Yes, but they did pass on them, didn't they?"
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,480.957,487.169,"Well, Mr. Justice White, let me say this to you as a basis for this statement."
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,523.385,526.24,But they did have the papers before -- from both of you.
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,526.24,528.093,They had all of the papers from the District Court --
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,528.093,528.546,And they had a (Voice Overlap) --
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,528.546,529.035,-- a hearing.
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,529.035,532.102,-- affidavits and briefs and whatnot from the --
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,532.102,533.15,From the previous --
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,533.15,533.188,"-- on the merits, from the merits."
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,533.188,535.476,"From the previous proceedings, yes, sir."
1967.71,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,535.476,541.454,So you think at least you want to argue the merits up here for the search and seizure claim?
1967.71,0,29570,james_j_cally,,541.454,546.464,"I think so, sir, because I think it amounts the consideration of this Court."
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,906.667,911.05,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,994.852,1001.923,"I gather Miss Soloff, he was still serving his time when this petition for habeas was filed?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1001.923,1003.483,"When petition was filed, it was Your Honor."
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1003.483,1008.973,It's before the conclusion of the proceeding that he completed service of his --
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1008.973,1009.113,He completed --
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1009.113,1010.222,"Now, what point was it?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1011.766,1013.62,"It had gotten through the Circuit Court, Your Honor."
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1013.742,1017.327,"But I mean, at what point was he released had he -- did he finished servicing his sentence?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1017.327,1019.42,"On March 6, 1967, that --"
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1019.42,1021.72,And what was the status of this proceeding then?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1021.72,1023.794,After the dis -- it was between courts.
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1029.439,1031.348,After the disposition by the Circuit?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1031.348,1031.794,That's right.
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1031.794,1032.282,I see.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1032.282,1036.33,And before the petition was filed with some two weeks.
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1036.33,1041.623,I understood counsel to say that it was after he filed the petition here.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1041.623,1043.526,"Well, I think that's an error of thought --"
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1043.526,1044.242,"It is, its."
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1044.242,1044.789,Yes.
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1044.789,1045.214,Very well.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1045.214,1047.896,According to the cover on his appendix --
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1047.896,1048.032,Yes.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1048.032,1055.367,"-- the petition was filed on March 20, which was some two weeks later."
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1106.803,1109.463,What was the date of that?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1109.814,1111.931,"These are the 1966 amendments, I believe, Justice Brennan."
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1111.931,1115.106,19 -- after Parker and Ellis have been decided here?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1115.106,1117.398,"Oh, yes."
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1117.398,1132.779,"May I ask you, if Parker versus Ellis is fav -- is followed here, that there's any procedure under New York law whereby this man can get any relief from that conviction?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1132.779,1145.033,"I think at this point, I could not say that there is any procedure by which he could get relief from the conviction itself although there is a procedure by which he could be relieved of any civil disabilities attaching to it."
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1145.033,1151.214,Even not because of a defect in the trial?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1151.214,1152.503,"No, not because of a defect in --"
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1152.503,1156.719,That's something that applies to all prisoners that --
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1156.719,1156.92,New York --
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1156.92,1163.071,"-- that they can go -- they can have some relief in order to get the civil liberties back, isn't that right but --"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1163.071,1165.072,It applies to first offenders.
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1165.072,1166.167,Yes.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1166.167,1168.225,Then they get back their voting rights --
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1168.225,1168.687,Yes.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1168.687,1175.835,-- and the -- they may apply for licenses which might otherwise be barred if they procured the necessary certificate.
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1210.082,1216.432,What disabilities does this man labor under now that he has been convicted of this felony?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1216.432,1221.454,The only ones that I know of are the ones that he mentions in his reply brief.
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1234.358,1242.483,"And he stands convicted of a felony for impeachment purposes, and that -- and as a witness, I would suggest?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1242.483,1245.565,"I'm not -- I don't know the law on that, Your Honor."
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1245.784,1246.888,"Well, he is --"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1246.888,1247.166,-- that's true.
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1247.166,1250.565,"Then as a witness who take the stand, I think --"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1250.565,1250.575,Oh!
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1250.575,1251.365,-- if they asked if he's ever been --
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1251.365,1251.904,I see.
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1251.904,1253.998,-- convicted of felony and --
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1253.998,1254.084,I understand.
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1254.084,1256.211,"-- then he would have to say yes, would he not?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1256.211,1259.078,"Yes, he would."
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1259.078,1293.062,"Well now, if that is true if he has no relief of any kind from this conviction, what would prevent any state from releasing a man whenever he asked for a writ of habeas corpus before he gets to the Supreme Court and thereby deprive him, deprive all applicant -- or petitioners for a writ of habeas corpus?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1293.062,1298.486,"Well, I don't think that we can assume that the state is going to do this in bad faith, --"
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1298.486,1299.246,"No, but I --"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1299.246,1300.224,-- in essence.
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1300.224,1306.591,"Nor can we assume that they will not do it because it has been done to our knowledge in cases in this Court, many of them."
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1306.591,1317.907,"Well, may I say with respect to this case that during the entire period that it was in the state appellate process, including the application for certiorari to this Court, petitioner was on bail."
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1320.908,1323.921,But let's take the case where a man is in jail.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1329.947,1331.782,Where a person is in jail and he's --
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1331.782,1333.242,Yes.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1333.242,1334.681,-- and the state releases him?
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1334.681,1335.438,The state --
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1335.438,1335.665,They could --
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1335.665,1341.8,-- just before he gets to the Supreme Court releases him and deprives us a jurisdiction.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1341.8,1346.732,I would say that on the direct appellate process -- if that were on the direct appellate process.
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1346.732,1347.997,"No, I'm talking about habeas corpus."
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1347.997,1349.453,About collateral attack in the state courts.
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1349.453,1352.532,I'm talking about habeas corpus.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1352.532,1353.525,State habeas corpus?
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1353.525,1354.31,(Inaudible)
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1354.31,1356.326,You're talking about state habeas corpus or federal habeas corpus (Voice Overlap) --
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1356.326,1357.473,"Well, I wouldn't take either."
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1359.817,1374.149,"Well, as far as federal habeas corpus goes, I would say that this particular petitioner and most appellants, in order to secure relief by habeas corpus at all must have gone through the state courts and have had the opportunities --"
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1374.149,1374.482,That's right.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1374.482,1393.025,-- to apply to this Court and that therefore it is not -- it's not an unjust result that they don't have further collateral attack by way of habeas corpus where they have had the benefits of full appellate review.
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1393.025,1400.314,"Well, even though there are constitutional violations in his conviction, you mean this -- he had no right to come to this Court?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1400.314,1402.057,Not by way of habeas corpus.
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1438.414,1452.044,"Suppose in this case the man had already applied for certiorari here and jurisdiction had attached, and then after that the state had released him?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1452.044,1454.337,I think this is Parker against Ellis and I think that that's --
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1454.337,1456.048,You think that's still Parker versus Ellis?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1456.048,1459.803,I think it is because that's what happened in Parker against Ellis as I understand it.
1967.71,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1459.803,1465.177,"This is a -- is this really not -- the issue here isn't mootness, is it?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1465.177,1465.363,Only --
1967.71,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1465.363,1466.475,The issue here is that construction --
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1466.475,1466.783,-- jurisdiction --
1967.71,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.783,1469.816,-- of the federal statute as to where the habeas corpus lies?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1469.816,1470.158,That's right.
1967.71,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.316,1474.815,It's a question whether the -- Parker and Ellis said it's a custody problem --
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1474.815,1475.095,That's right.
1967.71,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1475.095,1476.732,-- not a mootness problem.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1476.732,1477.969,"That's right, Mr. Justice White."
1967.71,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1483.296,1488.855,Because it could well be held that this case isn't moot at all and still habeas corpus wouldn't lie.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1488.855,1490.52,"Yes, that's right."
1967.71,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.786,1503.069,That would go to -- that would go if it was here on direct appeal when he released --
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1503.069,1504.687,That's correct.
1967.71,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1504.687,1506.56,-- then the question would be mootness?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1506.56,1507.071,That's correct.
1967.71,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1507.403,1509.173,And he might -- it might not be moot.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1509.173,1509.913,That's our position.
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1513.668,1523.608,"Miss Soloff, could you tell me again what section you say that was amended in 1966, and how that amendment reads?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1524.42,1525.108,Oh!
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1529.864,1532.72,"Do you have it, the language?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1532.72,1533.584,"Yes, I have, Your Honor."
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1533.584,1540.916,Would you mind reading it?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1540.916,1563.366,"The Supreme Court or Justice thereof, a Circuit Judge or a District Court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States”."
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1563.366,1571.775,"Well, but here, I gather, of the -- at the time I think you told us, that he filed that application with the District Court."
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1571.775,1572.732,He was indeed in custody --
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1572.732,1579.934,"But doesn't that's -- then really, that amendment, doesn't answer the Parker and Ellis question for instance."
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1579.934,1582.445,"Oh, I think its further evidence."
1967.71,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1582.445,1584.284,Was there ever a writ issued in the hearing?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1584.284,1585.438,"No, no writ ever issued."
1967.71,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1586.516,1590.044,And they would still have to -- a writ still have to be issued if he won this case here.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1590.044,1590.695,That's right because --
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1590.695,1595.633,"But this speaks in turn that (Inaudible) may apply to it, is that it?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1595.633,1595.659,I'm sorry.
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1595.659,1599.052,They'll entertain an application for isn't that the way it's done.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1599.052,1600.299,Only.
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1600.299,1605.793,"Yes, but it's entertained an application for it, not an issue of writ, is that the way it is?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1605.793,1606.535,That's right.
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1606.535,1608.433,Yes.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1608.433,1617.708,"Nevertheless, I would think that in view of Parker and Ellis and in view of the fact that this falls not only in Parker and Ellis but language in Fay against Noia."
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1617.708,1619.081,"No, I perhaps -- I misunderstood you."
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1624.801,1625.013,No.
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1625.013,1625.491,"-- the question, (Voice Overlap)."
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1625.491,1627.156,"No, I'm sorry."
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1651.486,1654.497,Are you going to address yourself to the Nowakowski claim?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1654.497,1661.492,I am.
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1693.544,1704.799,Can you make any distinction between the fact that he was on bail now and not in actual custody?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1704.799,1706.877,"I'm not sure I understand the question, Mr. Justice Warren."
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1706.877,1715.03,"Well, in some states anyway, a man cannot apply for habeas corpus if he is on bail."
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1721.812,1723.746,"Not for purposes of this case, Your Honor."
1967.71,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1785.886,1791.272,"Well, the -- but the specific decision, you're concerned with is the Linkletter decision, isn't it?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1791.272,1818.015,"Yes, but Linkletter is also not a bar to this, to this reading of the case because the facts in Linkletter were and I think that the decision limited itself to those facts quite specifically that the entire process, the entire appellate process had in fact been concluded before Mapp was decided so that the retroactivity of Mapp had only to reach back to that point."
1967.71,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1818.015,1822.745,"Well, Linkletter was pretty clear in what it said, didn't he -- isn't it?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1822.745,1834.306,"I believe that there's -- I don't have Linkletter in front of me, but I believe there's a statement in Linkletter to the effect that we're dealing with the facts of this case and I believe it's in the context of chronology."
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1901.777,1906.29,"Did the Court decide it on the merits, the Court of Appeals?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1906.29,1930.967,"The Court of Appeals filed a one line order in which it granted our motion to dismiss the appeal and denied relief in forma pauperis because it included an order denying -- pardon me, because it included the order granting our cross motion to dismiss and because our cross motion to dismiss was for want of merit."
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1931.447,1937.28,"Did you submit something in support of the argument, which you (Inaudible)?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1937.28,1941.121,We submitted an affidavit which contains arguments of law.
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1953.937,1955.162,Also with argument?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1955.162,1957.108,Also with argument of law.
1967.71,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.605,1969.304,(Inaudible)
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1969.304,1969.755,It is.
1967.71,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.353,1975.554,They dismissed the appeal (Inaudible)?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1975.554,1977.126,That would be the only explanation --
1967.71,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1977.126,1978.406,(Inaudible)
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1978.406,1982.508,"-- that they did pass on the merits, that it was -- he described it a bobtail appeal."
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1982.508,1990.218,(Inaudible)
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,1990.218,2001.0,"In Nowakowski, there was no cross motion made so that it couldn't be determined what basis the decision of the Third Circuit went on."
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2001.0,2007.382,(Inaudible)
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2007.382,2009.574,I haven't looked at the Nowakowski record.
1967.71,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2025.358,2071.112,"Miss Soloff what Nowakowski held, as I remember it, I understand it is that once a certificate of probable cause has been granted by the District Court, then it is incumbent upon the Court of Appeals to treat that appeal as an ordinary appeal as of right, to treat it in accordance with its usual procedures, the way it treats appeals as of right to the Court of Appeals and I suppose then the question becomes whether this is a -- consistent with the regular procedures of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to dismiss an appeal as of right in the manner that this was -- this case was dismissed without argument but simply on the records."
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2102.731,2103.138,Well --
1967.71,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2103.138,2106.188,"Maybe you don't know the answer, I know, I don't know the answer."
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2106.188,2109.635,Let me say this.
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2150.159,2155.574,"Are the rule, the court rule requires (Inaudible)?"
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2155.574,2158.135,"No, they don't provide that."
1967.71,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2158.135,2170.606,"Well, the offer it and as here is that the Court of Appeals did expressly reject the application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis."
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2182.265,2182.277,Well --
1967.71,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2182.277,2189.321,"But may I ask you another question here, if you know the answer to this."
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2197.716,2200.784,"March 6, 1967."
1967.71,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2200.784,2201.455,March 6.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2208.147,2210.259,"Yes, it was well after he had filed the application."
1967.71,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2210.259,2210.684,Yes.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2210.684,2210.711,This Court -- this case --
1967.71,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2210.711,2216.583,And it was -- it was -- at what stage in the appellate process was that?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2222.06,2227.044,"No, it was after the Court of Appeals had determined that there was no merit to the appeal."
1967.71,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2227.044,2227.776,I see.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2228.256,2228.404,That was in --
1967.71,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2228.404,2230.609,-- between that stage and --
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2230.609,2232.287,His application to this Court.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2232.287,2233.265,"I see, yes."
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2265.01,2265.909,That's right.
1967.71,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2265.909,2266.496,Thank you.
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2266.496,2274.388,He was in custody through the disposition by the Second Circuit.
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2275.13,2291.961,(Inaudible) Do you know of any instance that made the view that the Court of Appeals of New York has to -- without oral argument composed off merely on submission to make (Inaudible) --
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2291.961,2304.973,I don't know of an instance where paid appeal has been dismissed without oral argument but I do know of instances where paid appeal has been dismissed without briefs on a motion of some sort in the Second Circuit.
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2312.523,2313.905,But on a motion?
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2314.559,2315.535,On a motion.
1967.71,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2315.535,2316.084,(Inaudible)
1967.71,1,18028,brenda_soloff,,2319.149,2320.6,That's what we suggest.
1967.71,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2362.497,2367.831,Mr. Cally.
