1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,51.839,55.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-7000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,118.936,124.402,"Well, you say the... the court engrafted that onto Simmons."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,131.744,137.648,"--Yes, but it... it looked at... it implicitly looked at all of State law and not--"
1999.99-7000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,137.648,140.913,"Well, how can you... how can you say it implicitly looked at all of State law?"
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,140.913,155.859,"--Parole eligibility under Simmons means that there is no possibility of parole absent... and the Court looked at remote... what it described... the plurality described as hypothetical possibilities, some of which would have--"
1999.99-7000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,155.859,158.983,"Well, but... but the plurality is not the controlling opinion in that case."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,158.983,175.587,"--Yes, but the concurrence necessarily had to accept... in order to reach the same result, had to accept the plurality's characterization of parole ineligibility as not including remote hypothetical possibilities."
1999.99-7000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.034,189.986,"When you say... now, tell me again."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,193.219,232.048,"--The plurality made this explicit, but the concurring opinion of Justice O'Connor, which created the majority in Simmons, could not have taken any other view because if that was correct, then it would not be... if... if the plurality opinion as to what constituted ineligibility was not the view of the Court, then Simmons... the holding of Simmons as expressed by the concurring opinion could not have been handed down because it would not be possible to say, given these remote hypothetical possibilities in the future, that Mr. Simmons himself was truly ineligible for parole."
1999.99-7000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,232.048,234.765,"Well, this is something slightly different than that, of course."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,242.247,243.341,"Yes, but it is--"
1999.99-7000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.341,249.65,"And... and is that a ministerial act, or... or what was to take place here?"
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,254.024,254.571,--No.
1999.99-7000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.571,255.491,--the entry of the judgment?
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,255.491,256.005,No.
1999.99-7000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,303.723,308.752,"Now, the defense counsel did tell and argue to the jury--"
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,308.752,309.268,--Yes.
1999.99-7000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,309.268,310.5,--did he not--
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,310.5,310.907,He did.
1999.99-7000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.907,315.234,"--that this person would never, as a practical matter, get out, if he lived to be 120?"
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,315.234,329.744,"Yes, but Virginia law prohibited him from giving the most important aspect of that, which was that these long terms of years could not be reduced by parole, and the jury spotted the omission."
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,375.475,390.985,"Mr. Bruck, in this case you say, you know, it's pretty clear that it would have... in the next case it won't be quite so clear that... you know, that... that he will get the third... the third strike which will render it impossible for him to be paroled."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,415.678,429.283,"But we do say that because what Virginia failed to do is to look not at the single statute, but at the entire relevant body of State law which includes the provisions of State law that I was citing a moment ago to Justice O'Connor."
1999.99-7000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,429.283,443.152,"Well, shouldn't we look to the Virginia Supreme Court for that decision as to... I mean, are you saying that the State supreme court in deciding a question of whether someone was parole eligible made a mistake of State law?"
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,443.152,443.527,No.
1999.99-7000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,446.152,446.572,What are you saying?
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,446.572,452.774,--look to the Virginia law if the State gives us the law and if the State looks at the relevant State law.
1999.99-7000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,461.692,462.02,Well--
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,462.02,462.442,--I'm sorry.
1999.99-7000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,462.442,474.859,"--Well, you... you concede, don't you, that under the law of Virginia, this person was not eligible for parole at the... at the critical... or was eligible for parole at... at the critical point?"
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,474.859,492.383,"We concede that... that under Virginia law, his ineligibility had not yet been formally declared, but when one takes into consideration the other provisions of Virginia law, we by no means concede that there was any possibility of his ever being paroled."
1999.99-7000,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,505.051,516.328,"Well, you're saying... I guess you're saying... that the question of what is a sufficient certainty or a sufficient probability, if you will, that there will be no parole is a question of Federal law."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,521.421,522.577,"Yes, although--"
1999.99-7000,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,522.577,531.041,"So, Virginia can say, yes, in this sense the... the ineligibility is yet to be determined because a decree has not been entered."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,549.877,550.799,--That's correct.
1999.99-7000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,586.66,596.672,"Well, Justice Scalia has raised a question which I think is one that should be of concern, and that is, where do you draw the line?"
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,625.41,629.487,"--If... well, Simmons of course said lifetime."
1999.99-7000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,637.548,638.53,"So, you would concede--"
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,638.53,638.921,Yes.
1999.99-7000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,638.921,640.452,--that that kind of hypothetical--
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,640.452,640.796,Yes.
1999.99-7000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,640.796,642.186,--is ruled out by Simmons--
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,642.186,642.545,Yes.
1999.99-7000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,642.545,644.997,--that to do that would require an extension.
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,644.997,646.388,I do concede that.
1999.99-7000,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,646.388,652.134,"But you think that you fall within Simmons, properly understood, without extending it in this case."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,652.134,653.289,Yes.
1999.99-7000,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,657.679,667.503,"May I go back to with the... the question... one of the things I believe that I said in Simmons, it doesn't necessarily have to be the judge, if the lawyer can bring it out."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,694.508,695.399,--Precisely.
1999.99-7000,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,696.477,703.551,"So... so, he couldn't do what Simmons said a lawyer could do and then the judge doesn't need to do it."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,707.16,708.675,That is exactly correct.
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,710.034,717.186,"But it makes no difference if the answer was... was no, he would not be ineligible for parole."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,717.186,720.247,--But that was not the answer under Virginia law.
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,720.247,721.685,"Well, you ultimately have to come back to that."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,725.793,727.682,And I think that's very clear.
1999.99-7000,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,728.87,731.962,May I... this is a jury that's not composed of lawyers.
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,746.612,747.204,--Exactly.
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.875,755.593,Is that what Simmons... it's not a matter of law.
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,757.873,758.685,--No.
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,758.685,764.823,"--if... if it's really a thousand to one even though there's a... you know, a small possibility under State law?"
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,765.963,766.057,No.
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,766.854,770.024,It doesn't have to be absolute impossibility under State law?
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,770.024,774.975,"--Yes, yes, that's correct, with the exception of remote hypothetical possibilities."
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,775.975,776.334,"Oh, I see."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,777.833,780.896,--Nothing is absolute except death.
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,780.896,782.004,"--Well, no."
1999.99-7000,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,782.004,782.504,Taxes.
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,782.504,792.78,I think whether under current... whether under current Virginia law he will be ever eligible for parole can be absolutely answered yes or no.
1999.99-7000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,792.78,797.201,Then it would be a much easier rule to apply than the one you--
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,797.201,801.09,But it would not apply the rule in Simmons.
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.049,867.172,--That just says that the court can't make the decision.
1999.99-7000,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,874.451,875.997,"Yes, but your point is the decision had not yet been made."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,877.013,878.247,The decision had not yet been made.
1999.99-7000,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,878.982,881.605,By... by the authority who had the authority to make the decision.
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,881.605,891.21,"And had the Attorney General of South Carolina taken the view that the Commonwealth takes now, they would have made exactly the same argument and said, well, there are statutory exceptions."
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,915.981,917.637,The difference is there he was in the rule.
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,935.38,937.38,Justice Scalia--
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,937.38,938.099,That hadn't occurred.
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,938.099,947.156,"--everything in Simmons had not occurred either because under South Carolina law, which is different than Virginia's, the parole board has to make a factual determination."
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.219,951.295,That's just the determination.
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,965.4,975.599,--The only factor that remained... I... I don't believe it's a real distinction because... because of the difference between South Carolina law... but the... and... and Virginia.
1999.99-7000,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1101.25,1116.854,"Mr. Bruck, what about the answer is... you're asking us to draw the line where in... in practical reality we know that this person is going to get judgment entered on the conviction."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1130.66,1134.034,--Exactly the same thing would apply.
1999.99-7000,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1140.611,1144.249,But in Simmons there was the... the adjudication.
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1169.756,1173.206,--A guilty plea is at least conclusive as a jury's verdict.
1999.99-7000,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1184.906,1187.281,"Well, I take it you would accept a reasonable doubt standard."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1195.012,1199.386,--That would be... and... and I think that's a nice way of restating the holding of Simmons in--
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1199.386,1204.211,"What if he's only been indicted for the third crime, but the... the evidence is overwhelming?"
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1204.211,1205.741,--Simmons does not apply.
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.741,1207.1,Simmons... why not?
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1211.567,1212.317,I--
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.317,1218.705,But you say Simmons would apply if he had already confessed to that third crime even though he hasn't yet... what if he has confessed to it?
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1218.705,1220.018,--I'm sorry?
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.018,1222.547,What if he has confessed to the third crime?
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1222.547,1230.951,If... I do not believe that Simmons could be read to extend that far without extending it.
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.951,1231.607,Why not?
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1234.371,1235.403,We don't even know if it's going to be prosecuted.
1999.99-7000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1244.836,1249.803,"I know, and I don't want to go nuts trying to figure out how far down the line we're... we're going to carry this."

1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1254.989,1256.096,--No.
1999.99-7000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1264.484,1265.046,--the issue of law.
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1271.591,1274.278,"Well, we did not use that term in our... in our brief."
1999.99-7000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1274.638,1275.918,But I thought you agreed with Justice Souter.
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1275.918,1278.557,"--Well, I... I think that is... that is one way of looking at it."
1999.99-7000,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1286.351,1293.27,Why don't... why don't we say that the determination is a determination which depends both on law and on fact?
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1293.27,1294.723,It does.
1999.99-7000,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1294.723,1299.47,"And in making that next determination, we require a very high standard of probability?"
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1299.47,1302.063,I... I would be quite comfortable with that.
1999.99-7000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1353.371,1354.511,Just one... one question.
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1375.861,1380.735,"--Well, let... let us recall that he was working under the strictures of Virginia law, which were absolutely settled."
1999.99-7000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1383.811,1384.78,And it was... and it was pre-Simmons.
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1384.78,1385.687,--And it was pre-Simmons.
1999.99-7000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1385.687,1396.901,"Still, it... it seems to me the... the answer that the... that the trial counsel suggested contradicts most of the arguments you're making here."
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1396.901,1406.037,"He was halfway through, thinking on his feet about how he could fashion something that wouldn't contradict Virginia law, which is contrary to Simmons."
1999.99-7000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1406.037,1406.724,I understand.
1999.99-7000,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1409.317,1417.485,"Of course, the Virginia Supreme Court did not, in any sense, base its decision on that, but reached the merits."
1999.99-7000,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1418.61,1420.5,"Very well, Mr. Bruck."
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1422.25,1426.89,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-7000,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1497.378,1514.777,"In this connection, would you comment on... on your brother's argument that this case is like Simmons because in neither case was there a decree in so many words by a court that the individual was parole ineligible?"
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1526.07,1535.315,"Justice Souter, the reason why we can't even consider that argument under 2254(d) is because it's not contained in Simmons."
1999.99-7000,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1545.983,1557.962,"Well, but there was... there was no... I think maybe he would say, even... even accepting your response, there's no... there's no statement in Simmons to the effect that there had been an entry of... of a... a kind of definitive order."
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1562.399,1583.297,"--I think a reasonable jurist and... and objectively reasonably could have looked at the opinion in Simmons and determined, because of the tremendous repetition of the phrase, ineligible under State law, almost... the word parole ineligible was almost never standing alone."
1999.99-7000,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1601.586,1608.147,But the question... the question is what it... what that phrase means as a matter of Federal law.
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1634.527,1635.604,"--Correct, but we cannot--"
1999.99-7000,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1635.604,1637.79,But that's... but that's a question of Federal law.
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1637.79,1642.492,"--Well, we cannot... first of all, we cannot impute anything in the briefs or the oral argument to the Virginia Supreme Court."
1999.99-7000,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1670.325,1671.122,Let... let me ask you this.
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1703.405,1705.405,"Not covered by Simmons, Justice O'Connor?"
1999.99-7000,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1705.405,1706.358,Why not?
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1706.358,1716.369,"Because in that case, I think it would present a different case, one in which once presumably the defendant found out about this, it would be his duty to bring that to the attention of a court."
1999.99-7000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1738.345,1740.875,What happens if it's subject to appeal?
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1740.875,1744.077,I don't understand the question.
1999.99-7000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1744.077,1753.151,"I mean, we have Mr. Simmons back, and Mr. Simmons says, you know, there's something you didn't know about, although I've been convicted and the conviction had been entered, it could have been reversed on appeal."
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1754.995,1755.667,It would--
1999.99-7000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1755.667,1757.697,Now does he get... we're going to execute him now?
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1757.697,1760.259,--It would depend on what the State law is on the--
1999.99-7000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1760.259,1761.93,"Well, I mean, all right, fine."
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1851.755,1858.268,"--Well, Justice Breyer, is your question that under that particular State's law, those are factors that go into the State's determination--"
1999.99-7000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1858.268,1858.674,I'm just saying--
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1858.674,1859.861,--of parole eligibility?
1999.99-7000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1859.861,1865.295,"--on your... on your view of it... you know, what we're imagining is ridiculous possibilities."
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1893.644,1906.233,"If the State law is... and... and, Justice Breyer, I disagree that the entry of a judgment order on conviction is anything technical or... or formalistic--"
1999.99-7000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1906.421,1906.233,That would be a different question.
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1907.718,1908.077,--whatsoever.
1999.99-7000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1924.133,1926.883,"You know, but what I'm doing is I'm not being clear myself."
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1954.934,1967.132,"--My view is that under the laws that exist today, under the four corners of Simmons, that if he is ineligible under State law, he gets the Simmons instruction, and if he is eligible under State law, he does not."
1999.99-7000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1983.282,1994.168,"So... so, in your... in your view, if the State court were to say, we consider our people ineligible for parole only when the Governor announces he's not going to give a pardon."
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1999.261,2002.274,"Under... currently under Simmons, yes, Justice Breyer."
1999.99-7000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2006.914,2011.459,"If I... if I believe that you were wrong about that, would you lose?"
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2011.459,2014.222,Wrong about my interpretation.
1999.99-7000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2014.222,2017.518,"If I believed that Simmons... that would be so far from what Simmons intended, that... that--"
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2017.518,2020.908,"No, I would not lose in this case because my case does not present those facts."
1999.99-7000,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2032.326,2037.855,"--Well, except for the fact that the entry of the judgment may have been a purely ministerial thing."
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2037.855,2038.37,It--
1999.99-7000,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2038.37,2043.305,It was not... it was not in any way a situation where it wouldn't be entered in the--
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2043.305,2044.82,"--Justice O'Connor, it was not."
1999.99-7000,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2050.52,2051.427,--Tell us why.
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2051.427,2065.438,He has conceded that... that the authority in Virginia gives to a circuit court the authority to vacate or set aside a jury's conviction before entry of judgment.
1999.99-7000,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2066.875,2069.404,Sua sponte... sua sponte the judge can do that?
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2069.404,2071.404,"He certainly may, yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-7000,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2072.309,2081.337,You have... you have given us in your brief a couple of factual scenarios on which the judge might do that.
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2081.337,2083.118,"--And there are many more, Justice Souter."
1999.99-7000,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2083.118,2090.974,"And... no, but there may be many more, but I'd like you to comment on what seems to me the just total lack of reality of the suggestions you make."
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2120.962,2130.02,"Justice Souter, I believe that it's... it's Virginia Supreme Court 3A: 15 gives a circuit court unfettered authority to set aside the judgment."
1999.99-7000,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2130.474,2140.454,"Have you ever known of a circuit court that said, gee, I feel so sorry for this fellow because he's got too many convictions against him, I think I won't enter judgment in this most recent one?"
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2141.344,2145.546,--I... I think that absolutely what could occur in that sentencing--
1999.99-7000,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2145.546,2147.389,My question was whether you had an example.
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2150.185,2152.308,--They certainly do.
1999.99-7000,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2152.308,2153.245,They do?
1999.99-7000,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2153.386,2154.167,"Now, it may not be--"
1999.99-7000,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3230.663,3241.269,"If Your Honor please, really the only point I'd like to respond to is this idea of slippery slope that Virginia advances."
1999.99-7000,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3297.028,3307.43,"Maybe we should reformulate Simmons then and say, you know, that issue is whether he is likely or overwhelmingly likely or beyond a reasonable doubt will be paroled by Virginia."
1999.99-7000,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3307.43,3309.913,One need not go so far.
1999.99-7000,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3309.913,3312.396,That... that would solve the problem that you're worried about.
1999.99-7000,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3314.301,3321.736,"Well, I'm really not worried about it because I don't think that... that this Court will restrict South Carolina in such a way."
1999.99-7000,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3321.736,3322.954,"Well, maybe Simmons itself was a mistake."
1999.99-7000,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3322.954,3329.639,"Well, that leads me to my last point, which is that Simmons has been accepted very comfortably by the States."
1999.99-7000,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3376.387,3377.637,"Thank you, Mr. Bruck."
