1986.85-2116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.787,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 85-2116, Puerto Rico again Branstad."
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,12.84,17.334,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-2116,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,341.035,343.316,"Iowa was his home, was it not?"
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,343.316,345.516,"Iowa was his home, yes, sir."
1986.85-2116,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,345.516,353.472,Do you know why so low a bond was imposed under a murder charge?
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,353.472,357.203,"In Puerto Rico, you mean, sir?"
1986.85-2116,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,357.203,358.044,"Yes, in Puerto Rico."
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,358.044,370.493,"Well, he was first charged with manslaughter, and a small bond was requested from him."
1986.85-2116,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,400.934,402.386,I suppose there isn't any explanation.
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,404.557,406.578,"Yes, it is."
1986.85-2116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,677.246,685.333,"You agree, Mr. Saldana, don't you, that we would have to overrule Kentucky against Dennison to rule in your favor here?"
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,685.333,686.402,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-2116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,690.545,694.449,"Mr. Saldana, why is that... why is that so?"
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,731.685,753.24,"--Well, the power of Congress to enact the extradition act is based on the implied power of Congress to implement the extradition clause."
1986.85-2116,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,756.879,771.359,"Well, maybe this statute, insofar as it might apply to Puerto Rico, is not an implementation of the extradition clause of the Constitution but is an implementation of Congress' power to govern territories."
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,771.359,787.772,"--Well, that power cannot justify the Congress ordering a state to extradite a fugitive to a territory."
1986.85-2116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,969.969,975.853,"But that statute was in effect at the time Kentucky against Dennison was decided, wasn't it?"
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,975.853,980.147,"I'm sorry, I did not hear you."
1986.85-2116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,980.147,983.179,I thought you were referring to the statute of 1793.
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,983.179,983.61,Yes.
1986.85-2116,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,983.61,989.443,And that statute was in effect at the time that Kentucky v. Dennison was decided.
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,989.443,990.655,"That's right, sir."
1986.85-2116,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1040.437,1047.621,"Mr. Saldana, not that it matters, but what position do you hold in the government of Puerto Rico?"
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1047.621,1052.185,I am special counsel in this case.
1986.85-2116,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1052.185,1055.565,"I mean, I notice on the brief that everybody has a title but you."
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1055.565,1056.456,That's right.
1986.85-2116,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1056.456,1059.819,"And I was just wondering, you're authorized to speak for the government?"
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1059.819,1060.38,Yes.
1986.85-2116,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1060.38,1061.579,Thank you.
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1061.579,1088.056,"Well, we feel that no case, or few cases at least, would better demonstrate that Dennison should be overruled that this, the present one."
1986.85-2116,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1261.691,1279.423,"Well, Mr. Saldana, the State of Iowa in its brief suggests, as a last argument, that Puerto Rico isn't entitled to use the clause or the statute at all, because you aren't a state; that you're a territory."
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1279.423,1291.05,"Well, Your Honor, that argument really is not in point."
1986.85-2116,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1352.26,1354.461,You say it's... Puerto Rico is a state?
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1354.461,1378.587,"--Well, it's a state not in the sense that it is a state of the Union, but it is a state that is joined with the United States by a compact, and has the degree, the same degree, a similar degree, of autonomy and independence as the other states of the union."
1986.85-2116,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.587,1385.272,Do you think just any territory of the United States could employ the extradition clause?
1986.85-2116,0,35152,lino_j_saldana,,1385.272,1387.215,"I think so, sir, I think so, yes."
1986.85-2116,1,17394,brent_r_appel,,1826.977,1831.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-2116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.769,1879.911,"I think that's probably how Marbury v. Madison was argued, too."
1986.85-2116,1,17394,brent_r_appel,,1879.911,1881.301,--I read Marbury--
1986.85-2116,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1881.301,1882.302,It lost there.
1986.85-2116,1,17394,brent_r_appel,,1882.302,1885.387,--I read Marbury yesterday.
1986.85-2116,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1890.409,1891.849,You spent most of the day reading it?
1986.85-2116,1,17394,brent_r_appel,,1891.849,1894.901,"--Only a part of it, Justice."
1986.85-2116,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.805,1998.849,What's the source... how can you tell what this common law tradition is?
1986.85-2116,1,17394,brent_r_appel,,2001.881,2004.372,--There's a smattering of case law.
1986.85-2116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.551,2092.992,xxx needn't perform what otherwise would be his duty?
1986.85-2116,1,17394,brent_r_appel,,2092.992,2095.625,"Well, as to how to deal with the--"
1986.85-2116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.625,2097.755,"Well, that's what it amounts to in this case."
1986.85-2116,1,17394,brent_r_appel,,2097.755,2103.761,"--Well, our interpretation, of course, is the governor has done his duty; and that the governor--"
1986.85-2116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2103.761,2108.925,"Well, he needn't carry... he needn't extradite."
1986.85-2116,1,17394,brent_r_appel,,2108.925,2112.786,"--And that's our interpretation of the Constitution, that's correct, that while--"
1986.85-2116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2112.786,2114.458,Sometimes he has to and sometimes he doesn't?
1986.85-2116,1,17394,brent_r_appel,,2114.458,2116.889,"--Well, that's correct, just like the First Amendment says Congress--"
1986.85-2116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2116.889,2128.816,"Well, are you defending the judgment that... are you defending Kentucky, the Kentucky case, that there is no power to make a government extradite?"
1986.85-2116,1,17394,brent_r_appel,,2128.816,2133.889,--I think that prong of Kentucky v. Dennison has been much chipped away.
1986.85-2116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.889,2137.582,"Well, I know, but how about my question?"
1986.85-2116,1,17394,brent_r_appel,,2137.582,2140.383,Am I saying that this Court has no power?
1986.85-2116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.383,2140.904,Yes.
1986.85-2116,1,17394,brent_r_appel,,2140.904,2142.305,"Yes, I would say that."
1986.85-2116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2142.305,2144.097,Has no power to order a governor?
1986.85-2116,1,17394,brent_r_appel,,2144.097,2148.919,"Has no power under the constitutional scheme, because that was not anticipated."
1986.85-2116,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2148.919,2151.611,You know what you're asking for?
1986.85-2116,1,17394,brent_r_appel,,2165.111,2172.184,What I'm advocating is that the governors have authority to interpret that constitutional provision.
