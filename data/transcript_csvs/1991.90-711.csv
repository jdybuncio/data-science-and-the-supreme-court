1991.90-711,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.724,"We'll hear argument next in 90-711, Lawrence Presley v. Etowah County Commission, Peter Mack v. Russell County Commission."
1991.90-711,0,23085,edward_still,,43.577,46.445,Thank you.
1991.90-711,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,119.677,122.529,"Mr. Still, these two counties are not adjacent, are they?"
1991.90-711,0,23085,edward_still,,122.529,123.529,"No, sir, they are not."
1991.90-711,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,123.529,127.731,"One is in, where, northeast, and the other one is on the east side?"
1991.90-711,0,23085,edward_still,,127.731,128.481,"On the eastern border, yes, sir."
1991.90-711,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,133.718,136.67,I'm glad to know how to pronounce the one county's name.
1991.90-711,0,23085,edward_still,,137.27,138.287,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-711,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1127.684,1137.792,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-711,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1172.363,1173.863,Excuse me.
1991.90-711,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1177.396,1180.515,"Well, Justice Scalia, we think that is--"
1991.90-711,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1180.515,1181.781,"I mean, we're not dealing with poetry here."
1991.90-711,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1186.15,1204.112,"--Well, we think citizens do not simply cast votes, they cast votes for officials who will make decisions of Government, and... and a view of voting in elections, that it simply involves going into a booth and casting a vote is, we think, much too narrow."
1991.90-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1215.567,1227.191,"Your rule, I take it, would apply to statewide offices, too, if one responsibility were shifted to the treasurer to the auditor, saying they were both elected officials?"
1991.90-711,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1227.191,1227.727,Yes.
1991.90-711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1233.195,1236.916,"Well, what do you... how do you define decision making authority?"
1991.90-711,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1236.916,1251.842,"The distinction we draw is between the exercise of the authority to decide matters of Government... taxing, spending, substantive policy... and the transfer of those decisions from one official to another."
1991.90-711,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1268.268,1269.184,What do you mean by typically?
1991.90-711,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1275.255,1280.326,"Well, we think the rule would be something very close to no, it never has to be precleared."
1991.90-711,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1282.361,1285.73,So you disagree with Mr. Still on that?
1991.90-711,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1285.73,1287.598,"--Yes, we disagree on that point."
1991.90-711,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.797,1317.201,Why is that... why is it different if you do it through the budget than if you do it through reassigning functions?
1991.90-711,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1317.201,1317.967,--Because--
1991.90-711,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.967,1319.653,"In principle, why is it different?"
1991.90-711,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1319.653,1326.307,--Then we regard that as the exercise of the authority rather than a transfer of the authority to make decisions.
1991.90-711,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.864,1343.518,"If I take all authority from you and give it to another officer, that affects voting--"
1991.90-711,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1343.518,1344.251,--Yes.
1991.90-711,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1344.251,1349.172,"--But if I take all the money at your disposal and give it to another officer, that doesn't affect voting."
1991.90-711,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1349.172,1351.272,"In our view, that is where the line--"
1991.90-711,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1707.76,1714.164,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-711,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1744.766,1748.254,Was that argument rejected in Dougherty County?
1991.90-711,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1748.254,1749.304,"No, Your Honor."
1991.90-711,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1753.772,1758.907,"But that was the gist of the dissent there written by Justice Powell, wasn't it?"
1991.90-711,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1758.907,1765.061,"--Well, Your Honor, the dissent there dealt with whether this thing was closely enough related to election laws."
1991.90-711,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1804.436,1806.069,What about section 2?
1991.90-711,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1806.069,1807.221,Well--
1991.90-711,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1807.221,1809.254,"Do you... in your view, does section 2 apply to this or not?"
1991.90-711,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1809.254,1809.673,"--No, Your Honor."
1991.90-711,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.083,1961.387,"Have we got any cases that are even close to this, in your favor?"
1991.90-711,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1961.387,1974.778,"Well, Your Honor, there's only two cases that I'm aware of that have ever been filed that didn't involve something that related to elections, this case and the case of Hardy v. Wallace, which was a district court case in which they said that--"
1991.90-711,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1974.778,1975.98,So your answer is no.
1991.90-711,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1975.98,1976.614,"--No, Your Honor."
1991.90-711,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2008.332,2014.653,"Well, certainly voting... the term voting in the statute has been given a broad definition, Mr. Smith."
1991.90-711,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2014.653,2032.698,"Yes, Your Honor, and I... and I certainly am not asking the Court to cut back in that definition, the definition that started in Allen, but what that definition says is you look at who can vote, who's voting with them in the voter pool, who's on the ballot, what... where they vote, the terms of office of people, so that affects when they vote."
1991.90-711,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2057.599,2071.489,"Well, the... I think it's the Solicitor General's brief in this case gives a few examples in it of situations which might be said to be in this category of cases--"
1991.90-711,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2071.489,2073.375,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-711,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2073.375,2084.831,--where it has taken action and where it has... where the Office of the Attorney General has found there to be a discriminatory effect.
1991.90-711,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2084.831,2087.284,There are several examples cited.
1991.90-711,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2096.139,2117.97,"And it is certainly possible that in a covered jurisdiction that if a black person is elected to a particular office that with the intent to deprive that person of any power it could be removed, and under your view, then, there is no remedy."
1991.90-711,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2117.97,2118.47,No.
1991.90-711,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.706,2172.298,What... what about that... wasn't there a case in a three-judge court where there was a transfer of authority to appoint a racing commission from the county's legislative delegation to the Governor?
1991.90-711,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2172.298,2174.334,"That was the case I cited to you a moment ago, Your Honor."
1991.90-711,3,23085,edward_still,,2996.263,2997.596,Thank you.
1991.90-711,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3060.669,3073.31,Do you think the respondent's or the appellee's position here really requests a greater relief than they got in the three-judge court?
1991.90-711,3,23085,edward_still,,3073.31,3084.285,"--To the extent that they suggest and... and ask this Court to hold that we no longer have a section 2 claim if we don't have a section 5 claim, then they're getting more than they had in the court below, and they did file--"
1991.90-711,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3084.285,3087.237,So they have a different... they have a different and broader test for invalidation?
1991.90-711,3,23085,edward_still,,3087.237,3094.224,"--That's right, but they... but they're asking for greater relief than they got, and they're not... they didn't file an appeal."
1991.90-711,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3096.324,3098.009,"Thank you, Mr. Still."
