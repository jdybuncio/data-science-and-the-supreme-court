1998.97-475,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.026,"We'll hear argument now in No. 97-475, El Al Israel Airlines v. Tsui Tseng."
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,10.908,13.71,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-475,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,51.635,56.45,May I ask you a preliminary question that is a little confusing?
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,66.254,66.825,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-475,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,66.825,69.386,And we take the case on that assumption.
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,69.386,70.478,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-475,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,70.478,83.686,"And there is an article in the convention setting aside limits of liability in the case of willful misconduct, but we don't have that issue before us in this case?"
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,83.686,95.654,"I would submit, Justice O'Connor, you do not because the trial court found that there was no willful misconduct in the facts of this case, and that finding was not disturbed by the court of appeals, and therefore I do not believe it is before the Court."
1998.97-475,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,95.654,110.332,"And if there were a case of willful misconduct, then there... there would be no limit on the liability, or you would look to the law of the nation trying the case to determine that liability?"
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,110.332,118.489,"Justice O'Connor, we would submit that you do not reach the issue of willful misconduct if you do not reach the threshold issue of meeting the conditions under article 17."
1998.97-475,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.492,162.298,"So, in any event in this case, we simply don't address the issue of article 25 and how that would bear on it."
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,162.298,162.929,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-475,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,164.809,180.77,"Except that under your interpretation, we are left with the... with the surely unusual situation in which if there is a willful tort committed by a carrier, so long as it is not an accident, there is no recovery."
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,182.76,184.022,"Well, it--"
1998.97-475,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,184.022,184.841,Isn't that right?
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,188.854,189.595,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-475,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,196.449,198.512,Why would anyone write a treaty like that?
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,199.013,202.716,"Well, at the time that the convention was drafted, it was 1929."
1998.97-475,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,225.562,239.23,--But that still doesn't seem to me a good explanation for why the convention would cover accidents that really were no fault of the carrier and exclude liability for something that's intentional wrongdoing on the part of the carrier.
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,239.23,246.364,"Well, they... I don't believe the drafters thought they were doing that because when they drafted the convention, they also had article 20 which was the all necessary measures defense."
1998.97-475,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,275.984,296.67,"Why isn't it just as fair a reading... and granted, article 25 is not before us in this case, but when we're construing the convention as a whole, we have to have some mind for the type of thing article 25 covers... just as fair a reading of article 25 to say that the convention does permit recovery, but the limits are off?"
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,296.67,304.583,"To do that, I believe you have to ignore the scheme as to how the articles under the liability chapter were set forth."
1998.97-475,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,304.583,311.937,"Ms. Wilson, it might help if you gave examples of what has been considered willful misconduct."
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,348.572,354.849,"Well, there are the willful misconduct instances with respect to, for example, the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing."
1998.97-475,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.618,401.108,"In the Lockerbie situation, would the... would the carrier's... let's say it is willful... failure to... to have adequate security measures... would that be considered an accident so that you could come under the treaty?"
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,401.108,415.987,"Well, the court didn't address on point, when they reached the Lockerbie decision, the issue of whether the security measures was what triggered the accident requirement."
1998.97-475,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,415.987,418.649,"Well, just tell me your view."
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,418.649,420.029,"Well, my view is that the--"
1998.97-475,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,420.029,420.85,Would that be an accident?
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,420.85,437.35,"--Well, yes, but... but it also would have... the accident also could be the unusual and unexpected event of having the bomb placed on the aircraft, but the conduct of the carrier that rose to the level of intentional, the willful misconduct on the part of the carrier, was their security program."
1998.97-475,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.35,440.793,And would that be... was that an accident in your view?
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,440.793,443.227,"Yes, I believe that would... could constitute an accident."
1998.97-475,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.406,444.666,I see.
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,444.666,445.996,"--was driving at in that case, Your Honor."
1998.97-475,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,445.996,451.2,You mean in Lockerbie they were found to have willfully defaulted in taking security measures?
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,451.2,452.19,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-475,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,452.19,454.503,They said we... we want no security.
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,457.885,458.186,No.
1998.97-475,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,478.678,481.09,"They were doing nothing for their $5, in effect."
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,481.09,481.27,--Right.
1998.97-475,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,485.133,489.728,Do I understand that from your point of view it doesn't matter?
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,506.618,519.756,"Well, broadly speaking, that's true, but in the context of international security, to hold that the provision of security services is an unusual and unexpected event, I do not think would be borne out."
1998.97-475,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,571.33,574.072,--I suppose we ought to let you address this case.
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,574.252,576.485,Thank you.
1998.97-475,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,692.879,701.515,But is... do I correctly understand that your position is that it does not matter whether this is a case covered by article 17 or not?
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,711.603,720.648,"Justice Stevens, I wouldn't agree with that position because I do not view article 17 as determining the scope of the convention."
1998.97-475,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,724.412,731.365,"No, but article 17 surely is relevant to deciding whether article 24 applies, or do you think it's not relevant?"
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,745.474,756.493,"--Well, I... I don't in the sense that I say covered by 17 means that they concern passenger injury or death cases, not that it concerns whether or not you have a recoverable claim under article 17."
1998.97-475,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,756.493,759.725,"Well, I still... I'm still not sure."
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,768.22,779.667,"It is a passenger injury case, and therefore it falls under article 17, but the passenger in this instance does not state a recoverable claim under 17."
1998.97-475,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.667,780.759,But you haven't answered my question.
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,783.911,785.602,This passenger's claim?
1998.97-475,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,785.602,786.453,This case.
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,786.453,787.211,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-475,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,787.211,788.523,It is covered by 17.
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,788.523,788.733,Yes.
1998.97-475,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,788.733,789.935,I see.
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,789.935,791.978,It's covered by 17 because it's a passenger claim.
1998.97-475,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,791.978,801.706,"Are you saying it's covered by 17 because 17 embraces the universe of personal hurt, excluding baggage and delay?"
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,801.706,803.155,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1998.97-475,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,803.155,806.137,"In other words, you're saying--"
1998.97-475,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,806.137,817.704,"--It covers the universe and... and in this case it is inapplicable, but it has sufficient breadth so that 24 kicks in."
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,817.704,821.457,I... I would not agree that it's inapplicable.
1998.97-475,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,826.65,843.18,"See, the problem I have, this is... I want to get it on the table so you have an opportunity to... is that if you say the universe covered by article 17 is all cases, it's a little tension with the language of article 17 which describes the universe of cases in which the carrier shall be liable."
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,850.035,871.109,"I do suggest that, Your Honor, because I suggest that article 1 is intended to provide for all of international air transportation for passengers for hire, and article 17 I do not believe should have to have a subparagraph 2 saying that unless you meet these conditions... if you don't meet these conditions, you're entitled to sue outside the convention."
1998.97-475,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,879.364,889.262,"Yes, but the mere fact that article 1 says the convention shall apply doesn't necessarily mean... maybe it did... doesn't necessarily mean it shall preempt every other source of recovery."
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,891.783,914.036,"--I... I believe that it does when you read the... the articles in succession, and I believe that if you... although I... I don't believe you need to refer to the drafting history, if you do refer to the drafting history, I don't... I don't think that you can sensibly read the articles to mean that the... the drafters thought they were leaving a category of cases with respect to passenger injury outside of the convention."
1998.97-475,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,914.036,917.97,"Well, to make that clear, don't we really look outside the text?"
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,973.678,1001.416,"I believe that because treaties should be faithfully upheld, that it is appropriate to look to the drafting history in respect of the Warsaw Convention, in particular the Warsaw minutes which were transcribed by Horner and Legrez, and if you read them in total, including the comments of Sir Alfred Dennis and the reporter and various other delegates, it's clear that they were intending it to be all encompassing with respect to passenger claims."
1998.97-475,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1014.384,1038.49,"I'm surprised that you don't put weight on article 24 because I thought it was that article that clarifies that the convention is meant to be exclusive for these categories, personal injury, baggage delay, exclusive of any other actions of tort... whatever it may be."
1998.97-475,0,21688,diane_w_wilson,,1047.226,1056.804,"Justice Ginsburg, I... I do take the position that article 24 is telling the courts that you are not permitted to look outside the convention for causes of action."
1998.97-475,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1076.345,1077.707,"Very well, Ms. Wilson."
1998.97-475,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1078.719,1123.218,"Mr. Nuechtherlein, do you know, going to Justice Stevens' question, I think we would have less trouble with article 17 if instead of beginning, the carrier shall be liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if the accident, blah, blah, blah... I think it would be easier to sustain your case if it read instead, in the event, if it began with in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury, the carrier shall be liable if."
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1140.158,1145.631,The grammatical structure of article 17 is very similar in the French as in the English.
1998.97-475,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1168.398,1169.099,That's the core.
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1169.099,1191.172,"As an initial matter, I should point out the House of Lords also thought that that was in fact the appropriate language to focus on in... in this circumstance and determined, as we believe is correct, that the framers of the convention intended that introductory clause as a shorthand to denote the class of personal injury cases generally as opposed to the class of cases involving damages--"
1998.97-475,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1191.172,1193.513,The introductory clause for which article?
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1193.513,1194.905,--For article 24.
1998.97-475,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1197.466,1213.708,"Do you read article 17 as saying... for purposes of article 24, as saying something like in all cases covered by article 17, excluding or including liability, the provisions of the preceding paragraph apply?"
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1213.708,1221.262,"--I think the introductory clause of article 24, even in its original form, was a shorthand denoting all personal injury cases."
1998.97-475,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1227.746,1239.214,"Well, we're aware of that, but just I want to be quite sure of your interpretation of the first phrase of paragraph... subparagraph 2 of article 24."
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1245.128,1253.883,"That means in the class of cases to which article 17 is addressed, which is personal injury cases."
1998.97-475,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1253.883,1255.724,Whether or not liability--
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1255.724,1257.706,Exactly.
1998.97-475,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1257.706,1258.616,--exists.
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1258.616,1273.445,"The premise of this is that if the... if a passenger cannot satisfy the conditions of liability under article 17, that passenger should not, for that very reason alone, be able to disqualify the carrier from invoking the limits of the... of the convention."
1998.97-475,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1273.445,1278.1,How many smart people from how many countries came up with this... with this formulation?
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1280.123,1280.273,Well--
1998.97-475,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1280.273,1280.734,--could have said it more clearly.
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1280.734,1292.592,"--Again, I think it's very relevant that in Montreal Protocol No. 4, smart people from a lot of countries got together and decided to clarify the language that is in article 24."
1998.97-475,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1311.125,1312.164,It makes perfect sense.
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1324.493,1335.109,"Well, the... there... there is no indication in the proceedings that led up to the change in language that anyone contemplated that this would make any difference in the exclusivity analysis."
1998.97-475,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.298,1369.622,"But is it correct that the conditions for liability under 17, as you view the treaty, are simply physical harm and being in the course of international travel?"
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1373.354,1375.667,Under the convention there is not a fault requirement.
1998.97-475,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1375.667,1382.349,"So, the only conditions you're talking about is somebody got hurt while he was on an airplane... in international travel."
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1382.349,1385.421,"If there was an accident, and that is also an important requirement."
1998.97-475,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1486.457,1490.341,"Do you have any... I couldn't find anywhere... I'll get it, but I haven't read it yet."
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1524.151,1529.386,"Well, the treaty as a whole is reproduced in the United States Code, and petitioner has reproduced the most important provisions--"
1998.97-475,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1529.386,1532.879,"--But if you look at just provision by provision, you lose, don't you?"
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1532.879,1532.947,--I--
1998.97-475,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1532.947,1540.624,"I mean, 17 says... we're talking about instances where the carrier is liable for a... for physical injury."
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1568.32,1572.934,"--To begin with, Justice Breyer, I do not think the House of Lords viewed the text as going the other way."
1998.97-475,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1588.546,1590.456,I thought... what I was thinking of is the exact words.
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1610.919,1617.644,"--I think the House of Lords recognized that it would, in fact, be anomalous to allow passengers to disqualify carriers from invoking the--"
1998.97-475,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1617.644,1617.885,It would be.
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1618.823,1619.224,--Yes.
1998.97-475,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1619.224,1620.065,But we have some language.
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1620.065,1629.402,"And I think the House of Lords also recognized that that language was not dispositive because it was ambiguous and you do, in fact, need to look at the drafting history and the convention as a whole."
1998.97-475,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1633.476,1643.824,Are there any other cases from other jurisdictions of member nations to the Warsaw Convention that we can look to besides Abnett from the House of Lords?
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1643.824,1648.355,"--To my knowledge, Abnett is the only decision of the highest court of a sister signatory."
1998.97-475,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1648.355,1657.141,I take it then you... you disagree with your fellow counsel here that the language of the... of the convention requires your result.
1998.97-475,1,32203,jonathan_e_nuechtherlein,,1669.179,1672.06,I do not think that the convention read as a whole is ambiguous.
1998.97-475,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1679.367,1680.937,"Thank you, Mr. Nuechtherlein."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,1683.06,1690.093,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1998.97-475,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1707.306,1733.142,"But Mr. Silk, in the Senate report on what the... what our Senate voted on, it says in the... in the article by article explanation of Montreal 4, it says, article 24 clarifies that any action for damages, whether based on the convention or in contract or in tort or otherwise, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in the convention."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,1739.617,1748.951,"--Well, the Senate report may have said that, but the Senate report was not in effect at the time this particular incident occurred."
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.951,1752.093,"I guess your position is the treaty meant what it meant, and the Senate--"
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,1752.093,1752.263,My position--
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.263,1756.036,"--cannot, by later saying it meant something else, cause it to have meant something else."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,1757.559,1758.207,--Exactly.
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.207,1759.479,It seems reasonable to me.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,1759.479,1780.162,"My... my contention is that the treaty says... means what it says, and what it means is that article 1, which defines the scope and the breadth of the convention as dealing with international air transportation, does not preclude or preempt anything, that article 20... if it did preempt everything, then article 24 would be unnecessary."
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.845,1804.228,But you must admit it produces results that make the whole treaty seem quite pointless.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,1834.609,1838.69,Article 24 preempts only accident cases.
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1842.414,1845.475,"So, your answer is yes, that's... that's a result and too bad."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,1866.369,1869.36,--I think the cases in which article 17 addresses.
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.249,1907.796,"Well, sure, but why can't I say that article 17... what it addresses is damage sustained in the event of death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger?"
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,1910.319,1917.122,Except that's only true if the accident that caused the damage took place on board an aircraft in the course and so on.
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1917.122,1920.114,"That's necessary for liability, to be sure."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,1920.114,1936.657,But that's... that's... that's... that modifies the entire first sentence and first clause of article 17 because the first clause says that it shall be liable for damages sustained for bodily injury if the accident which caused the damage.
1998.97-475,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1945.512,1946.684,"So, do you lose if I think there was an accident?"
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,1946.684,1947.563,There was no accident.
1998.97-475,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1947.563,1950.566,"I know that's your opinion, and... and this is disputed."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,1958.019,1966.006,"I... I believe that if this was an accident, if this was an accident, which would be contrary to all--"
1998.97-475,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1966.006,1967.486,I know you don't agree with that.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,1967.486,1971.599,"--to the meaning of an accident, if this was an accident, that's true."
1998.97-475,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1973.639,1975.391,"So, you would not be arguing--"
1998.97-475,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1975.391,1976.311,--Because there was no physical injury.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,1976.311,1978.364,"Yes, there was no physical injury."
1998.97-475,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1978.625,1983.248,Because the... article 17 requires accident plus bodily injury.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,1998.329,2026.917,"Well, I would agree that if this was an accident and not an intentional tort, that the article 17 would apply and article 24 would apply, and it would preclude the accident... anything from happening because of Floyd because the fact that the injuries were psychic and were not bodily injuries, if this was an accident."
1998.97-475,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.917,2039.085,"Mr. Silk, does that mean that your... your... I'm just trying to think this thing through... response to Justice Scalia about the anomaly is that there is total preemption of State law causes of action in accident cases that do not result in physical harm?"
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2039.085,2039.416,Yes.
1998.97-475,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2039.416,2044.598,"So, there would be... a category of common law causes of action would be... would be preempted by the treaty."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2044.598,2045.139,"Oh, yes."
1998.97-475,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2045.139,2046.739,Even though there's no recovery in those cases.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2046.739,2048.4,"Oh, yes, I would certainly agree with that."
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2062.04,2070.885,Why do you... why do you insist that only the necessity of an accident is part of the... of the limitation in 17?
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2080.172,2081.792,--It's only a condition if it's an accident caused it.
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2081.792,2082.893,"Well, I can--"
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2082.893,2084.185,And that's what it says in article 17.
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2084.185,2091.288,--I can also say the... the... the accident is only a condition if... if there's death or... death or wounding or any other bodily injury.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2093.739,2101.906,"Well, if that was intended to be the case, then the convention would have been written in a different way."
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2112.593,2118.988,"That's right, but it also... it also only predicated liability for death or wounding or other bodily injury."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2129.336,2150.47,"Well, I believe that the convention intended to include only accidents in article 17 and intended to include everything else under article 18, which is exactly what the Saks case said, and it's exactly what the Solicitor General argued in the Saks case in the Solicitor General's brief amicus."
1998.97-475,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2170.075,2174.125,"Where is accident defined in... in the treaty, Mr. Silk?"
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2174.125,2188.647,"--Accident... accident is not defined in the treaty, but accident is defined in the treaty, if you look at the French, which means... which is the original language of the treaty, and they use the word l'accident or... I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right."
1998.97-475,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2188.647,2189.646,"Well, neither do I.--"
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.927,2190.467,Close enough.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2190.467,2194.05,And... and I'll give you another one.
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.305,2230.405,"You know, I... I wish... I... I want to join... was it Justice Breyer who complained about the fact that both sides are arguing all different sections of the treaty, and the only ones that are reproduced in the materials we have in front of us are 1, 17, and 24."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2245.974,2246.225,"--Well, I... I--"
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2246.225,2247.807,We're talking about 18.
1998.97-475,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2252.158,2255.431,"But on the other hand, you benefit somewhat--"
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2255.431,2261.726,--Article 17 is in... is in the petitioner's supplemental brief.
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2265.429,2265.599,--Oh.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2269.352,2269.553,Right.
1998.97-475,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2269.553,2271.653,"At the beginning, and 18 is somewhere."
1998.97-475,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2273.025,2287.424,"--You agree that an important class of... of injuries, of torts, are excluded by this treaty and that there can be no State cause of action."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2311.581,2329.249,"Because I see nothing in the structure of the treaty that says that the... that a... that would indicate that a willful tort, an assault and battery and a false imprisonment, committed by an airline against a passenger is something which is inconsequential or which could be included or excluded."
1998.97-475,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2349.144,2350.615,Article 25.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2350.615,2358.792,"Article 25, but article 25 is good for the respondent in this case."
1998.97-475,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2358.792,2361.844,You said that nothing in the convention covered--
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2361.844,2362.504,I will withdraw.
1998.97-475,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2380.346,2390.904,"--But I thought, as the case came to us, we had to assume that article 25 isn't before us, that we take the case as though it isn't willful misconduct under article 25."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2391.815,2399.349,"As the case came before this Court, the petitioner did not mention article 25 in the petition."
1998.97-475,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2407.103,2410.757,"Well, and there was a finding below that it wasn't willful misconduct?"
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2410.757,2410.957,--No.
1998.97-475,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2424.057,2426.117,"Okay, but there was no cross petition on that."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2426.117,2427.358,--We weren't aggrieved.
1998.97-475,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2437.787,2442.379,"Well... well, but as the case comes to us, willful misconduct is definitely excluded by the treaty."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2456.177,2457.859,"Well, willful misconduct--"
1998.97-475,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2457.859,2462.331,And it seems to me that that's inconsistent with the whole design of the treaty to limit the liability.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2462.331,2470.869,--Willful misconduct is covered by the convention only to the extent that nothing in the convention shall limit or exclude... exclude such a case.
1998.97-475,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2470.869,2471.878,But that isn't this case.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2471.878,2478.583,"Well, we're talking about excluding such a case, and if there's nothing in the convention to exclude my case, then I go ahead."
1998.97-475,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2478.583,2479.034,"Yes, but--"
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2479.034,2480.384,Article 25 is fine.
1998.97-475,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2480.384,2502.218,"--Let me ask you about... because I've now seen the whole treaty, as Justice Thomas had the... if you look at the treaty as a whole... and I think this is what the English court was doing... it's saying, look, there's one section here, section 3, which says, airlines, you cannot limit your liability in a contract and you give that up."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2524.322,2525.143,Yes.
1998.97-475,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2525.143,2526.335,And that's all it meant.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2593.16,2601.745,"My view on the Abnett case, or the English case, the House of Lords case, is that the House of Lords case did not deal with the kind of willful problem that we have in my case."
1998.97-475,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2641.102,2647.536,"Oh, but there's no doubt at all in reading that opinion that, faced with this case, they would have come out the same way."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2658.684,2667.579,"My only answer to that would be that the treaty governs what it governs, and the treaty... the language of the treaty spells out what it does govern."
1998.97-475,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2712.299,2724.248,"That was the same assumption that the House of Lords made, and I think that they felt a certain discomfort in that too because they said, we have to take this case on the basis that it was no accident."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2765.096,2767.718,But this procedure in my case did not misfire.
1998.97-475,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2803.491,2804.102,Is that a fact question?
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2805.882,2806.313,No.
1998.97-475,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2854.626,2863.542,"I thought that would be kind of something to which the airline would demur in the district court because the airline's case in the district court was, no bodily injury, end of case."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2863.542,2864.674,They didn't.
1998.97-475,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2873.197,2875.268,Was there a trial in this case?
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2875.268,2875.729,--Was there what?
1998.97-475,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2875.729,2876.43,A trial.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2876.43,2878.13,"Yes, there was a trial in this case."
1998.97-475,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2894.042,2896.914,"When you said proved, were there findings of fact?"
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2896.914,2897.665,"--No, no."
1998.97-475,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2958.593,2962.025,I thought Judge... the... I'm not sure of this factual thing.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2975.993,2976.243,Yes.
1998.97-475,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2976.243,2983.75,"And I take it your position was that they had a legal duty to say to her, now, if you object to the search, you can go and leave the room."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2983.75,2984.561,Yes.
1998.97-475,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2984.561,2984.95,Is that... was that--
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2984.95,2985.25,Yes.
1998.97-475,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2985.25,2988.171,--And is there a finding on whether... I guess that's a legal question.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2988.171,2988.862,There was no finding.
1998.97-475,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2988.862,2989.744,There's no finding.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,2989.744,2990.733,There was no finding at all.
1998.97-475,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2990.733,2992.756,"So, is that relevant at all to us?"
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,3004.935,3010.371,"Well, I think that that is not the question before this Court."
1998.97-475,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3034.945,3036.127,I agree with you.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,3036.668,3037.606,--may properly be used.
1998.97-475,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3037.606,3038.657,It's irrelevant.
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,3038.657,3053.808,"It's only relevant when... when I think they raised the red flag that this involves a security problem and... and they have to be able to protect their security, which I think is... is sham argument because they could easily have protected their security by giving her a choice."
1998.97-475,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3053.808,3070.959,"Mr. Silk, on the question Justice O'Connor asked earlier in the argument, is there any precedent from other... another court other than the House of Lords that interprets article 17 in context of article 24 in context of the whole treaty?"
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,3070.959,3076.863,"Justice Ginsburg, I have tried to find any other precedents."
1998.97-475,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3080.626,3083.608,"Just let me amend the word to be decisions, court decisions."
1998.97-475,2,40425,robert_h_silk,,3083.608,3087.853,--I know of none which involve this kind of situation.
