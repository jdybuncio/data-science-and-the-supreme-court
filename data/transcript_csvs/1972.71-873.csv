1972.71-873,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,41.932,"We'll hear arguments next in No. 71-873, United States against Falstaff Brewing Company."
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,44.481,47.743,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1972.71-873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,187.59,197.763,"Do the -- the complaint did not allege, did it that Falstaff was the only brewery with equivalent opportunity and -- and resources to enter this market?"
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,197.763,198.568,No.
1972.71-873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,198.568,198.65,Is it --
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,198.65,202.96,"Mr. Justice, I think the Government's theory is it was one of the most likely entrants."
1972.71-873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,202.96,204.987,If it did --
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,204.987,215.283,"More specifically, if I'm right, the allegation and the evidence submitted would tend to indicate that it is one of the Nation's 10 largest brewers."
1972.71-873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,218.369,219.998,And two of them are way out west somewhere (Voice Overlap).
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,219.998,229.423,"Two of them -- well, I don't know who had said they were way out west but they were significantly further west than Falstaff and they are also significantly smaller than Falstaff."
1972.71-873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,229.423,242.205,"So, at least in argument you're going to say that Falstaff had superior opportunity and resources to any other brewing not already in the New England market to enter."
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,242.205,243.368,I believe that was the case.
1972.71-873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,248.129,260.757,"On the other hand, if the record showed there were 15 or 20 with equal access and resources of the potential competition argument would be much less than Falstaff."
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,260.757,272.229,"Yes, I think if -- if the evidence were to demonstrate that there were very large number of potential entrants, then clearly one would have to take the position elimination of one had no particular impact."
1972.71-873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,272.229,286.033,"In other words, part of the potential competition theory I should suppose would be a proof that the potential entrant was -- if not unique at least one of a very small group, would it not be?"
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,286.033,289.142,"I think that essentially is correct, yes."
1972.71-873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.865,1042.484,Mr. Kauper.
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1042.484,1043.165,Yes.
1972.71-873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1043.165,1057.518,"The quotation you just read spoke in terms of waiting anxiously and you earlier used the term “likelihood”, don't those both suggest that the inquiry here is basically factual one?"
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1059.176,1070.194,"Well obviously, there is a factual question, but it was one thing in any case of this sort, but I think the question is what is it that the facts have to show?"
1972.71-873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1089.583,1098.654,Well assuming that those facts are at least -- as I would say wouldn't necessarily add up to the concepts -- concept of anxiously waiting to enter.
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1105.091,1110.409,Well I think the Court dealt to some extent that same question yesterday.
1972.71-873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1191.827,1194.541,What is the ultimate factual inquiry as --
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1194.541,1204.572,"Our -- in our judgment, the ultimately -- ultimate factual inquiry, let me put it in several parts because I think there are -- there are several issues although in a sense we're really only talking about one."
1972.71-873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1244.284,1255.588,Even though the trial court finds as a fact that this particular management however a reasonable manager might have operated did not plan to enter.
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1255.588,1258.013,I think we would be prepared to make that argument.
1972.71-873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1308.604,1311.458,Do you say then the District Court should have disbelieved it?
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1311.458,1314.973,"No, I don't think I would say it should have disbelieved."
1972.71-873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1358.915,1367.653,"You don't think will remove the concept of anxiously waiting or subjective attempt, make it kind of a reasonable man of negligence."
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1367.653,1368.075,Yes.
1972.71-873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.904,1409.709,My point --
1972.71-873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1409.709,1432.195,"Mr. Attorney General, the -- since your premise is that -- that this case is likely the impact of Falstaff is sitting on the edge of the market, that -- that is an assumption about the -- its effect on the contenders in the market."
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1432.195,1433.217,That's correct.
1972.71-873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.217,1443.221,"So, why shouldn't the standard be what -- how contenders in the market would view a potential entrant in the likelihood of potential entry?"
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1443.221,1446.649,"Well, I take it -- let me see if I understand your question Mr. Justice While."
1972.71-873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.067,1455.49,I don't know how you -- but isn't that --
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1455.49,1456.505,"Well, I –"
1972.71-873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.505,1459.35,Your argument is that this has an impact on competition.
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1459.35,1460.858,Yes.
1972.71-873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1460.858,1474.858,"And if -- if no fool was competing in the market would assume that or would even think that some company would enter, your case (Inaudible)"
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1474.858,1475.127,Yes.
1972.71-873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1524.139,1534.591,"So really, the basic element is not the actual livelihood of entry but the perceived likelihood of entry by those already in the market."
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1534.591,1539.826,"Well, I think Mr. Justice, there may be a case where it is precisely the question of actual entry."
1972.71-873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1551.209,1556.162,"Yes and there could also be a case a 180 degrees the other way, is there not?"
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1556.162,1558.428,"Yes, I believe there could be."
1972.71-873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1558.428,1567.09,Were in fact there was no actual intent or possibility for some reason that was secret there -- some family reason or something.
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1577.654,1578.866,Yes.
1972.71-873,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1579.426,1583.417,Even though -- even though were it quite inaccurate and incorrect perception.
1972.71-873,0,33743,kauper,,1583.417,1585.099,I believe that's right.
1972.71-873,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1588.428,1592.397,"Very well, Mr. Kauper."
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,1594.464,1600.609,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1793.899,1794.911,Did the -- excuse me.
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,1811.016,1814.488,That is not the entire standard he applied.
1972.71-873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1814.488,1817.929,Is there some -- can you tell what the standard they did apply?
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,1817.929,1821.108,He referred to that as significant.
1972.71-873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1832.524,1835.013,So he does -- he does -- stated conclusion.
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,1835.013,1836.932,He doesn't -- that is correct.
1972.71-873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1847.007,1854.07,"Really on analysis the question is a little more subtle than that as my Brother White has suggested though, isn't it?"
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,1878.067,1890.072,"I think it's quite clear that both facets have some significance if they both exist that is the likelihood of entry and the apprehension in the industry, in the market."
1972.71-873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1890.072,1900.211,Was there any evidence that apprehension was taken into account by the District Judge in applying the standard?
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,1900.211,1901.035,There was no --
1972.71-873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.035,1901.702,In deciding --
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,1901.702,1907.389,"-- evidence of any kind that that apprehension existed, none whatever."
1972.71-873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.389,1912.473,But how about it is -- in the legal standard that he applied?
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,1916.171,1923.27,You can't from the record pinpoint it.
1972.71-873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.647,1982.725,"But I think the Government's argument is however if he shows some facts about an industry in a market area and perhaps to be a very effective place to do business, it's profitable that almost anyone in the industry would think that -- that a -- an outsider with financial resources would be interested in entering in order to share the prosperity."
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,1983.73,1984.849,If there were any --
1972.71-873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.849,1991.122,"So there's facts like that, there must be facts about the condition of the market in this record."
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,1991.122,1993.354,There are no facts about the profitability --
1972.71-873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1993.354,1993.965,I see.
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,1993.965,1997.794,-- of any entry which could've been made by Falstaff.
1972.71-873,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2152.499,2170.156,"Mr. Goring, on your suggesting that Government call the other New England brewers or some of them, would you regard them as entirely objective, impartial observers of this scene?"
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,2170.156,2184.982,"To be perfectly frank, I should think they might be very willing to say to the Government exactly what the Government wanted to hear that they were afraid of this just standing in the wind."
1972.71-873,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2189.389,2195.003,"In other words, there's a built-in conflict of interest with respect to most of these people, is it?"
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,2195.003,2206.011,"I'm not convinced that when the testimony to be educed that way runs in favor of the Government, the Government have much concern with your observation."
1972.71-873,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2219.688,2224.944,"From the other brewers, what could be the source?"
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,2224.944,2226.427,Other brewers?
1972.71-873,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2226.427,2234.249,"Well, I thought you were suggesting that they aren't -- the necessarily the most reliable witnesses on this."
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,2236.299,2242.482,They could be honest but let me give you a sample of what is in the record in this case.
1972.71-873,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2858.635,2866.977,For how long now has Narragansett been operated as an independent division in the city area of Falstaff?
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,2866.977,2868.866,After the acquisition.
1972.71-873,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2868.866,2869.561,"Oh, what could --"
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,2869.561,2871.385,Do you say after the acquisition?
1972.71-873,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2871.385,2871.844,Yes.
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,2873.596,2876.701,Until the judgment was entered.
1972.71-873,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2894.007,2895.41,And the acquisition was 19--
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,2895.41,2898.687,"1965, July 1965."
1972.71-873,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2918.667,2934.303,"So, until -- at least until the judgment in this -- by the District Court, Falstaff did not gain the advantage of marketing beer in the New England market under its Falstaff -- under its national brand label?"
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,2934.303,2951.278,"Oh yes, it made attempts to sell Falstaff brand in New England using the distributor organization which he just did in the Narragansett operation."
1972.71-873,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2952.469,2954.943,"Well, was the Narragansett label discontinued?"
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,2954.943,2957.533,"No, no indeed."
1972.71-873,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2967.312,2969.099,Yes.
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,2969.099,2986.117,"Which show what happened to barrel sales of various brewers in the period from 1964 through 1968, and it shows that Narragansett was being sold under its own brand during that entire time."
1972.71-873,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2987.41,2989.535,It doesn't show Falstaff though.
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,2989.535,2991.123,No.
1972.71-873,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3013.025,3030.154,I suppose one could assume that that was regarded by Falstaff as a transitional step in what they hope ultimately would be the result to get the name exposed to some extent before this was finalized.
1972.71-873,1,35942,matthew_w_goring,,3030.154,3040.596,The only information in the record upon that and they should have adverted to this is a testimony of Mr. Griesedieck under examination by me.
1972.71-873,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3073.63,3075.276,Thank you Mr. Goring.
1972.71-873,2,33743,kauper,,3079.952,3086.034,Let me address myself to several matters raised in the argument of counsel.
1972.71-873,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3165.757,3178.052,"Don't you think the Government had some duty to go forward with the evidence after that testimony on page 2 -- 376 from this gentleman, the former --"
1972.71-873,2,33743,kauper,,3178.052,3179.705,Are you talking about chief executive officer?
1972.71-873,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3179.705,3181.879,"Yes, the former chief executive officer."
1972.71-873,2,33743,kauper,,3181.879,3195.494,"Well, I think that -- that what Mr. Haffenreffer said as I understand it is that during the time that he was operating the Narragansett brewery he did not fear and as -- maybe I read the statement incorrect, “Shipment into the area by Falstaff."
1972.71-873,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3324.22,3336.169,"Mr. Kauper, let -- let me ask you on more question if I may in your colloquy with Mr. Justice White about the competitor's perception of this potential competitor."
1972.71-873,2,33743,kauper,,3355.704,3357.54,I think that is a subjective question.
1972.71-873,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3363.565,3365.38,Thank you Mr. Kauper.
