1967.174,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,19.021,"Number 174, Clyde Franklin Lee et al, petitioner versus Florida."
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,20.209,24.972,Mr. Chief Justice and if it may it please the Court.
1967.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,142.903,145.991,Petitioner Lee already on a party line?
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,145.991,153.543,Mr. -- the evidence I believe will show in this case that Mr. Lee ordered a private line.
1967.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,209.348,223.466,"Well, the evidence shows as I understand it that your client Lee was advised that whenever he might've ordered he was advised that he was on a party line by the telephone company?"
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,223.466,223.893,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,230.551,232.545,"Yes, but is there a finding to that effect?"
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,232.545,232.793,"No, sir."
1967.174,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,235.599,247.028,I think the opinion of the Florida Court say the facts in this case show the defendants requested private line but were in more by the telephone company that no private line was unavailable?
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,247.028,247.382,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,255.082,259.053,Do you mean that a Florida Court on this historical fact finding here?
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,259.053,259.993,I'm sorry sir.
1967.174,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,259.993,261.732,We should differ with the Florida Court on this?
1967.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,545.146,560.312,"Well, in so far as the -- in so far as this is not a statutory violation but rather a violation of the Fourth Amendment as made applicable to the states thorough the Fourteenth --"
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,560.312,560.943,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,560.943,570.348,-- then you don't have any problem with Schwartz do you since Mapp against Ohio your situation is clear so far as the exclusionary rule --
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,570.348,570.81,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,576.672,577.689,Katz was a federal case.
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,577.689,578.767,-- had not been decided.
1967.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,578.767,580.055,"Well, Katz was a federal case --"
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,580.055,581.687,"Was a federal case versus U.S., yes, sir."
1967.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,581.687,603.965,"I'm not directing my question to your -- to the Schwartz case which involved the wiretapping in violation of the federal statute, it was held in that case that even though the federal statute was violated the results of what was found in the wiretap could be introduced, could constitutionally be introduced into a state court criminal trial."
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,606.978,608.546,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,608.546,627.046,And in so far as in this case you're relying not on the violation of the federal wiretapping statute but rather a violation of the -- of your client's right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures you don't have any problem about excludability do you since Mapp against Ohio.
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,628.699,641.588,"Well, we are underpinning our appeal on both that we're asking the Court to revisit Schwartz versus Texas and to depart briskly from that decision."
1967.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,717.928,731.514,"Does -- Mr. Kirkland, does it appear exactly what was done here that policemen rented at this house or got access to this house and which there was a phone on a party line of your client?"
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,731.514,731.845,"No, sir."
1967.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,732.82,734.394,They had one installed?
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,734.394,734.721,Yes.
1967.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,734.721,736.672,Then they have the phone installed on --
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,736.672,736.968,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,736.968,744.547,-- which is on your client's party line and did they simply pick up the receiver and listen or did they actually taps some wires to put on some kind of.
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,744.547,788.037,"The evidence in the appendix says, states that the officer who did it disconnected two screws at the base within the home that they had rented, the base board which made a direct connection with the line of the petitioner Lee and it facilitated the recording because it was not necessary then to release or pick up the receiver which gives a click and it was a bit sophisticated for me but apparently this was in fact a direct connection with the party line."
1967.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,788.037,790.917,"In other words, you know it had."
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,798.727,801.3,Lee was the house that the petitioner.
1967.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,802.462,803.784,"In the house, the police rented?"
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,803.784,804.707,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,804.707,807.506,"As I understand it, they didn't have to take the receiver --"
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,807.506,808.611,That's correct.
1967.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,808.611,814.965,"-- because they made an actual tap on the lines connected with your client's phone, is that it?"
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,814.965,826.97,This is what the testimony I believe and the appendix will show that instead of lifting up to the phone to hear the conversation when it ring of course --
1967.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,826.97,836.895,"But I gather the tap, it was a tap even though it was made under wires in the officer's house."
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,836.895,837.719,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,840.022,841.057,They did not have to lift their own --
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,841.057,841.714,That's correct.
1967.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,844.443,846.961,-- when Lee was on the telephone --
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,846.961,848.031,It automatically --
1967.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,848.031,848.672,-- party line.
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,848.672,849.921,It automatically recorded.
1967.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,849.921,853.176,Someone in the officer's house to pick up and then they click and they would've known.
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,853.176,853.943,That's correct sir.
1967.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,853.943,855.367,But now they didn't have to?
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,855.367,856.334,They didn't have to.
1967.174,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,859.065,861.0,"Well, how can difficult an ordinary tap?"
1967.174,0,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,861.0,862.635,"Well, it doesn't in my view."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1584.891,1590.791,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1760.365,1770.435,"How about if it rang in somebody else's home, somebody else was on that party line, did it record all of their conversations too?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1770.435,1773.573,I don't know sir but I would assume that it would.
1967.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1779.421,1784.635,"Well, it took everything it over the line it would follow, wouldn't it if they did get all of those?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1784.635,1785.824,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1788.755,1797.325,And does the record show that the authorities were responsible for Lee begetting only a party line rather than a --
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1797.325,1801.126,Absolutely not.
1967.174,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1801.126,1812.293,How then is this distinguishable from the Silverman case where there was spike driven in the wall and turned into a giant microphone?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1812.293,1815.796,The Silverman case as I understand it was --
1967.174,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1815.796,1819.956,It's a different instruction but the wires run in --
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1819.956,1823.315,You're talking about the heating apparatus --
1967.174,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1823.315,1833.863,Where you have a different kind of wire but it doesn't reach inside and it is triggered in operation from an outside element that's hooked up one physical unit.
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1833.863,1845.085,If I recall correctly I believe that case turned on the fact that there was a physical intuitive -- in that case.
1967.174,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1845.085,1848.401,So that telephone wire that --
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1848.401,1849.376,Sir?
1967.174,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1849.376,1855.926,"Here, they hooked up with a telephone wire running into defendant's house."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1855.926,1856.643,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1865.98,1866.574,I understand it.
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1869.036,1874.922,It was hooked up to their telephone so that they could over hear the conversations.
1967.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1877.252,1878.569,-- are you starting to --
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1878.569,1878.92,Sir?
1967.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1878.92,1886.202,"-- tell me that no, it was not the fact that the authorities were responsible for petitioner to get him only a party line?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1889.05,1894.809,He is so contend and I contend just strongly that they did not --
1967.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1894.809,1896.492,Was only fact finding on this?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1896.492,1896.988,"No,sir."
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1916.98,1951.455,I suppose on your position that you would say there was no tap and no violation of the Federal Communications Act if the police after having acquired the party line had gone outside their own house and on some other part of the telephone line tapped the wire because they could've picked the phone and listen that they could also listen on the line anywhere else and anywhere else they wanted to do.
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1951.455,1954.72,"Not anywhere else, no, sir --"
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.72,1958.045,Perhaps none of somebody else's property.
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1958.045,1958.545,If they --
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1958.545,1963.626,"What about along the street when the telephone rang, it's just like put a tap on there."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1963.626,1964.096,"No, sir."
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.349,1972.458,What's the difference between that and this device they put in their own house?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1972.458,1988.023,"Well, on a party line there is no a law which prevents a man from picking up the telephone and hearing the conversation of two other people and may it not be the proper thing to do but there's no law against it."
1967.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1988.023,1993.984,"But if you do it I take it the one you overhearing knows that you're on the other line, doesn't it?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1993.984,1994.825,"No, sir."
1967.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1997.301,1999.937,"Well, I don't believe on the party lines."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1999.937,2000.961,"Oh, I see."
1967.174,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.959,2006.133,"Have you got a special kind of party lines in Florida, you don't hear it click?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2006.133,2006.57,"No, sir."
1967.174,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2013.839,2017.565,"When you pick up the receiver, there's a click?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2017.565,2018.537,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2018.537,2025.542,"And in this, if that if you picked the receiver he would've known somebody was listening?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2025.542,2028.178,"If he had heard the click, he would, yes sir."
1967.174,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2028.178,2041.198,"Well, assuming he had normal hearing and he heard the click, he would know somebody was listening in or would the device the way you put it on he could never know whether that somebody was listening."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2041.198,2051.527,"And if you forgive me sir, I believe that to say that he would've known that there was someone hearing what he had to say Your Honor I believe that's a conclusion sir."
1967.174,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2062.553,2068.25,"Well, isn't that the reason you put this other one in there, the activator so that he wouldn't hear it click?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2068.25,2069.53,"No, sir."
1967.174,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2082.141,2086.405,"You would save his energy, you'd save the policeman's energy."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2086.405,2086.87,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2164.469,2171.075,"Well, are you suggesting the Katz is retroactive and it applies to this case or not?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2171.075,2180.819,"I would hope that it would be, I don't know whether it is or not and whether courts going to have it be retroactive or not."
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.05,2193.056,You -- you urged us to hold Katz retroactive?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2193.056,2206.611,I don't believe that you would have to hold Katz to be retroactive in order to sustain this case Justice White.
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.349,2226.931,"So, Katz whether it's retroactive or not it's just irrelevant?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2226.931,2228.367,"No, I don't think it's irrelevant at all."
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.367,2236.057,Well because there's nothing in the facts of this case just wouldn't fall within Katz anyway.
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2236.057,2243.291,I don't think Katz that the case here can be controlled by Katz.
1967.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2280.892,2294.422,"Well, your case really I gather can stand to this that he took all of the risks of being overheard and that ought to dispose both of his 605 argument and of his Fourth Amendment argument."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2294.422,2296.135,Absolutely.
1967.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2331.751,2334.463,How many issues to be exact?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2334.463,2335.043,-- that --
1967.174,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2335.043,2345.211,Wasn't this man in the same business as Mr. Katz was?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2345.211,2347.43,"Yes, Your Honor, he was."
1967.174,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2347.509,2350.633,Now what does the business have to do with it?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2350.633,2359.847,It goes to ascertaining his intent whether or not he had a right to believe he had a constitutionally protected right of privacy.
1967.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2361.435,2367.449,Did the police know that he was violating the law when they put this tap on?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2367.449,2381.081,I can only assume that they did or else they would not have installed the party line telephone to overhear the conversation and again Mr. Chief Justice I deny it was a tap.
1967.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2381.081,2384.606,-- as to that just to find out whether he was or not.
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2384.606,2385.581,"No, sir."
1967.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2388.791,2391.276,Is it in the record that they knew it?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2391.276,2391.549,"No, sir."
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2397.003,2456.457,"Well, Mr. Allbritton, it seems to me that you're saying that the police may run the house or install a party line in order to listen on and establish party line the conversations between other people on the party line that you would necessarily argue that even without renting a party line from any from the telephone company that they could just simply tap a party line anytime or any place they wanted to because the people who talk on that line anticipate that somebody is going to overhear them and if it would justify the police in buying a party line and picking up the receiver and listening to other parties on the line I don't know why it wouldn't justify the police in just not running a party line but just tapping the wire."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2456.457,2458.654,"Well, if -- then if they tap the wire --"
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.654,2465.495,"Why isn't this just one smooth way of tapping a party line, you just rent one?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2465.495,2465.919,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2482.406,2486.535,"Well, you would say then they wouldn't have had to rent the party line at all."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2486.535,2486.846,"No, sir."
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2491.933,2492.426,I know but --
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2492.426,2494.105,-- then they have a right to pick it up and hear --
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2494.105,2502.507,Or let's just say -- I'm not -- this is just another way of tapping a wire as you said.
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2504.096,2507.944,It's a way of overhearing a conversation Mr. Justice White.
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.614,2519.553,"Well, I know but under 605 you wouldn't I'm sure that just to be renting a party line probably to tap under 605 but we're talking about the Fourth Amendment also."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2519.553,2521.754,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2562.445,2576.92,And I'm wondering if they could tap or whatever you call it this particular party line in a community like this where I understand there were nothing what party lines --
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2576.92,2577.237,"No, sir."
1967.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2578.211,2588.292,Is that mean that the police in such a community that tap any lines of it wanted to in a city anytime he wanted to?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2588.292,2588.597,"No, sir."
1967.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2588.597,2591.099,"Alright, why do you draw the line?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2591.099,2615.096,"Here, if the petitioner had been talking on a private line in his own house then as far as I'm concern I would be out of Court because there I believe that the man would have a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy."
1967.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2635.621,2639.864,"Well, let's leave it to just then to the party lines."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2652.977,2665.087,"As long as they have a right to do so in this sense sir, in the sense that they are in a house that they pay the rent on it and that they have their own telephone installed in there."
1967.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2665.087,2680.974,"Well, suppose they installed in police headquarters and apparatus like this which tied in with every party line in the community they're on their own police headquarters they did exactly what they did here, you think that's alright?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2680.974,2681.237,"No, sir."
1967.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2682.137,2682.632,Why?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2683.004,2688.919,I think that is too broad a right to give to the police officers.
1967.174,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2692.903,2694.271,How is that differ from this?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2694.271,2699.004,"Here they were only listening on one party line, Justice Brennan."
1967.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2699.004,2702.359,Where do you draw the line?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2702.359,2709.83,I draw the line sir between what a man have the reasonable right to believe.
1967.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2719.246,2727.128,"Yes, but we're dealing with party lines and where do you draw the line as to what lines the police can --"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2727.128,2728.056,"Alright, sir."
1967.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2728.056,2730.158,-- and what was they cannot?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2730.158,2750.185,"I will answer that this way, I would say that if they had just gone out and through an undercover agent and ascertain where the party line was at and then put a device on it where they could overhear it then I think that's wrong."
1967.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2784.385,2789.297,"Well, they didn't rent this for a home."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2793.33,2794.932,"Absolutely, they did."
1967.174,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2794.932,2808.663,"Well, what is difference if they did it for that purpose between that in accomplishing the same purpose for a little different way as Mr. Justice Brennan suggested putting a tap to police stations?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2808.663,2817.597,"Well, the difference is I don't believe this Court would permit them to go out ipso facto you might say and tap a party line."
1967.174,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2836.568,2841.784,"Well, why install the party lines and rent a house, why not just rent a room?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2841.784,2849.835,I would suspect sir that there wasn't a room nearby that they could use.
1967.174,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2849.835,2854.759,"As I understand you, you have a very simple proposition which is either right or wrong?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2854.759,2855.648,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2855.648,2859.131,What you have is party lines installed?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2859.131,2860.068,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2860.068,2866.871,These people may have rented this for a home or they may have rented it for gambling but that's not the theory.
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2884.368,2884.81,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2884.81,2893.585,Do you say if they are simply on party line they've got the same right to use it as anybody else that's not a tap.
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2893.585,2894.628,That's right.
1967.174,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2894.628,2916.481,"What you say is that stops right there that they put any kind of device that do anything of that kind that it would be illegal, that's my understanding of what your claiming and that you are putting it all on to this that they will own the party line right through it."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2916.481,2916.878,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2918.597,2919.76,Do you claim rightfully?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2921.007,2921.71,I may be.
1967.174,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2921.71,2930.759,"But your claim that since that is the case, that the Constitution shouldn't protect the gentlemen who is running the lottery."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2930.759,2933.848,That's right and that's it.
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2989.171,3005.731,"Well, Mr. Attorney General, it seems to me that to exclude this evidence would require one either holding that this was a violation of 605 in which event, you have to overrule force?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3017.203,3017.531,"No, sir."
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.673,3029.543,"Well, do you think the -- do you think before the Katz case was decided that this was a violation of -- would've been a violation of the Fourth Amendment."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3029.543,3031.273,"Yes, I do."
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3031.273,3032.141,Without Katz.
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3032.141,3032.577,Yes.
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3032.577,3034.732,Why?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3034.732,3036.497,Because I believe that the --
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.497,3044.042,Now when you -- are you -- I thought you were arguing this was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3044.042,3047.169,"Perhaps I misunderstood you sir, I'm sorry."
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3047.169,3062.128,"Well, before the Katz case was decided now would the state have been permitted under the Fourth Amendment to use the evidence which it had got over this party line."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3062.128,3064.161,"I believe it would have, yes sir."
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3064.161,3067.323,And I know you think that after Katz the same thing but --
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3067.323,3068.079,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3068.079,3075.327,-- but why would the state if that permitted to use it?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3075.327,3080.756,The state would have been permitted to use it I believe as I have reiterated --
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3080.756,3085.606,"Well, wouldn't have been permitted to use it under Olmstead?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3085.606,3086.018,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3091.957,3095.294,"Well, when was the Olmstead overruled?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3095.294,3111.894,"I believe that Katz case finally cut the underpinnings I believe is the word that was used from the Olmstead case, I believe."
1967.174,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3111.894,3115.802,"Mr. Attorney General, could I ask you a question?"
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3157.197,3158.313,I can't answer that.
1967.174,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3161.988,3165.424,Well it's kind of related to the proposition which you are stating.
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3182.638,3183.106,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3183.459,3190.301,But I -- would you extend that to the case of a client communicating with his lawyer?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3190.301,3191.124,I don't know sir.
1967.174,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3195.664,3198.361,Was this man communicating with his lawyer?
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3198.361,3198.97,"No, sir."
1967.174,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3204.799,3209.856,"Well, this hasn't answered the question whether this man was communicating with his lawyer or not."
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3214.712,3215.199,"Yes, sir."
1967.174,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3215.46,3224.325,It's to whether a person who uses a party line telephone surrenders whole claim to confidentiality.
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3237.604,3240.75,Let me put it this way sir.
1967.174,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3266.393,3267.198,I see.
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3282.484,3286.483,I can't give you a categorical answer on that sir.
1967.174,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3286.483,3309.687,I guess what you're really claiming is the aid or opportunity of party line listen to his neighbors accusation when he has a party line that the Constitution doesn't step in that make him a criminal if he exposes what he heard on his party line.
1967.174,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3309.687,3312.44,That's true sir.
1967.174,2,22590,edward_r_kirkland,,3320.083,3328.21,Very briefly touching on two points in answer to Justice White's inquiry about the retroactivity of Katz.
