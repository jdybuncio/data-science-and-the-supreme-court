1989.88-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.918,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-42, Olaf A. Hallstrom versus Tillamook County."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,78.603,83.625,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,224.67,229.252,"Mr. Buckley, you say the case came on for hearing; this was in the District Court in Portland--"
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,229.252,229.522,"Yes, yes."
1989.88-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,229.522,230.814,--What sort of a hearing?
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,230.814,232.234,Motion for summary judgment--
1989.88-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,232.234,235.217,A hearing on the motion for summary judgment filed by your opponents?
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,235.217,235.988,--Yes.
1989.88-42,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,254.239,259.903,"May I ask, though, at that time, was one of the grounds of the motion the failure to comply with the notice requirement?"
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,259.903,261.654,"--Yes, that was the whole ground of the motion."
1989.88-42,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,261.654,263.246,"The whole ground, yeah."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,263.246,277.845,"After the district judge essentially said to me that I had done everything that was required because the defect had been cured, the case went to trial about two years later and an injunction was entered against Tillamook County."
1989.88-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,385.706,391.75,"I wonder, Mr. Buckley, if you are quite right in calling the question here, is it a jurisdictional requirement."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,423.401,426.954,"--Well, I think it is, Your Honor, because the Ninth Circuit ruled that it was a jurisdictional requirement."
1989.88-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,426.954,432.4,"I mean, we don't have to follow the interpretation of the Ninth Circuit if we are not convinced of its wisdom."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,432.4,436.409,"Well, I hope that the Court does not follow the Ninth Circuit."
1989.88-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,437.13,449.709,"But I, you know, to the extent that the requirement would prevent you from proceeding with your suit and refiling, and still not be a jurisdictional one, that analysis really doesn't help you."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,453.092,457.844,"Well, I agree, Your Honor, that it is a requirement."
1989.88-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,465.3,468.823,"So, how stringent is the requirement is really what we're talking about."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,468.823,469.744,I guess that's the point.
1989.88-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,506.81,511.351,"Well, the language of the statute, of course, is rather explicit."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,533.617,536.519,"Yes, the language is very--"
1989.88-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,536.519,538.058,"I mean, that's pretty explicit."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,538.058,539.42,"--Well, yes, it is."
1989.88-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,564.606,586.281,"Well, of course it's possible that the legislative history here indicates that at least, in part, those provisions were intended to prevent the federal courts from having to deal with litigation until after the government agencies had an opportunity at least to act."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,586.281,608.215,"Right, and the legislative history in this case dealt primarily with a situation, this particular situation, that there are going to be lots and lots and lots of violations of environmental law out there, and it can't be expected that the government is going to be able to monitor every single violation out there."
1989.88-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,667.613,670.825,Or is it a good idea to have a rule that everybody can understand?
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,670.825,674.519,"Well, that is true."
1989.88-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,680.632,694.28,"In this case, I take it, under this statute, one of the prohibitions on bringing this suit is if the government has itself brought a suit, correct?"
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,694.28,694.771,--Yes.
1989.88-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,694.771,703.299,And how do you know whether or not that statutory exception has been met by the government?
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,703.299,706.16,You mean how do I know if the government has brought a suit or not?
1989.88-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,706.16,706.96,Yes.
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,711.534,714.185,"Well, I suppose that you could do that."
1989.88-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,715.696,729.075,"But isn't, doesn't, isn't the point that the statute (b)(2) says that if the administrator or state has commenced and is diligently prosecuting."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,729.075,729.686,--Um hum.
1989.88-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,729.686,741.754,"So the statute itself makes a distinction between commencement and prosecution, and it seems to me that we should interpret the word commencement the same way in the previous paragraph."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,741.754,743.333,"Well, I think that is the apparent way to interpret it, Your Honor."
1989.88-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,744.535,749.188,"But if that is so, commencement means filing, doesn't it?"
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,749.188,750.299,"Yes, it does."
1989.88-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,760.804,770.932,"But if you agree with that it seems to me that you must lose, because you commenced the action without going through the waiting period and the notice period."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,770.932,788.654,"--Well, if I may answer, yes, that is true if you look only at that particular section and don't try to interpret that section in the context of the statute as a whole, and if you don't instead also look to the purpose that that provision was intended to serve."
1989.88-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,788.654,795.828,You have to argue that this is one of those rare instances when the Court shouldn't apply the statute as it is written.
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,795.828,796.669,Yes.
1989.88-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,796.669,799.093,"That is basically what you are saying, that we shouldn't--"
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,799.093,798.9,"Yes, I am making that argument."
1989.88-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,798.9,805.134,"--We don't do that very often, but you think that's what we should do here."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,805.134,810.051,"I think that would effectuate the will of Congress in this particular case, when--"
1989.88-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,810.051,817.121,"And yet, it certainly would be workable as a scheme and as a statute if we did enforce it as it's written."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,817.121,829.101,"--I think it would be at the cost of injustice in many cases, and I think it would also be at the cost of defeating the will of Congress on the statute as a whole."
1989.88-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,829.101,837.289,"Well, don't you think once the rule is clear that people would understand that that is the requirement?"
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,838.108,878.773,"Well, first of all, if there are other lawyers like me out there, who realize that that is a requirement, and yet, as I said between the intention and the execution something falls through the cracks, and, at the same time the government in fact has, the government with enforcement authority has actual authority, has actual notice, and decides to do nothing, then to have the Court impose a bright line rule would have the result, in this case, of requiring a dismissal and refiling to serve no congressional purpose."
1989.88-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,878.773,880.574,Congress could have written it that way.
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,922.751,924.982,"Well, I am arguing judicial estoppel."
1989.88-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,924.982,935.641,"Well, no, you're arguing the statute should generally, for everyone, be interpreted this way so that judges in the future can do just what this judge did here, and could say, it doesn't matter that you haven't given notice."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,940.262,949.969,"Well, I'm arguing that the Court should interpret the requirement of notice to be a procedural requirement, one that the District Court can have flexibility to meet real life situations."
1989.88-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.969,950.38,Right.
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,952.851,954.291,"Well, no, I disagree, Your Honor."
1989.88-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,958.936,960.288,We are not in the business of enforcing intent.
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,970.108,984.436,"--Well, in other situations in the civil rights context, this Court has held that similar prelitigation requirements specified by Congress in similar mandatory language are, in fact, requirements where the Court can fashion a remedy."
1989.88-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1021.301,1027.976,"Well, I suspect there are cases where we've stuck by the strict wording and cases where we haven't struck by, stuck by the strict wording."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,1030.667,1044.847,"--I think that the rhyme or reason is that the Court generally tries to construe remedial statutes, and particularly statutes that are enforced by private attorney generals, to effectuate the remedial purpose of the statute."
1989.88-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1065.731,1070.024,It had served the purpose of making that inquiry unnecessary in future cases.
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,1095.71,1096.461,But there probably are not many other exceptions.
1989.88-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1112.994,1117.548,"Well, this won't be exceptional if we say that this doesn't mean what it says, is what I am saying."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,1124.314,1128.194,"Well, I think that... that's what this Court should hold, and I think that's what this Court has held repeatedly."
1989.88-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1174.025,1177.097,"What's the name of that court case, Mr. Buckley?"
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,1177.097,1180.899,"--It was in the District of Rhode Island, and it is Save Our Sounds versus Callaway."
1989.88-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1180.899,1182.029,"Oh, it's a District Court case?"
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,1182.029,1195.019,"It's a District Court case, and the point of that is not that it has precedential value, but that it presented a unique factual situation, as this case does, where it made sense for the District Court to have discretion."
1989.88-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.145,1318.391,The result in Holy Trinity... that was a case in which a statute categorically prohibited the importation of people to work in the court just out of whole cloth created an exception for clergymen.
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,1318.391,1320.122,"--Well, I remember--"
1989.88-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1320.122,1321.894,You thought that was a correct result?
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,1321.894,1339.144,"--I do think that was a correct result because when the Court looked at the legislative history... and I believe that was a unanimous decision... when the Court looked at the legislative history, it determined that the whole purpose of the statute was to prevent the wholesale importation of unskilled manual labor."
1989.88-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.602,1353.654,They didn't make a skilled laborer exception; they made a clergyman except.
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,1353.654,1357.677,"--I'm sorry, I misspoke."
1989.88-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1395.823,1401.345,"Counsel, we are telling District Courts all over the country to expedite their dockets."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,1442.022,1451.399,"--Well, one of the purposes to be served by the notice requirement... in the legislative history, one of the purposes to be served by the notice requirement was to ease the burden on the courts."
1989.88-42,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1533.069,1550.852,"Counsel, there is comment through these papers that once a suit is filed the position of the parties hardens, and that this is one reason for the preliminary giving of notice before the commencement of an action."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,1553.704,1554.625,"--Yes, I do."
1989.88-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1587.446,1599.996,"If this case had to be refiled, do you think the county would immediately resume the action that it had previously taken, or do you think the problem is now corrected?"
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,1599.996,1602.447,--The problem is not now corrected.
1989.88-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1608.029,1614.794,And you think that if this suit had to be refiled that the county would go right back to its former practices?
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,1614.794,1623.951,"No, I don't think that the county would go back to its former practices, but I do think that the case would be refiled... I don't think this is a situation of mootness."
1989.88-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1681.638,1682.589,"Mr. Buckley, that is not fair."
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,1697.709,1713.578,"Well, whenever the Court looks and focuses on one specific sentence in an entire statute and says that that is not ambiguous, I think the Court disregards the whole context of the statute."
1989.88-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.578,1717.031,It happens to be the sentence that relates to the matter at issue here.
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,1717.031,1719.953,"But it also... but the whole statute also does as well, Your Honor."
1989.88-42,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.095,1801.745,"If you lose, do you think the case will be refiled?"
1989.88-42,0,33764,kim_t_buckley,,1801.745,1803.738,It will be refiled.
1989.88-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.015,1815.866,"Thank you, Mr. Buckley."
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,1817.067,1823.241,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1852.971,1855.963,--say that.
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,1855.963,1857.963,"--I think it does, Your Honor, and I would like to respond--"
1989.88-42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.963,1859.045,"Well, it doesn't say that in those words."
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,1859.045,1870.352,"--It doesn't say that in those words, but I think the overall statute, taking all of the sections together, and the statute as it is relevant to this case as set forth in the appendix to our Respondent's brief."
1989.88-42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1886.402,1894.539,"Well, do you think you have to look at something besides the words that no case may be commenced without a notice?"
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,1897.019,1899.391,"--I don't think you do, Justice White."
1989.88-42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1899.391,1904.286,"Because that just, everybody agrees that you are supposed to give a notice before there is a commencement."
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,1910.13,1910.818,That is correct.
1989.88-42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1931.402,1934.192,"Well, let's start with that."
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,1935.264,1961.444,"I'd also this morning like to touch upon a matter that several of the justices raised this morning, and that is why a decision by this Court affirming the Court of Appeals and construing the statute as written will bring about predictability and even-handed administration of this law, rather than the litigation generating result advanced by the plaintiffs."
1989.88-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1961.444,1970.119,"Well, it might, but it certainly results in some unfortunate, an unfortunate situation in this case, doesn't it?"
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,1970.119,1981.215,"There is no question about that, Justice O'Connor, and I think this Court has said on a number of occasions that the Court's sympathy for a particular plaintiff is no reason to ignore the clear meaning of a statute."
1989.88-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1981.215,1988.491,"And, of course, the Court has overlooked, apparently, clear meaning in the Title 7 context?"
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,1988.491,1997.069,"It has, but Justice O'Connor, those cases do not contain anywhere near the kind of clear language, we submit, that is in this statute."
1989.88-42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.956,2105.759,"Well, now tell me why those words unequivocally say that if you fail to give notice that, something that is filed without the notice must be dismissed, rather than just stayed."
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,2126.934,2132.179,"Justice White, I think it is not an adequate remedy, again because of the clear words, the use of prohibited--"
1989.88-42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.179,2134.871,"Well, tell me what clear words require dismissal?"
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,2134.871,2135.402,--Prohibited.
1989.88-42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2288.511,2293.293,"Do you think the, whoever was entitled to the notice, could waive this requirement?"
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,2293.293,2308.234,"Well, I guess my first response would be that is clearly not the case here, but no, I don't think so."
1989.88-42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2308.234,2312.697,"Well, you have to say that if you claim the jurisdictional, I suppose."
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,2312.697,2313.698,Right.
1989.88-42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2313.698,2319.682,"And a court would... could raise it on its own motion, would have to raise it on its own motion."
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,2319.682,2320.213,Yes.
1989.88-42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2358.638,2361.219,What do you gain by your present position?
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,2374.028,2402.737,"--Perhaps little in this case, Justice Blackmun, but I think as a matter of public policy what is gained by this Court enforcing the, or construing the statute as written and saying that it must be... a notice must be given and, if not, a case must be dismissed... is that predictability in the future, even handed administration of the law--"
1989.88-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2402.737,2407.842,"Well, if it is dismissed I guess the county doesn't pay the attorneys fees and costs?"
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,2407.842,2417.806,"--Well, there were no attorney fees awarded, and that was one of the bases for the appeal taken by the Plaintiffs to the Ninth Circuit, was that no attorney fees were awarded."
1989.88-42,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2592.393,2597.946,"But, presumably, with the same result that took place the first time."
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,2608.302,2623.122,"If I understand your question, Justice Blackmun, it would be avoided simply because you wouldn't have these lawsuits going on, as this one did, with an appellate court ending up saying there was no jurisdiction in the first place."
1989.88-42,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2623.122,2628.174,"Well, maybe the appellate court was wrong."
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,2630.437,2632.699,"Two to one, two to one."
1989.88-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2632.699,2637.503,"Yes, that is circular because if we rule for the Plaintiff then that won't happen."
1989.88-42,1,28580,i_franklin_hunsaker,,2645.071,2647.462,"In this case, Justice Kennedy, it wouldn't happen."
1989.88-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2692.792,2695.353,"Thank you, Mr. Hunsaker."
1989.88-42,2,17885,brian_j_martin,,2697.886,2703.307,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-42,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2800.261,2803.283,"Well, what about the Holy Trinity case, Mr. Martin?"
1989.88-42,2,17885,brian_j_martin,,2803.283,2812.119,"I'm not on the Holy Trinity team today, I don't think."
1989.88-42,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2812.63,2817.134,"That's like, the Holy Trinity team is kind of like the Hail Mary."
1989.88-42,2,17885,brian_j_martin,,2817.134,2820.377,"Well, that's right."
1989.88-42,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2831.352,2833.353,"That isn't what the, the majority said absurd."
1989.88-42,2,17885,brian_j_martin,,2838.088,2842.242,"--Difficult to fathom, unlikely to believe, difficult to fathom."
1989.88-42,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.598,2951.67,"--I take it you are, maybe you don't have to answer this, but I take it you are representing the views of the EPA?"
1989.88-42,2,17885,brian_j_martin,,2951.67,2952.391,--I am.
1989.88-42,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3027.011,3037.458,"Mr. Martin, may I go back to Justice White's concern earlier that the language is plain as to the duty not to commence the action, but that the statute is silent as to the remedy for violating that duty."
1989.88-42,2,17885,brian_j_martin,,3040.41,3041.391,Yes.
1989.88-42,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3041.391,3047.566,"If it was commenced, then the question is what is the remedy for violating the statute."
1989.88-42,2,17885,brian_j_martin,,3050.007,3053.13,"No, I think an action is commenced when you file a complaint."
1989.88-42,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3053.13,3056.782,"Well then if it has been commenced, how can you say there is a wad of jurisdiction?"
1989.88-42,2,17885,brian_j_martin,,3056.782,3062.606,Actions are commenced and they remain on the court's docket until they are dismissed for some reason.
1989.88-42,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3078.837,3100.202,"Well, doesn't that force you to confront the nature of the remedy that must be imposed and whether it is jurisdictional in the true sense or whether it is waivable, or whether the Court could enter a stay?"
1989.88-42,2,17885,brian_j_martin,,3100.202,3103.324,"Well, the facts of this case--"
1989.88-42,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3103.324,3109.548,It seems to me that you can't avoid answering the Chief Justice's inquiry.
1989.88-42,2,17885,brian_j_martin,,3109.548,3117.074,"--Is it jurisdictional, could it be waived by a defendant?"
1989.88-42,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3125.66,3135.478,"Yes, but the lower court took the position that it could remedy it by entering a stay and allowing--"
1989.88-42,2,17885,brian_j_martin,,3135.478,3149.855,"--Well, we think that remedy is plainly inconsistent with the statute, whether it is a jurisdictional requirement that can never be waived or... we're talking about an intent of Congress, so Congress can intend anything they want along these lines."
1989.88-42,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3189.19,3193.113,"--Mr. Martin, I'm worried about this commence point."
1989.88-42,2,17885,brian_j_martin,,3202.059,3205.191,I believe it would be commenced.
1989.88-42,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3205.932,3208.093,"Well, what do you mean by commenced, that's what--"
1989.88-42,2,17885,brian_j_martin,,3208.093,3215.74,"--I mean what Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mean, an action is commenced by filing a complaint."
1989.88-42,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3225.934,3228.926,"Thank you, Mr. Martin."
