1987.87-82,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.778,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Number 87-82, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation versus James E. Mallen."
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,14.089,20.975,"Thank you, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1987.87-82,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,169.651,171.227,Who was the District Judge?
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,171.227,174.024,The District Judge was Judge O'Brien.
1987.87-82,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,174.024,179.632,"Mr. Harrison, why are we examining this thing in gross?"
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,182.99,183.706,That's correct.
1987.87-82,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,183.706,185.503,Why is that?
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,197.873,203.356,The hearing had been scheduled for a date 19 days after he requested it.
1987.87-82,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,214.789,221.849,"Well, is it the government's position... that it is proper to attack the statute on its face in those circumstances?"
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,221.849,226.924,We think that the statute clearly survives a facial challenge.
1987.87-82,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,226.924,227.767,"That is not what I asked, though."
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,227.767,243.386,"And that it is unusual for the District Court to decide that the statutory process is completely meaningless, that it does not provide meaningful review because of the time that is permitted by the statute."
1987.87-82,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,243.386,245.807,That is still not what I asked.
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,261.723,265.347,"That would be a sound ground for decision, yes."
1987.87-82,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,278.762,286.837,"Mr. Harrison, I guess this respondent was later convicted in a criminal proceeding."
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,286.837,287.587,--That's correct.
1987.87-82,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.587,291.539,"And that conviction is on appeal, is it?"
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,291.539,292.678,It is.
1987.87-82,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,292.678,295.35,Has the Eighth Circuit ruled yet?
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,295.35,296.146,It has not.
1987.87-82,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,296.146,301.112,"If it were to do so, is this case moot?"
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,301.112,308.625,Once the criminal process for Mallen is exhausted the case may become moot.
1987.87-82,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,325.634,337.927,"Well, I take it what you mean in answer to that question is, after the direct appeal in the criminal proceeding becomes final, not after the Eighth Circuit rules, but after a petition for rehearing time, petition for certiorari time has gone by."
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,337.927,338.458,"Yes, that's right."
1987.87-82,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,339.754,341.754,"And the United States appealed, too, didn't it?"
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,341.754,343.174,"Yes, we did."
1987.87-82,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,343.174,349.155,"And if dismissal of that count is reversed, there may be another trial."
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,349.155,350.187,That's right.
1987.87-82,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,352.326,359.386,"Are they holding the case up for this argument, or was it just recently argued?"
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,359.386,365.681,"It was argued in December in the Eighth Circuit, and as far as I know it is not being held pending resolution of this case."
1987.87-82,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,392.716,396.027,"Mr. Harrison, is his suspension without pay?"
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,396.027,401.088,"--No, the statute does not provide that the suspension is without pay."
1987.87-82,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,401.088,403.681,So he has been receiving it during--
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,403.681,409.553,"I believe while the bank was open the bank continued to pay him, and there is certainly nothing in the statute to prevent that."
1987.87-82,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.939,427.562,--What happens if the criminal conviction becomes final?
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,435.136,439.073,"Well, he has served his sentence and is currently on probation."
1987.87-82,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,443.461,443.727,I see.
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,443.727,455.034,"--because it became insolvent, so he is no longer employed there anyway, but... and... and he wouldn't be employed by the bank because of a different statute."
1987.87-82,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,455.034,468.64,"Mr. Harrison, are you sure a bank wouldn't be in trouble with its shareholders or indeed perhaps even with federal regulatory authorities if it continued to pay an officer who was not performing any services?"
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,476.744,485.319,It is entirely possible that either the bank shareholders or management or state or federal regulatory authorities might object to paying a suspended officer.
1987.87-82,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,486.554,487.678,I would think.
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,487.678,489.178,"Yes, that's true."
1987.87-82,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,834.164,844.034,"And of course, as was suggested earlier from the bench, we will never know in this case whether the agency would have allowed him to produce oral testimony because he didn't allow it to come to that."
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,844.034,845.519,That is entirely correct.
1987.87-82,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.757,917.474,Can I ask you just... what does the government decide in these cases?
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,932.452,933.264,Absolutely not.
1987.87-82,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,973.217,978.106,Has it ever... an officer unsuspended?
1987.87-82,0,30821,john_c_harrison,,978.106,985.666,"Since the 1978 amendments that are under consideration in this case, I believe it has not."
1987.87-82,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1004.315,1005.517,"Thank you, Mr. Harrison."
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1007.173,1036.271,"Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court, as this Court has often stated, due process requires some kind of hearing, and that that hearing take place at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner."
1987.87-82,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1235.189,1235.501,"Well, Ms. Curtin--"
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1235.501,1235.767,--pending appeal.
1987.87-82,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1235.939,1243.28,--I gather that you and the government disagree on when that other statute becomes operative.
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1243.28,1263.771,"No, Your Honor, we don't, and the reason we don't is because when Mr. Mallen was convicted the FDIC brought an action which you will see referenced, I believe, in our brief, FDIC versus Mallen, to immediately require Mr. Mallen's suspension from the bank pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1829."
1987.87-82,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1263.771,1272.769,Do I not understand that they now take the position that the conviction won't be final until after his appeal?
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1272.769,1286.653,"Well, Your Honor, they are taking the position, as I understand it, that the conviction isn't final until after his appeal, but the language of 1829 does not say that you shall be removed when your conviction is final."
1987.87-82,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1323.903,1326.465,"It wasn't Mr. Harrison down there, though, was it, anyway?"
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1326.465,1329.088,"It was Mr.... no, it wasn't Mr. Harrison."
1987.87-82,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1329.088,1329.76,That's nice.
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1330.494,1355.562,"I am just saying now we have all changed sides, but there is a court case that specifically interprets that statute, the only one that I am aware of, Your Honor, and it ruled in favor of the FDIC's position that the conviction, the entry of the conviction operated to terminate the individual's ability to work not just in the Kanawha Bank, where Mr. Mallen was employed, but any bank whose deposits are insured."
1987.87-82,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1363.279,1375.523,Do you think that the District Court was proper to decide this on a facial challenge rather than to wait and see what happened?
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1375.523,1392.939,"It was very clear, Your Honor, and some of this... all of this correspondence, I believe, is in the appendix that we were not going to get a hearing from the FDIC where a decision would have been rendered even close to when Mr. Mallen's criminal trial had been over."
1987.87-82,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1411.382,1417.912,"Well, let's assume that's correct, but why should the District Court declare the statute unconstitutional?"
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1433.797,1445.091,"I read Judge O'Brien's decision, Chief Justice Rehnquist, to indicate that he felt that the statute was applied in an unconstitutional manner."
1987.87-82,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1501.379,1512.719,How about the District Court's ruling coupling his reservations about the timeliness with the fact that the FDIC would not automatically have admitted oral testimony?
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1523.058,1552.265,"In anticipation of this question, I read a number of cases that attempted to distinguish a facial challenge to a statute from a statute that was unconstitutional as applied, and I am afraid I have to admit to this Court that I concluded that there was an extremely gray area in the middle, and I will tell you quite candidly I am not sure if this is a facial challenge to the statute or if it was just unconstitutional as applied."
1987.87-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.622,1572.867,"Well, outside of the First Amendment area, if a statute is to be held unconstitutional on its face, wouldn't it be true that it could never be any circumstances constitutionally applied?"
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1572.867,1580.63,"From the cases I read, yes, in order for it to be a facial challenge to a statute, my understanding was that there were no set of circumstances--"
1987.87-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.63,1587.128,"Well, you certainly must... you certainly must concede that the statute could be constitutionally applied."
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1587.128,1593.842,"--Well, the set of circumstances that I could foresee that would allow the statute to be constitutional--"
1987.87-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.842,1604.979,"Well, if the agency here had given your client a hearing within two days and decided the case within two more days, I would doubt if you would have had much objection to that, would you?"
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1604.979,1611.539,"--Justice White, if the agency had proposed anything near that kind of timetable with my client I wouldn't be standing here."
1987.87-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1611.539,1617.74,"I take it, though, you originally asked for a pre-suspension hearing, didn't you?"
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1617.74,1618.646,"No, we did not."
1987.87-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.646,1619.224,You never did?
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1619.224,1620.379,"No, we didn't."
1987.87-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.379,1626.565,The court said that the agency didn't need to have a pre-suspension hearing.
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1626.565,1634.39,It has never been contested in any posture of this case that we had a right to a pre-suspension hearing.
1987.87-82,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1691.147,1693.897,"Ms. Curtin, you say the risk is high."
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1738.238,1752.655,"Justice Scalia, the reason the trial is important to me and the reason it is the trigger is because whatever the result of the trial, the posture of the administrative proceeding will then... if you follow me."
1987.87-82,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1754.076,1757.823,"--I understand, but Congress would be saying, fine, so much the better."
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1772.974,1781.861,"--The resolution of the trial is going to moot, for lack of a better word, regardless of the nature of the resolution, the administrative proceeding."
1987.87-82,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.837,1811.583,--I suppose that that would be a good argument if it were clear that Congress could not absolutely automatically eliminate officerships when there is an indictment.
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1811.583,1814.864,The Feinberg Court made that observation.
1987.87-82,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.33,1870.091,"I agree with all of that, but it still seems to me reasonable for the legislature to say there must be some kind of hearing, and this has to be done within 90 days."
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1877.29,1879.806,It may be rational.
1987.87-82,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1880.492,1885.943,So long as you assume that Congress could have eliminated him without a hearing and just said everybody who is indicted gets down as an officer of a bank.
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1885.943,1895.752,"--I think we need to focus on something else here, Justice Scalia, because perhaps, maybe I am wrong, but perhaps this is the source of the confusion between us, or the disagreement."
1987.87-82,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1906.217,1907.029,"Yes, I understand that."
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,1907.029,1911.325,Was not to decide any facts pertaining to his indictment or the reason for his indictment.
1987.87-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2019.936,2030.62,Hadn't the FDIC started a hearing to remove him under another section?
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,2030.62,2031.978,The previous--
1987.87-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2031.978,2033.727,Several months before indictment?
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,2033.727,2036.32,"--Yes, previous to the indictment in September."
1987.87-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.32,2036.836,And there was a hearing.
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,2041.364,2043.285,It went on before an Administrative Law Judge.
1987.87-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2045.3,2046.41,Did your client testify?
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,2046.41,2054.047,My client was on the stand to testify when the judge declared... the judge recused himself.
1987.87-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2054.859,2059.42,The hearing was never concluded?
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,2059.42,2060.732,That's correct.
1987.87-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.732,2062.139,There was an indictment there.
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,2062.139,2063.637,He was indicted in December.
1987.87-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.731,2069.713,So the FDIC did know something about the bank.
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,2069.713,2071.838,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2083.739,2085.081,"Well, it was to see whether he should be removed."
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,2085.081,2099.529,"--Yes, but the standards for removal under 8(e), which was the administrative proceeding, had nothing to do in any way, shape, or form with the standards for suspension under 8(g)."
1987.87-82,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.529,2100.56,Right.
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,2100.779,2110.618,"Had that hearing been concluded, there would have been no testimony in that hearing having anything to do with impairment of public confidence or damage to the depositors."
1987.87-82,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2209.532,2214.405,Is that because you weren't allowed to have a hearing that you lied?
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,2214.405,2216.669,--That I liked?
1987.87-82,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2216.669,2218.826,"That you liked, the kind of hearing that you liked."
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,2220.059,2223.026,"Well, I think it's a twofold problem."
1987.87-82,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2223.026,2224.37,Is that the problem?
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,2224.37,2226.416,Well--
1987.87-82,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2226.416,2228.025,You want a fullblown trial--
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,2228.025,2248.532,"--It is our position, Justice Marshall, that had the hearing been convened, and given the total lack of pre-deprivation procedures, that we needed to be afforded the opportunity to confront and cross examine witnesses, but the problem in arguing that past point in this context is, it was... we were never going to have a hearing at all."
1987.87-82,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2248.532,2254.155,--How can you be sure if you didn't participate.
1987.87-82,1,35562,mary_e_curtin,,2265.666,2273.631,"Justice Marhsall, we did not refuse to participate, as you put it, until it was made clear to us by the FDIC--"
1987.87-82,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2273.631,2277.037,"Well, did you then refuse to participate afterwards?"
