1987.87-5277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.456,"We will hear argument next in Number 87-5277, Tony B. Amadeo versus Ralph Kemp."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,67.792,69.377,Thank you very much.
1987.87-5277,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,95.575,98.044,"Where is Putnam County, what part of Georgia?"
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,98.044,101.062,"It is not far from Macon, Georgia, in the center of the--"
1987.87-5277,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,101.062,102.495,More or less south then?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,102.495,103.745,"--More in the central part of the state, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,103.745,104.847,Below the Nat Line?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,104.847,107.466,"Right about on the Nat Line, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.54,209.514,"Mr. Bright, the District Court here concluded that petitioner's counsel at the time... that wasn't you, I guess."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,209.514,210.114,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,210.114,218.853,Did not deliberately bypass the constitutional challenge to the composition of the master jury list.
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,218.853,219.805,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,219.805,248.556,"Now, what evidence is there in the record to support that finding in the face of what appears to be defense counsel's testimony to the effect that defense counsel considered challenging the jury list, thought they could win such a challenge, but chose not to raise it in order to preserve what they thought was a favourable jury?"
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,248.556,257.245,"Your Honor, that was one of two factual determinations that the District Court made which the Eleventh Circuit rejected."
1987.87-5277,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,267.936,270.588,"And he was only one of more than one counsel, was he not?"
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,270.588,284.046,"--He was one of two counsel, right, and they were appointed to represent both Mr. Amadeo and the two co-defendants in all three of these cases, but the District Court looked at the totality of the circumstances and clearly did not credit that testimony, because the District--"
1987.87-5277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,284.046,292.085,"Well, tell me, please, where we look in the record to find something to support the District Court's contrary view."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,292.085,292.835,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,305.911,313.601,"Right, and you had explicit testimony by the lawyer saying that we like this jury, we didn't think we could get a better jury."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,319.838,321.071,The ultimate jury.
1987.87-5277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,338.966,340.834,I think you are being whipsaw.
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,351.976,357.528,"Yes, and there are a number of sources of that that they would have brought the challenge, and let me go through those, if I may."
1987.87-5277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,357.528,359.896,Would you go with pages to the record?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,359.896,360.446,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,432.511,433.128,Excuse me.
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,441.867,446.152,--The continuance motion would have produced a different jury but in the same county.
1987.87-5277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,476.373,480.259,There was that testimony by one of the defense lawyers?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,480.259,483.444,"--Well, of course, they didn't know they had this claim."
1987.87-5277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,485.063,503.29,"Right, but there was testimony, I thought, by at least one of them to the effect that we considered a constitutional challenge to the master list, thought we might have won it, but we bypassed it because we thought we had a favorable actual jury."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,507.742,509.261,"--Yes, you can find that he said this."
1987.87-5277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,529.056,529.458,Okay.
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,539.697,540.164,--All right.
1987.87-5277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,548.819,550.838,That was after they had lost the trial.
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,550.838,551.488,--Yes.
1987.87-5277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,551.488,560.794,"I mean, that is quite a different context to say then, sure, you are going to do anything you can to upset the verdict, but their testimony was of this guy's opinion before the trial, wasn't it?"
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,560.794,561.244,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,562.562,568.133,"He was testifying afterwards, but he was giving his point of view before the trial."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,568.133,570.383,That's what he testified to--
1987.87-5277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,570.383,574.954,"Well, yes, that is all we are saying, is that that's what he testified to."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,574.954,575.287,--Right.
1987.87-5277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,575.287,581.024,"So testifying different, taking a different position after you've lost the trial really is not a contradiction."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,581.024,589.129,"Well, if it's a different position, the fact that it was taken after the trial may be an explanation for it, but it is a contradiction."
1987.87-5277,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,629.706,630.572,Was that the testimony of the lawyers or some other lawyers?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,631.356,636.61,"--One of those statements, Mr. Coates, when he told Mr. Lambert about it,"
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,654.57,658.705,"That is not one of the lawyers, that is somebody who said he was talking to one of the lawyers."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,659.272,659.955,--Right.
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,659.955,662.507,And he said that that lawyer said... what were the exact words?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,663.926,666.295,"I'm not sure if I have the exact words, but I believe that--"
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,666.295,667.178,"Well, I think it's... here."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,667.178,680.535,"--Mr. Jernigan was asked if he recalled Mr. Lambert saying, had they known about this claim, would they have raised it, and Mr. Lambert said that they would have, and that's at the bottom of Page 59, the top of Page 60 of the Joint Appendix."
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.535,683.137,"Well, it says... is it the quote that says,"
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,694.544,700.282,"The quote is, and this is at the bottom, Justice Scalia, of Page 59,"
1987.87-5277,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,742.959,750.214,"Mr. Bright, let me ask, wasn't Mr. Jernigan speaking about statistical disparity when he made that statement?"
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,750.214,766.324,"No, he was speaking when he made that statement that I just quoted, Justice Blackmun, he was talking about the prosecutor's memorandum that indicated that he had designed a plan to limit blacks and women and avoid a prima facie case by--"
1987.87-5277,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,766.324,769.176,"I'm trying to help you out, but I guess I'm not doing it."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,769.176,769.959,--I'm sorry.
1987.87-5277,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,769.959,778.715,"I thought he was speaking of the statistical disparity, and that that was what he shied away from, which to me is very different--"
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,778.715,779.4,Yes.
1987.87-5277,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,779.4,783.786,--than allegations of a challenge of an intentional discrimination.
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,783.786,784.486,Exactly.
1987.87-5277,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,812.038,821.477,"If this is true, I think it utterly destroys this talk about what Jernigan said as being something that there is no answer to."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,825.013,825.763,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,904.048,910.284,Do you interpret the District Court's opinion as finding that the trial lawyer were not credible?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,910.284,928.496,"--I think he resolved conflicting evidence to come to the conclusion that they would have raised the claim had they known of this constitutional violation, that the district attorney was engaged basically in a criminal conspiracy with the jury commissioners to limit the participation of blacks and whites."
1987.87-5277,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,928.496,935.567,"So that their statement that they made a deliberate, knowing waiver of the jury challenge is not credible?"
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,935.567,939.804,"Well, two points on that."
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1214.517,1216.452,"Mr. Bright, this was a white defendant, right?"
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1216.452,1217.152,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.152,1226.008,So it is not at all implausible that the composition of the jury... what was the percentage of blacks on it?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1226.008,1228.508,On the ultimate jury that was chosen?
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1228.508,1229.31,"Yes, the ultimate jury."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1229.31,1231.343,Was six black and six white.
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.343,1232.162,Six and six.
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1234.864,1235.997,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.997,1236.58,Do we know which?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1238.148,1238.698,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1238.698,1244.219,It is not at all implausible that that was indeed quite satisfactory to this white defendant.
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1244.219,1257.043,"Well, it's not implausible, but I think what we know now which we didn't know at the time is that this basically was a jury selected through a clearly unconstitutional and illegal scheme."
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1257.043,1269.518,"There was some evidence, was there not, of prior offenses that this individual had committed against blacks which might indeed cause him to prefer a jury with fewer blacks rather than more?"
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1269.518,1273.572,That was one consideration put forward by one of the lawyers.
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1274.055,1282.677,"And you had the express statement by his lawyer that they made the tactical decision not to challenge it, even though they thought that had they challenged it, they might well have won."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1282.677,1284.477,"Yes, and of course we have--"
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1284.477,1293.133,And the only explicit statement you set up against that is somebody's recollection that he said it'd been a great issue if I'd known about it.
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1297.904,1300.639,"--Oh, no, but that is not the only thing, Justice Scalia, that contradicts that."
1987.87-5277,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1323.421,1327.873,"The latter motion was just to... was to change the county, however, right?"
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1327.873,1330.491,"To change the venue, yes, to another--"
1987.87-5277,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1330.491,1331.758,Which means a different county altogether.
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1331.758,1338.181,"--Yes, which would have meant that it wouldn't be before this jury, which contradicts certainly the testimony--"
1987.87-5277,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1338.181,1342.966,But that doesn't contradict the idea that this might have been the best jury they could have had in that county.
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1342.966,1367.783,"--Well, maybe the venue question does not, although I would submit that counsel's affidavit saying that the jury was so prejudiced against them certainly contradicts the testimony that the jury was so good that they would forego some other challenge, but again, I think the challenge that they thought they were foregoing is a completely different question than what the claim that they actually had in this particular case."
1987.87-5277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1382.46,1387.328,Is the setup in Georgia by counties or by circuits?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1387.328,1388.012,By county.
1987.87-5277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1388.012,1390.964,So every county has its own jury?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1390.964,1392.047,"Yes, jury commissioners."
1987.87-5277,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1392.864,1398.718,Can you tell me one detail of the procedure of selecting the jury?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1404.688,1408.574,They maintained the lists separately by race.
1987.87-5277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.172,1436.04,What is basic constitutional challenge--
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1436.04,1456.037,"Casseel versus Texas, that people were excluded, and I suppose as well, Your Honor, Peters versus Kiff and Your Honor's concurring opinion in that case that here basically in violation of the Constitution as well as 18 U.S. Code 243, people were excluded from jury service based on race and gender intentionally."
1987.87-5277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.037,1460.822,"--It isn't a fair cross-section claim, is it?"
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1460.822,1469.011,"Well, it would have been at the trial phase, it would have been both, both a cross-section claim and a discrimination claim."
1987.87-5277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.011,1469.844,How would it have been a clear cross-section claim?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1469.844,1471.127,Excuse me?
1987.87-5277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.127,1471.611,How would it--
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1471.611,1471.894,Well--
1987.87-5277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.894,1473.729,--Why would it have been a clear cross-section--
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1473.729,1474.279,--Very well.
1987.87-5277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1478.317,1479.45,--An equal protection claim?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1479.45,1480.267,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1480.267,1482.069,"This is a grand jury, not a petit jury?"
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1482.069,1483.069,"No, it was both, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.069,1484.085,Both.
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1484.085,1484.719,Both.
1987.87-5277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.925,1492.575,And this memorandum applied to both?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1492.575,1493.075,Applied to both.
1987.87-5277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1565.906,1570.175,Was this authenticated in some way--
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1570.175,1570.627,Yes.
1987.87-5277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1570.627,1573.579,--so we know someone testified that he did write it?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1573.579,1589.688,"The clerk of the court testified that he received this from the district attorney's office for the... and he was the secretary to the jury commission... for the purpose of giving it to the commission, and he gave it to the chairman, and they followed it to the letter, and the District Court made that finding, that it was followed to the letter."
1987.87-5277,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1592.956,1595.408,Did I mishear you?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1597.944,1609.585,"--No, I said the Eleventh Circuit erroneously rejected the finding that it was concealed and found that it was readily discoverable, and I was about to say why it was not."
1987.87-5277,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1609.585,1615.572,"Yes, would you, please, because it was in the stack of the papers that was voluntarily delivered, and the clerk testified exactly what it was."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1615.572,1615.822,Right.
1987.87-5277,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1616.356,1618.441,Is that the universe of things?
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1632.617,1643.306,"--Yes, and of course what the District Court found here was the whole purpose of the scheme was deception, but the Eleventh Circuit juxtaposed those two terms in terms of its finding and the District Court's finding."
1987.87-5277,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1643.306,1647.191,"Well, there is no finding that the memorandum was hidden."
1987.87-5277,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1656.566,1665.171,"I think what the record clearly shows, though, is that the way in which this memorandum came out was totally fortuity and inadvertent."
1987.87-5277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1770.739,1771.941,"Thank you, Mr. Bright."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1774.31,1805.912,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the existence of the memo which has been the subject of great discussion before this Court and the lower courts is only relevant in the context of this particular case if the memorandum played some part in the strategy decision that petitioner's trial attorneys made, so the pivotal inquiry for this Court to make is what the attorneys knew, when they knew it, and what important factors they knew about the grand jury that called them to make the decision to forego the challenge."
1987.87-5277,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1956.537,1972.063,"Ms. Boleyn, do you think that defense counsel were actually aware of the basis by which they could have challenged the master jury list for this statistical discrepancy?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1972.063,1979.236,"Your Honor, they made a reasonable assumption that the jury was challengeable and could be challenged successfully."
1987.87-5277,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1980.152,1993.06,Do you think they made an assumption that it could have been challenged because of the intentional discrimination in the statistical makeup?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,1993.06,1998.214,--They assumed the statistics would establish the intentional nature of the discrimination.
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2002.518,2004.268,"Of course, they were wrong on that, weren't they?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2004.268,2005.303,"Yes, they were."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2006.369,2009.035,So they didn't know the real basis for a valid challenge.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2009.035,2013.939,"--Right, but the crucial thing, of course, is that the memorandum didn't cause them not to make the challenge."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2037.47,2040.922,"Which is one of the things they sought unsuccessfully, was delay, wasn't it?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2040.922,2042.208,"Your Honor, I believe--"
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2042.208,2044.541,They did file a motion that would have resulted in delay.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2044.541,2048.445,"--They filed a motion for continuance, but the basis of that motion was not to--"
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2048.445,2051.814,"I understand, but one of the things as a matter of tactics they wanted was delay."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2051.814,2052.647,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.217,2059.517,"Three motions, wasn't it?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2059.517,2060.085,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2069.358,2076.112,And is it not clear that had they known of this defect in the grand jury selection they clearly could have obtained a continuance?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2076.112,2078.878,--If they had known of the defect they could have obtained the continuance?
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2078.878,2079.028,Yes.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2079.028,2082.016,"Yes, but they never said they wanted a continuance."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.318,2088.836,I thought you agreed they did file a motion for a continuance.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2088.836,2089.353,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.445,2108.583,They must have wanted... you just don't file a motion for continuance without a reason for it.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2110.849,2111.449,"Yes, they did, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2122.991,2135.048,"So the assumption that that was just a motion to get time for time's sake is not valid, and just because they wanted a continuance for that purpose doesn't mean that they would seize upon any device to give them more time."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2137.333,2138.602,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2182.279,2191.218,"If the motion for continuance had been granted, is counsel for the state correct that there would necessarily have been a new jury array?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2191.218,2192.77,There would not have been.
1987.87-5277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2199.157,2204.461,Do we know the dates of the expiration of the jury?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2204.461,2206.58,"I don't believe that's in the record, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2211.983,2220.554,"So a three-week continuance, you are representing, would not necessarily result in a new jury array?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2220.554,2221.506,"Let me correct myself, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2228.976,2230.945,"Do the juries run on a calendar year, do you know?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2230.945,2236.532,"--I think there are three juries per year in that county, as I recall, three."
1987.87-5277,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2236.532,2238.968,How long does the average term in Putnam County last?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2238.968,2243.77,"I think it's four months, each for four months is what I believe it is, but I'm not certain of that."
1987.87-5277,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2243.77,2246.455,"And you fill a calendar for four months, keep a judge there for four months?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2246.455,2251.941,I think what they do is rotate the different judges within the circuit to the particular county where you have it.
1987.87-5277,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2252.976,2254.227,Got a lot of business then in Putnam County?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2254.227,2255.377,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1987.87-5277,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2255.377,2257.293,I say they have a lot of business in Putnam County.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2257.293,2257.627,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-5277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2257.627,2270.137,"Ms. Boleyn, did the District Court issue any opinion on this subject other than the order and memorandum decision that is contained from Page 90 to 93 of the appendix?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2270.137,2280.493,"They had the first order prior to the time the trial attorneys testified, Your Honor, and then, of course, they entered the oral or if you will after the remand had taken place."
1987.87-5277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2280.493,2284.628,"Yes, and that is the one at Page 90 to 93."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2284.628,2286.98,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2286.98,2288.113,Thank you.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2288.113,2298.219,The attorneys carried out their trial strategy to try to get a beneficial array by voir diring the jury about the various factors that I have mentioned.
1987.87-5277,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2308.091,2313.061,Did they exercise any peremptories?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2313.061,2316.096,"Yes, they exercised all but two of their ten peremptories."
1987.87-5277,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2316.096,2317.263,But they didn't exhaust them?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2317.263,2321.167,"No, they didn't, but they required that the District Attorney exhaust all 20 of his."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.988,2330.106,"Ms. Boleyn, would you help me?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2343.064,2344.283,"Yes, Your Honor, perhaps I wasn't clear."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2347.568,2350.104,"--Which is a full explanation of cause and prejudice, that written opinion."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2350.104,2350.704,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2402.886,2404.671,I thought the District Court found otherwise.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2406.373,2411.725,"Your Honor, the bases for the District Court's opinion were these."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2451.551,2463.71,So you agree that we couldn't uphold setting aside the District Court's decision unless we agreed that it was clearly erroneous that there had been concealment.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2478.803,2483.771,"--Your Honor, in the first order of the District Court we contend the filing findings are clearly erroneous."
1987.87-5277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2551.282,2554.267,Wasn't that based on the testimony of Jernigan?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2554.267,2555.301,"--Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2555.301,2562.207,"Which was hearsay testimony, no quite as reliable as Lambert's own testimony, but that is for the trial judge, isn't it?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2562.207,2581.085,"Your Honor, what you had was, you had the two trial attorneys at the time, of course, present before the District Court, and they didn't testify that if they had had the memorandum they would have known it, but yet two other people talking to them recollected that back in 1978 they thought that that's what they had said, so you are balancing hearsay testimony--"
1987.87-5277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2581.085,2583.62,"But that's for the trial judge, isn't it?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2583.62,2585.572,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's what it is."
1987.87-5277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2591.642,2593.192,"Well, was the hearsay objected to?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2593.192,2595.261,--The hearsay of Mr. Jernigan?
1987.87-5277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2596.078,2597.313,"It is in the record, then, isn't it?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2597.313,2598.18,"Yes, it is."
1987.87-5277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2601.082,2613.906,"Well, now, that's... is there a rule that you cannot credit hearsay testimony over direct testimony, especially when the person testifying on direct has an interest in the testimony, namely, these attorneys' interest in not being sued for malpractice?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2613.906,2619.127,"--Your Honor, a fact can be clearly erroneous even if there is some evidence to support it."
1987.87-5277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2640.807,2643.492,"Ms. Boleyn, I think that's a close call."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2650.515,2654.383,Only that portion that the Court noted before of Mr. Jernigan's testimony.
1987.87-5277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2654.383,2655.633,It doesn't say they would have raised it.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2666.774,2667.191,Yes.
1987.87-5277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2667.191,2669.226,I think he just said it was a great issue.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2669.226,2669.759,Yes.
1987.87-5277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2669.759,2671.859,I don't know where it is in the appendix.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2676.228,2688.386,"What they rely upon, Your Honor, what they have always relied upon is JA60, where they ask Mr. Jernigan after he has first said, I don't remember what he said, then they ask him again, on cross said, asked him the leading question;"
1987.87-5277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2696.307,2707.699,"The ""Yeah, I recall that"" might be taken to mean, I recall his saying he would have raised it but for the fact that he had said earlier specifically, I don't think he told me what he would have done."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2715.953,2716.721,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.546,2730.379,"Well, you don't want to do that."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2732.898,2748.924,"I think our bottom line position on this, Your Honor, is that the memo has no relevance in this case because it was not a basis for the trial attorneys' deliberate decision, and this is borne out in the manner in which they finally did raise their challenge."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2772.206,2773.892,"Well, do you think this issue is just a straw issue?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2777.56,2782.913,"--I think the allegations and the nature of the memo are very serious, but the question is--"
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2782.913,2784.213,And the facts are serious.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2784.213,2784.449,--Yes.
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2784.449,2785.299,This actually happened.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2798.221,2800.304,And that is a very serious contention.
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2800.304,2803.439,And they even used jury lists that were segregated by race.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2803.439,2805.291,That is a very serious--
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2805.291,2807.243,"And was that commonly known, that that was being done?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2807.243,2809.91,--The jury boxes were kept separately?
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2809.91,2810.412,Yes.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2810.412,2811.845,"I don't know, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2821.067,2829.573,"So that by and large they would not have been charged with notice that this was going on, so even if the memorandum were not concealed, the plan was concealed, was it not?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2829.573,2831.839,--That is what we contest.
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2831.839,2835.457,You contest that the plan was concealed?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2835.457,2835.907,Yes.
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2835.907,2841.611,How was anyone to find out about that if they didn't bump into this memorandum and ask a lot of questions?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2841.611,2844.413,"It was in the relevant public record, Your Honor, along with--"
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2844.413,2845.246,In a stack of papers.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2845.246,2848.865,"--In the master jury list, not just in a stack of papers but in the master jury list."
1987.87-5277,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2848.865,2850.198,How so?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2853.083,2856.019,"It was in... the clerk testified... well, excuse me."
1987.87-5277,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2874.346,2880.3,"Well, you take the position that this yellow pad sheet--"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2880.3,2881.067,--Yes.
1987.87-5277,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2881.067,2884.769,--could reasonably have been discovered.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2884.769,2885.069,Yes.
1987.87-5277,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2889.571,2897.41,"I just wonder how... you know, I looked at it on Page 3, and I think if I had seen it I wouldn't have known what I was looking at."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2899.795,2900.612,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2973.827,2978.195,But do you seriously think that the district attorney's office wanted that document to be found?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2978.195,2978.731,No.
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2978.731,2982.765,"So that if they knew where it was, they surely would have recaptured it, wouldn't they?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2982.765,2983.949,There is no evidence--
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2983.949,2991.288,"So you can't say... maybe the clerk certainly testified truthfully and all, but you can't say the prosecutor's office wasn't guilty of concealment."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2993.906,2994.606,--No.
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.492,2998.842,Correct.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2998.842,3002.36,"So it's the clerk's action, not the prosecutor's action, that caused it to be in the public record."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3002.36,3006.931,But the prosecutor is the adversary of the petitioner in this case.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3006.931,3007.814,Your Honor--
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3007.814,3010.08,It's not the clerk we are concerned about here.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3010.08,3017.42,--I think the point to be made about that is first of all that the record is not as complete as the petitioner says that it is.
1987.87-5277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3039.166,3040.285,May I interrupt?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3043.101,3046.939,"That is the previous name for the district attorney, the solicitor's office."
1987.87-5277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3046.939,3049.307,And the solicitor is the prosecutor?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3049.307,3050.591,"Yes, they are the same thing."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3073.156,3074.239,"No, but the percentages do fit, don't they?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3074.239,3074.806,"--Yes, they do."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3074.806,3076.191,And the District Judge was persuaded by that.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3076.191,3085.547,"And it of course resulted in minimal disparities, Your Honor, 10 percent for one and 5.1 percent for the other, which of course is very minimal even if you are trying to discriminate."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3085.547,3090.682,Just a little bit pregnant.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3120.72,3121.72,Why do I suppose... what is my speculation?
1987.87-5277,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3121.72,3124.172,"--Is that all it is, speculation?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3124.172,3125.472,"The same as theirs is, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3126.79,3129.623,"He sent it, though, didn't he?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3129.623,3130.875,The prosecutor never testified.
1987.87-5277,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3138.312,3139.562,"Well, it just didn't create itself."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3139.562,3140.181,That's right.
1987.87-5277,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3140.181,3142.914,So it came from the prosecutor's office.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3142.914,3143.383,"That's right, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3143.383,3146.751,And so it came from a person in the prosecutor's office.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3146.751,3147.635,"Yes, sir, that's what we know."
1987.87-5277,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.635,3150.037,What do you suppose that person had in mind?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3150.037,3151.837,"We don't know, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3173.068,3175.854,I thought that that was determined in another trial.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3196.767,3200.469,"Your Honor, I am not contesting that that memorandum came from the solicitor's office."
1987.87-5277,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3227.37,3229.322,There has never been an action against the prosecutor?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3229.322,3229.939,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3236.893,3239.094,Is that solicitor still solicitor?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3239.094,3239.794,"Yes, he is, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3239.794,3253.937,What is the basis for your saying that the trial court was wrong in finding that the petitioner's counsel were justified in assuming that an attack upon the jury would be futile?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3253.937,3256.556,"Because they at all times assumed it would be successful, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3256.556,3256.922,Because they--
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3256.922,3259.008,Because they at all times assumed it would be successful.
1987.87-5277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3262.126,3264.662,--And what did they base that assumption on?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3264.662,3276.902,"--They said general knowledge in the legal community, that it statistically wasn't right, and also general knowledge that if you went far back enough in Georgia that you were going to find an underrepresentation of blacks in the grand and traverse juries."
1987.87-5277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3276.902,3282.039,"In other words, the statistics on their face show about the same disproportion that were shown in the memo?"
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3282.039,3283.955,They never went and looked at the statistics.
1987.87-5277,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3295.43,3302.084,Were those statistics easily demonstrable other than from the memo?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3302.084,3309.69,"Yes, they were, Your Honor, because that's how Mr. Coates got them, was going to the clerk's office himself and doing the tabulations, and then he presented those in Bailey v. Vining."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3334.905,3335.674,May I ask you another question?
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3347.232,3348.348,"It could be, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3349.265,3352.1,"Why would that be different, because they thought they had a good jury."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3352.1,3356.421,"--Because I think, Your Honor, first of all you have to look at what they assume."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3360.205,3361.138,Yes.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3361.138,3366.006,"Then that would be a reasonable strategic decision, the fact that they didn't... they thought that they had an element of proof."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3366.906,3367.825,And they later on found there was a bribe.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3369.675,3375.379,"It depends on whether the reasonableness, you know, whether there was ineffectiveness for not knowing about the bribe or something like that."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3375.379,3382.051,"They just didn't look at the memo that said, we bribed this juror that was hiding over, you know, was in the clerk's office."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3382.451,3384.134,If they assumed... if they assumed--
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3384.134,3391.157,"They just didn't know about it, and they could have found it out if they had really been diligent and careful, but they didn't, and they thought they had the best jury they could get."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3392.99,3395.692,--If they also assumed that they could challenge--
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3395.692,3400.513,"Yes, they assumed... they made all those assumptions and decided, well, let's just go ahead with this jury."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3400.513,3404.981,"--It would still be a reasonable strategic decision that would not be caused, as long as they assume that they can be successful--"
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3404.981,3406.333,They'd be stuck with that jury.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3406.333,3407.333,--The decision would be--
1987.87-5277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3407.333,3411.285,Are you saying that they assumed that... they assumed that one of the jurors had been bribed.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3414.52,3416.772,"--That is what I thought I was saying, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3416.772,3418.64,"Well, I didn't understand you to be saying that."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3418.64,3419.19,"No, perhaps I was--"
1987.87-5277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3419.19,3420.19,But that would be the parallel.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3426.061,3434.4,"--And the key inquiry whether if they think they need an element of proof that they don't have for whatever they are trying to show, then there you would have the nexus."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3451.112,3457.182,"Their assumption of the bribery would just be based on the notion, we know we've got a crooked prosecutor here who probably bribes people."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3460.667,3463.669,"Your Honor, but they had more to base their assumption on in this case."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3463.669,3464.069,--But they didn't.
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3471.775,3472.375,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-5277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3500.426,3502.628,"But that is past juries, not this jury."
1987.87-5277,1,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3502.628,3504.128,"--Well, that's, of course, the way you look at it."
1987.87-5277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3537.415,3539.498,"Thank you, Ms. Boleyn."
1987.87-5277,2,40972,stephen_b_bright,,3542.033,3544.069,Very well.
1987.87-5277,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3603.108,3608.726,Can you tell us why the prosecutor wasn't called as a witness?
1987.87-5277,2,40972,stephen_b_bright,,3608.726,3616.332,"I think the evidence was established at least from... in the Bailey case by the testimony of Mr. Dennis, the clerk of the court and secretary to the jury commission."
1987.87-5277,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3628.472,3629.322,Amadeo didn't need him.
1987.87-5277,2,40972,stephen_b_bright,,3629.322,3630.172,Excuse me?
1987.87-5277,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3630.172,3632.191,Amadeo didn't need the prosecutor.
1987.87-5277,2,40972,stephen_b_bright,,3632.191,3635.126,We certainly did not need the prosecutor in this particular case.
1987.87-5277,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3671.715,3673.084,"Thank you, Mr. Bright."
