1992.91-1421,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We'll hear argument now in No. 91-1421, United States against William F. Hill."
1992.91-1421,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,11.122,15.176,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1421,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,91.76,94.545,When did Congress enact the minimum tax?
1992.91-1421,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,94.545,98.597,The first version of the minimum tax was enacted in 1969.
1992.91-1421,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,98.597,99.697,Thank you.
1992.91-1421,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,104.983,106.067,Yes.
1992.91-1421,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,106.067,115.875,"And by virtue of the most recent change, I guess no minimum tax will be applied to this."
1992.91-1421,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,115.875,134.337,"Under section 1915 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which was enacted 2 weeks ago, Congress has exempted the restricted minimum... I'm sorry... percentage depletion allowance for independent oil producers from the coverage of the minimum tax."
1992.91-1421,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,142.025,150.798,"Well, that certainly indicates that at least the present Congress isn't viewing the situation quite like you do."
1992.91-1421,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,150.798,158.952,Actually what we think and what I believe the statute reflects is that there are two ways to attack abusive tax preferences.
1992.91-1421,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,240.439,247.343,"Well, Mr. Jones, since I have you interrupted, may I ask one other question?"
1992.91-1421,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,266.006,277.295,"Well, we address it in the sense that all that regulation does is refer the reader to section 1016 of the code for adjustments to basis."
1992.91-1421,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,284.051,301.68,"Well, but this regulation 1.57 at least can be read to mean that the special rule referred to in the regulation 1.612 doesn't apply."
1992.91-1421,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,301.68,302.263,"--Well, there's--"
1992.91-1421,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,302.263,306.549,"And so, I just wondered why you didn't even talk about it."
1992.91-1421,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,306.549,313.32,--There's at least two reasons why that regulation has no relevance to the Court's decision in this case.
1992.91-1421,1,40330,richard_b_robinson,,1430.088,1433.659,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1421,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1585.672,1589.79,As distinguished from the cost of drilling the well in the first place?
1992.91-1421,1,40330,richard_b_robinson,,1589.79,1595.61,"Your Honor, I think they both help in terms of producing them, but yes, they are distinguished from drilling the well in the first place."
1992.91-1421,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1595.61,1598.645,And drilling the well is in your view an intangible.
1992.91-1421,1,40330,richard_b_robinson,,1598.645,1600.181,Drilling the well is an intangible cost.
1992.91-1421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.28,1665.374,"Well, are you depreciating any tangible property in connection with this mineral enterprise?"
1992.91-1421,1,40330,richard_b_robinson,,1665.374,1672.36,"Your Honor, we are depreciating the tangible improvements to the mineral deposit."
1992.91-1421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1673.86,1676.062,You're taking a depreciation deduction.
1992.91-1421,1,40330,richard_b_robinson,,1676.062,1677.931,--A depreciation deduction for the tangible improvements.
1992.91-1421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.931,1682.483,And not including that for purposes of figuring your depletion.
1992.91-1421,1,40330,richard_b_robinson,,1682.483,1684.983,We are not including it for purposes of figuring our depletion.
1992.91-1421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.983,1691.589,So what kind of... what kind of property are you depreciating?
1992.91-1421,1,40330,richard_b_robinson,,1691.589,1699.743,"We're depreciating the casing that goes down into the well, the pump that brings the oil and gas to the surface."
1992.91-1421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1699.743,1701.945,And you're not including that in your... figuring your depletion.
1992.91-1421,1,40330,richard_b_robinson,,1701.945,1703.563,"No, we're not."
1992.91-1421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.563,1707.932,"Well, without those properties, you wouldn't have much of an oil well either."
1992.91-1421,1,40330,richard_b_robinson,,1707.932,1708.432,We couldn't.
1992.91-1421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1726.06,1738.653,"Well, I thought you said that you were... the casing... are you including that in your... your basis for the depletion?"
1992.91-1421,1,40330,richard_b_robinson,,1738.653,1740.486,"Not for depletion, Your Honor."
1992.91-1421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.486,1746.224,Even though it's absolutely essential for... to get the oil out of the ground.
1992.91-1421,1,40330,richard_b_robinson,,1746.224,1753.33,Any costs that are represented by physical property have to be recovered through depreciation.
1992.91-1421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1757.547,1758.597,"Well, now, tell me again."
1992.91-1421,1,40330,richard_b_robinson,,1761.983,1771.874,"It is the casing, the pipes, and the pumps that are lifting the oil and gas out of the ground."
1992.91-1421,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2672.787,2673.12,Thank you.
1992.91-1421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2772.336,2776.521,"Of course, that case didn't deal with the tax on the depletion allowance."
1992.91-1421,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2782.358,2784.543,"Well, it certainly doesn't involve the minimum tax."
