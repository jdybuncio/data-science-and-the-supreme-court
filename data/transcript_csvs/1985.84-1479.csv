1985.84-1479,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.325,We'll hear arguments next in LeFevre against Wilson.
1985.84-1479,0,41583,steven_r_kartagener,,12.12,12.777,Thank you.
1985.84-1479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,230.734,231.875,You mean 1984?
1985.84-1479,0,41583,steven_r_kartagener,,231.875,232.11,Excuse me.
1985.84-1479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.052,575.83,"But it's cast, isn't it, Mr. Kartagener, in terms of the thing may he, the writ may be dismissed, not that the writ must be dismissed?"
1985.84-1479,0,41583,steven_r_kartagener,,575.83,584.779,"Well, Justice Rehnquist, what it says is the court need not entertain the successive petition unless."
1985.84-1479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,614.206,629.964,"But even if Sanders by virtue of the rules and the advisory notes still governed, I would think that you could use the term ""ends of justice"" for your purpose as much as your opponent could."
1985.84-1479,0,41583,steven_r_kartagener,,629.964,648.862,"I would certainly agree with that position, Your Honor, and in our brief we argue as a final subsection that, even if the ends of justice analysis were to be considered extant, notwithstanding the Congressional mandatory legislation of 1966, we should still prevail under that analysis."
1985.84-1479,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.578,892.249,"Something along the lines of Judge Friendly's article, ""Is Innocence Irrelevant""?"
1985.84-1479,0,41583,steven_r_kartagener,,892.249,892.655,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1985.84-1479,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,950.068,957.097,What was the trial court finding with respect to who prompted the conversations?
1985.84-1479,0,41583,steven_r_kartagener,,957.097,964.172,The state court finding was that the statements were spontaneous and completely unsolicited.
1985.84-1479,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1561.087,1561.462,That's just your warning light.
1985.84-1479,0,41583,steven_r_kartagener,,1561.462,1562.289,--Excuse me?
1985.84-1479,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1562.289,1563.695,That's just your warning light.
1985.84-1479,0,41583,steven_r_kartagener,,1563.695,1565.85,"Yes, but I was hoping to reserve my remaining five minutes."
1985.84-1479,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1569.256,1569.662,Very well.
1985.84-1479,1,38431,philip_s_weber,,1582.376,1589.749,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.84-1479,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1602.057,1605.804,What about the finding of the trial court that these were spontaneous statements?
1985.84-1479,1,38431,philip_s_weber,,1608.616,1612.739,"Your Honor, we haven't argued that that is a clearly erroneous finding."
1985.84-1479,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1764.819,1773.721,"Mr. Weber, has your client in the second federal habeas proceeding made anything that you would describe as a colorable claim of factual innocence?"
1985.84-1479,1,38431,philip_s_weber,,1773.721,1777.734,"Your Honor, the court--"
1985.84-1479,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.734,1779.859,"You can answer that yes or no, can't you?"
1985.84-1479,1,38431,philip_s_weber,,1779.859,1782.03,"--There has been no change in the facts, Your Honor."
1985.84-1479,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.803,1812.642,"Well, but would you seriously contend before a neutral body, say of arbitrators rather than lawyers, that there isn't enough evidence to support your client's conviction for the crime?"
1985.84-1479,1,38431,philip_s_weber,,1812.642,1817.797,"--Your Honor, what I would argue is probably not pertinent here."
1985.84-1479,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1827.902,1831.713,Has that argument been made before in these federal habeas proceedings?
1985.84-1479,1,38431,philip_s_weber,,1831.713,1835.883,"Well, that is something that would have to remain for trial, Your Honor."
1985.84-1479,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1835.883,1837.601,"Well, I said has it been made before."
1985.84-1479,1,38431,philip_s_weber,,1837.601,1838.258,"No, it hasn't, Your Honor."
1985.84-1479,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1982.917,1985.667,"Well, do you think it's just a standardless discretion?"
1985.84-1479,2,41583,steven_r_kartagener,,1985.667,1990.414,I think that the discretion is controlled by an abuse of discretion standard.
1985.84-1479,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1990.414,2000.942,"Well, how would you decide in a particular case whether a district court or Court of Appeals had properly either considered the petition or refused to consider?"
1985.84-1479,2,41583,steven_r_kartagener,,2000.942,2023.713,"Your Honor, I think if the case comes up on appeal, for example to a Court of Appeals, where the district court refused to consider the petition, I think the Court of Appeals would then have to decide whether, given all the facts and circumstances, the ends of justice would have been served by the district court considering the petition."
1985.84-1479,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2023.713,2026.133,There's nothing more general than that?
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2028.321,2032.116,"Well, I think that that was the holding of the Court in Sanders, Your Honor."
1985.84-1479,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2036.818,2040.909,"Well, but Sanders no longer governs this situation by its terms."
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2043.22,2043.423,--Yes indeed.
1985.84-1479,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2043.423,2056.121,"Now, there may be carryover from the language of Sanders, but I don't see that you can argue that particular language in Sanders that wasn't carried over in the advisory committee notes is binding."
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2056.121,2061.072,"Your Honor, I do argue that it's binding, for two reasons perhaps."
1985.84-1479,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2070.366,2072.662,"That would have to have been dicta, I suppose."
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2072.662,2079.581,"Well, in a sense the rule of guidance is dictum, because it wasn't necessary for the holding of the case."
1985.84-1479,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2090.249,2109.585,"Well, I guess you concede that it is open to this Court to give substance and meaning to the situations that this Court thinks are appropriate for federal courts in entertaining petitions from state cases?"
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2109.585,2110.194,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1479,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2276.141,2288.293,"What if we were to think that Henry didn't articulate new legal principles, but simply applied the same legal principles previously established to new facts?"
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2288.293,2309.784,"I think in that case, Your Honor, what we would have is a case that makes clear that the prior legal determination of the courts that considered the first petition was a plain error, and that is the contention that the Petitioner alluded to in his argument and we think that that is within the purview of the Court on habeas corpus to reconsider that."
1985.84-1479,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2309.784,2318.531,"You think there should be no limit, then, on when courts will consider the same issue again and again?"
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2318.531,2327.059,"Your Honor, at common law there was no limit to the number of times a prisoner could bring a habeas corpus petition."
1985.84-1479,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2331.214,2340.616,You think that the evidence of the legislative history then is entirely free from an indication that Congress thought there should be some limit someplace?
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2340.616,2350.877,"--Your Honor, I think that the legislative history shows that Congress believes that there should be some limit, but it has not made a limit as to this particular point."
1985.84-1479,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2388.83,2415.617,"Well, would you say that the ends of justice language in the section and the notes always indicate an argument in favor of extended review, or would you say that the ends of justice might on occasion, perhaps in the fourth or fifth petition or if there isn't any colorable claim of innocence, indicate that the petition shouldn't be reviewed?"
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2415.617,2416.508,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1985.84-1479,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.069,2732.849,What about the purpose here?
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2732.849,2735.177,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1985.84-1479,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2735.177,2739.69,"What about, did the state deliberately set out to elicit something?"
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2739.69,2740.393,Absolutely.
1985.84-1479,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.393,2742.658,Is there a finding to that effect?
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2742.658,2748.234,"No, there isn't a finding of that in the state court's decision, because the state court didn't know that that was what it was supposed to be investigating."
1985.84-1479,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2748.234,2752.498,"Yes, but how about, are there any findings anywhere to that effect?"
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2752.498,2756.277,"Well, the Court of Appeals below correctly determined--"
1985.84-1479,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2756.277,2756.918,What about the district court?
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2756.918,2763.883,--The district court held that the visit from Wilson's brother was in fact the cause.
1985.84-1479,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2763.883,2766.539,"Well, what about the purpose of the--"
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2766.539,2774.645,"I don't think there's any question, Your Honor, that the purpose of the state's employing an informant--"
1985.84-1479,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2774.645,2775.331,--Was to elicit something?
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2775.331,2777.846,--was to elicit a statement from the accused.
1985.84-1479,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2778.846,2786.499,"Well, that's different than saying the purpose was to report to us if he says anything."
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2786.499,2789.249,"--That's not all that the investigating officer said, Your Honor."
1985.84-1479,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2803.336,2806.07,"You don't purport to be quoting what he actually said, do you?"
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2806.07,2806.695,Pardon?
1985.84-1479,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2806.695,2808.474,You're not purporting to quote what he said?
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2808.474,2809.349,No.
1985.84-1479,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2809.349,2812.505,"He said you are to listen, you are not to initiate."
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2812.505,2814.457,That's true.
1985.84-1479,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2816.02,2819.517,And the court found that that added up to a spontaneous declaration.
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2819.517,2821.954,"--But there is more to it, Your Honor."
1985.84-1479,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2851.816,2857.329,"He was to find out by keeping his ears open, wasn't that essentially the statement?"
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2857.329,2858.033,"Yes, that's true."
1985.84-1479,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2880.868,2896.954,"Suppose that there had been a recording device in the cell and there was just some other prisoner, just a casual occupant of the cell--"
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2896.954,2898.703,That's the hypothetical--
1985.84-1479,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2898.703,2902.265,--and this gentleman talked and said all the things he said here.
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,2902.265,2908.575,"--Yes, Your Honor, and that'... the hypothetical question that was left open by the Court in Henry in footnote number 9."
1985.84-1479,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3128.439,3130.562,"Mr. Weber, I don't want to interrupt you."
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,3151.257,3158.972,"Your Honor, I think that the Court of Appeals' finding is correct that the ends of justice would be served, and--"
1985.84-1479,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3158.972,3161.441,"Well, let me just put a second question that's related--"
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,3161.441,3161.877,--Yes.
1985.84-1479,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3161.877,3162.706,--and then you might want to cover them both.
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,3177.574,3180.839,"Your Honor, I think that probably it would serve two purposes."
1985.84-1479,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3204.018,3205.596,"See, they didn't really do that."
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,3210.187,3210.812,Correct.
1985.84-1479,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3210.812,3219.995,And they didn't really say whether the district court was plainly wrong in coming to a contrary conclusion or whether the district court had a duty simply to entertain the petition.
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,3227.149,3231.725,"Well, Your Honor, the district court did entertain the petition and--"
1985.84-1479,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.725,3233.989,"It denied it without a hearing, did it not?"
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,3233.989,3234.364,"--No, no."
1985.84-1479,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3244.283,3253.467,"So the district court denied it on the merits, rather than on the ground that it was a successive petition raising the same issue?"
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,3253.467,3254.309,Correct.
1985.84-1479,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3298.152,3311.474,Do you think that you must show that what your client said was the result of conversing with the informant?
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,3311.474,3315.551,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think that Henry takes in a result test."
1985.84-1479,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3357.847,3370.56,"Well, the Court of Appeals referred to Henry and said that there were some conversations with the defendant while he was in jail, and the defendant's incriminatory statements were the product of these conversations."
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,3370.56,3371.56,"Yes, Your Honor, there is--"
1985.84-1479,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.56,3380.259,Now do you... must we... you are asserting that these admissions were a product of the conversations?
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,3380.259,3385.881,"--I think it is true in this case, Your Honor, that the admissions were the product."
1985.84-1479,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3386.647,3389.255,"Can they be that and be spontaneous, too?"
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,3389.255,3391.566,--Perhaps they can.
1985.84-1479,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3391.566,3395.175,Don't you think spontaneity is a historical fact?
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,3395.175,3396.69,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1479,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3397.986,3401.11,"Voluntariness may not be, but why isn't spontaneity?"
1985.84-1479,3,38431,philip_s_weber,,3401.11,3414.887,"--Well, I think that the way the court, the state trial court which determined Wilson's suppression motion, used the word, it used it as essentially a paraphrase or an equivalent of the word ""voluntary""."
1985.84-1479,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3432.3,3434.722,"Do you have anything further, counsel?"
1985.84-1479,4,41583,steven_r_kartagener,,3434.722,3435.752,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1479,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3439.016,3439.782,You have five minutes.
1985.84-1479,4,41583,steven_r_kartagener,,3439.782,3440.766,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1985.84-1479,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3440.766,3442.25,You have five minutes remaining.
1985.84-1479,4,41583,steven_r_kartagener,,3442.25,3442.812,"Thank you, Your Honor."
