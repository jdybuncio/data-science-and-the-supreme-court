1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.07,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1729, Caplin & Drysdale v. United States."
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,11.122,15.01,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,268.273,272.16,"Mr. Lockwood, what are the requirements for a forfeiture?"
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,277.897,285.551,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, there are a variety of properties which are subject to forfeiture in Section 853(a)."
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,289.372,296.609,"I didn't mean so much the various kinds of properties, but what does the government have to show in order to forfeit any property?"
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,299.995,304.049,"--The government has to show... well, the government first has to convict the defendant."
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.049,304.565,Yes.
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,304.565,332.632,"Secondly, having convicted it, it has to show that the property was either obtained or used in the manner proscribed by the statute itself which, as I say, involves a variety of different considerations including, for example, that the property in a RICO case, which has an identical statute to the one at issue here, was a portion of the enterprise that the defendant conducted by a pattern of racketeering activity."
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,354.481,357.933,What was the basis for the forfeiture against Reckmeyer here?
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,357.933,363.17,"Well, the ultimate basis was Reckmeyer's consent."
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,363.17,363.62,"Well, but--"
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,363.62,366.205,There was never any litigation or findings--
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,366.205,368.988,--Doesn't the court have... doesn't the court have to make any findings or anything like that?
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,368.988,370.973,--Not if the defendant consents.
1988.87-1729,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.773,504.094,I mean... there... there... there is not agreement on both sides that that's the only purpose.
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,504.094,507.898,"--Your... Justice Scalia, I didn't mean to say it was agreement that that was the only purpose."
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,540.0,550.456,"But that... is that your principal contention here, that the forfeiture... or the tying up of the assets simply on the basis of an indictment is not right?"
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,556.092,557.961,"That is correct, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,557.961,559.761,"So, it isn't just the fact that it is just an indictment."
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,562.663,564.548,"That is correct, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,611.762,612.212,It's like a--
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,612.212,615.881,--In exchange for money that the government can come and take back if the defendant is convicted.
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,615.881,618.85,--It is like a lis pendens in a civil action.
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,618.85,626.189,"Short of the formality of filing the lis pendens with the court, it is exactly the same, Justice Rehnquist."
1988.87-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,626.189,634.877,But your claim is limited to compensation for services performed prior to conviction.
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,634.877,636.727,"Prior to conviction, that is correct, Justice White."
1988.87-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.727,644.483,And you think you should be paid either before or after conviction for those services.
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,644.483,659.91,"As long as the services were rendered prior to conviction, it is our position that the procedural context of when the lower court got around to deciding that we were entitled to be paid is irrelevant."
1988.87-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,742.647,756.156,"So, you... it's your position that... I mean, that... that relation back to the date of the offense is just... you shouldn't construe the statute that way or that if you do, it's unconstitutional?"
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,756.156,757.74,--We do not--
1988.87-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.74,766.929,What about an... what about just a bank loan that the defendant owed and was due and it was owing?
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,773.285,774.052,"--Well, under the statute--"
1988.87-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,774.052,780.289,--[inaudible] something special out of the fact that these are counsel fees?
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,780.289,783.558,"--Well, we are and we aren't, Justice White."
1988.87-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,797.117,798.95,xxx bank loan?
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,798.95,809.458,"--A bank loan, depending upon the circumstances under which it would be made, the bank could very well qualify as a bona fide for... purchaser for value without notice."
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,837.109,842.346,But what about the money that is claimed to be the proceeds of a bank robbery?
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,842.346,845.631,"Chief Justice Scalia, we would... excuse me... Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,849.683,850.868,You see visions of the future.
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,856.622,860.408,We would argue that the bank robbery analogy is not apt.
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.291,887.691,But--
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,887.691,889.343,--by operation is a fiction.
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,890.543,901.218,"--Well, but... but why can't the federal government make property law the same way state governments make property law when they say that the... that the money deposited in a bank belongs to a bank?"
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,906.789,912.191,"They can, provided that they have a particular, legitimate constitutional purpose."
1988.87-1729,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,939.343,956.12,"But the only legitimate basis for imposing the penalty is the wrongful act and, therefore, it is perfectly proper... in fact, I should think necessary... for the government to make the statute relate back to the occurrence of the wrongful act, which is all it has done here."
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,960.756,985.122,"That's correct, Justice Kennedy, as long as you don't push the principle too far because if the issue... to the extent the statute and the forfeiture provisions are directed at the defendant himself, it is perfectly appropriate for the statute by way of a penalty to look back to the time that the criminal act was committed for purpose of identifying the forfeitable property."
1988.87-1729,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1023.163,1023.68,That's a... that's a different theory.
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1059.603,1061.372,"Justice Scalia, I don't believe so."
1988.87-1729,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.372,1063.455,He can go through that money completely.
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1063.455,1064.49,I don't believe so.
1988.87-1729,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.94,1065.374,Why not?
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1065.374,1076.898,--We would concede that the government has a legitimate interest in preventing the defendant from simply wasting money that he believes he will ultimately have to turn over to the government.
1988.87-1729,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.898,1079.834,Why is that if... if it can't make any relation back?
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1083.101,1089.272,We didn't say that the relation-back doctrine is unconstitutional on its face.
1988.87-1729,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1116.107,1119.975,"Well, you must be reasoning from something else other than the mere relation back then."
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1124.362,1125.195,"Well, we... the statutory--"
1988.87-1729,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1125.195,1134.234,"--because if you really think that you can't take it away from him until he is convicted, he ought to have the right to do whatever he wants with that money during the period while the trial is continuing."
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1134.234,1146.626,"--In the statutory context, Justice Scalia, we are relying on language in the statute which we contend gives the court an equitable discretion both under the restraining order provisions and under the relation-back provisions."
1988.87-1729,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1226.16,1228.179,"Well, of course, that... that's the issue."
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1244.706,1245.64,Justice Kennedy--
1988.87-1729,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1245.64,1246.64,And that's the whole point.
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1246.64,1258.448,"--Justice Kennedy, the problem is that at the time of the impact of the restraint and forfeiture, the defendant's assets are only claimed by the government to be illegal."
1988.87-1729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1281.897,1302.06,"Mr. Lockwood, what if the defendant has as his property a stash of narcotics, which he had been planning to sell, and also money that he had obtained from prior sales of narcotics according to the government's allegations?"
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1309.898,1312.516,We would concede he could not use the narcotics.
1988.87-1729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1332.179,1342.102,And do you think the government has a different interest there so it can prevent the use of that money that it alleges were simply obtained by drug sales?
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1342.102,1356.795,--I think the government's interest at all times in this criminal forfeiture penalty in this statute that is before the Court is in penalizing the defendant by stripping him of his assets that were illegally obtained.
1988.87-1729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1356.795,1357.295,"Well, are we sure of that?"
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1368.419,1393.52,"The government could, I believe, make a different case from the one that is presented here if the assets sought to be seized were alleged to be needed to be used for evidence because that gets into a different set of constitutional considerations more like the typical ones that this Court has upheld in... in prior cases where counsel of choice was at issue, namely, the due and fair administration of justice."
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1416.583,1427.891,"What... what if you applied the government's rationale to your rather standard forfeiture of an automobile used in transporting drugs, nothing to do with CCE or RICO?"
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1439.849,1441.635,"No, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1441.635,1443.42,How do you distinguish that case from this?
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1443.42,1454.792,"Well, for openers, we would... I would not... I would need to know whether the automobile was the only asset that the defendant possessed which he could convert to cash to hire a lawyer because that's what this case entails."
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1454.792,1459.762,Let's suppose it... let's suppose it was.
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1459.762,1462.648,And the automobile was not proposed to be used as evidence.
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1465.766,1466.233,To... yes.
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1466.233,1467.802,--and penalize the defendant for having--
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1467.802,1472.07,So that the defendant doesn't sell it... doesn't sell it before the forfeiture proceedings are completed.
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1472.07,1494.102,"--I believe that if the sole purpose is to maximize the forfeiture penalty and not for evidence or some other thing and the automobile was not proven to be used in the crime at the time of its seizure and the defendant needs to sell it to raise counsel fees, that... that that would, in fact, be a violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment to counsel of choice in that very unusual circumstance."
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1494.102,1496.721,"Well, I don't think it is terribly unusual."
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1502.206,1507.66,What is unusual is the notion that a defendant's only asset would be the automobile.
1988.87-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1508.529,1519.901,"Mr. Lockwood, you would... I gather you... in this example about the car, you... it was necessary for you to reach the Sixth Amendment issue."
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1519.901,1521.42,"That's correct, Justice White."
1988.87-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1521.42,1528.591,"And so, you concede that the... that the statute and the forfeiture provision covers that car."
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1528.591,1537.196,"Well, the... the question of the scope of the discretion in 853 could be read to even include it there."
1988.87-1729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.881,1539.598,"Well, it seems to me--"
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1539.598,1544.285,--because it is not a blanket asset forfeiture; it is a particularized one.
1988.87-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.022,1551.839,--Let me push you one step further.
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1565.029,1566.281,"No, Justice Stevens, I wouldn't."
1988.87-1729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1569.149,1571.449,"And... and also, of course, they would be the property of the government."
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1571.449,1572.518,"That's correct, from the beginning."
1988.87-1729,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1579.088,1580.238,"Counsel, one more question--"
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1596.717,1616.813,"--No, Justice Kennedy, but this is not an unjust enrichment statute, and in an unjust enrichment case, the defendant generally speaking, is not deprived of his ability to live and hire counsel while he litigates with his opponent under some doctrine of relation back or some restraining order."
1988.87-1729,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1616.813,1626.753,Your position is there no unjust enrichment in the prospect of a dope dealer keeping the proceeds of his transaction?
1988.87-1729,0,38088,peter_van_n_lockwood,,1628.021,1636.342,"By definition, the dope dealer or the RICO defendant or the... in the future, the tax evader who has spent the money on a lawyer has not kept it."
1988.87-1729,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1651.553,1652.653,"Very well, Mr. Lockwood."
1988.87-1729,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1655.855,1658.707,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1729,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1803.869,1809.673,"And you assert that the Fifth Amendment issue, the due process issue, is not involved here at all."
1988.87-1729,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1809.673,1823.265,"Well, the... there is a Fifth Amendment issue with respect... a general Fifth Amendment claim that is made by Caplin & Drysdale with respect to the question of whether it violates the Fifth Amendment to put this kind of authority in the hands of prosecutors."
1988.87-1729,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.917,1827.317,Yes.
1988.87-1729,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1827.317,1829.252,--we believe is not presented in these cases.
1988.87-1729,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.252,1830.636,As to whether you need a hearing--
1988.87-1729,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1830.636,1831.069,A hearing.
1988.87-1729,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1831.538,1832.288,--and what has to be shown at that hearing.
1988.87-1729,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1832.288,1832.804,That's right.
1988.87-1729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1872.865,1876.067,"Yes, but of course, you didn't have that before the guilty plea."
1988.87-1729,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1878.167,1883.321,"--When we had it, Your Honor, was... and let me give you the chronologies because I think it may be important."
1988.87-1729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1906.419,1906.819,"No, that's true."
1988.87-1729,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1910.221,1910.638,--That's correct.
1988.87-1729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1911.24,1914.542,And part of the issue is what can be done during that six-weeks period.
1988.87-1729,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1914.542,1914.992,That's right.
1988.87-1729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1914.992,1925.314,"Say h makes... pays his landlord his rent during that six-weeks period, and the landlord hears about the indictment and has reason to be believe maybe this fellow is a crook and maybe this is tainted money."
1988.87-1729,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1929.285,1929.868,That's right.
