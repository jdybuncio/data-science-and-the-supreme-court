1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,27.988,33.166,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Honorable Court.
1965.650,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,269.6,272.498,Are there any of these come out of the trustees' own pocket or --?
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,272.498,272.954,No sir.
1965.650,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,272.954,274.457,Thank you.
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,274.457,283.358,"The point that I first made, this is a fight between the general state and the United States rather than the trustee and the United States."
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,683.162,687.141,"Well, why do you concede the principal there?"
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,687.141,689.086,"Sir, I -- what principal?"
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,689.086,691.422,Of the tax.
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,691.422,694.935,"Well, we concede the principal of the tax because we believe that --"
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,694.935,697.34,I mean as an expense for administration.
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,697.34,698.131,Because sir --
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,698.131,710.625,Why do you concede that the bankruptcy trustee must treat taxes incurred by his predecessors namely the debtor Chapter XI as an expense of his administration?
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,710.625,713.697,Because that bankruptcy statute requires it sir.
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,713.697,715.425,And what -- what does it say?
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,715.425,724.232,"Section 64(a) in setting up the first priority says there should be first paid out of bankruptcy estates, the costs and expenses of administration."
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,752.643,762.844,"Well, I know but you're conceding that -- that your bankruptcy trustee must treat -- must pay as an expense of his administration."
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,762.844,762.895,No sir.
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,762.895,766.503,Taxes -- taxes incurred by Chapter XI.
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,766.503,768.298,"No sir, I think the word there is his."
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,779.856,781.819,In a prior -- in a prior Chapter XI --
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,781.819,786.635,That's right sir because they occur after the filing of the bankruptcy petition.
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.635,801.291,"Well now, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't think for a minute that after there had been a difference here, if the debtor had himself filed that -- if the time for filing a tax return had occurred during the time the debtor has been in possession."
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,808.335,813.816,"Yes sir, I think either case he has to pay the principal.Our basic argument is the interest which is --"
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,813.816,815.087,"Well, I understand that but I'm --"
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,815.087,821.638,"Because after the election of the trustee, the continuing interest to the date of payment and the penalties against the trustee for not returning it."
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.638,828.023,"Well, do you think the -- well then do you think if the -- do you think that the Trustee in Bankruptcy had an obligation to file a return?"
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,828.023,829.76,No sir.
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,834.448,839.246,You just -- you mean you only had -- he didn't even have an obligation to pay the tax on time.
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,839.246,848.556,"No sir, he never had an obligation to pay the tax until he (Voice Overlap) until all the expenses -- until we knew where all the expenses of administration were."
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.114,906.819,"Well, what's the -- what's to keep you though from -- I know you've already conceded it but what's -- what's really -- would prevent a bankruptcy trustee in position of this trustee from arguing that Chapter XI taxes should be paid in a subsequent straight bankruptcy proceeding only if other pre-petition taxes are paid."
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,906.819,908.618,"Well, I think sir that --"
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,908.618,908.999,What is that?
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,909.831,911.441,I believe it might well be argued.
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,914.13,914.303,No.
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,928.417,931.18,"Section 64(a) of the Bankruptcy Act, sir."
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,931.18,932.224,What does that say?
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,932.224,941.409,It says that -- it's under decisions understated that any expenses incurred subsequent to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy.
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,941.409,944.542,"Well, I agreed but this -- this was not incurred."
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,948.898,954.883,It was -- it was incurred subsequent to the filing of the petition for the arrangement which is the petition --
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,954.883,963.121,"Well, do you concede then that we have to -- that you have to go back to the -- that the bankruptcy trustee himself has to go back to the original filing date?"
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,963.121,968.121,"Yes sir, for purposes of paying those subordinated administrative point."
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,969.082,976.633,And you picked up -- do you pick up all the obligations then that the -- that the Chapter XI trustee or debtor possession had?
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,976.633,986.22,"Insofar as the assets are sufficient to pay them after the payment of the expenses in the liquidating bankruptcy, Justice White."
1965.650,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,986.22,994.91,"Well, let's see if I understand that you're turning these all into the 64(a) petition of the Chapter XI for that purpose."
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,994.91,1014.133,"Well sir, I'm saying that since 1952, when this Act was amended, it is our position that there are three classes of creditors rather than two with whom we're dealing this afternoon because we're not talking about wage claims or any of the other classes."
1965.650,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1041.117,1042.473,In this instance of Chapter XI --
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,1042.473,1043.271,That's right sir.
1965.650,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1043.271,1043.53,Alright.
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,1043.53,1051.64,"Because of the relation back part of Section 378 of the Bankruptcy Act, they are administrative expenses."
1965.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.317,1131.372,One of the -- one of the Chapter XI proceeding had lasted long enough for the -- for the debtor to file but not pay the tax and to accrue some interest.
1965.650,0,30454,john_h_gunn,,1142.443,1148.835,"Sir, with that I have no dispute and I do not dispute you -- that with you here this afternoon nor do I dispute that with the Government this afternoon."
1965.650,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1316.158,1319.506,Alright.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,1321.21,1326.098,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1574.433,1579.194,"Well then, why did you file a statement of expenses?"
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,1585.379,1592.484,"There is the possibility, Mr. Justice White, that there were no funds available to be turned over at that particular time."
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.771,1603.493,But you don't mean to tell me that your -- that your trust there disappears because there's commingling.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,1603.493,1604.165,It does not.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.68,1625.759,This means you're bringing us here though under your own administration expense theory.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,1625.759,1625.964,Yes.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.964,1633.205,"And that's what it's up here on and I don't see how you can -- if you wanted to litigate it on another basis, you ought to go ahead and litigate it on then."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,1633.205,1641.165,Your Honors we're not contending that we're entitled to the -- to the interest and penalties here as a trust fund.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.434,1656.076,"Well, what's that -- what does that have to do with priority here though?"
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,1656.076,1668.568,It has -- it has to do with priority because borrowed funds during the period that a debtor is in possession are funds on which the Debtor in Possession ordinarily has to pay interest.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1871.756,1881.886,"Well, nobody did really disputes you that if -- if the debtor had gone on operating the business and hadn't paid his taxes -- paid these taxes that it would have to pay interest."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,1893.366,1897.882,"Yes, Your Honor and with respect to that --"
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.882,1907.024,"Well, by the way, could you tell me the provision in the Code, are there any, or the Bankruptcy Act which imposes on the bankruptcy trustee."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,1914.848,1914.947,Your Honor --
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1914.947,1923.913,-- and incurred the taxes but which were not due or payable until after a bankruptcy petition had intervened.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,1923.913,1928.762,"Your Honor please, there is no provision in the Bankruptcy Act specifically on that point."
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.762,1929.204,"Well, how about --"
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,1929.204,1929.668,We --
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1929.668,1931.695,-- the internal revenue law?
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,1931.695,1943.968,"In the Internal Revenue Code, it say -- it's our position that Section 6011 which specifically provides that a person who is liable for a tax shall file a return."
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.035,1984.345,So you say that the --
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,1984.345,1985.209,Bankruptcy proceeding.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1985.209,1991.125,You say the bankruptcy trustee inherited the obligation to pay the tax and to file a return.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,1991.125,1992.112,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1965.650,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1993.251,1996.305,"Well, I'm very explicit though with --"
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,1996.305,2028.639,"It -- by adding one more section of the Bankruptcy Act, if I may, to this presentation, Section 3782 provide that upon the entry of an order that the bankruptcy shall be proceeded with, the proceedings shall be conducted so far as possible in the same manner and with the light effect as if a voluntary petition for adjudication had been filed and a decree of adjudication had been entered on the date when the bankruptcy petition was filed."
1965.650,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2029.071,2031.181,Is that published in your brief?
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2031.181,2031.274,"Yes, sir, I --"
1965.650,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2031.274,2033.107,Is that under your brief?
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2033.107,2035.25,"3782, yes sir."
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.5,2071.242,"Well, I might that even that just gets you though, that just gets you to the point to ensure the bankruptcy trustee owes the tax."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2095.027,2102.799,"Your Honor, this is a -- that Section 64(a) sets up a sub-priority as we understand you to cover liquidation expenses."
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2109.181,2110.468,"Well, just a minute."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2166.609,2178.318,"Well, Mr. Justice White, I think that that approach does violence to the concept that this is one continuous administration."
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2178.318,2180.603,"Well, I don't think it does violence to it at all."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2182.499,2185.795,Well I -- if the claim which was in question --
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2185.795,2197.242,"He accepts the claim, the trustee says I've -- we're all then proceeding here, I accept and I -- and I have to pay as an expense for administration the tax that is already approved."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2197.242,2197.992,Suppose that the --
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2197.992,2205.304,And you want to go and say -- and not only that but you have to pay it on January 20 and file a return or else.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2205.304,2207.861,Certainly there is no problem with filing the return.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.1,2216.066,But it doesn't unless you don't.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2216.066,2216.685,And --
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2216.685,2218.888,But it doesn't unless you don't file it.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2218.888,2223.388,And so if -- the return can be filed without creating a hardship to anyone.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.388,2230.53,"Yes, but you wouldn't -- if he doesn't -- if he isn't liable to pay the tax on that date, you really wouldn't care whether he filed a return on it."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2230.53,2231.427,"Well, it's our view that you --"
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.427,2232.995,"That you want to go to the next step, don't you?"
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2232.995,2235.423,It's our view that he must pay the tax.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.814,2251.72,"Well, how about the situation where there's -- where there is only X dollars in the estate and the prebankruptcy petition, the Chapter XI tax obligation equals the amount of the assets."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2260.137,2276.828,"For the immediate term about the liquidation expenses, in those circumstances, he is in exactly the same position as he would be with respect to any other liability incurred by the Debtor in Possession which bears interest."
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2282.131,2284.89,"That doesn't -- that doesn't get you by the penalty, does it?"
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2284.89,2286.293,Except with respect to the trust fund.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.302,2298.826,"Oh no, or only at the expense of that same interest."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2298.826,2299.479,That's right.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2317.037,2324.566,When you say he had been on position that he would be involved with respect to any other obligation of the Chapter XI proceeding which bears interest.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2324.566,2325.055,Yes sir.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2325.055,2331.055,"Well, I'm not so -- if he were, what he would do is subordinate."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2339.474,2340.897,"If we're correct, of course --"
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2340.897,2345.552,"If there's not enough to pay both, who gets paid first?"
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2345.552,2351.695,"If there's not enough to pay them both, if we're correct with respect to the trust fund theory, then those money has never been --"
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.695,2354.603,"Well -- wait a minute now, you can't go back on that now."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2356.632,2358.743,Alright.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2364.982,2373.84,They wouldn't come first though if he had already paid them out on January 20 when they were due according to you.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2378.021,2389.354,"Well, if he have paid them out, if he -- if the Trustee in Bankruptcy had paid more, then the share in which the Government was entitled under the first priority --"
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2389.354,2390.174,Yes.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2390.174,2395.291,-- it would be possible for him to apply for a return to the Internal Revenue Service.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.17,2446.811,I find -- I just don't agree with you.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2465.65,2487.092,"Well, if you -- if that is the position then I think that I've answered your question if there is and not enough, if we're correct with respect to the trust funds and the Government is entitled with the trust funds, if we're incorrect with respect to that and it is not in fact a trust, then the liquidation expense in the succeeding bankruptcy would come first."
1965.650,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2489.106,2489.76,"Well, the cabaret --"
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2489.76,2492.67,"But that's not what we have here if, Your Honor please."
1965.650,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2497.425,2498.602,Yes.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2498.602,2511.549,"And I suppose that it's in a deposit in drawing money, drawing interest itself which eventually will increase the amount which may be distributed to the general creditors or which may --"
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2511.549,2532.139,"What if you were a bankruptcy trustee, and that you had the basic problem of it, what is the effect to pay the tax now and perhaps run out of money before you pay the priority administrative expenses and have to rely on getting the money back to the United States.And do you think you might be subject to some surcharge yourself as trustee?"
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2532.139,2532.224,If --
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2532.224,2542.588,"If I were a creditor for other administrative expenses, I wouldn't like that much because you'd already spend my money on somebody that I have priority over."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2542.588,2556.584,"One way to -- one way to do that, of course, would be to have a condition specifically stated in the order authorizing the payment to the effect that it is paid to the Internal Revenue Service on condition that it will be returned."
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2738.866,2759.977,"Mr. Featherston, you ask me this, let's assume that in Chapter XI proceeding, the Debtor in Possession incurs an obligation for this body under an invoice that says that this is not paid when due, it will draw 6% interest and it's due 30 days after the invoice."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2794.766,2799.953,It depends upon whether he has obtained the authority of the Court to carry on the business at this time.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2799.953,2801.502,"Well, this was at Chapter XI."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2801.502,2807.239,Well he had -- if the Court outlines the circumstances in which the --
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2807.239,2807.622,Alright.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2807.622,2811.939,"And the conditions under which the Debtor in Possession may carry on his business, he's under the supervision or --"
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2811.939,2827.328,"Alright, let's just -- let's just assume that the obligations to pay that the -- the lumber -- the purchasing of the lumber was authorized, and the terms were authorized by the Court, namely, if not paid when due it would draws 6% interest?"
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2827.328,2828.814,It withdraws 6% interest.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2828.814,2830.654,Right on -- right on through the bankruptcy.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2830.654,2831.902,Yes sir.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2832.335,2833.705,"Well, you have to say that I suppose."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2833.705,2834.867,"Yes, well --"
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.867,2835.388,Don't you?
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2835.388,2836.971,I think it's undoubtedly true.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.514,2866.155,But you -- what you're really getting at is you're not -- there's no basis for distinguishing the private claim from the Government's tax claims in this regard.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2866.155,2870.918,"No sir, we're not -- we're not making any special claim whatever on behalf of the Government."
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2877.34,2884.972,What if the -- now just remember that the -- that this straight bankruptcy intervenes in this 30-day invoice.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2897.721,2901.074,"Here again, it would depend upon the terms and conditions specified on the report."
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2901.706,2912.549,"Excuse me, you can't get me this time with that because all the Court did was -- all the Court did was approve the terms of the contract which was payment 30 days hence with 6% interest afterwards."
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2912.549,2912.705,Then it --
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.705,2913.656,That's all there is.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2913.656,2916.759,Then it would be an administration expense on the Debtor in Possession.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2916.759,2918.019,That's right.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2918.019,2921.257,The liquidation expenses would come ahead of that.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2921.257,2922.747,Well I know but I just want to ask you that.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2924.912,2926.16,"Yes, I would think so."
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.16,2929.516,And then why are you getting it back in that private creditor?
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2929.516,2935.685,"Well, there are proceedings which are brought in connection with the recovery of excessive funds."
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2938.751,2945.276,Could you think the Trustee in Bankruptcy would be entitled to pay that on and would have to do these the payment and indeed they have to do these payments.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2945.276,2958.653,"Well, I think that preterm would require him to wait and see whether or not -- whether or not, there would be sufficient assets that you continue to accrue (Voice Overlap) yes sir, interest would continue to accrue."
1965.650,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2958.653,2960.04,There's really a dilemma.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2960.04,2961.456,This really is a -- really a --
1965.650,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2961.456,2962.622,It's barred.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2962.622,2963.671,This is their product.
1965.650,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2966.381,2969.166,He didn't.
1965.650,1,18920,c_moxley_featherston,,2969.166,2976.688,So it's our conclusion that the Fifth Circuit was correct in the decision which it made.
1965.650,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2976.688,2978.221,Mr. Gunn.
1965.650,2,30454,john_h_gunn,,2978.221,2981.233,"Sir, I'll be very brief."
1965.650,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3060.478,3060.652,Yes.
1965.650,2,30454,john_h_gunn,,3089.721,3090.858,"None sir, I believe --"
1965.650,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3090.858,3091.698,"You wouldn't, would you?"
1965.650,2,30454,john_h_gunn,,3091.698,3092.844,No sir.
1965.650,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3098.126,3106.713,What you've been saying is that -- or what you're really saying is that you're just not going to have chapter -- effective Chapter X and Chapter XI borrowing that for --
1965.650,2,30454,john_h_gunn,,3106.713,3109.17,"No sir, I believe it can be done in one of two ways."
1965.650,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3119.955,3123.076,But that doesn't solve the interest.
1965.650,2,30454,john_h_gunn,,3123.076,3123.627,Well sir --
1965.650,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3123.627,3125.525,Just giving collateral doesn't solve the interest.
1965.650,2,30454,john_h_gunn,,3125.525,3127.745,They will safeguard him on his principal.
1965.650,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3128.053,3129.599,"Well, it's on the list, it's on the other."
1965.650,2,30454,john_h_gunn,,3134.193,3137.799,I doubt seriously that there is an effective way to do it.
1965.650,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3155.682,3167.835,"Yes, but the court approval of a -- of any of these transactions wouldn't be an answer to you -- wouldn't give you any answer of -- that's all you have to have you move this case."
1965.650,2,30454,john_h_gunn,,3167.835,3168.961,"No sir, I don't say that."
