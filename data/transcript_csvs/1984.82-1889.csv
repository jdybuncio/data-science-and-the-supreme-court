1984.82-1889,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.857,We will hear arguments first this morning in Springfield Township School District against Knoll.
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,11.46,42.498,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case squarely presents to the Court the question whether a state statute of limitations applicable to the commencement of judicial proceedings should be disregarded in a Section 1983 suit solely on the ground that the limitation period, six months, is per se unreasonably short, and consequently inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States."
1984.82-1889,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,406.937,417.184,Does the same statute or does the same kind of a statute apply to discrimination actions against private employers?
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,417.184,418.346,"No, Your Honor."
1984.82-1889,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,431.522,433.054,Against a public employer.
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,433.054,433.943,Against a public official.
1984.82-1889,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,434.383,435.265,How about against private?
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,435.265,435.795,"No, sir."
1984.82-1889,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,435.795,442.859,What about... what is the statute of limitations if you sue a private concern for discrimination?
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,442.859,444.141,"That would be six years, Your Honor."
1984.82-1889,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,444.141,445.252,Six years.
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,448.515,450.125,"Well, I think, Your Honor, there is a--"
1984.82-1889,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,450.125,452.246,"They would be suits under the same statute, I suppose."
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,452.246,468.869,"--Well, under the... the whole statutory scheme, yes, Your Honor, but not this provision, but there is a legitimate, Your Honor, I think there is a legitimate interest that the state has in having the matter brought to light, a discrimination matter brought to light very, very quickly."
1984.82-1889,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.72,528.945,Did the court below make anything of this difference between suits against public employers and against private--
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,528.945,535.2,"Yes, Your Honor, the opinion of the court referred to it; however, it did not consider, I believe, the argument that I am making."
1984.82-1889,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,537.771,553.602,--Would it have rejected this six-month statute solely on the ground that it was so much shorter than the limitations period applicable to private employers?
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,553.602,564.298,"--It made reference to that in its opinion, Your Honor, but I believe that the appellate court just felt that a six-month period was just per se unreasonably short."
1984.82-1889,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.298,573.205,Do you think that its judgment that six months was too short was really the ground for its decision?
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,573.205,574.136,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1984.82-1889,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,579.56,580.842,Could I ask you a question?
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,580.842,581.593,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.82-1889,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,581.593,584.334,Are you familiar with the case that will be heard next?
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,584.334,585.924,"Somewhat, Your Honor."
1984.82-1889,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,585.924,597.041,"If the Court in that case should, and I am not saying it will, but if it should affirm the Tenth Circuit in that case, will it have a hearing on this one, in your opinion?"
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,597.041,620.576,"It might, Your Honor, because I believe that this Court, if it adopts the fact that the appellate court must first characterize the nature of the action, and then refer to the state statutes of limitations, it might affect the outcome of this case."
1984.82-1889,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,652.526,655.809,Let me ask you one more.
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,662.423,663.555,"Yes, Your Honor, it could."
1984.82-1889,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,663.555,673.619,"And then suppose the state court says six months is it, and the federal court in a similar case says, no, it isn't six months."
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,680.415,721.561,"I believe, Your Honor, that we could have different rules in each forum, and I believe that the first consideration that the federal court would have to make is to determine what is the analogous statute of limitations, so therefore it may very well be... as to what characterizes the type of action may very well determine whether that state statute or that state holding would be followed."
1984.82-1889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,770.025,775.148,But surely there ought to be uniformity as to a single case.
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,775.148,777.148,"Yes, if the facts are identical."
1984.82-1889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,777.889,794.358,"It seems to me that 1988 has very expansive provisions for reference to state law, but isn't the ultimate question of what is the appropriate statute of limitations nonetheless a federal one in light of... it is a construction of 1988?"
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,794.358,796.351,"I believe that is correct, Your Honor."
1984.82-1889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,796.351,812.912,So then really if a state court held contrary to... held one way as to the statute of limitations after that had gone through the state system if that question were preserved a person could seek certiorari here because that is a federal question.
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,812.912,813.883,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.82-1889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,813.883,817.826,"Counsel, does this statute apply to legislators?"
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,817.826,821.928,Legislature are public officials.
1984.82-1889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,823.818,827.06,It applies to the people who passed it?
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,827.06,827.942,"Yes, sir."
1984.82-1889,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,827.942,830.163,Now I understand.
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,830.163,857.771,"Specifically with respect to cases involving discrimination in the hiring or promotion of public employees, each day of delay in commencing suit further establishes a person who was hire or promoted in the place of a complainant in his or her position, and entitles a hired or promoted person to compensation, seniority, tenure, and due process rights."
1984.82-1889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.426,900.398,"But that would be true in the case of a private employer, too, wouldn't it?"
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,900.398,900.899,Yes.
1984.82-1889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,957.636,961.61,Do you assume a private employer has infinite resources?
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,961.61,963.38,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1984.82-1889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.38,965.052,I don't understand why that is a difference then.
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,967.263,968.303,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.82-1889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,979.321,985.566,"A private employer has to answer to his stockholders, and he has to decide what prices to charge."
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,985.944,990.058,"The private employer may only have to answer to himself, not to the public at large."
1984.82-1889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1099.669,1101.9,"--Mr. Potash, may I just ask this?"
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,1108.695,1122.593,"The effect would... Your Honor, the shorter the statute of limitations would affect have a greater curb on the perpetuation perhaps of the unlawful conduct."
1984.82-1889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1122.593,1124.964,May I ask--
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,1124.964,1125.435,However--
1984.82-1889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1125.435,1126.086,--Go ahead.
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,1126.086,1135.383,"--However, Your Honor, what I am saying, that the facts in this case, in the ordinary employment discrimination case, a six-month period is not unreasonably short."
1984.82-1889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1160.05,1160.898,I understand that.
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,1172.676,1178.21,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1984.82-1889,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1178.21,1181.923,"For administration claims, yes."
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,1181.923,1184.544,"Yes, but not for actions judicially enforceable."
1984.82-1889,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1184.544,1185.125,All right.
1984.82-1889,0,19853,charles_potash,,1185.125,1188.297,Thank you.
1984.82-1889,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1188.297,1191.019,Mr. Chanin.
1984.82-1889,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1191.019,1209.671,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, although we believe that this case can and should be decided on narrow grounds, the petitioners suggest that it implicates certain broad principles set forth by this Court in Tomanio, in Robertson, and other cases."
1984.82-1889,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1312.27,1327.028,"Mr. Chanin, are you taking the position that Pennsylvania, had the claim been filed in the Pennsylvania court, would have applied the six-month residual statute of limitations period?"
1984.82-1889,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1327.028,1328.68,"--Yes, Your Honor, Pennsylvania courts would have done that."
1984.82-1889,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1328.68,1331.633,Your argument--
1984.82-1889,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1332.224,1332.704,Six months.
1984.82-1889,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1332.704,1344.032,--in your brief in Note 9 indicated that you thought the Pennsylvania legislature never intended the six-month statute to apply.
1984.82-1889,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1344.032,1348.605,"No, Your Honor, the point we make is a little different than that."
1984.82-1889,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1409.366,1423.695,Isn't there some precedent in the state and the federal courts sitting in Pennsylvania for the proposition that it should have been treated as a breach of implied contract claim?
1984.82-1889,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1423.695,1426.045,There is such precedent for that.
1984.82-1889,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1451.222,1466.04,Do you think that the Court of Appeals below really looked into the question of what the applicable statute should be had the action been brought in Pennsylvania?
1984.82-1889,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1466.04,1468.863,"I think there was no dispute on that point, Your Honor."
1984.82-1889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1655.956,1660.687,Are you saying that latter is an impermissible judgment for the State of Pennsylvania to make?
1984.82-1889,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1660.687,1673.657,"--No, we are suggesting merely to characterize six months as atypical, unusually short, it is in any event, but when dealing with a residuary statute, it sticks out like a sore thumb."
1984.82-1889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1675.498,1681.111,Most states have residuary statutes at a different end of the time spectrum.
1984.82-1889,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,1681.111,1686.487,"Yes, my research indicates some 20 of them, and they run generally four to ten years."
1984.82-1889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2142.205,2143.264,May I interrupt you with a question?
1984.82-1889,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2172.285,2178.717,"I would make a different argument leading to the same conclusion, that it should be struck down, probably slightly more quickly than the one that is before you right now."
1984.82-1889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2182.3,2188.465,"Well, they say 1983 or claims based on the Pennsylvania constitution as well."
1984.82-1889,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2188.465,2194.418,"I would still say it should be struck down, and I would rely heavily on Burnett."
1984.82-1889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2217.095,2219.135,"And that would be even if it was, say, a year or two years?"
1984.82-1889,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2219.135,2221.406,"Well, you reach a point."
1984.82-1889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2249.574,2252.966,I am assuming a time that would not be per se unreasonably short.
1984.82-1889,1,38927,robert_h_chanin,,2268.056,2272.22,"No, I can conceive of circumstances, pursuing your hypothetical, where we would have no quarrel."
1984.82-1889,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2329.576,2333.729,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Potash?"
1984.82-1889,2,19853,charles_potash,,2333.729,2337.112,"Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, I do."
1984.82-1889,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2395.017,2398.203,"Thank you, gentlemen."
