2014.12-1226,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.004,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 121226, Young v. United Parcel Service."
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,8.187,10.789,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.12-1226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,45.879,57.187,"Well, what you make it sound as if the only condition that was not accommodated was a lifting restriction because of pregnancy, and I -- I did not understand that to be the case."
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,63.005,76.495,"Well, I so I think on the summary judgment record here, Your Honor, that the three 3 very broad classes of of limitations that UPS accommodates do at least there's a genuine issue of material fact that they cover the waterfront of everything but pregnancy."
2014.12-1226,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,84.418,84.768,I'm sorry.
2014.12-1226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,85.268,88.053,"Well, I mean, I think that's a necessary starting point for your case."
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,91.672,94.272,"--Well, I Your Honor, I would submit that that's not right."
2014.12-1226,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,120.272,133.249,"Mr. Bagenstos, what would your case be if let's accept, for argument's sake, that there's a category people who are injured off duty who do not get light work assignments."
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,140.253,141.186,--Yes.
2014.12-1226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.662,154.895,Most favored nations treatment.
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,154.895,155.595,--So--
2014.12-1226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,155.595,157.114,It doesn't have to be read that way.
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,192.052,193.054,"--No, we would not say that."
2014.12-1226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,193.054,193.27,Why not?
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,193.27,210.23,"I mean, we would we -- would not say that because our position is that the statutory text requires that employers provide workers who are disabled by pregnancy the same treatment they would receive if they themselves had a similar had a condition with a similar effect on the ability to work, but that had a different source."
2014.12-1226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,218.652,220.168,But suppose you have a--
2014.12-1226,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,220.168,221.118,Justice Breyer.
2014.12-1226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,221.118,231.293,"--Suppose -- I mean, we have a brief, as you've seen it, from the truck drivers, and -- and they say they don't give many of these benefits to anybody."
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,267.566,277.189,"So I -- I think as to that, the -- the important point is that -- that is an example of what may be an idiosyncratic decision by an employer to provide an accommodation to a particular employee."
2014.12-1226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,278.357,287.729,"Well, I don't know that it's idiosyncratic, you see, because I don't know all the workplaces, and I can imagine that employers have all kinds of different rules for different kinds of jobs."
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,303.156,304.441,--And so--
2014.12-1226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,304.441,307.793,--then do you have to give them to all pregnant women who hold different jobs?
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,316.649,317.132,--Right.
2014.12-1226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,320.618,321.167,Yes.
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,321.167,322.867,--actually contains the seeds of the answer to that.
2014.12-1226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,322.867,323.05,Exactly.
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,323.05,331.456,So -- so seems to me I might agree that an employer that provides a particularly good deal to a single nonpregnant employee doesn't set a--
2014.12-1226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,331.456,331.839,Not a single.
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,333.475,334.175,--For a small -- right.
2014.12-1226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,345.383,367.062,"I see -- I see that that now, it sound the other question I have, and it's the only other one, is it did seem to me there is a way, given your theory it's a quite easy way for you to win, and that would be to bring a disparate impact claim, and that's what I thought disparate impact claims were about."
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,367.062,368.329,--So--
2014.12-1226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,368.329,388.56,"But you didn't bring the disparate claim and, therefore, what am I to do because I don't know that you want to twist the disparate, you know, intent claim out of shape when you have such a beautiful vehicle to bring a claim of the kind you just articulated."
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,388.56,393.28,"--Well, I think the vehicle to bring the claim of the kind that I articulated is the second clause of the PDA."
2014.12-1226,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,402.82,403.57,"Well, you read that as a--"
2014.12-1226,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,403.57,404.22,Could that take--
2014.12-1226,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,404.22,407.771,"--You read that as an accommodation provision basically, and maybe -- maybe it is."
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,463.441,464.508,"No, I don't think so."
2014.12-1226,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,478.416,484.403,But why -- why doesn't that fit why doesn't that second class fit within your reading of the statutory text?
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,484.403,504.399,"Well, so because, in our -- in our view, the statutory text, by saying -- by drawing this distinction between employees affected by pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions and not so affected, saying employers can't draw that distinction, excuse me, and saying instead they look only at the ability to work, what it does is it prohibits discrimination based on the source of the disabling condition."
2014.12-1226,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,524.813,535.937,But why then I -- guess I'm not quite understanding why you pin get the source classifications into a different category from all other classifications.
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,536.987,540.072,"--Well, so, I mean, I think it -- it goes to the statutory text."
2014.12-1226,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,577.279,582.915,But I think you're reading you have admitted that other persons can't really be read literally.
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,599.191,606.631,"Because once you do that, then the second clause of the PDA doesn't occupy any space and then -- and Congress should have stopped with the first clause."
2014.12-1226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,669.62,673.489,So you do assert it's a -- it's a most favored nation provision.
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,679.993,682.528,"To any other class of employees, I think that's right."
2014.12-1226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.528,686.33,"How long -- it doesn't matter whether that class is enormous or small, right?"
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,686.33,691.384,"Well, I -- so I think this is -- this is text that obviously requires some degree of interpretation."
2014.12-1226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.659,716.682,"Does -- does the record show what you have asserted here, that the classes that are given special treatment is almost everybody?"
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,716.682,718.451,"--Well, I think that we have--"
2014.12-1226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,718.451,719.101,Does the record show that?
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,719.101,721.153,--I think -- I think the record is sufficient to show that.
2014.12-1226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,723.169,723.938,I understand.
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,723.938,724.521,Yes.
2014.12-1226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,758.176,762.23,"You can win your case with that argument, perhaps."
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,762.23,762.58,"And I hope so, yes."
2014.12-1226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,762.58,764.213,"Yes, assume that."
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,817.814,818.381,Yes.
2014.12-1226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,840.227,840.86,Most favored nation.
2014.12-1226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,849.08,854.268,"But unfortunately, it takes out of what you just said the fact that you give them to a lot of employees."
2014.12-1226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,857.736,858.069,That's right.
2014.12-1226,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,858.069,861.021,--including those who've only worked there for 4 years.
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,865.073,865.656,--I understand.
2014.12-1226,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,869.292,881.015,"--Basically what you're saying, if I understand it, is it's okay to differentiate on the basis of anything but source, which means whether it's work or non-work-related."
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,883.284,883.651,--Yes.
2014.12-1226,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,883.651,897.711,"--You're reading out of the legislative history the fact that Congress repeatedly said, we're not forcing employers to give benefits for non-work-related injuries, but we're going to write it so they have to anyway."
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,897.711,904.631,So I -- so I don't think there's any statement in the legislative history that says we're not forcing employers to give benefits for non-work-related injuries.
2014.12-1226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,910.019,910.871,I'm so relieved.
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,910.871,917.707,"That Respondent draws a negative inference from to say, obviously, Congress didn't mean to do that."
2014.12-1226,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,947.477,948.344,Certainly.
2014.12-1226,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,948.344,949.429,Thank you.
2014.12-1226,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,949.429,967.973,General Verrilli.
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,967.973,970.075,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.12-1226,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1008.284,1015.788,That wasn't the position that the government took in the U.S. Postal Service policy.
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1049.694,1051.094,"Of course, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.12-1226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1078.945,1082.414,I thought we felt that we don't give deference to the EEOC.
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1082.414,1084.766,You don't give Chevron deference to the EEOC.
2014.12-1226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1084.766,1085.366,Oh.
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1085.366,1086.766,But the government has interests--
2014.12-1226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.766,1087.818,"Oh, come on."
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1099.708,1105.11,--The EEOC sets the enforcement policy for the Federal sector with respect to this issue.
2014.12-1226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1111.516,1118.687,Would your position here be the same if the 2014 guideline had not been adopted?
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1118.687,1124.941,"We didn't take that position before the 2014 guideline had been adopted, Justice Kennedy."
2014.12-1226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1143.987,1147.522,"But we don't give you any more deference than we give the EEOC, though, right?"
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1147.522,1152.258,"Well, with respect to this, I do think that the Court's got to decide what the best reading of the statute is, that's right."
2014.12-1226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1152.258,1153.943,"What the best reading is, regardless of what you think."
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1153.943,1154.276,That's correct.
2014.12-1226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1242.734,1244.334,Would you give me your interpolation again?
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1250.171,1252.423,"""On the basis of their condition. """
2014.12-1226,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1262.563,1268.984,"Well, but you start -- you've got -- at the very beginning, you listed three things that you said were reasonable distinctions."
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1297.569,1300.02,"I'd like to make two points in response, Justice Breyer."
2014.12-1226,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1378.705,1385.792,"I would have thought it's those types of cases that present the starkest example of discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, the idiosyncratic one."
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1399.886,1419.198,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I guess what I would say about that is that you could certainly bring a McDonnell Douglas claim against an individual idiosyncratic difference, but then if the employer can show that the accommodation was granted to one not on the basis of a criterion that this sentence in the PDA would forbid, then the employer's -- then the -- then the accommodation is fine, there's no violation."
2014.12-1226,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1420.865,1430.738,"That's the -- that's -- I used the idiosyncratic example, not because I'm interested in it, because I think it illustrates something that isn't idiosyncratic."
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1472.398,1472.882,"--Yes, of course."
2014.12-1226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1525.031,1538.024,"Suppose the employer has the rule, we will, if you have a disability outside of employment, give you benefits for one month, and it applies that same policy to the to -- the pregnant woman."
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1539.308,1539.508,No.
2014.12-1226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1543.626,1543.86,But nothing less.
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1543.86,1544.476,Correct.
2014.12-1226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1545.412,1548.045,Why isn't that discrimination on the basis of--
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1548.045,1552.316,"Well, because the statute requires that people be treated the same, and so she would be."
2014.12-1226,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1556.251,1561.354,But not if there is a separate category of people who are entitled to benefits for more than one month.
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1561.354,1573.329,"--Well, the question would be whether those benefits -- whether the distinction -- whether the disentitlement of the pregnant employee was based on the source of her condition, namely, pregnancy."
2014.12-1226,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1576.781,1583.118,"Would you please answer my question, which was: Do you mean “ source ” means on the job and off the job?"
2014.12-1226,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1589.022,1589.255,Briefly.
2014.12-1226,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1589.255,1590.691,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, briefly."
2014.12-1226,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1632.101,1632.768,"Thank you, General."
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1637.253,1639.188,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1669.123,1671.54,"Well, Ms. Halligan, could we talk about the claim that she did bring?"
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1671.54,1671.909,Yes.
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1671.909,1681.281,So your reading of the statute basically makes everything after the semicolon completely superfluous.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1682.964,1683.881,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1708.681,1710.883,But that is what the first provision does.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1722.256,1730.862,"This Court explained in Newport News, as well as in CalFed, that the function of the second clause is to explain how Title VII principles apply to pregnancy."
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1734.499,1739.468,So -- so you are saying it's not doing anything new; it's only explaining the old stuff.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1741.486,1742.886,"--I'm not -- I'm not saying that, Your Honor."
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1777.09,1784.029,"I think, again, that that is not necessary, because all that the inquiry would be is were you discriminated against because you were pregnant?"
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1810.413,1815.215,"I think, to respond to the last point first and then to the first."
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1857.309,1862.879,"That seems the -- that is the question that this language raises, right?"
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1940.546,1945.781,"--I think the second clause is highly relevant to the question of comparators, but not in the way that you are suggesting."
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1964.594,1965.111,That's the first clause.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1978.485,1981.521,"--I'm not sure that you could, but that wasn't the function of the second clause."
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1982.039,1988.527,Then you are saying second clause adds nothing even though Congress said “ and ”.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1997.649,2008.523,"--I think that grammatical connector is very important in understanding how the two clauses relate, for the following reason: Petitioner's construction would read the first clause out of the statute entirely."
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2046.379,2048.165,"Ms. Halligan, what is wrong with my middle ground?"
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2073.716,2077.668,I just don't think it has any anchor in the words of the statute itself.
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2078.634,2079.702,Quite the opposite.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2107.185,2122.712,"--I think that this Court's been clear that the function of the second clause is to repudiate that logic which equates -- when you look at women and men and you have a pregnancy -- a cause -- a policy that discriminates on the basis of pregnancy, you say that is not sex discrimination."
2014.12-1226,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2144.558,2147.244,What if the language after the semicolon were not there?
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2153.5,2159.904,"--It would have overruled Gilbert by bolting pregnancy on, but Congress was--"
2014.12-1226,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2159.904,2162.17,Would it have produced a different result in Gilbert?
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2171.378,2171.612,--Right.
2014.12-1226,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2171.612,2183.535,"If you didn't have the language after the semicolon, would the language before the semicolon have required the employer to treat pregnant women the same as those who have an illness or an injury?"
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2183.535,2184.652,I'm not sure that it would have.
2014.12-1226,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2193.808,2196.243,Isn't that the reason for the language after the semicolon?
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2205.099,2222.395,"I think the language after the semicolon instructs that when you look at a policy that facially discriminates on the basis of pregnancy, what you would typically do in a sex discrimination case is to look at how women and men are treated."
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2241.456,2243.391,That's what the first clause does.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2267.273,2274.927,"--To be clear, Your Honor, the reason the second clause is there is to avoid a case in which a court uses the same reasoning and reaches a different result."
2014.12-1226,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2296.709,2303.197,But you don't know where the I -- would like just to go back on this very point to what Justice Kagan said.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2355.495,2356.562,--It does.
2014.12-1226,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2356.562,2367.684,"And so -- and so how does it and does it matter if we put it under the first socalled whatever, you know, intentional as opposed to disparate impact?"
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2374.022,2387.432,"Well, I -- I think if I can, this Court has been clear that McDonnell Douglas provides a mechanism for providing indirect evidence of disparate treatment of intentional discrimination."
2014.12-1226,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2412.899,2414.932,But why not if it goes under disparate treatment?
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2414.932,2415.465,Pardon?
2014.12-1226,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2415.465,2415.984,Why not?
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2429.675,2430.192,If--
2014.12-1226,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.192,2435.328,"And I mean, that -- that's the kind of thing that we're trying to stop in this statute."
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2442.082,2443.384,"--Two answers, Your Honor."
2014.12-1226,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2443.384,2443.751,Yes.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2443.751,2461.396,"First of all, I think that distinction between a disparate impact claim where you're looking adverse effects on a certain class of employees, but you have a facially neutral policy has been quite -- as distinct from a policy that discriminates on its face, either directly or indirectly--"
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2461.396,2462.513,"Well, Ms. Halligan, suppose this--"
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2462.513,2462.832,--that's well established.
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2462.832,2465.784,"--Suppose this, and it's exactly what Justice Breyer is talking about."
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2480.424,2480.926,Yes.
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2480.926,2482.993,--but without all the other facts of Gilbert.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2485.261,2485.611,Yes.
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2485.611,2500.621,"We're going to provide accommodations, but, of course, pregnancy is not a nonoccupational sickness and accident, so as a result of this facially neutral policy, pregnant women will not get accommodations."
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2504.592,2511.662,If -- if a policy distinguishes between occupational injuries and nonoccupational--
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2511.662,2513.764,"Yes, this is nonoccupational sickness and accident."
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2513.764,2515.214,--And that would be acceptable.
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2538.88,2559.393,"You are departing you -- are departing radically from what the Fourth Circuit view in this -- I mean, the Fourth Circuit did say, right up front, that this clause standing alone is unambiguous; if a group of employees get the benefit, if other employees get the benefit, so must pregnant women."
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2570.867,2571.567,"--Well, the first--"
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2571.567,2571.934,--that meaning.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2571.934,2581.509,"--The Fourth Circuit realized that the two clauses have to be read together, and in fact to read the second clause, as Petitioner suggests, just -- just reads the first clause out of existence."
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2607.04,2611.944,But that's where we disagree because -- because what this tells you is it tells you what the comparators are.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2637.328,2651.336,"--Because all the second clause is telling you, and -- and Congress was clear and this Court was clear that the -- that the PDA, both clauses, in its entirety, were not intended to in any way depart from traditional Title VII principles."
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2655.59,2667.198,"But we absolutely know that what Gilbert -- was said was that kind of policy was legitimate and that Congress came back and said, no, that kind of policy is illegitimate, right?"
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2667.198,2667.531,--It said two things.
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2692.113,2701.852,"But as I understand the answer to my question, and tell me if I'm wrong, is you're saying with respect to a facially neutral policy as to nonoccupational sickness and health--"
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2701.852,2702.054,--Yes.
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2702.054,2705.99,--that you think that -- that is illegal under the PDA.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2705.99,2706.29,No.
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2708.975,2709.208,I'm sorry--
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2709.208,2718.63,--that distinguishes between occupational and nonoccupational injuries and is evenly applied is absolutely permissible under the PDA.
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2718.63,2723.865,"--Even if it's -- it's exactly the policy that's in Gilbert, and you're saying that's fine?"
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2723.865,2724.098,No.
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2727.486,2727.719,It didn't.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2731.938,2732.388,The Court--
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2732.388,2735.49,"If -- if a man had a vasectomy, it got excluded in Gilbert."
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2747.548,2756.837,"--This Court and Congress clearly described the policy in Gilbert as singling out pregnancy and that's why Congress enacted the PDA, because--"
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2756.837,2761.223,"But it -- it enacted it to overturn Gilbert, everybody--"
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2761.223,2761.89,--It's holding and--
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2761.89,2764.675,"--and not just some abstract theory, but the result--"
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2764.675,2764.875,--Yes.
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2764.875,2765.575,--in Gilbert.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2773.745,2789.022,"One of -- the result that Petitioner and the government suggests, which is instead to say that you can have any distinction you want and it's permissible under the PDA except on the job versus off the job is -- is far more contorted."
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2791.891,2798.396,"Is it -- is it true essentially -- I mean, you said that -- that Young's position is most favored nation."
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2800.812,2802.248,It's -- it's not least favored nation.
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2811.154,2813.437,This -- this case went off on summary judgment--
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2813.437,2813.704,--Yes.
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2813.704,2828.949,--so the facts -- Mr. Bagenstos has told us that there is not in this record a single instance of anyone who needed a lifting dispensation who didn't get it except for pregnant people.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2828.949,2829.516,And I--
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2829.516,2833.667,"And if that's the case in fact, then you lose, don't you?"
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2833.667,2838.987,"--Well, I would like to address that because I think that's a real mischaracterization of the record in a couple of ways."
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2858.299,2867.069,But do we know in fact -- this is an allegation that in fact no one who wanted a dispensation didn't get it except pregnant women.
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2867.069,2868.585,"That is also contradicted, Your Honor."
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2868.585,2873.223,"But we have -- we're on the summary judgment stage, so we don't know what the facts are."
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2873.223,2875.456,"No, but we have to look at the uncontroverted evidence."
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2896.671,2897.721,Can you give an example then?
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2917.418,2925.172,--There's not a name provided in the record because one was not elicited by the Petitioner whose burden it was in building a prima facie case.
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2935.629,2947.621,"They -- they suffered off-the-job injuries, but we don't know if they asked for a dispensation because the off-the-job injury would require that they limit the weight that they could bear."
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2947.621,2959.079,The district court held that UPS's policy is that employees who are unable to perform the essential functions of their job would be required to take leave if their inability stemmed from something off the job.
2014.12-1226,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2973.754,2994.602,"I assume that you disagree with the Petitioner -- the Petitioner's proposition that when you take these three classes, namely, off the job -- I'm sorry, on-the-job injuries, ADA injuries, and the -- what was the third one?"
2014.12-1226,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2994.602,2995.435,Traffic certificates.
2014.12-1226,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2995.435,3000.239,"Yes, yes, getting disapproved as drivers by DOT."
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3004.091,3010.111,We absolutely disagree with that and there is nothing in the record which suggests that.
2014.12-1226,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3038.711,3042.146,So why shouldn't there be a trial on that or further proceedings?
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3065.196,3071.25,"First of all, Your Honor, that would be relevant to a disparate impact claim which the Petitioner did not bring."
2014.12-1226,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3095.298,3096.467,Is there really a dispute about this?
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3115.744,3124.384,There's no dispute at all and the District Court made a square finding exactly to that effect at page 56A and page 35A.
2014.12-1226,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3142.596,3149.602,I -- I -- but there are individuals who are injured off the job who lose their DOT licenses?
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3149.602,3159.057,"--There are individuals who lose their DOT certification and pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, they are accommodated for some period of time."
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3232.522,3233.706,The original -- the--
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3251.75,3254.435,"--'79 guidelines, the '79 53 guidelines simply mimic the language of the statute."
2014.12-1226,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3312.558,3317.694,"Well, Ms. Halligan, for the democratic process to work as it should, the PDA has to be given a fair reading."
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3354.735,3359.188,I'm not saying that the employer isn't subject to a suit under McDonnell Douglas.
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3368.81,3381.118,"--So essentially it says any group that doesn't get the benefit, a group that is nonpregnant, then pregnant people are any group at all?"

2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3390.324,3391.51,What category of employees?
2014.12-1226,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3391.51,3397.229,"--The policy that's at issue here, Justice Ginsburg, distinguishes on-the-job versus off-the-job injuries."
2014.12-1226,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3407.685,3410.22,Singling out is in the first -- is what the first--

2014.12-1226,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3483.732,3495.723,You really think that you could prove at trial that if somebody is injured in a recreational activity over the weekend that they get light duty but a pregnant women does not maybe?
2014.12-1226,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3495.723,3503.312,"So if someone is injured over the weekend in a way that leads them to be DOT decertified, yes, and in fact, the UPS manager so testified about his sports injury."
2014.12-1226,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3592.55,3594.467,Actually I think the reverse.
2014.12-1226,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3617.598,3622.586,"--Well, I think, Justice Sotomayor, the first clause says you don't worry about whether they're the same sex or not."
2014.12-1226,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3623.502,3627.121,"No, you do have to worry about it because it still has to be sex discrimination."
2014.12-1226,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3627.121,3627.354,"--Well, no."
