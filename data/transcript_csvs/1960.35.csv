1960.35,0,42990,thomas_f_mount,,32.055,37.466,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1960.35,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,296.354,297.671,(Inaudible)
1960.35,0,42990,thomas_f_mount,,297.671,298.006,"Yes, sir."
1960.35,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,298.006,302.166,"(Inaudible) unloading, who control that matter?"
1960.35,0,42990,thomas_f_mount,,302.166,303.168,The stevedore.
1960.35,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,303.168,304.084,The stevedore.
1960.35,0,42990,thomas_f_mount,,304.084,308.793,"Yes, sir."
1960.35,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,543.174,550.335,That was the Court of Appeals by petition (Inaudible)
1960.35,0,42990,thomas_f_mount,,550.335,551.716,I -- I think the --
1960.35,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,551.716,553.34,(Inaudible)
1960.35,0,42990,thomas_f_mount,,553.34,556.476,"Well, Judge Forman wasn't on it the first time."
1960.35,2,42990,thomas_f_mount,,772.112,772.847,"Oh, there is."
1960.35,4,42990,thomas_f_mount,,774.26,792.208,"-- the stevedore and consignee and we say that under -- under Crumady and Fisser, that we and the third-party beneficiary of that contract because it was -- the part of that contract that the stevedore gained his employment, came aboard on the vessel, made his money, used our equipment and --"
1960.35,4,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,792.208,802.512,I wonder if that's open to you having stipulated that there is no contractual relation between these parties.
1960.35,4,42990,thomas_f_mount,,802.512,804.109,"No, if the Court please."
1960.35,4,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,824.807,828.248,And you regard that as still open under this stipulation.
1960.35,4,42990,thomas_f_mount,,828.248,828.784,"Yes, sir."
1960.35,6,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1083.581,1085.591,"I thought so, sir."
1960.35,8,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1257.336,1261.132,"Yes, and I can't see no difference in this case."
1960.35,10,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1348.992,1352.227,"Yes, I didn't hear it just that way before but I think its --"
1960.35,12,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1353.317,1353.88,-- rather well court --
1960.35,14,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1358.796,1361.505,That's right and so it is with the third-party --
1960.35,16,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1368.123,1368.542,"No, sir."
1960.35,18,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1373.085,1374.299,-- pointed out before.
1960.35,20,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1383.552,1384.852,"Well, I don't think so, sir."
1960.35,22,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1408.55,1408.554,That's right.
1960.35,24,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1409.715,1410.346,I think that's the --
1960.35,26,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1411.744,1427.194,"That's theory of the thing but you -- you get at it on a basis of the fact that here, you got a ship which is what we might call very tender when it comes to beings -- casted damages."
1960.35,28,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1481.475,1481.715,I agree with you.
1960.35,30,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1487.311,1487.791,"Yes, sir."
1960.35,32,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1493.717,1494.784,"I quite agree, sir."
1960.35,34,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1506.153,1507.231,That's very -- it sounds very good.
1960.35,36,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1511.493,1512.644,It hasn't.
1960.35,36,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1512.644,1525.813,"Mr. Mount, Justice Frankfurter's question was on the basis that the negligence was all of the stevedores and that the shipowner is innocent."
1960.35,36,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1528.495,1530.372,"I -- no, no for that sir."
1960.35,36,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1530.372,1530.775,Beg your pardon.
1960.35,36,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1530.775,1533.271,No -- are you asking me a question about the record?
1960.35,36,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1533.271,1533.923,Yes.
1960.35,36,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1533.923,1535.676,"Oh, no."
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1554.79,1576.429,"And the -- there is on the testimony in the record to the effect that the stevedore were -- was performing his work, did it in such a -- a challenge in such a matter that it was unsafe to do it in the way he did it so that he left his -- all the cargo without protection, his good fault on his men."
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1611.556,1629.908,"Well, if there -- if -- if there is no contract between these two and they're both guilty of negligence, wouldn't -- wouldn't this just be enforcing the contribution from (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1629.908,1632.662,You -- nothing but that fault situation because I say --
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1632.662,1633.02,But how --
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1633.02,1635.987,-- we do have a relationship between the banks.
1960.35,38,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1667.957,1668.574,Is that --
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1668.574,1674.106,"Well, I don't think you quite get my point."
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1674.106,1675.566,"Well, I'm afraid, sir, I did not."
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1675.566,1678.549,"-- well, this -- this is the -- this is what I had in mind."
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1739.456,1742.903,I say that they are not just joint tortfeasors.
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1750.823,1753.25,But there was a contractual relationship --
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1753.25,1753.775,"Not in this case, sir."
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1753.775,1758.497,"-- between -- between the stevedore, in Ryan, there was a contractual --"
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1758.497,1758.685,In Ryan --
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1758.685,1759.074,-- between --
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1759.074,1759.725,but not in Fisser.
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1759.725,1761.313,-- the stevedore.
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1761.313,1765.846,Not in Fisser.
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1765.909,1766.236,Now --
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1766.236,1766.35,-- went --
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1766.35,1766.398,-- who is --
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1766.398,1769.639,-- into the Fisser case much further than you'd gone in any other case.
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1769.639,1772.175,"Yes, I -- I know that."
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1774.118,1783.11,"Contract was where an agent of the charterer, not the owner, agent of the charterer with the stevedore."
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1783.11,1791.855,"Yes, but the -- the charterer has a contractual relationship to the owner."
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1791.855,1793.436,So he might have.
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1793.436,1793.439,Yes --
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1793.439,1793.822,But still --
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1793.822,1793.954,in this case --
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1793.954,1795.501,-- it doesn't make any contract between the owner --
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1795.501,1795.832,Yes.
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1795.832,1798.448,-- and the stevedore.
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1798.448,1800.293,"Well, I -- I merely asked a question."
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1800.61,1801.657,"Yes, well, I think, Your Honor --"
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1801.657,1802.394,-- I don't have any -- I don't have any --
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1802.394,1803.023,-- that -- that thing has been --
1960.35,38,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1803.023,1803.471,-- firm belief on it.
1960.35,38,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1803.471,1803.92,-- posed.
1960.35,40,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1816.468,1818.454,-- fall on Halcyon and Haenn case.
1960.35,42,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1830.093,1832.056,Just liability without fault.
1960.35,44,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1833.978,1834.545,"Yes, sir."
1960.35,46,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1838.363,1838.972,Right.
1960.35,48,42990,thomas_f_mount,,1855.729,1857.526,"I think so, sir."
1960.35,48,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1861.867,1872.487,Mr. Beechwood.
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,1872.487,1877.532,"Mr Chief Justice, Mr. Justices."
1960.35,49,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2027.097,2033.21,"And that was directed, as I understand it, to dealings with contractual indemnity."
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,2033.21,2038.0,That's right.
1960.35,49,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2632.144,2645.481,"Mr. Beechwood, before you get away from that, would you mind stating for me just the difference in the degree of responsibility of the shipowner in this case and in the Ryan case."
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,2649.996,2650.95,That's right.
1960.35,49,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2650.95,2657.77,"Now, where -- where -- I -- where in this difference in responsibility between the two shipowners?"
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,2657.77,2659.58,"In my opinion, there is no difference."
1960.35,49,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2659.58,2660.595,No.
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,2663.181,2665.395,"No, my opinion is there is no difference."
1960.35,49,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2674.869,2676.864,Yes.
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,2676.864,2685.248,"In the Ryan case, the stevedore was both a stevedore at the port of loading and the port of discharge."
1960.35,49,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2685.248,2685.809,Go on.
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,2686.998,2703.833,"So that in this case, this ship is just as responsible with that improper stow as was Ryan because the ship itself was the one who hired that stevedore."
1960.35,49,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2938.852,2946.993,"Even if subject to that construction, Mr. Beechwood, do you read the opinion as proceeding on that too?"
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,2946.993,2954.945,I proceed -- I read the opinion as proceeding on an entirely erroneous theory.
1960.35,49,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2954.945,2973.553,One more question about this issue.Do you argue here that the Court did not find -- the Court did find some negligence on the part of the ship in this stow as in Ryan?
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,2973.553,2976.112,You mean in the -- in our present case?
1960.35,49,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2976.112,2976.998,"Yes, this case."
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,2976.998,2986.715,"Oh, yes, because the Court said twice in its opinion, once from Judge Maris' proceeding and it was 7 -- Section 1."
1960.35,49,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2999.799,3005.479,The trial court said on page 14 in sustaining the motion for the court to act further --
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,3005.479,3007.115,The trial court --
1960.35,49,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3007.115,3011.832,-- that there was no negligence on the part of the ship and that was not the theory of his action.
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,3023.253,3041.663,"If it was a sole negligence of the stevedore and this was not a piece of equipment at all, nothing that we were doing or using for the ship, it was been a pure volunteer and they wouldn't have failed."
1960.35,49,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3046.567,3058.017,"Well, wouldn't they have had to pay under the theory of Hawn, Sieracki, two persons who enjoyed both shore-based employees, enjoyed the rights of seamen?"
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,3058.017,3058.209,No.
1960.35,49,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3058.244,3058.701,And wouldn't the ship be liable simply --
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,3058.701,3059.832,-- you entirely.
1960.35,49,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3059.832,3061.192,-- because it was a ship?
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,3061.192,3068.706,I disagree with you entirely because the record says that if the ship -- the stevedore is solely responsible.
1960.35,49,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3112.704,3114.753,"Mr. Beechwood, before you proceed."
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,3126.174,3128.455,In the Crumady case?
1960.35,49,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3128.455,3130.704,You told us that the actual record in the Crumady case.
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,3131.654,3132.354,I did.
1960.35,49,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3132.354,3132.65,-- it showed that there was a --
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,3132.65,3135.204,I held in Crumady you have to -- Crumady record right in my hands on page --
1960.35,49,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3135.204,3136.011,Yes.
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,3136.423,3137.208,-- 97.
1960.35,49,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3137.208,3139.625,Can you give us either the page in the record or is there a reference in your brief?
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,3139.625,3141.611,"Page 97, the Crumady record."
1960.35,49,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3141.611,3142.186,"Alright, thank you."
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,3142.186,3144.688,"Now, that's the beginning of it."
1960.35,49,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3223.853,3224.711,"No, no, sir."
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,3228.105,3230.797,Thank you.
1960.35,49,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3232.204,3235.424,"There'll be a white light, five minutes before your time is up."
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,3235.424,3237.518,Thank you.
1960.35,49,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3382.788,3385.496,I don't believe I can get quote on that first.
1960.35,49,24930,george_e_beechwood,,3391.439,3414.992,"Well, they ruled against you but, Mr. Justice Black, since that time in the Crumady case to the Justice that is Justice Harlan and then Justice Frankfurter, in the Crumady case in the dissent, that's what the Crumady case did not hold."
1960.35,51,24930,george_e_beechwood,,3433.832,3460.582,"I -- I deduce that the majority opinion in the Ryan case held that there could be no recovery unless there was a contractual relationship and that recovery had to be based upon that contractual relationship, otherwise, it violated the exclusive provisions of the Longshoreman's Act which says no recovery, just as what."
1960.35,51,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3867.103,3875.068,"Gentlemen, it is so close to our German time but I think we will not start the -- the next case this time."
