1979.79-5601,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,50.101,We will hear arguments next in Gomez v. Toledo.
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,55.211,58.837,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-5601,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,81.375,85.046,"Mr. Avery, I wonder if I could ask you a question at the threshold."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,93.754,102.452,"I don't believe that has been decided by this Court, Mr. Justice Brennan, but the First Circuit has decided that on a number of occasions."
1979.79-5601,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,102.452,104.597,But has the issue ever been before this Court?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,104.597,105.883,Not to my knowledge.
1979.79-5601,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,105.883,113.98,"I take it that it is the kind of issue that we can take cognizance of, isn't it?"
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,116.75,119.446,It is a basic jurisdictional issue.
1979.79-5601,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,123.008,123.649,I appreciate that.
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,123.649,128.496,And I know of no argument that has been presented --
1979.79-5601,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,128.496,134.074,"Well, what has been the rationale of the First Circuit, to suggest that it is a State."
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,134.074,144.433,"As you are aware, this Court has held that the District of Columbia is not a State for purposes of 1983."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,149.764,154.305,It is not a territory in a strict constitutional sense but it has been treated as such by the First Circuit.
1979.79-5601,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,160.343,166.171,"Well, that isn't a constitutional matter though, is it?"
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,174.916,179.481,"That would be our position with regard to the application of 1983, yes, sir."
1979.79-5601,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,179.481,189.64,What has the First Circuit said is the basis for a conclusion that actions against Puerto Rican officials lie under 1983?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,189.64,204.799,"As I recall -- and you do catch me somewhat off guard, Mr. Justice Brennan -- the argument that has been made in this case is that the Constitution must have meaning within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico since it is under our jurisdiction."
1979.79-5601,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,208.435,213.176,"We said that in the Fourth Amendment case, didn't we?"
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,213.176,214.118,That may very well be.
1979.79-5601,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,214.118,217.827,"Not that it is a State, but that the Constitution is applicable."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,217.827,247.251,"But didn't we also say in the opinion written for the Court by Mr. Justice Brennan covering the District of Columbia that Congress enacted 1983 because it thought that State legislatures would be considerably less receptive to Federal constitutional rights than Congress itself and that since Congress itself legislated for the District of Columbia, the District of Columbia was not a State for purposes of 1983."
1979.79-5601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.267,258.985,"Well, it certainly passed the Organic Act."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,258.985,266.838,"Yes, but the laws that govern the people of Puerto Rico on a day to day basis are passed by the Puerto Rifo legislature in Puerto Rico."
1979.79-5601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,273.133,298.036,"Well, would you say then that the Home Rule Act enacted by Congress for the District of Columbia several years ago made our earlier decision saving 1983 was not applicable to the District out of date because now the City Council of the District of Columbia is the one that enacts the laws which govern the citizens of the District of Columbia?"
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,298.036,300.99,"Well, that might be a possible argument, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.79-5601,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,334.1,347.632,"Because there is a difference in the status of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, they aren't going to stand for it, are they?"
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,347.632,350.839,"Well, I accept your statement that they are not, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1979.79-5601,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,354.47,355.492,That is what I thought.
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,355.492,359.317,-- does have a unique relationship with the United States.
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,372.553,383.039,Have there been any rulings with respect to 1981 or 1982 about Puerto Rico?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,383.039,386.075,I know of no 1981 and 1982 cases.
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,475.16,478.593,Do you think all matters of immunity are?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,478.593,479.582,I think --
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,479.582,484.011,"What about absolute immunity for -- legislative immunity, for example?"
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,484.011,486.9,This Court has treated absolute immunity as a defense.
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,496.595,503.272,"Just to plead the immunity, to establish that what was going on there was legislative."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,503.272,504.677,"Yes, that is correct."
1979.79-5601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,518.347,535.282,"What about Eastland v. Servicemen's Fund decided three or four years ago, wasn't there some statement in there that a mere letter from the defendant stating that he was a member of Congress was all that was required, no pleading at all?"
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,535.282,546.116,"I don't know, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but in other absolute immunity cases rather more than that has been required of the defendants."
1979.79-5601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,555.715,557.858,"You still have to say, I object."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,557.858,558.707,Yes.
1979.79-5601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,571.673,582.707,What if the plaintiff alleges in his complaint that the defendant is a judge and that it is clear from the allegations in the complaint that the judge was acting in his judicial capacity?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,582.707,585.955,I think the judge would be entitled to win on a motion to dismiss in that case.
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,585.955,588.697,For failure to take a cause of action?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,588.697,596.231,"No, because the immunity would be clear on the fact of the pleadings and the complaint in that sense would not state a claim for relief."
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,596.231,609.988,"Well, Tenney v. Brandhove this Court reinstated a District Court dismissal of an action where the Court of Appeals had ruled that they had stated a cause of action."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,620.756,629.329,"Well, I think the plaintiff states a cause of action when he alleges his constitutional rights have been violated and that they have been violated under color of law."
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.443,650.581,"Well, you don't need to argue about absolute immunity."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,650.581,653.079,"No, I do not."
1979.79-5601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,694.29,700.429,That doesn't necessarily follow because you have to plead it that you have to prove it?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,700.429,702.599,That doesn't necessarily follow under the Federal --
1979.79-5601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,702.599,708.224,So what case do you have that the defendant not only must plead but prove it?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,708.224,716.851,This Court has not addressed the question of who has the ultimate burden of proof with regard to the qualified immunity matters.
1979.79-5601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,736.757,738.545,Some decided the other way?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,738.545,750.721,There is only one case I know of outside the First Circuit and that is Cruz v. Beto in the Fifth Circuit where they held that the director of a State-wide prison system did not have that burden and in that case the plaintiff had the burden.
1979.79-5601,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,750.721,751.797,He had to plead it?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,751.797,755.791,He had to raise it --
1979.79-5601,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,755.791,764.101,He had to pose a defense but it is like an insanity defense in some jurisdictions.
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,766.416,774.398,"I don't know if that is an exact analogy, because the Fifth Circuit decision isn't so clear, actually, about the relationship between the pleading requirement and the proof requirement."
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.133,916.295,To you think the burden matter is even here?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,916.295,917.222,Do you think the --
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.222,920.529,Do you think the burden issue is here?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,920.529,927.907,"Yes, I do think it is here, because it seems to me what the District Court and what the First Circuit decided was that --"
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,927.907,930.46,"Well, wasn't the complaint dismissed?"
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,930.46,931.613,"The complaint was dismissed, yes."
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,931.613,933.021,On what -- motion?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,933.021,937.405,It was dismissed on motion but the District Court really sua sponte raised this issue.
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,937.405,946.016,"Well, I know but it wasn't even pleaded."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,949.79,952.398,The dismissal was for failure to plead.
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,952.398,954.791,It couldn't have been for failure to prove.
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,954.791,955.817,That is correct.
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,955.817,958.898,So and neither could the First Circuit.
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,960.79,962.135,As to burden of proof?
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,969.165,980.381,"Well, you certainly would seem to argue and assert that is your position, anyway."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,980.381,982.009,That would be my position.
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.009,983.835,"It is your position in your brief, isn't it?"
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,983.835,995.087,"Yes, it is our position in our brief but we do state in the brief that we think it would be a mistake for the Court in this case to announce a flat rule covering all 1983 cases as to the allocation of that burden."
1979.79-5601,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1001.648,1004.771,Why get to the burden at all?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1004.771,1005.641,The burden of proof?
1979.79-5601,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1005.641,1006.12,Yes.
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1006.12,1007.747,I don't think the Court does need to get to the burden of proof.
1979.79-5601,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1007.747,1012.994,"Well, then you are using the term ""burden"" in two different senses, at least for my ear."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1012.994,1015.813,Let me apologize for my lack of clarity but --
1979.79-5601,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1015.813,1017.684,Pleading is the only thing that is here.
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1017.684,1019.986,This is a case about the burden of pleading.
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1022.021,1030.944,"Isn't it also true that if the Court should ultimately decide that the burden of proof was on the defendant, then necessarily the burden of pleading would fall a fortiori."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1030.944,1031.497,That is correct.
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1031.497,1038.944,So to the extent that you make an argument favoring placing the burden of proof there you are supporting an argument in favor of placing the burden of pleading there as well.
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1038.944,1040.026,That is correct.
1979.79-5601,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1043.622,1046.684,"But the converse of that is not true, necessarily?"
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1046.684,1048.348,That is correct also.
1979.79-5601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.872,1155.36,Unless some element happens to be independently an element of a constitutional violation?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1155.36,1155.89,That is correct.
1979.79-5601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1160.012,1175.322,"In New York Times v. Sullivan, as I understand it, the requirement of intent to defame or actual malice is a burden on the plaintiff as a matter of constitutional law."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1175.322,1180.149,"In pleading a defamation case such as The New York Times v. Sullivan, that is correct."
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1212.644,1214.347,And in a racial discrimination case.
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1214.347,1218.897,And in a Fourteenth Amendment racial discrimination case invidious discrimination is required.
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.897,1220.206,Intentionally.
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1220.206,1225.219,"And intent, and in an Eighth Amendment case some deliberate indifference is required."
1979.79-5601,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1301.891,1309.095,And you say that is pleading merely the ultimate facts?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1309.095,1336.186,"Well, I say that those are the elements of those two constitutional violations, that the -- with regard to the First Amendment issue I think that he has to fairly put the defendant on notice that he is claiming that he was fired because of the content of his speech and I think with regard to the procedural due process issue he does have to plead that he lost his job and that he lost it without a hearing."
1979.79-5601,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1343.654,1353.423,"Mr. Avery, I think before you sit down, perhaps I should have looked at 1983 before I asked you the question I did whether Puerto Rico is a State, the statute reads."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1367.12,1369.809,"Oh yes, if Puerto Rico is considered a Territory it --"
1979.79-5601,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1369.809,1369.91,"Well, all right, then."
1979.79-5601,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1369.91,1373.002,It is just a question of whether or not Puerto Rico is a Territory.
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1373.002,1375.705,I thought that was what Mr. Justice Brennan's question was addressed to.
1979.79-5601,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1375.705,1376.845,All right.
1979.79-5601,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1376.845,1382.784,"It is a Commonwealth, it is a Commonwealth by congressional legislation."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1382.784,1389.436,"Correct as I say, and I am repeating myself, it has been treated as a Territory for the purposes --"
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1389.436,1393.709,"Incidentally, it has been a Commonwealth for not that many years, has it?"
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1393.709,1399.417,"The Commonwealth status, if I am not wrong, is in the late 'Fifties or early 'Sixties."
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.417,1404.34,1983 would apply if it were a Territory or if it were a State?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1404.34,1405.391,Yes.
1979.79-5601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.391,1415.011,"And the Court of Appeals of the First Circuit says, well, whatever it is, it is somewhere between the two."
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1415.011,1415.781,"Yes, that is correct."
1979.79-5601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1417.275,1422.025,What was it before it was a Commonwealth?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1422.025,1423.33,"It was, I believe, a Territory."
1979.79-5601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1423.33,1424.233,A Territory?
1979.79-5601,0,35373,michael_avery,,1424.233,1427.798,Yes.
1979.79-5601,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1430.85,1435.628,Very well.
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,1437.68,1441.74,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-5601,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1458.147,1467.193,"Are you familiar with any cases that have addressed directly the question whether Puerto Rico comes within 1983, and why?"
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,1467.193,1470.79,"No, sir."
1979.79-5601,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1615.23,1625.042,How does this bear on the holding of the First Circuit with reference to the pleading question here?
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,1625.042,1631.939,"Well, it has been said here that his right of freedom of speech had been violated."
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1887.142,1890.602,Are you suggesting absolute immunity?
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,1890.602,1893.144,It is a qualified immunity.
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1893.144,1903.887,"Well, how is the party under 1983 to know what immunity there is?"
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,1903.887,1905.442,Because of the very position.
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1905.442,1911.165,"Well, how would you allege it you are a lawyer, how would you allege if you want others --"
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,1911.165,1928.424,I would have claimed that regardless of defendant being a police officer the immunity did not apply to him because he had acted in bad faith.
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1928.424,1934.92,"Well, what other defense would have to take care of in your original pleading?"
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,1940.544,1946.105,I think this is main point on which the defense rests.
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1952.214,1958.003,Suppose you put in a provision that says a defendant has no valid defense.
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,1962.579,1965.451,I would say that this is a very valid defense.
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1965.451,1977.207,"I said if the moving party says and the defendant herein has no valid defense, would that be enough?"
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,1977.207,1979.523,"No, I would not say so."
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1983.554,1985.28,"He would have to be very particular, wouldn't be?"
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,1985.28,1985.62,Yes.
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1988.36,1993.335,He would have to be very specific about something he didn't know anything about.
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,1993.335,1993.958,Well --
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1993.958,2002.195,Is he obliged to know the immunity or lack of immunity that the police officer has?
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,2002.195,2011.429,"I think he should know about it, since he is actually pleading that it was implied in the allegations."
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2011.429,2013.813,What was implied?
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,2013.813,2030.228,"Before the Court of Appeals it was argued that though they had not pleaded bad faith in those many words, it was actually implied in the allegations."
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2030.228,2044.778,"Do you mean that the only way a police officer can be held liable under 1983 is on proof of bad faith, affirmative proof of bad faith?"
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,2044.778,2046.145,That is correct.
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2046.145,2047.384,That is your position?
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,2047.384,2048.324,That is my position.
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2055.108,2058.98,Why plead it if you don't have to prove it?
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,2058.98,2064.246,"Well, why crossing the bridge before you get to the river?"
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2073.915,2077.255,But what you want to do is go to the other side of the river.
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,2087.04,2088.838,I would --
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2088.838,2090.179,There is just one defense.
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,2090.179,2099.136,I would ask from him to anticipate and at least give notice of what he intends to say.
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2104.334,2106.937,Do you have discovery in Puerto Rico?
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,2106.937,2107.653,"Yes, we do."
1979.79-5601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2107.653,2108.334,I assumed so.
1979.79-5601,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2109.929,2120.154,"Supposing you had a complaint in which there were two defendants, one a municipality and the other the chief of police."
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,2131.54,2139.731,"Well, your very case of Owen v. The City of Independence, Missouri covers that adequately."
1979.79-5601,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2153.609,2159.204,But you would agree that under Owen there would be no necessity of pleading bad faith against the municipality?
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,2159.204,2160.195,Yes.
1979.79-5601,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2160.195,2164.779,And you would say there is an additional element in the cause of action against the individual?
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,2164.779,2167.301,"Affirmative, yes."
1979.79-5601,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2227.472,2232.896,"Counsel, is that so clear that it could be decided on the complaint in this case?"
1979.79-5601,1,23523,federico_cedo_alzamora,,2232.896,2255.504,"It was definitely clear because Act 26 of 1974 on which the claim was based does not provide for the celebration of an evidentiary trial-type, formal administrative hearing."
1979.79-5601,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2326.959,2328.844,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Avery?"
1979.79-5601,2,35373,michael_avery,,2328.844,2331.192,"Just two points, if Your Honor please."
1979.79-5601,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2373.977,2383.594,"I don't have it in front of me right now, but isn't there something in the complaint itself about the conducting of a hearing?"
1979.79-5601,2,35373,michael_avery,,2383.594,2389.884,The complaint alleges that the plaintiff was entitled to a hearing under the Puerto Rico Police Act of 1974.
1979.79-5601,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2389.884,2394.273,"But doesn't it also say he got one but it was defective, or --"
1979.79-5601,2,35373,michael_avery,,2394.273,2396.427,"No, he didn't get a hearing, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.79-5601,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2422.881,2427.681,The affirmative allegation is that his discharge was without prior hearing.
1979.79-5601,2,35373,michael_avery,,2427.681,2428.506,That is correct.
1979.79-5601,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2456.822,2457.549,"Thank you, gentlemen."
