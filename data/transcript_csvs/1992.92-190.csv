1992.92-190,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.939,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-190, the United States v. Idaho on the relation of the Director of the Idaho Department of Water Resource."
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,56.968,60.791,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-190,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,179.509,187.886,"Well, Mr. Minear, the last sentence, the proviso, says no judgment for costs shall be entered against the United in such a suit."
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,200.335,203.978,They certainly serve the very same function as a judgment for cost.
1992.92-190,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.881,232.241,I found troublesome the Government's argument that the United States isn't bound by any procedural requirements of the State in which the water litigation is conducted.
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,232.241,233.763,"Well, with all respect, Your Honor--"
1992.92-190,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.763,235.405,That strikes me as pretty broad.
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,235.405,236.496,--That is... that is not our position.
1992.92-190,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.397,256.815,I mean there may be time limits for filing certain things and a whole array of State procedural requirements.
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,256.815,257.512,That is correct.
1992.92-190,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,257.692,263.647,"And if the United States isn't bound by any of those, I don't see how the litigation could proceed."
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,263.647,271.604,"--Well, our position is that... we think that the McCarran Amendment does not expressly address this issue, but we think that the United States is bound by reasonable procedures."
1992.92-190,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,297.523,307.578,"But I think... I think you could say that in granting the waiver, it was assumed that the procedures, if not for the sake of the United States at least for the... for the sake of other people, would comply with due process of law."
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,307.578,309.11,--And that's... and that is my point.
1992.92-190,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,309.11,313.172,"So do you have some other example that would prove your point, because I don't find that one a persuasive one?"
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,313.172,316.574,"Excuse me, I'm not sure... other examples of a--"
1992.92-190,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,316.574,335.537,"No, I'm saying since... since I am sure that the... that the McCarran provision assumed that any procedures would comply with... with the requirements of due process, I don't think that this example that you give proves that... that the McCarran Act was not meant to subject the Government to procedures."
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,335.537,340.903,"--And, again, I think that there's nothing that the... in the McCarran Amendment that addresses State procedures specifically."
1992.92-190,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,340.903,341.123,Right.
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,341.123,356.815,"And, again, we're talking about the implications and not... my point is simply that the United States still has the right to raise objections to procedures that are either unfair, which, I think, is the point that you're making in terms of them being... not comporting with due process, or also procedures that are directly hostile to Federal interests."
1992.92-190,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.882,370.304,"Sure, but not on the basis of sovereign immunity."
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,377.04,378.549,"That's correct, that's correct."
1992.92-190,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,378.549,378.74,Okay.
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,388.437,390.147,That... that is correct.
1992.92-190,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,394.2,394.741,Yes.
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,407.199,413.992,The question with respect to the United States is whether Congress has waived its historic immunity from those types of assessments.
1992.92-190,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,413.992,414.463,And do--
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,414.463,416.025,And we... and our answer is it has not.
1992.92-190,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.737,438.1,--You don't think there's any subsidiary waiver involved when it... when it talks about being joined in a proceeding.
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,438.1,441.471,Not with respect to... to fees and costs.
1992.92-190,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,448.345,456.182,"Well, but then why does Congress say at the end of this that it shall not be liable for costs, if it wouldn't have been without the provision?"
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,456.182,465.609,"For the very reason that it... that the provision was attached to the third provision, the so-called judgment provision, which subjects the United States to the judgments of the State court."
1992.92-190,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,476.134,511.137,"Well, Mr. Minear, the... the statute permits the United States to be joined, but what that means is that the... that there can be a general adjudication of a... of water rights in the basin, but only... and what it means is that if the United States wants to get water rights, they not only are joined but if they did not come in and file a claim, they would have no water rights."
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,511.137,511.998,--That is correct.
1992.92-190,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,511.998,523.214,And so it... you... the United States conceded that it would have to to make a valid water right claim in the State of Idaho.
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,523.214,524.456,It would have to.
1992.92-190,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,526.407,526.617,Exactly.
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,527.999,529.439,"Yes, that is correct."
1992.92-190,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,529.439,538.435,And you don't think that subsumes compliance with some rules about how you file a claim.
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,538.435,542.178,We believe it does not subsume compliance with filing fees.
1992.92-190,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.421,546.662,"Well, what if it had been a $5 fee?"
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,546.662,551.354,"If it had been a $5 fee, in all likelihood we would not have challenged it because it's a de minimis amount."
1992.92-190,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,551.354,551.554,"Well, why not?"
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,551.554,559.17,"And because it... the law does not concern itself with trifles, as the Court said in Weltover last year, that de minimis not curat lex."
1992.92-190,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,559.17,559.41,"Well, but--"
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,559.41,559.871,We simply would not--
1992.92-190,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,559.871,564.915,--The United States is not being subject to filing fees that are different from other parties.
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,564.915,567.268,--I think that in terms of types of claims--
1992.92-190,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.268,567.448,Is it or not?
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,567.448,568.089,--In terms--
1992.92-190,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,568.089,568.42,Yes or no?
1992.92-190,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,568.42,576.535,--That it does not discriminate directly against the United States with respect to the claims made by the United States.
1992.92-190,1,19995,clive_j_strong,,1290.149,1296.393,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-190,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3054.342,3054.532,"Yes, Your Honor."
