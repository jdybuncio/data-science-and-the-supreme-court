2008.08-479,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.754,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-479, Safford Unifed School District v. Redding."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,7.67,20.828,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: The search of Savana Redding in this case was constitutional because Mr. Wilson had reason to suspect that she possessed contraband which posed a health and safety risk."
2008.08-479,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,27.417,34.754,"Any place, even though he had perhaps no reasonable suspicion to suspect that she was hiding the contraband in her underwear?"
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,34.754,45.712,"Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, as long as he had reason to suspect, which we believe the evidence does show, he was entitled to search any place where the contraband might be reasonably hidden."
2008.08-479,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,45.712,46.545,Any place?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,53.966,54.851,"No, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,76.731,81.235,But I -- I think you're really caught in -- in a dilemma here.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,87.556,88.822,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,88.822,94.46,But people have been known to secrete contraband in -- in bodily cavities.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,106.334,120.677,"The principle is, Your Honor, is that the common experience with schoolchildren, as -- as school officials have a relation to schoolchildren, is such that they might hide things, and they do hide things, in and under their clothing."
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,120.677,121.243,Was there--
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,121.243,121.71,But--
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,121.71,126.014,--Was there prior experience in this particular school?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,133.418,143.459,"--Your Honor, I don't know, and that's not in the record, but I can tell that you that that would not be the threshold requirement under this Court's prior rulings to justify the search."
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,143.459,157.385,"But you -- I thought your answer to Justice Scalia was that in the -- in the school's experience, children do hide contraband in their underwear but not in their body cavities."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,157.385,158.335,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,183.368,186.37,Let me ask you about another bright-line rule that I think you're assuming.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,211.603,212.503,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,212.503,215.489,Why -- why should we accept that -- that blanket assumption?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,232.016,244.658,"For the very same reasons this Court noted in T.L.O. 25 years ago, Your Honor, and that is that the school officials have deemed, in their judgment, that this is an important rule with regard to health and safety."
2008.08-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,245.191,255.716,"Oh, and I agree with you, and I -- I don't have any question with this kind of a, let's say, a -- a broad swath of judicial hands-off in determining what is a risk and what isn't."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,277.312,311.719,"--Well, Your Honor, if -- if an administrator in their judgment, in their reasonable judgment, believes that any -- any drug poses a potential health and safety risk, because they have the custodial and tutelary responsibilities for those kids -- and it's not like a criminal issue where they're trying to prosecute; this is a case where they're trying to protect -- because they have those kinds of obligations to provide for the safety of children, to provide an orderly educational environment, it is best for this Court to defer to their judgment when they believe that certain rules are important and not second-guess those rules."
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.719,312.385,Had it been--
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,312.385,312.785,So long--
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.785,324.193,"--Had it been the case that, as I recall, someone had -- well, students were popping ibuprofen, weren't they?"
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,324.193,325.645,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,325.645,328.764,I guess they might pop aspirin as well.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,344.274,345.424,"Precisely, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.424,347.059,On over-the-counter drugs.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,347.059,349.344,On a prescription medication that--
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.344,351.194,"A prescription, not over-the-counter."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,351.194,358.783,"--that a student brought to school and that a student ingested, another student ingested, and then was airlifted out in an ICU in a near-fatal experience."
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,358.783,359.566,What was--
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,359.566,360.266,But just 7 days--
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,360.266,362.318,--What was -- what was the drug involved in that case?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,362.318,364.02,"--I don't know, Your Honor, and it's not in the record."
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,364.02,366.62,But it certainly was not ibuprofen?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,366.62,369.222,"Again, I don't know, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,369.222,370.841,You said it was a prescription drug.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,370.841,371.974,It was a prescription drug.
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,388.969,394.389,"Yes, but he -- he was not the one who identified Redding."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,400.376,402.909,"Her friend Marissa Glines, yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,402.909,412.934,"And on that classmate's say-so -- was the classmate ever asked, well, when did you get this pill?"
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,414.884,422.972,"Where -- the question, where did this pill come from, was asked by the administrator."
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,422.972,423.622,"I mean, what place."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,441.518,443.686,"No, but that's clear from the record, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,456.128,462.699,But it's contemporaneous with the -- with the student who blamed the other child.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,476.257,485.63,"But the tip from the young man goes to Glines, and the young man's tip becomes reliable when Glines produces the fistful of pills that he said she would have, plus other pills."
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,485.63,488.165,"Maybe it becomes reliable as to her, but it has nothing to do with Redding."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,488.165,504.376,"But, Your Honor, then it ties in with the -- with the contraband -- excuse me -- the planner that was laid open before Mr. Wilson when he subsequently searches Savana Redding, and she admits to him that that was her planner, but she denies any knowledge of the contents."
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,506.562,511.28,Did the school know what -- what particular pills it was searching for?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,511.28,512.38,--Not--
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,512.38,519.786,Did it know that -- what -- what the threat was was ibuprofen or aspirin or -- or some prescription drug?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,519.786,521.322,"--Not comprehensively, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.592,531.528,How did he know it was an OTC pill?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,531.528,532.628,--Because he--
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,532.628,533.13,Just by looking at it?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,533.13,534.38,--called poison control.
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.38,535.613,Okay.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,535.613,537.598,And -- and once that was assessed--
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.598,538.247,What was in it?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,539.116,540.749,--It was Naprosyn 200 milligrams.
2008.08-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,553.641,575.557,"Have you ever made -- has your side of the case ever made the argument that it needs this sort of blanket classification rule, any drug over the counter or prescription, because when a, a pill is found, they're not pharmacists, they don't know what it is, and therefore they've got to have a blanket rule or they simply cannot act effectively?"
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,579.574,580.693,"Precisely, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,584.895,586.045,Where did you argue it?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,588.113,589.097,It's in the briefs.
2008.08-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,589.097,590.299,Is it?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,593.417,595.351,"I don't have one offhand, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,595.351,597.103,But you say it's in your brief?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,597.103,598.655,I'm fairly -- fairly certain it's in the brief.
2008.08-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,598.655,599.121,"Okay, I'll go back."
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,599.121,606.808,"In the case, this case, the school nurse -- the pills were given to the school nurse and she identified what they were."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,606.808,607.926,Precisely.
2008.08-479,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,612.062,613.664,"Mr. Mr. Wright, could I ask you this question."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,651.539,659.709,"The problem with that is, Your Honor, it wouldn't comport with the notion that we need to shield administrators from lawsuits and legal liability."
2008.08-479,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,659.709,661.478,"No, not on the question of qualified immunity."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,665.513,673.286,"Whether or not that would be a factual determination, as to whether he could reasonably suspect that the pills would be there?"
2008.08-479,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,673.286,673.886,Right.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,673.886,688.478,"I think -- I think it could lend itself to that, Your Honor, but I would prefer that the Court -- we would ask the Court and it's our position that the Court would lay down a bright line rule such that it wouldn't end up in a factual dispute, and that bright line rule is this."
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.636,710.824,"--Any contraband, like the black marker pencil that -- that astounded me."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,714.009,715.295,"--Well, for sniffing."
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,715.295,717.478,"Oh, is that what they do?"
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,717.478,717.997,It's a permanent marker.
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,717.997,719.28,They sniff them?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,719.28,722.199,"Well, that's the -- I mean, I'm a school lawyer."
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,724.115,725.198,Really?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,725.198,752.032,"--But the point was is that the rule -- the rule, Your Honor, is -- is grounded in the notion that when there's a health and safety risk because these people are charged and tasked with the responsibility to keep these kids safe, they have to have the opportunity to act flexibly, immediately, and effectively when they're dealing with these risks."
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,752.032,764.49,"But there has to be -- I mean, some -- the stark difference between this case and T.L.O., in addition to the intrusiveness of the search, was there was a teacher said: I caught those girls; they were smoking in the bathroom."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,791.759,798.079,Your Honor seems to be concerned about the reliability of the tip in this case.
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,805.25,812.423,But an official could follow up to see whether this child -- whether there is a basis for what she said.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,815.239,818.41,"There was additional corroborating evidence, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,834.336,839.323,"Well, the school could keep records on its students, like the police keep records on confidential informants."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,850.279,853.131,"Except that, Your Honor, there's a different incentive here."
2008.08-479,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.811,876.263,What discipline did the tipster receive?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,880.483,886.119,"--Oh, there was no discipline that I know of in the record, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,888.071,891.523,Was she subject to a civil suit by the plaintiff in this case?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,891.523,895.391,"Was the person Marissa Glines, the person who gave the tip?"
2008.08-479,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,895.391,896.075,Yes.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,896.075,896.641,"No, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,896.641,904.581,Could I come back to your distinguishing a strip search from a cavity search.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,907.783,908.566,Nothing at all.
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,910.317,912.369,"No cavity search in school, no matter what?"
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,912.369,914.386,"We're not even clinically trained to do that, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,925.76,931.914,"Your basis -- your basis for saying that, I guess, is just sort of the practical one, we don't know how to do that type of thing."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,939.604,941.456,"On the legal basis I could see that, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,943.156,960.183,"But if -- if we hold in your favor in this case and the next school district says, all right, we're going to have classes in body cavity searches, then there would be no legal basis, if we accept your principle, for saying that's out of bounds as a matter of the Fourth Amendment; isn't that correct?"
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,960.183,961.15,--I see your concern.
2008.08-479,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,966.921,969.706,So it would not -- it would not be out of bounds under the Fourth Amendment?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,969.706,972.825,"--Technically, but it will be controlled by the community."
2008.08-479,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,975.26,984.883,Do you know whether or not in the Ninth Circuit in border search cases a body cavity search can be conducted without a warrant?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,988.52,997.958,"--I just know that there has been concern expressed over body cavity searches, even in the prisoner environment and even in the border environment."
2008.08-479,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1011.35,1018.956,Can I ask just a follow-up on your answer to Justice Kennedy's earlier question about whether the informant was subject to civil suit.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,1022.741,1023.558,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1024.61,1025.076,Okay.
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1025.076,1033.798,There's one aspect of this considering the reasonableness of the school administrator's behavior.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,1063.751,1081.712,"Your Honor, that is not a matter of the record, but the inference is that the -- that the investigation was still ongoing because there was a group of kids, and at that time the administrator was making efforts to try to make sure that he had gathered all the drugs that might be on campus."
2008.08-479,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1084.998,1091.318,But how were they investigating her when they did nothing but put her in a chair outside the vice principal's office?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,1091.318,1103.562,"--Well, Your Honor, I can see where it might have been more reasonable in that sense to have let her go back to class, but it certainly is not a standard that would affect the constitutionality."
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1103.562,1106.93,I assume a school can assign a student to study hall.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,1117.952,1119.321,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1119.321,1120.304,"Schools do that all the time, don't they?"
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,1120.304,1121.037,Yes.
2008.08-479,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1138.533,1149.757,"When was the -- when was she detained there in relation to the lunchtime period, which was when the other student had said that all the kids were going to take these pills?"
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,1149.757,1153.642,"I believe it went through the lunchtime period, Your Honor, the detainment."
2008.08-479,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1169.004,1172.622,But aren't there things here that are a little extreme?
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,1216.782,1218.548,May I offer two principles?
2008.08-479,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1218.548,1218.982,Yes.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,1218.982,1226.238,"First, this Court has recognized that the least intrusive means is not a threshold prerequisite to a constitutional--"
2008.08-479,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1226.238,1230.923,"I know, but I mean, here she is embarrassed if -- if what she says happened happened."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,1246.634,1247.951,--Very true.
2008.08-479,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1247.951,1255.323,"So that's what I -- I don't see any basis for saying to the school administrator, you know, you can do that."
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,1260.892,1265.013,"In the record, Your Honor, she did -- she did have her underpants on and her brassiere still on."
2008.08-479,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1265.013,1271.267,"I know, but she says in the record that they went further and required her to be partly naked beyond just her underwear."
2008.08-479,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.75,1278.071,"Well, I suppose you could say that about any strip search, couldn't you: That there is never a need for a strip search?"
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,1289.461,1290.044,"No, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1298.567,1299.1,--Okay.
2008.08-479,0,36841,matthew_w_wright,,1308.642,1309.542,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1321.999,1323.217,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1333.59,1347.667,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Intrusive body searches in the school context implicate fundamentally different expectations of privacy than other -- other kinds of searches."
2008.08-479,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1364.544,1370.448,"Before you get started, do we have to reach the underlying merits or can we just decide the qualified immunity issue?"
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1370.448,1377.686,--The government agrees with the parties and all amici in this case that this Court should address the substantive Fourth Amendment issue.
2008.08-479,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1377.686,1379.471,"Should -- should, but must?"
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1379.471,1384.69,This Court could decide the case on qualified immunity grounds alone.
2008.08-479,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1384.69,1387.475,"Well, one of the defendants doesn't have qualified immunity."
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1387.475,1389.244,"That's exactly right, Justice Scalia."
2008.08-479,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1389.244,1393.112,"So don't we have to, for that defendant at least, decide the constitutional question?"
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1393.112,1398.033,"Well, this Court could remand on Monell grounds for a hearing on that, which was not addressed in--"
2008.08-479,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1398.033,1402.753,"What would be, Mr. O'Neil, the basis for the Monell claim?"
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1406.038,1406.921,--That's correct.
2008.08-479,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1406.921,1411.775,What would the plaintiff have to show to establish a claim under Monell?
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1411.775,1423.231,The plaintiff would have to show that this search was conducted pursuant to a -- an official policy or that the vice principal was a person who was acting with that authority.
2008.08-479,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1445.33,1454.702,"You -- you criticized the Ninth Circuit in your brief for having a sliding scale standard, which is a bad thing in your view."
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1463.292,1464.342,"No, Justice Kennedy."
2008.08-479,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.683,1488.007,"You -- you have to, under your standard, have reason -- a reasonable suspicion specifically that -- that the student is hiding the contraband in the student's underwear?"
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1488.007,1489.292,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2008.08-479,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.292,1517.693,"Now, if -- if you have a reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs and you search every other place, you search in the student's pack, you search the student's outer garments, and you have a reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs, don't you have, after conducting all these other searches, a reasonable suspicion that she has drugs in her underpants?"
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1517.693,1520.395,"No, Justice Scalia, we believe that you don't--"
2008.08-479,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1520.395,1521.08,All right.
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1521.08,1522.48,--without -- without--
2008.08-479,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1522.48,1523.514,Your logic fails me.
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1523.514,1524.532,"--Well, Justice--"
2008.08-479,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1524.532,1527.234,You -- you reasonably suspect the student has drugs.
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1532.369,1537.023,"--Well, Justice Scalia, you posited that the teacher began the search with reasonable suspicion."
2008.08-479,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1550.35,1552.116,That sounds like you--
2008.08-479,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1552.116,1554.468,--putting things in their underwear.
2008.08-479,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1554.468,1560.539,--That sounds to me like the sliding scale that you reject from the Ninth Circuit.
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1560.539,1570.161,"--No, because we believe that where you have reasonable suspicion that there is contraband in the underwear, then you could go directly to that location, and you wouldn't have to work from the outside in."
2008.08-479,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1571.346,1571.996,"Oh, surely not."
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1579.55,1592.593,"--Well, to take T.L.O. as an example, Justice Scalia, in that case the Court believed that there was reasonable suspicion that the student had cigarettes in her purse because that was the obvious place to find them."
2008.08-479,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1604.484,1606.384,"Now, what specifically do you think is missing here?"
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1618.542,1625.096,--The particularized suspicion could come from information from students that reliably adverted to the location of the contraband.
2008.08-479,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1625.662,1632.099,But you have to have direct evidence that the -- the -- it can't be based on inferences?
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1632.099,1632.951,--No--
2008.08-479,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1632.951,1634.184,Is that the distinction you are drawing?
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1639.621,1640.688,"--No, Justice Alito."
2008.08-479,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1668.189,1676.211,But you are -- you are saying basically there is -- there is no general understanding that people carry ibuprofen in -- in their undergarments.
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1676.211,1676.994,That is -- that is true.
2008.08-479,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1704.048,1725.127,"But if your -- accepting your argument that there may be no reasonable suspicion based on Marissa saying this is the person who gave me the drugs, does the fact that she said kids are going to -- the kids are going to take these drugs at lunchtime, a specific time, does that present a difference in the level of concern that the school should have?"
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1725.127,1735.5,--We believe that the schools may take seriously any information they receive and must take seriously any information they receive about the presence of prescription pills on campus.
2008.08-479,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1790.403,1802.96,"If Marissa Glines had said specifically that Savana Redding has pills someplace on her person and she's going to distribute them at lunch in the cafeteria, would this be a different case?"
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1802.96,1804.912,"--It may well, Justice Alito."
2008.08-479,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1809.131,1812.166,What is the difference between that situation and this situation?
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1819.339,1821.672,--That may present a triable issue.
2008.08-479,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1822.124,1822.674,Excuse me.
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1849.591,1851.841,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2008.08-479,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1871.405,1887.43,"I mean, the student says, she has -- she has crack someplace on her person, and she's going to distribute it to kids during the lunch hour, and so they search her -- her garments, and they don't find it."
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1890.901,1893.418,The nature of the contraband--
2008.08-479,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1893.418,1894.07,--because--
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1894.07,1911.815,"--The nature of the contraband could be relevant in the totality of the circumstances to the suspicion that the student has -- is hiding it in some illicit place as -- Justice Souter, as you noted, certainly there is no practice anywhere, that I'm aware of, of hiding ibuprofen in underwear."
2008.08-479,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1911.815,1916.184,So there is a sliding scale for the dangerousness of what you're looking for?
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1916.184,1917.136,No.
2008.08-479,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1924.805,1927.407,How is a school administrator supposed to know?
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1945.219,1955.159,My point was simply with a drug like crack there is a more common understanding that a drug like that can be hidden in a student's -- in underwear.
2008.08-479,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1955.159,1966.132,"So what is the school administrator supposed to know when he sees a white pill and doesn't know if it's something terribly harmful, even deadly, or if it's prescription strength ibuprofen?"
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1972.02,1978.007,"Well, we believe that, as I said, school administrators have to take seriously all medication like this on campus."
2008.08-479,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1986.113,1988.565,"I'm sorry, your answer to me was they have to take it seriously."
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1997.504,1998.038,--No.
2008.08-479,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1998.038,1999.388,He's not?
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,1999.388,2000.123,He is not.
2008.08-479,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2000.123,2003.075,"Even if it turns out to be -- you know, I don't know, some very deadly drug?"
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,2003.075,2012.263,"Mr. Chief Justice, we do not believe that this Court should get in the business of deciding that searches are okay for, for example, heroin, but not okay for cocaine."
2008.08-479,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2012.263,2015.382,"That's what you just told us we should do, in answer to Justice Alito's question."
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,2015.382,2032.677,"No, I simply -- the point was simply that if there is some common understanding that a type of contraband is generally secreted in a certain way, and the example is crack, and there is a known understanding that crack can be hidden in that way, that that would be relevant to the totality of the circumstances."
2008.08-479,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2032.677,2040.498,"And I don't see why your answer might not be different if, under the Chief Justice's question, he didn't know it was ibuprofen."
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,2059.761,2077.206,"It may, Justice Souter, but I think that the question would be whether the school official has some reason to believe, based on a practice, that -- that pills, for example, are hidden in a student's -- can be hidden in a student's underwear."
2008.08-479,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2096.434,2097.369,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-479,1,21324,david_oneil,,2097.369,2098.253,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-479,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2098.253,2107.909,Mr. Wolf.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2107.909,2120.133,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree with the Federal Government that before conducting an intrusive strip search a school needs to have location-specific information."
2008.08-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2132.34,2137.178,I don't think the case can begin and end with that because we have the separate issue of qualified immunity.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2149.319,2155.64,"Your Honor, I don't think a head count of the judges is the standard by which this Court measures qualified immunity."
2008.08-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2185.392,2186.177,What if--
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2186.177,2186.811,--without any suspicion.
2008.08-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2186.811,2188.527,--What if what Marissa has is heroin?
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2197.569,2200.771,The nature of the infraction -- no.
2008.08-479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2229.354,2232.992,I'm not quite sure where we are in your answer to the question of the Chief Justice's question.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2251.119,2252.536,"No, it does not."
2008.08-479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2257.44,2261.992,So you don't mind our judging this case as if they were searching for meth?
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2261.992,2263.777,--Your Honor--
2008.08-479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2263.777,2269.748,"That's the way -- we should -- we should judge this case as though they were searching -- the fact that it was -- is it ibuprofen, have I got that?"
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2274.485,2279.104,"--I think we all understand that this -- that this case, you know, involves ibuprofen."
2008.08-479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2279.904,2282.656,I don't think I understand that based on your answer.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2287.727,2288.943,"--Not in in this case, correct."
2008.08-479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2288.943,2296.982,Insofar as the rule that we -- that's because in this case you don't think there's a reasonable suspicion to begin with.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2309.54,2315.21,I think it's irrelevant when you're making distinctions between drugs.
2008.08-479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2321.181,2330.054,So that goes back to my earlier proposition that you don't mind our deciding the case as if this were a search for meth that was going to be consumed at noon?
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2330.054,2330.905,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2330.905,2331.405,Thank you.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2331.405,2332.938,Why?
2008.08-479,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2346.915,2361.841,"Well, to play the devil's advocate on that, why couldn't the assistant principal reason as follows: that he has information from -- from Ms. Glines that Ms. Redding has drugs."
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2397.598,2398.8,Justice Alito--
2008.08-479,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2398.8,2399.416,What's wrong with that?
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2399.416,2402.168,"--Justice Alito, I don't think that accurately describes the record."
2008.08-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2461.973,2465.075,"You're saying the whole search, not just the search of the undergarments."
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2469.646,2471.246,I think they could have searched her backpack.
2008.08-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2471.762,2472.264,Why?
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2472.264,2478.335,--What that speaks to is the low degree of the suspicion and the nonspecific suspicion that's needed to conduct an ordinary search.
2008.08-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.335,2479.168,So you want a sliding scale?
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2479.168,2480.835,"It's not a sliding scale, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2502.45,2507.521,"I mean, I think there's a dispute in the record about that."
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2590.175,2591.008,"It is, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2591.008,2591.525,Because?
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2591.525,2594.21,"It is because that is an intrusive, traumatic search."
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2594.21,2595.077,All right.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2603.833,2612.589,It -- it might be different if they asked Savana to go into the other room and to change where you're not revealing your body to any government official.
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2612.589,2616.223,"No, they didn't -- she didn't reveal her body beyond her underclothes."
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2620.027,2620.494,Right.
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2620.494,2635.137,"I'm trying to work out why is this a major thing to say strip down to your underclothes, which children do when they change for gym, they do fairly frequently, not to -- you know, and there are only two women there."
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2642.441,2642.924,Right.
2008.08-479,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2642.924,2645.326,"Mr. Wolf, one thing should be clarified."
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2669.525,2670.377,There is none at all.
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2670.377,2678.899,"Well, I thought there was, because I thought on page 135 of the record the official said they didn't see her naked, and so I thought that there was--"
2008.08-479,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2678.899,2683.018,There was no dispute that they asked her to shake her pants and her bra.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2692.141,2693.659,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2694.159,2697.694,--My question -- my question has to do with accepting--
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2697.694,2698.244,--Yes.
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2698.244,2704.098,"--What they said on page 135 of the record, and this is a genuine problem I'm having."
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2710.768,2711.035,Yes.
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2711.035,2711.437,Okay.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2724.178,2724.812,Yes.
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2768.691,2772.426,"Maybe the psychologists -- ""strip search"" has a lot of meanings."
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2782.133,2784.5,"--I believe it is, Your -- Justice Breyer."
2008.08-479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2797.143,2805.916,"Let me -- let me just, not so much change the facts, but -- but emphasize a couple of different aspects of the facts."
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2890.836,2898.59,"And to make sure I understand, it's that there's reasonable belief -- there's a reasonable belief that a student has drugs on his or her person?"
2008.08-479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2898.59,2899.073,That's right.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2899.073,2905.762,"And by his or her person, presumably it could be the pockets or it could be in the backpack that he or she is holding?"
2008.08-479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2905.762,2910.731,Somewhere between the surface of the clothes and -- and the body.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2910.731,2911.364,Right.
2008.08-479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2921.955,2937.298,"You -- you say that the -- the point of my question, this is what I'd like you to focus on -- you're entirely right, I would accept that argument and I think that argument is entirely right, if the stakes are lower."
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2961.765,2964.448,"--Well, I mean, to start, that's not what T.L.O. said."
2008.08-479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2966.734,2972.904,I'm -- I'm saying it.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2981.826,2991.783,"--Because in order to conduct that intrusive search, it seems like it that case you would have to be doing guesswork, if you will, about where those pills are located."
2008.08-479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2991.783,2995.585,You've got reasonable suspicion that they are somewhere on the person.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,2995.585,2996.069,That's right.
2008.08-479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3005.675,3008.727,"And with those stakes in mind, why isn't it reasonable?"
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3021.303,3024.672,--Because -- it all comes back to the balancing of the Fourth Amendment.
2008.08-479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3031.575,3034.61,I don't have a belief; I simply have a reasonable suspicion.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3050.004,3051.739,"--No, it's not what I'm saying, Your Honor."
2008.08-479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3065.832,3069.034,"Some search is -- is reasonable, I take it?"
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3069.034,3069.618,--But -- absolutely.
2008.08-479,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3069.618,3070.267,All right.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3087.845,3091.114,"Well, the hypothetical supposes they have searched everywhere."
2008.08-479,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3105.207,3121.335,"Do you agree with Mr. O'Neil when he said if the drug had been cocaine, and it's well known that cocaine is carried in underwear, that then this would not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment?"
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3127.656,3128.172,Right.
2008.08-479,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3139.547,3140.447,It has to be that student.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3144.599,3159.091,"And it may be that if this becomes so customary, that that somehow differently calibrates the equation here, but it -- it's sort of strange credulity to think that you would have loose pills concealed against a student's genitalia."
2008.08-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3161.627,3171.083,"As -- as I understand your -- your presentation, you qualify as a strip search any search that requires the outer garments to be taken off."
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3180.791,3183.243,"It certainly added to the trauma -- trauma, Justice Scalia."
2008.08-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3183.243,3194.681,"But is a strip search and -- impermissible along the lines you say, to require the student to even take off the outer garments?"
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3194.681,3195.466,That's -- that's right.
2008.08-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3199.802,3211.726,"Just to combine it with -- with your answers to Justice Kennedy, you are saying it's unreasonable to take off the outer garments even if your suspicion, reasonable suspicion for justifying the preliminary search is that the student has heroin?"
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3211.726,3219.766,"--Without any location-specific information, that's correct, and anything else would send a shudder down the spines of little boys and girls around this country."
2008.08-479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3219.766,3223.384,"Well, let me ask you this about spine shuddering."
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3260.759,3264.695,If -- if they called in the police officers?
2008.08-479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3264.695,3267.313,They give the student the choice.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3276.085,3279.47,"I don't think that would violate the Fourth Amendment, Justice Kennedy."
2008.08-479,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3279.47,3280.137,But--
2008.08-479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3280.137,3284.541,Which -- which would be the less traumatic of the two choices for the student?
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3284.541,3287.91,Well I'm not sure that there's a lesser or more traumatic.
2008.08-479,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3289.226,3290.012,--But wouldn't the police--
2008.08-479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3290.012,3297.599,"You think it's less traumatic, or it might be less traumatic to have uniformed police officers take the person to the police station and conduct the search there?"
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3297.599,3299.034,Well--
2008.08-479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3299.034,3302.486,You want us to decide the case on the fact that that's probably less traumatic for the student?
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3302.486,3305.438,--I'm saying both are remarkably traumatic.
2008.08-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3305.438,3306.955,The police would require--
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3306.955,3308.39,I'm not putting them one above the other.
2008.08-479,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3308.39,3312.359,"--The police would require probable cause, wouldn't they, not just suspicion?"
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3312.359,3314.46,They would require probable cause.
2008.08-479,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3314.46,3316.079,In the hypothetical wasn't there a probable cause?
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3316.079,3320.381,"Well if there's probable cause and they want to call the police officers in, then they can do that."
2008.08-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3335.041,3337.076,"Well, you've made that point several times."
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3342.897,3344.58,Did you say the prisoner?
2008.08-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3344.58,3345.197,Yes.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3345.197,3345.932,Mr. Chief Justice?
2008.08-479,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3351.586,3353.586,Maybe I'm -- maybe I'm not articulating this.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3361.374,3364.476,--Well it -- the brassiere I think as well.
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3369.88,3372.08,It's not like you have any studies on this.
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3393.496,3394.43,Well--
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3394.43,3396.031,Do you have any studies on this?
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3396.714,3398.414,"--No, but neither -- neither do they."
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3398.414,3400.066,So what am I supposed to do?
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3426.115,3428.649,"Yes, but the ""not beyond human experience""--"
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3428.649,3430.049,"Well, what are they supposed to do?"
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3430.049,3435.72,"--But the ""not beyond human experience"" standard is not the standard that governs whether the Fourth Amendment is violated."
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3435.72,3437.589,"No, no, but it's supposed to be what's reasonable."
2008.08-479,2,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3437.589,3438.105,Right.
2008.08-479,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3438.105,3440.291,And a teacher is there thinking what's reasonable?
2008.08-479,3,36841,matthew_w_wright,,3465.859,3470.31,"Well, it -- it is unreasonable, and at the end of the day, it has to be unreasonable."
2008.08-479,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3494.276,3503.448,"Is that a question of law or is that a question that goes to the trier of fact, whether you could infer reasonable suspicion about the presence of the pills in those locations?"
2008.08-479,4,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3503.448,3506.0,"That seems like a factual question to me, Justice Alito."
2008.08-479,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3516.041,3518.357,Is probable cause a jury question too?
2008.08-479,4,17193,adam_b_wolf,,3518.357,3522.195,Whether something rises to the level of probable cause?
2008.08-479,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3522.195,3525.397,"Yes, probable cause in the ordinary criminal investigation cases."

2008.08-479,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3571.342,3573.358,I don't think it's a jury question.
