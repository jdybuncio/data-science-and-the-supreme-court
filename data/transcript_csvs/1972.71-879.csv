1972.71-879,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,38.87,"We'll hear arguments next, in 71-879, Heublein against South Carolina Tax Commission."
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,40.951,45.38,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-879,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,319.902,327.458,You say that these Supreme Court of South Carolina left stand the lower court's finding favorable to your client.
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,331.767,335.298,There was no discussion of it at all in the opinion.
1972.71-879,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,351.509,364.987,"Well, you say that but isn't the ordinary rule that when a judgment comes here from a state court that all presumptions are in favor of the validity of the judgment of the highest court of the state?"
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,364.987,397.394,I would think sir that the primary purpose of this particular proceeding is to consider the Federal question and the substantial federal question involved in the mandated activities required by the ABC laws of South Carolina and that the factual conclusions of whether Heublein's representative carrying promotional materials from this retail account to another retail account would not be the substantial federal question that should concern this Court.
1972.71-879,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,397.748,402.517,You don't suppose why then the lower court's findings that were favorable?
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,402.517,408.148,"I think it is important in the overall view of, the overall picture of this particular case."
1972.71-879,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1028.633,1044.796,"Mr. Piga, even if you are right as to the broad sweep of the Federal statute in the matters not dealing with liquor, doesn't the Twenty-first Amendment the least arguably out some limitations on the power of Congress to sweep that broadly when they are dealing with liquor?"
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1044.796,1060.261,"There have been conflicts raised in the past between the Twenty-first Amendment, ABC Laws generated by the Twenty-first Amendment and other Federal statutes."
1972.71-879,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1082.864,1100.36,"But Mr. Piga I gather that it is the fact, isn't it that the orders are filled from stocks maintained within the state and you say this is only a technicality but such orders as are finally filled, are filled with stocks maintained within the state?"
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1100.36,1103.001,No it's not exactly correct sir.
1972.71-879,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1113.057,1115.242,They don't go to the ultimate purchaser yet?
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1115.242,1119.798,"Well, they are consigned to the producer's representative in South Carolina."
1972.71-879,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1119.798,1128.523,"And that's from wherever he keeps and that they are finally filled, you mentioned that they are already actually on the warehouse platforms somewhere?"
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1128.523,1135.21,Actually in practice the trucks are unloaded outside of the wholesaler's warehouse.
1972.71-879,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1158.063,1173.239,Didn't the senate report expressly or rather carefully say that the interpretation of the statute would be such that in a fact situation like this the immunity would not apply?
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1173.239,1181.815,No I think that the senate -- well the statute itself is talking about shipment or delivery from out of state to in-state.
1972.71-879,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1195.498,1203.975,"But if we don't agree with that, if we think it falls within the literal language of the statute, that's the end of the case isn't it?"
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1203.975,1211.329,"Well, it's the end of the case if you interpret delivery or shipment in the terms that the Court of South Carolina has interpreted."
1972.71-879,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1215.891,1220.241,Then I gather you don't challenge the Authority of the State under the Twenty-first Amendment?
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1223.88,1230.423,That's correct.
1972.71-879,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1264.625,1266.331,But doesn't that go to a different issue?
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1272.263,1282.531,"But it's using the Authority of the Twenty-first Amendment with respect to a State Statute, or the Twenty-first Amendment itself in challenge to a Federal Statute."
1972.71-879,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1332.39,1338.181,"What about the Jim Beam cases, same volume?"
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1338.181,1340.146,The Beam case?
1972.71-879,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1340.557,1353.738,Department of Revenue versus James where they said they surely can be no doubt that it was a state's preliminary power the regulate control by taxing and otherwise the distribution use of consumption of (Inaudible) within our --
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1353.738,1366.886,"The Beam case is, the Court is correct, but in fact that case over turned the Connecticut -- the Kentucky tax laws even though the Kentucky tax laws were based again on the Twenty-first Amendment."
1972.71-879,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1366.886,1369.541,"Well, I have been relying on the Court."
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1369.541,1371.939,But the court is dictum.
1972.71-879,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1375.97,1380.301,If it wasn't dictum would it apply to this case?
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1380.301,1381.54,Id it were not a dictum?
1972.71-879,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1381.54,1381.974,Yeah.
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1381.974,1387.886,"Well, the court went on hold in that case that the State Statute fell --"
1972.71-879,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1387.886,1391.15,"And they put another, the dictum apply it'd be okay?"
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1391.15,1393.549,The dictum is helpful to the opposition.
1972.71-879,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1393.549,1397.882,(Inaudible) [Laughter]
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1397.882,1405.163,But the whole thing I believe is helpful to us.
1972.71-879,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1480.841,1492.651,Mr. Piga supposing that South Carolina instead of just as you contend requiring checkpoints had required Heublein to establish a warehouse in South Carolina?
1972.71-879,0,41896,stephen_m_piga,,1492.651,1497.123,"Sir, we thought about that and greatly concerned about."
1972.71-879,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1540.311,1547.141,Thank you Mr. Piga.
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,1549.591,1553.194,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-879,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1852.816,1867.257,Then Mr. Argoe I take it you -- your argument does concede that what Heublein was required to do here was mandated by the state?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,1867.257,1868.805,I concede to the point --
1972.71-879,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1868.805,1878.93,"Where in your argument if I understand it correctly, the interstate commerce aspect has come to an end."
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,1878.93,1880.93,"I do make that point, Your Honor."
1972.71-879,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1883.394,1892.356,"So the another crux of it is that Twenty-first Amendment then overrides in the liquor area, the Federal statute?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,1892.356,1907.025,"The Twenty-first Amendment, yes the state's exclusive right and control to regulate the traffic into the state and to that extent, I would say that the Twenty-first Amendment would override the commerce clause, yes."
1972.71-879,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1907.025,1910.554,This has to be your argument?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,1910.554,1910.925,Yes.
1972.71-879,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1910.925,1926.237,Would you tell me then what is the interest of the state that is protected by these additional requirements other than the actual one of controlling the liquor traffic?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,1926.237,1941.786,"The interest of the state in these regulations is to provide that all shipments shall be by one party, that party being subject to the exclusive control of the state."
1972.71-879,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1954.217,1956.861,It couldn't do this with respect of groceries?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,1956.861,1981.342,"I do not think that this would apply, that we would -- that the state of South Carolina or any state would have the right to control the shipment of groceries because they are not specifically protected or the state is not being specifically given the authority under the Twenty-first to regulate the sale of groceries or any other ordinary articles of commerce by the way."
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2084.02,2090.985,"You did permit import of the liquor to be shipped directly to the distributor, physically?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2090.985,2095.542,"Physically, it was delivered at the distributor's warehouse."
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.542,2100.629,So what -- and the only thing different was the papers read in the representative's name?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2100.629,2105.115,"The papers, the liquor was actually consigned to the producer representative --"
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2105.115,2113.807,If the producer representative actually have to go to the distributor or it was a paper just sent to him and he endorsed them over to them?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2113.807,2140.77,"The papers are required by statute to be forwarded by the producer to the producer representative and upon receipt and upon arrival with, all this liquor in South Carolina and by the way, it must be transmitted by common carrier so that the control can be -- proper control can be maintained, but those documents are submitted to the producer representative when a shipment commences."
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.77,2142.003,So who submits them?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2142.003,2147.097,They are submitted to the producer representative by the producer.
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.07,2149.721,He forwards them by mail to them?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2149.721,2156.129,He forwards them by mail to the producer and he also forwards those same documents to the state.
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2156.129,2159.202,"Alright, then what happens?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2159.202,2162.726,When the documents are received --
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2162.726,2163.805,By the representative --
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2163.805,2171.153,-- by the representative and after the liquor has arrived within the state and are delivered by the common carrier --
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.153,2172.418,-- to the distributor --
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2172.418,2178.926,"-- to the distributor's warehouse, they are set aside at that moment."
1972.71-879,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2178.926,2180.652,Consigned to the representative?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2180.652,2182.171,They are set aside and they are not --
1972.71-879,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2182.171,2185.88,Are they consigned on the paper or consigned to the representative?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2185.88,2187.638,They are consigned by --
1972.71-879,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2187.638,2194.903,Do you have instances where you don't have as much confidence in the distributors --
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2194.903,2196.345,"As I understand, yes."
1972.71-879,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2196.345,2203.709,Where you -- where the producer's representative must physically receive of the liquor when it comes in?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2203.709,2213.395,"To the best of my knowledge, there are instances in which they set a delivery, and actual physical transfer of the property could not be made to a common carrier."
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.395,2224.368,"The law though requires, that -- the law doesn't require in any instance that the liquor actually be delivered physically to the person -- to the producer representative?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2224.368,2229.218,The law states that it shall be delivered to the producer representative.
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.185,2241.651,"I know but it doesn't break the law, if the liquor is physically delivered to the distributor's warehouse rather than to the producer representative himself?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2241.651,2250.68,There is well provision of the statute that would preclude a producer representative from accepting the shipment on the platform or the loading dock of the --
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2250.68,2254.068,Well how does a common carrier know where it is delivered?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2254.068,2263.028,"He is required on his documents, the shipping document state that the consignment is to the producer representative."
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2263.028,2265.765,"Well, I know that but how does he know where did he take it?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2265.765,2269.065,At the location of the wholesale of warehouse.
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2269.065,2272.829,So the common carrier knows what warehouse to deliver?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2272.829,2273.758,What warehouse to deliver to --
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2273.758,2275.037,He has to know that.
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2277.103,2280.282,That just happens to be the distributor warehouse and they are delivered there.
1972.71-879,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2280.282,2287.503,"Well I suppose that John Jones is the producer's representative, it's John Jones and the address given as the distributor's warehouse?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2287.503,2290.048,"A distributor's warehouse, that is correct."
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2290.048,2296.603,"Well then what does he do on the phone he is told that, yeah, by the distributor?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2296.603,2309.137,"In this -- under the facts in this case, if you read in the record they put -- the producer representative has office space at the distributor's warehouse at which point he --"
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.137,2310.512,That's one of his addresses.
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2310.512,2317.741,That's one of his addresses and that is one point at which he has furnished office space to --
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2317.741,2318.884,To facilitate his whole operation?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2318.884,2323.1,To facilitate the transaction and to complete the necessary documents.
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.163,2325.202,"Well, now what does he do?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2331.355,2338.593,He takes the papers and he seeks the permission of the state to make a transfer.
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2353.772,2354.504,Then what does he do?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2354.504,2368.365,"Thereafter, he uprise for a certificate of transfer which would give him permission to transfer the legal ownership and title and make a – and to affect the sale and delivery of this liquor."
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2368.365,2369.91,Where does he get the certificate?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2369.91,2375.522,The certificate is a form which is supplied to him and upon which he has to fill out all and give all the requirements.
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.522,2378.069,(Voice Overlap) requiring that last --
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2378.069,2380.307,That certificate is applied and all has to do.
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.307,2382.061,Supplied in advance to him or not?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2382.061,2382.936,Yes it is.
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2382.936,2386.063,Supplying all that he fills it in.
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2386.063,2392.682,"This certificate is like a certificate with upon -- with that he fills the form out, the form is not filled out the state."
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.682,2398.028,"Well I know and it isn't signed by the state afterwards, it's already signed in advance?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2398.028,2401.672,"No, it is not signed in --"
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2401.672,2404.056,He fills out the form and then takes it somewhere?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2404.056,2414.57,"He fills out the form, carries it to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission and requests that a approval for the transfer be granted."
1972.71-879,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2440.141,2447.529,Is that -- what is you just say and suggested and you know of no instances where the approval had been withheld.
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2447.529,2449.695,I know of none with this particular wholesaler.
1972.71-879,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2449.695,2450.575,I see.
1972.71-879,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2450.575,2468.312,"I suppose if the particular wholesaler had violated some statute, some section of the statute relating to the control of alcoholic beverages, the board might refuse in that instance to approval the transfer, is that true?"
1972.71-879,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2468.312,2495.056,"Your Honor, for any violation a license maybe revoked and that being the license of the registered producer authorized the ship, or the license of the wholesaler seeking to buy this liquor and for a violation it depends upon the nature of violation I assume as to whether or not they would revoke the license or refuse to allow them to obtain or to purchase liquor."
1972.71-879,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2496.333,2506.491,(Inaudible) I thought some sort of separate storage or the bins within the warehouse or or I am mistaken in thinking that?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2506.491,2516.882,"Any storage by Heublein in South Carolina, must be made in a a bonded warehouse or upon it -- or it's own warehouse."
1972.71-879,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2516.882,2517.401,And in this case --
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2517.401,2519.216,To be legal a storage.
1972.71-879,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2519.216,2522.17,"Well, in this case was it shipped to the wholesaler's warehouse?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2522.17,2539.342,It was shipped to the wholesaler's warehouse and I think you fond that the record is silent as to how long that liquor may have rested on a loading dock before it was actually reported to the State that it had arrived.
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.933,2683.153,"On that basis you would -- If South Carolina had the same regulation with respect to groceries or meat, they might be invalid under some of the provision of the constitution, but it would still be out from under the tax -- you would still have the right to tax it because the Federal statute wouldn't apply."
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2683.153,2689.775,"Your Honor, I can't agree with you in that respect."
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2689.775,2691.91,"You are saying that liquor business is just different, is that true?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2691.91,2693.604,"The liquor business is different, yes."
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2695.48,2699.795,"Is same scheme with that was respect to anything but liquor would be very questionable, isn't it?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2699.795,2716.978,"It would be very questionable and I think under the court's holding in the case of the South Carolina Highway Department versus Barnwell, the Court would take jurisdiction and determine whether or not the State had exceeded it's authority with respect to that type of regulation."
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2716.978,2729.463,With respect to other property you would say that Commerce Clause would prevent South Carolina from the requiring Tittle to pass inside the State.
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2729.463,2743.359,"If I follow your question, I think the -- I don't think Title passage is a -- I don't think Title passage is a point that we would look to in determining whether Public Law 86-272 --"
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2743.359,2745.753,What are you looking for then here?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2745.753,2763.974,"We are looking to determine if we have first an interstate sale and I state that we need not go no further and that is in line with the decisions that the South Carolina Supreme Court issued that we had a sale in interstate commerce -- intrastate commerce, a local --"
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2763.974,2766.676,Because title passed in South Carolina?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2766.676,2767.451,Title.
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.451,2768.975,Because title passed in South Carolina --
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2768.975,2779.051,"Because title passed in South Carolina because title could not have passed without South Carolina, second because acceptance of the shipment could not be accepted without South Carolina."
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2779.051,2785.071,"Well, with every any other product then you would say South Carolina couldn't impose those requirements of making title passage to South Carolina."
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2785.071,2788.621,I agree.
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2788.621,2793.111,Or prohibiting acceptance --
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2793.111,2802.709,"Your Honor, title passage will not in my opinion control the applicability of Public Law 86-272 or the Commerce Clause."
1972.71-879,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2822.885,2828.457,All of which gets you back to the concession you made before that you have hang on the Twenty-first Amendment?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2828.457,2830.872,This regulation is not under attack.
1972.71-879,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2840.008,2852.363,"Under that same power, could South Carolina require that oranges from Florida or cheese from the Minnesota be shipped by common carrier as you do with liquor?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2852.363,2865.764,The State of South Carolina in my opinion would not have the authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate the shipment into the state from without the state any --
1972.71-879,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2865.764,2867.186,That brings you back to the Twenty-first Amendment.
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2867.186,2883.684,We are back to the Twenty-first Amendment which states that the state is granted exclusive control over liquors which are brought into it for use and delivery therein.
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2883.684,2920.291,"Well, just to make sure I understand you, if in connection with meat, the producer ships in into his representative in the state and that the -- and there is exactly the same procedure gone through here when connected with meat as happens here in connection with liquor, you would say that the Federal tax statue would control there wouldn't you, even though title passed in the state?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2920.291,2928.414,"Your Honor, I say that the state has no authority to erect a trade barrier as is found."
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2928.414,2930.343,I am not suggesting that the state erected any.
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2945.3,2946.32,Your Honor --
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2946.32,2952.881,Would he then not -- would he then be subject to South Carolina tax?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2952.881,2956.453,This Court has upheld in the Northwestern State case the right of the state --
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2956.453,2958.289,"Yeah, but that was not my question?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2958.289,2960.032,-- to tax such a transaction.
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2960.032,2963.197,"So you say yes, South Carolina could tax such transaction?"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2963.197,2968.184,It could tax the income produced because of such transaction to --
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2968.184,2973.748,Just because the shipment with representative rather than directly to the distributor?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,2973.748,2979.194,Well I am not sure that I understand your question Mr. Justice White.
1972.71-879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3015.646,3024.44,You mean you can tax -- say you send the papers to a bank instead of to the producer representative in order to facilitate credit transaction.
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,3024.44,3032.861,The technicalities of the paper are not the important points that I would like to emphasis in this case.
1972.71-879,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3044.717,3069.915,"Mr. Argoe, isn't the state's contention here basically that the Twenty-first Amendment gives it the authority to regulate the way liquor distributors and sellers organize their business within the state and as a result of those regulations, the way that Heublein conducted it's business here is in fact, outside the scope of the Federal Commerce Act --"
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,3069.915,3071.509,Your Honor that is correct.
1972.71-879,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3090.153,3097.036,Is another way of saying that the Twenty-first Amendment is an authority to South Carolina.
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,3110.535,3113.284,"Your Honor, I agree with that statement."
1972.71-879,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3113.284,3115.866,And that's what you say South Carolina has done here?
1972.71-879,1,24878,g_lewis_argoe_jr,,3115.866,3133.186,"I say we have the statue, yes, have required the activities to be become so localized as to exceed the minimum standards for protection set out in Public Law 86-272."
1972.71-879,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3133.186,3134.015,Thank you Mr. Argoe.
1972.71-879,2,41896,stephen_m_piga,,3135.377,3136.389,No sir.
1972.71-879,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3136.389,3137.087,Thank you gentlemen.
