2005.05-130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.32,We'll hear argument next in eBay v. MercExchange.
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,6.419,9.659,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2005.05-130,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,76.529,80.25,Is that all in Judge Bryson's decision?
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,82.664,100.784,"That -- that is precise -- I think it's the only way to read Judge Bryson's decision, Justice Ginsburg, where the court says, at page 26a, that a permanent injunction will issue once infringement and validity have been adjudged, and then say, to be sure, it will not be so to protect the public interest."
2005.05-130,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,106.29,109.697,I didn't see anything about irrebuttable presumption.
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,109.697,124.836,"Well, the point is that if an injunction follows with a finding of -- of validity and infringement, then that means that there has to be --there has to be irreparable injury, inadequate remedy at law, and that the balance of hardships has to tilt in -- in favor of the plaintiff."
2005.05-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,195.617,203.984,Is -- is that so with -- with respect to someone else's use of -- of your property?
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,238.089,238.663,Right.
2005.05-130,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,304.195,315.254,"On Justice Scalia's question, I was trying to think of some, and I was trying to think the analogy might -- you might find some analogy in the public utilities field, the -- or a ferris wheel or something."
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,333.557,334.338,I don't know of any.
2005.05-130,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,338.291,346.742,"Yes, that's what -- I mean, that -- that's what you're trying to analogize this case to, I guess, is a person who licenses others to use his property and never uses it himself."
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,346.742,348.032,That's precisely what this case involves.
2005.05-130,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,348.032,353.47,"And there, I don't know how courts do normally act in other areas of property law."
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,353.47,359.173,"Well, I don't know that there are a whole lot of them like that, but the one thing that -- I mean, there are two things to think about the property concept in the statute."
2005.05-130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,393.4,400.525,"Well, but -- but the exercise of discretion is channeled over time, as -- as judges apply it in -- in similar cases."
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,412.406,422.088,"I think in those cases, the irreparable injury and the inadequacy of the remedy at law will be -- will be easy to demonstrate, as they have been for hundreds of years."
2005.05-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.324,511.881,"You know, I mean, that's --that's a problem with Marshall, Texas, not with the patent law."
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,515.072,515.192,"Well, I hope you do."
2005.05-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,515.192,522.966,But I don't think we should write -- write our patent law because we have some renegade jurisdictions.
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,543.676,544.223,Well --
2005.05-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.223,546.315,Why can't -- why can't we let the market take care of the problem?
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,546.315,548.254,"Well, I think the -- the market will take care of the problem."
2005.05-130,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,567.496,587.851,"One of the problems with the district court exercising equitable discretion without a close review by the Federal Circuit is just the thing that the Federal Circuit was created to handle, that is, you get a tremendous disparity among district judges."
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,615.28,623.662,"But, Justice Ginsburg, the --the problem with that is that that's not the scheme that Congress created with respect to the remedial aspects of -- of the patent laws."
2005.05-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,650.863,656.231,I think maybe you exaggerate the -- the extent of equitable discretion.
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,675.667,679.035,"Well, I don't know that I need a wide-ranging allowance with respect to this."
2005.05-130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,701.724,709.541,"Well, but he said other things too, and one thing he said is, I don't like business method patents very much, and so I'm not going to give an injunction here."
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,709.541,709.868,"Well, that's --"
2005.05-130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,709.868,711.248,Do you think that was proper or improper?
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,711.248,713.887,"That's -- that's not precisely what he said, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,718.121,722.704,He said there's a growing concern over the issuance of business method patents.
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,722.704,722.997,Right.
2005.05-130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,722.997,727.925,Is that an appropriate consideration to take into account in determining whether to grant an injunction or not?
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,727.925,735.354,"I think probably, at the end of the day, it wouldn't be, but the bottom line is that he did that in the context of analyzing the public interest consideration and he said that didn't --"
2005.05-130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,735.354,736.922,"Well, then he went on and he said --"
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,736.922,737.781,-- tilt in favor.
2005.05-130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,737.781,742.736,-- another -- another consideration is that this patentee does not practice its patents.
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,753.552,753.987,Sure.
2005.05-130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,753.987,764.397,"And if he's denying that inventor, you know, the -- what he'd give to Bell Labs -- or whatever Bell Labs is these days -- that does practice the inventions --"
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,764.397,775.257,"I should know that actually, but --(Laughter) but, Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I think you can -- it's -- it's not fair to pick apart each one of his findings and say does that finding good enough or is that finding enough."
2005.05-130,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,792.623,792.865,"Well, but --"
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,792.865,797.517,"And candidly, most of the licensing arrangements don't even exist, and they're --I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy."
2005.05-130,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,797.517,799.241,"Well, I'm -- I interrupted you."
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,816.235,821.841,I -- I think in -- in a proper case -- and I don't think you do it under the --under the public interest analysis.
2005.05-130,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,830.804,837.242,"My concern is if you take that away, I don't know if you've got a lot left for the -- saying no injunction in this case."
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,837.242,840.575,"Well, I -- I mean, there's plenty left because he doesn't practice this invention."
2005.05-130,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,873.894,883.689,"Well, isn't it a concern that Congress didn't provide for compulsory licensing which this seems to have a very strong resemblance to?"
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,896.314,902.203,"But -- but we're not asking for a compulsory license because it is not our intention, going forward, to infringe this patent."
2005.05-130,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,980.006,981.599,"Well -- well, tell me how -- how this works."
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1000.32,1011.61,"Well, of course, the consequences of the -- of the process are significantly different because, obviously, the remedies for -- for contempt are significantly more draconian than -- than just a finding of a -- of a violation."
2005.05-130,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1012.98,1019.95,"Well, but this gives you the advantage of coming in in advance saying, I want --I -- I want a ruling in advance that I'm not going to violate the injunction."
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1021.73,1030.95,"Well, and the reality is the district court already looked at this and said that it -- it is the district court's judgment that they're going to require full infringement trials."
2005.05-130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1189.84,1192.38,Why should we -- if I can get back to one of the factors.
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1215.92,1221.75,Because the -- because Congress didn't dictate that he gets that leverage in every situation.
2005.05-130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1251.29,1254.42,Can I -- maybe I don't understand what it means to practice the invention.
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1267.47,1268.66,Right.
2005.05-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1334.79,1339.15,Why -- why does the fact that -- that you're not practicing the invention make a difference?
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1354.75,1355.2,Right.
2005.05-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1355.2,1365.26,-- from the use of this particular invention in the engine than I would be if I licensed it with a royalty based upon the number of sales of engines?
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1374.0,1378.52,"Yes, I think -- I think I ought to modify it slightly because it's not just simply that you don't practice the invention."
2005.05-130,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1411.14,1414.81,"By not occupying it, you mean including not licensing it to somebody else."
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1414.81,1421.33,"Well, if you didn't license it -- and actually we have no relevant licenses here too -- that would be another factor that ought to be --that ought to count in the mix."
2005.05-130,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1434.48,1438.45,"Well, is -- is the troll the scary thing under the bridge, or is it a fishing technique?"
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1441.09,1444.44,"For my clients, it's been the scary thing under the bridge, but --(Laughter)"
2005.05-130,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1444.44,1446.2,"I mean, is that what the troll is?"
2005.05-130,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1446.2,1456.91,"Yes, I believe that's the -- I think that's what -- what it is, although you -- maybe we should think of it more as Orks, now that we have a new generation, but at this point troll is the word that gets -- that gets used."
2005.05-130,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1459.91,1462.3,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1470.6,1473.54,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2005.05-130,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1517.32,1522.91,"You don't think Mr. -- you don't think Judge Bryson forgot about the four-factor test, do you?"
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1522.91,1523.82,Absolutely not.
2005.05-130,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1523.82,1524.13,Sure.
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1538.93,1539.95,"Not exactly, Your Honor."
2005.05-130,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1586.45,1588.79,Can I ask you about one factor in particular?
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1605.43,1607.94,"Well, I think, Your Honor, you're referring to the reexamination process--"
2005.05-130,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1607.94,1608.19,Right.
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1608.19,1610.74,"-- that, in fact, is ongoing in this case."
2005.05-130,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1654.81,1656.51,"Well, that's what struck me as odd there."
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1664.77,1669.11,"Well, it also might be a -- a basis in terms of how to structure the injunction."
2005.05-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1713.87,1719.54,But it denies the right subject to being a damage remedy that's available.
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1719.54,1729.11,"That's correct, but the difficulty here is the pragmatic question of whether the district court can determine whether damages are appropriate or not in a particular case."
2005.05-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1729.11,1734.32,Is it always -- is it always going to be irreparable injury if the patentee always gets fairly compensated?
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1734.32,1734.56,No.
2005.05-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1737.94,1743.73,"So if there are some cases when he gets fairly compensated and some he does not, why should you say it's always irreparable injury?"
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1743.73,1748.21,"Well, my -- our position is not that it's always, but that it normally is irreparable injury."
2005.05-130,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1752.62,1757.34,Is that usually will be because usually damages are not an adequate remedy?
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1757.34,1758.66,"Yes, that's correct."
2005.05-130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1792.88,1802.34,"When you say going forward, I thought we were talking about damages for the past violation, not damages for future violations which will continue."
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1803.69,1804.73,"Yes, that's what we're talking about."
2005.05-130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.73,1811.92,"About the court effectively saying, yes, here pay him and -- and go on and skip away and continue violating it."
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1811.92,1813.15,"Well, when a district court --"
2005.05-130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.15,1816.33,"In this case, they -- they claim not to want to violate it in the future."
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1827.74,1837.13,"Yes, but in this case the district court has awarded the damages for the past --past actions already, and the question is how will we deal with the threat of continuing infringement."
2005.05-130,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.72,1848.99,Which -- when they will be calculable.
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1861.89,1862.72,Absolutely not.
2005.05-130,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1897.17,1901.54,Is there a classic case where the injunction should not be issued?
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1901.54,1901.71,Yes.
2005.05-130,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1936.19,1937.9,Business processes?
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1937.9,1947.39,"Well, business processes are not -- the district court clearly erred here in saying that the mere debate about business process patents is a reason for withholding injunctions."
2005.05-130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1958.4,1958.68,Suppose --
2005.05-130,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1958.68,1960.75,I'm curious about your nonwillful infringer.
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1971.37,1976.44,We're not suggesting that automatically that there is withhold with relief because of a nonwillful infringement.
2005.05-130,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2011.21,2020.32,"Why is it your bottom line then, send it back with your four-factor test, because there seems to be some uncertainty whether that was applied?"
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2020.32,2032.5,"We don't think that's appropriate because, first of all, the -- the court of appeals did identify the factors the district court relied on that weighed on -- it thought weighed on eBay's side of the balance, and it properly rejected each one of those."
2005.05-130,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2062.1,2075.55,"There isn't an automatic distinction, but a person who licenses a patent and who is licensing a patent that probably won't be developed very much beyond what it is -- it's fairly easy to --I'll ask Mr. Waxman."
2005.05-130,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2075.55,2077.06,"Thank you, Your Honor.(Laughter)"
2005.05-130,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2077.06,2079.1,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2080.69,2082.65,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2005.05-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2219.64,2224.27,We also know by now that the patent office has rejected all of the claims of the patent.
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2225.5,2245.0,"The -- what we know is that --that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, with the following clarification, that the office action, as Mr. Minear has indicated, represents a -- an initial judgment by a staff member in the office."
2005.05-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2287.83,2293.22,Is that a factor that a district court could take into account in deciding whether to issue an injunction?
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2293.22,2293.45,I don't --
2005.05-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2293.45,2296.49,"Say the injunction question came up right now, today."
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2305.26,2325.21,"I think that -- the case that the U.S. cites in its footnote is an example where reexamination processes are underway when the case is first filed or when it's pending in the district court, and the district judge certainly has the discretion to say, I don't want to get into a -- a fight here about separation of powers and Hayburns case."
2005.05-130,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2424.5,2424.94,Why?
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2428.28,2428.51,Well --
2005.05-130,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2428.51,2445.74,"What I was going to ask was if you have a -- a patentee that does only license and, moreover, licenses only to people who, by and large, will not take that product and develop it further, then it's fairly easy to calculate damages."
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2475.32,2475.54,Justice --
2005.05-130,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2475.54,2488.3,"Couple that with a patent that, if you read it on page 2 of the red brief, reminds, at least one person who read it, namely me, that if this could be patented, maybe A&P could patent their process for a supermarket."
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2497.76,2501.81,"I've been asked to couple so many things together, I may forget some of the coupling."
2005.05-130,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2508.05,2513.89,The main point -- what I was trying to do is I was trying to take what I'd call the patent troll case.
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2513.89,2514.23,Okay.
2005.05-130,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2681.42,2693.83,"On that very point, my question there really was -- that was the heart of it -- that I don't think there's a moral or even patent-related value attached to whether you practice it yourself or not."
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2699.23,2699.46,Well --
2005.05-130,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2699.46,2701.86,But it's easier to calculate the damage.
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2725.44,2725.61,That's --
2005.05-130,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2725.61,2728.11,So the -- other things being equal --
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2728.11,2731.29,"In the case of a nonwillful infringer, a court in --"
2005.05-130,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2731.29,2731.71,No.
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2741.14,2752.33,"You know, the -- the -- there are 52 self-proclaimed intellectual property professors that filed a brief written by Professor Lemley in support of eBay in this case."
2005.05-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2873.09,2881.86,"Mr. Waxman, you mentioned, in -- in responding to the suggestion that we're dealing with a troll, you described -- what exactly is the invention here?"
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2881.86,2886.86,The -- the invention is a --it's -- it's not a business method.
2005.05-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2895.59,2896.51,Electric.

2005.05-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2898.44,2900.51,"-- he invented the, you know, internal combustion engine or anything."
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2904.41,2904.69,Well --
2005.05-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2904.69,2905.75,-- the district court mentioned.
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2924.13,2934.37,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, if it turns out that it's too hard and -- and the -- and a specific injunction can't be written, rule 65(d) requires that an injunction not issue."
2005.05-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2961.26,2970.2,"I may not be a software developer, but as I read the invention, it's displaying pictures of your wares on a computer network and, you know, picking which ones you want and buying them."
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2972.64,2981.05,"Well --(Laughter) -- I'll say respectfully that that is not a fair characterization of the innovation here, the actual innovation."
2005.05-130,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3021.65,3025.18,"Well, but the patent office staff has rejected all the claims."
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3026.38,3030.93,The patent office -- none of the claims have been rejected on indefinite grounds.
2005.05-130,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3139.66,3143.31,"Mr. Waxman, could you help me with something I just realized I have no conception of here?"
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3153.61,3161.08,You couldn't just say don't infringe anymore because rule 65(d) requires specificity and precision.
2005.05-130,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3179.32,3183.95,"The thought just occurs to me and I -- frankly, with all the briefs we've had, I feel kind of stupid not to have thought it before."
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3195.76,3196.65,Certainly not.
2005.05-130,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3262.66,3263.07,May I ask this?
2005.05-130,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3263.07,3264.62,These are patent portfolios --
2005.05-130,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3264.62,3266.14,One -- one short question.
