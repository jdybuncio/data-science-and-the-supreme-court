1982.81-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.074,We will hear arguments next in Dickerson against New Banner Institute.
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,58.443,83.325,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether a person who has been convicted of a felony in state court and who therefore is disabled from dealing in firearms under the Gun Contol Act of 1968 is relieved of these federal disabilities when his conviction is subsequently expunged under state law."
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,83.325,93.086,"Mr. Geller, is the question of whether or not this particular respondent was convicted before us?"
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,93.086,99.723,"Well, the Fourth Circuit held that he was convicted, and therefore we have not raised that question."
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,99.723,102.113,"I suppose we will have to wait, then, to hear respondent's argument--"
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,102.113,103.018,But respondent has--
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,103.018,105.532,--to see if he urges that as an alternate ground for affirmance?
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,105.532,106.893,"--Yes, I think that the respondent appears to."
1982.81-1180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,106.893,111.296,Was that mooted in the court of appeals?
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,111.296,113.312,The Fourth Circuit held that he was convicted.
1982.81-1180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,113.312,114.669,"Well, I know, but was it an issue?"
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,114.669,119.138,I am not sure whether the respondents raised it.
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,378.424,385.608,"Well, your statement there really subsumes the issue of conviction velno, doesn't it?"
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,386.936,397.618,We believe that the Fourth Circuit was correct in finding that the acceptance of the guilty plea constitutes a conviction for purposes of Sections 922(g) or (h).
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,410.489,414.221,Do you prefer to discuss the issue of conviction velno now or in rebuttal?
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,414.221,418.609,"I would be happy to discuss the issue now, if you would like, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,426.216,436.6,"Well, that strikes me as a rather strange proposition for the government to argue, unless you simply mean that it is a federal question and federal law refers to the laws of the several states."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,436.6,442.628,"--No, we think it is a federal question, that it is the intent of Congress that governs as to what the meaning of the word ""conviction"" was."
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,442.628,444.333,No one would doubt that.
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,444.333,444.894,Yes.
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,444.894,446.033,It is a statute that Congress passed.
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,446.033,446.536,Right.
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,446.536,451.126,"But the question is, how did Congress intend that the meaning of the word be sought?"
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,451.126,465.762,"Agreed, and what we think, the only thing that makes sense in line with the purposes that Congress intended to accomplish in the Gun Control Act was that a conviction means there has been a formal adjudication of guilt of a serious crime."
1982.81-1180,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,474.866,476.757,But how do you tell whether it is a formal adjudication?
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,481.709,483.269,Under Iowa law?
1982.81-1180,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,483.269,484.583,Iowa law.
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,484.583,492.313,"Well, we have explained in our reply brief that Iowa law is somewhat ambiguous as to whether they would consider this a conviction."
1982.81-1180,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,497.764,500.171,Do you know the case of Iowa against Walton?
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,528.671,531.093,"Well, as we pointed out in our--"
1982.81-1180,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,531.093,533.686,Just the opposite of your position here under state law.
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,533.686,553.195,"--Well, it may well be that for purposes of imposing punishment or granting of forgiveness, that Iowa law would not consider this to be a conviction for certain purposes, although I should point out in our reply brief we pointed out that the Supreme Court of Iowa has for other purposes considered the procedure just like the one that Kennison underwent a conviction for other purposes, such as--"
1982.81-1180,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,553.195,560.222,"Federal law certainly requires that we look to the state law to determine whether or not it is a felony, doesn't it?"
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,560.222,560.565,--It's a felony.
1982.81-1180,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,561.146,566.625,And it is arguable that under that Walton case it isn't a felony because there was no conviction.
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,566.625,568.501,"No, I think not, because it is not a question of a felony."
1982.81-1180,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,598.473,606.393,"Let me give you the citation of the Walton case, and if either of you have any comments, as far as I am concerned, you could submit them after the argument."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,628.835,642.237,"--Well, we... we obviously didn't make an exhaustive study of Iowa law, because in our view Congress couldn't have wanted the disabilities of the Act to turn upon such formalities as, for example, whether a judgment was entered."
1982.81-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,643.971,648.53,Or whether one state has deviated greatly from another--
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,648.53,648.92,--Yes.
1982.81-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,648.92,651.92,--so that a man could get a federal license in one state--
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,651.92,653.468,Precisely.
1982.81-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,653.468,654.887,"--and not in another, in the adjoining state."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,654.887,655.951,"Precisely, precisely, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.951,658.794,"But the felony definition certainly could embrace such deviations, and--"
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,658.794,663.228,"Well, it could, Justice Rehnquist, but we don't think it's likely to."
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,670.836,675.707,"--In Arizona, it is a felony to steal more than $50 worth of citrus."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,678.674,683.985,"But there are fail-safe mechanisms in the statute to deal with that situation, and I hope to get to them eventually."
1982.81-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,769.322,772.98,"Mr. Geller, you have used the word ""formal adjudication"" I think three times."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,778.509,780.911,"--I think that if the plea is accepted, as it was here--"
1982.81-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.911,785.24,"And the judge accepts and says, but I won't enter judgment until the two years runs by."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,797.734,798.92,--That's exactly right.
1982.81-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,806.652,815.446,"What if, instead of his accepting the plea, the judge just said, file the plea with the clerk, and come back in two years; in the meantime, you know, the condition is--"
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,815.446,817.618,That is precisely the situation that I was going to address.
1982.81-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,817.618,818.772,--What would you... Is that a formal adjudication or not?
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,818.772,819.786,That is.
1982.81-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,822.675,825.923,"What if the judge says, we will continue the case for two years?"
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,825.923,828.283,"--Well, I would have to know a little bit more."
1982.81-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,828.283,829.722,"You have to draw a line somewhere, don't you?"
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,829.722,838.874,"You would have to find the point where the judge has actually found the defendant committed the elements of a crime, and that all he is going to do thereafter is to determine the appropriate punishment."
1982.81-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,853.259,855.353,"His lawyer or he says, I am willing to plead guilty--"
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,855.353,856.242,"--Right, the judge--"
1982.81-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,856.242,858.052,--if... because it was just my wife's gun--
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,858.052,858.663,--Yes.
1982.81-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,858.663,862.145,"--and it is not a serious thing, and I am just willing to not do something for two years."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,864.692,867.114,"Well, no, it doesn't depend on how the defendant says that."
1982.81-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,932.259,933.71,But here is there a judgment or--
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,933.71,935.024,Here there... here... Yes.
1982.81-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,938.382,939.567,--He couldn't place him on probation--
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,939.567,940.191,--That's exactly--
1982.81-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,940.191,941.114,"--if he didn't enter a judgment, could he?"
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,941.114,941.519,--Absolutely.
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,947.814,951.593,Are you saying in response to the Chief Justice's question that there was a judgment?
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,951.593,952.938,There was an order entered.
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,954.139,954.888,Well--
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,954.888,960.776,I am not sure that we should have what Congress intended to accomplish in this important federal statute turn--
1982.81-1180,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,960.776,966.524,"--Well, suppose the court had said, I accept your plea of guilty and sentence you to five years in the penitentiary?"
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,966.524,967.476,--Yes.
1982.81-1180,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,967.476,970.962,"And he doesn't say, I find you guilty, and he doesn't issue a judgment."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,970.962,974.507,"Well, I assume the sentence in that situation would be the judgment."
1982.81-1180,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,974.507,976.787,The sentence would be the... but he didn't say judgment.
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,976.787,981.284,I don't... that's exactly... I don't think that Congress's important purposes here turn on how--
1982.81-1180,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.284,986.782,"Well, the judge had to do something to justify keeping him... keeping the gentleman... under his control for a year."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,986.782,987.203,--Exactly.
1982.81-1180,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,998.933,1000.325,What would happen with a pardon?
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1001.308,1002.181,A pardon?
1982.81-1180,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1002.181,1003.448,The same thing.
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1003.448,1007.227,"It is interesting that you mention a pardon, because Congress dealt with a pardon."
1982.81-1180,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1007.227,1008.069,"Yes, that's what I mean."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1008.069,1023.484,"Congress dealt with a pardon in Title VII, and it said that a pardon, if it specifically announces that the defendant is still... is to be allowed to engage in carrying of firearms, serves to relieve disabilities, but Congress did not say that in Title IV, which is the statute at issue here."
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1105.841,1107.249,What page is that on in your brief?
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1107.249,1113.715,"--It's in the very back of the brief, in the statutory appendix, Justice Rehnquist, on Page--"
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.715,1115.231,"Page 3-A, I think."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1115.231,1117.088,"--Yes, Page 3-A."
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1188.807,1199.383,Is it correct to think that under 925(c) the Secretary may not grant relief if the crime in question is one... is one involving the use of a firearm or other weapon?
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1199.383,1199.976,That's correct.
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1233.917,1239.353,"Well, but that might happen in any number of ways, Mr. Geller, and certainly some of which Congress couldn't prevent."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1255.969,1259.986,"Well, Congress obviously had to bow to the... to certain realities."
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1272.229,1273.431,"You used the word ""convicted""."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1273.431,1274.491,"--Yes, I understand."
1982.81-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1279.46,1295.811,"Mr. Geller, assuming with you for a moment there was a conviction, so we don't get off onto that again, supposing that the man convicted appealed, and the conviction was set aside, or there is a collateral attack on the ground he didn't have counsel, or he didn't plead knowingly."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1302.385,1306.245,"Well, we don't think that would accomplish Congress's purpose."
1982.81-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1308.835,1311.771,"In other words, if you have exactly the same facts you have here--"
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1311.771,1312.493,Yes.
1982.81-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1312.493,1326.878,"--but instead of expunction, the man comes in with a lawyer and files a corum nobis writ or something like that and says, I want that conviction set aside because it was really my wife's gun and not mine, and I didn't realize that it had to be my gun, and therefore set it aside."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1333.562,1342.916,"Yes, but I think that... I mean, I think that is perfectly consistent with Congress's purpose in selecting out people who have had convictions entered against them."
1982.81-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1342.916,1345.462,It turns on the reason for the state action--
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1345.462,1346.913,Is relevant.
1982.81-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.913,1347.541,--of vacating the judgment.
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1347.541,1348.04,Yes.
1982.81-1180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.501,1370.608,"Yes, but it is equally reliable if you reverse on the ground that the evidence was improperly obtained with a search warrant, or something like that."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1370.608,1376.621,"Well, there may also be constitutional problems in imposing disabilities on someone who has had his conviction reversed, but we don't have to reach that."
1982.81-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1433.568,1445.72,"In other words, a conviction for manslaughter by use of an automobile might be the kind that the Secretary would have discretion to waive."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1445.72,1446.39,Absolutely.
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1467.084,1474.568,"Well, the Secretary can grant relief, can't he, for a triple first degree murder punishable by death if it was committed with a knife."
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1474.568,1475.738,"Yes, he could."
1982.81-1180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1485.67,1491.309,Do you think the Secretary of the Treasury spends a lot of his waking hours passing on these applications?
1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1491.309,1500.243,"--I would be surprised if he spends very much time, but there are people in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms who do spend a great deal of time studying these applications and making individualized inquiries."

1982.81-1180,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1505.538,1506.867,I think that's right.
1982.81-1180,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1711.549,1712.641,Very well.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,1715.873,1730.181,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, beginning with Justice Rehnquist's questions concerning conviction, we have argued in the brief that whatever happened in Iowa was not a conviction."
1982.81-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1730.181,1732.743,Did you present this to the court of appeals?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,1732.743,1734.354,"No, Your Honor, we did not."
1982.81-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1734.354,1738.507,The court of appeals had no way of passing on it then.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,1738.507,1739.599,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1739.599,1747.035,And you think that... you are suggesting affirmance on this ground.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,1747.035,1759.965,"Yes, Your Honor, on the basis that in the Fourth Circuit's opinion, they do talk in terms of a conviction, but in other portions of the opinion they talk about a temporary disability running because of the Iowa action."
1982.81-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1759.965,1768.01,"My question is whether you... you must believe, then, that under our rules you are entitled to present this issue."
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,1768.01,1769.714,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.9,1771.914,"Well, I know, but--"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,1771.914,1782.302,"But since it was argued, we feel that we should have an opportunity to reply to the conviction element of the case."
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1782.302,1799.607,"--Are you suggesting that the court of appeals uses the term ""conviction"" casually and loosely, without regard to consequences of the use of that term, having a statute before them where that was very relevant?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,1799.607,1807.961,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe the Fourth Circuit did in their holding indicate... go away from the term ""conviction""."
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1819.85,1824.3,"Relieved for all purposes, under all circumstances?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,1824.3,1830.031,"That was the holding of the Fourth Circuit, that the relief was unconditional and absolute."
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1837.592,1847.603,Are we or are we not bound to accept the court of appeals' holding as a determination that there was in law and fact a conviction in Iowa?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,1847.603,1849.697,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think you are correct."
1982.81-1180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.697,1856.069,"Well, Mr. Lanier, does that mean you are retreating from the position you took in your brief?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,1858.066,1858.911,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1858.911,1867.003,"On Page 14, in your summary of argument, where you say in the first short full paragraph on the page,"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,1877.184,1883.291,"Justice Rehnquist, that is a statement of our position on the brief."
1982.81-1180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.291,1890.821,"Well, then, you do assert that, quite apart from the Fourth Circuit's ruling on expunction, there never was a conviction under the statute in the first place."
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,1891.741,1893.036,That's correct.
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1893.036,1904.564,"Then we have to read the opinion again and see whether when they used... the three judges used the term ""conviction"" they mean what lawyers and judges usually mean by the term ""conviction""."
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,1904.564,1915.357,"Which, Mr. Chief Justice, seems to vary a great deal, adding to the ambiguity created by the federal Act and the use of the term ""has been convicted""."
1982.81-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.357,1922.243,"But you never... you didn't suggest to the court of appeals what happened here shouldn't be considered a conviction, did you?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,1930.85,1936.02,"Your Honor, I believe there was argument at the Fourth Circuit that it was not a conviction."
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1936.02,1939.909,What was expunged?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,1939.909,1948.309,"Mr. Justice Marshall, what was expunged was the record of the Iowa deferred judgment proceedings."
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2018.172,2020.609,All I... I want to ask a very simple question.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2022.481,2025.89,--The record of the deferred judgment proceedings in Iowa.
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2025.89,2027.434,The entire proceeding?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2027.434,2028.686,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2028.686,2047.005,"Do you think Congress contemplated that this national legislation should be subject to the idiosyncracies of more than fifty different state statutes, and twenty odd thousand judges' interpretation of that statute in those states?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2047.005,2056.61,"I think that Congress did interpret that way by using the state definition of the sentence, the maximum sentence, to trigger the disabilities under the federal Act."
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2060.576,2062.202,How does that help you?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2062.202,2064.058,Looking at--
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2064.058,2067.123,"Here is something for which the punishment was more than one year, was it not?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2067.123,2067.981,--That's correct.
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2080.585,2095.344,"Well, if Congress meant what you are suggesting, wouldn't it have been very simple to add a few words, that is, unless such conviction is expunged, or unless the record of such proceeding is expunged?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2095.344,2097.594,Congress could have done that.
1982.81-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.09,2193.74,Do you think a license could have been issued... would he have a right to have a license the day after his guilty plea?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2193.74,2195.725,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.441,2206.924,"Well, if that is so, he must have been convicted within the meaning of the statute."
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2211.689,2212.672,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.672,2215.296,"Well, then, there had to be a conviction, didn't there?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2215.296,2221.871,"Your Honor, I find the Iowa statute there a little bit unique in the criminal concept--"
1982.81-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.871,2226.574,"Well, it may be unique, but you have said that he was disqualified during the period of his probation."
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2226.574,2230.009,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but he was still--"
1982.81-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.009,2232.209,Within the meaning of this federal statute.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2232.209,2236.241,"--Yes, he was disqualified during that period of probation."
1982.81-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.241,2243.081,"That had to mean that for a while, anyway, there was a conviction."
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2243.081,2262.901,"Your Honor, we take the position that the defendant in this case actually consented to the probation under the terms of the Iowa statute, and that Iowa has spoken in this term, and said, we don't want the criminal law to come into effect in this particular case."
1982.81-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.132,2276.897,"Of course, your other argument is that even if there was a conviction, it was removed by the expunction."
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2276.897,2277.911,That's correct.
1982.81-1180,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2279.128,2283.784,"Mr. Lanier, did you represent the client before the court of appeals?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2283.784,2285.456,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1180,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2285.456,2287.453,And before the Administrative Law Judge?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2287.453,2294.951,"No, Justice O'Connor, my law partner represented him before the Administrative Law Judge, Judge Travis."
1982.81-1180,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2304.603,2308.117,You did not make the oral argument?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2308.117,2309.053,At Fourth Circuit?
1982.81-1180,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2309.053,2309.493,Yes.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2309.493,2310.663,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2313.147,2316.411,Was the case orally argued to the Fourth Circuit?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2316.411,2318.598,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2318.598,2319.316,But not by you?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2319.316,2320.377,That's correct.
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2320.377,2325.984,Could you have made the same argument if it hadn't been expunged?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2325.984,2329.372,Justice Marshall--
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2329.372,2331.498,"And I used ""it"" deliberately."
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2333.435,2334.121,--No.
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2334.121,2335.416,Why not?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2335.416,2338.586,Because the expunction was an unconditional action.
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2338.586,2338.851,No.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2339.787,2341.414,"Why not... I'm sorry, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2341.414,2341.851,Why not?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2343.567,2345.832,Arguing that the expunction--
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2345.832,2349.362,That you were entitled to a license.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2349.362,2352.204,--If it hadn't been expunged--
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2352.204,2354.251,What hadn't been expunged?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2354.251,2356.61,--The record of the deferred judgment proceedings.
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2356.61,2357.796,"Your conviction, right?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2357.796,2361.652,"No, Your Honor, we still resist the fact that there was a conviction."
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.869,2375.461,But the state is the one that decides today he is and tomorrow he is not.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2375.461,2377.617,In conjunction with the defendant.
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2379.239,2380.303,That's right.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2386.769,2388.22,That's correct.
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2388.22,2389.378,"The day after it, he could get it."
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2389.378,2390.766,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2390.766,2393.609,So the state is deciding a federal statute.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2414.225,2419.193,The trial judge in conjunction with the defendant elected a deferred judgment.
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2419.193,2421.755,"Well, there had to be a proceeding first, did there not?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2421.755,2423.284,There was a proceeding.
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2423.284,2427.909,"Charging him with kidnapping, was it, and armed conduct?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2427.909,2430.112,The kidnapping charges were dismissed prior to--
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2430.112,2434.874,"Yes, I know, but the charge was... that's how he got into the court, was it not?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2434.874,2436.718,--That's correct.
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2439.685,2442.793,In connection with the kidnapping?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2442.793,2445.573,The result of a plea bargain.
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2445.573,2447.636,"Well, no, I'm talking about the facts now."
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2459.506,2465.532,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe the charge of kidnapping was dropped, and then the possession--"
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2465.532,2471.314,"Yes, I know it was dropped, but the initial charge was a charge of kidnapping using a firearm."
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2472.344,2473.405,--That's not correct.
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2473.405,2475.764,"Well, then, tell me what is the charge."
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2475.764,2480.245,He was initially charged with the only charge of kidnapping.
1982.81-1180,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2480.245,2480.559,Yes.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2481.838,2489.369,"His wife, a South Carolina citizen in Iowa."
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2498.303,2498.646,A new charge.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2498.646,2505.969,"A new charge, which was... which was the subject of the negotiated or the conditional plea in Iowa."
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2505.969,2516.857,"So his plea then was an admission that whatever he did, whether you call it kidnapping or whatever, whatever the offense was, it was accomplished by him by the use of a firearm."
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2518.011,2524.776,"Mr. Chief Justice, I say that is not correct, either, because there may be a difference in terms between use and possession."
1982.81-1180,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2530.68,2533.347,Whose gun was it?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2533.347,2536.178,It was his wife's gun also.
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2577.064,2588.062,"But are we entitled to assume on this record that whatever he did that led to the charge of kidnapping, he did it at a time when he had a firearm on his person or in his possession?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2588.062,2589.625,Yes.
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2647.225,2651.927,Was an order issued at the end of his trial?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2651.927,2657.519,--Some type of order was issued that was not a judgment.
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2657.519,2659.423,Is it in the record any place?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2659.423,2663.298,"Your Honor, I don't think that order is in the record."
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2663.298,2666.874,"Well, isn't it rather important as to what happened?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2666.874,2668.934,"I am sorry, Justice Marshall."
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2668.934,2670.434,Isn't it rather important?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2677.306,2678.698,Absolutely.
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2678.698,2680.788,"And I don't know what he said, do I?"
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2682.04,2683.694,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2683.694,2685.943,Thank you.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2699.704,2713.949,"The only record... the record of the... the Iowa statute compels the expunction, it does not specify the destruction, of the deferred judgment proceedings."
1982.81-1180,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2745.999,2751.572,What are the contents of the administrative record after the expungement proceeding is terminated?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2754.606,2757.632,The statute does not tell us what it contains.
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2917.102,2918.568,Excuse me.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2931.686,2935.015,The appendix from Fourth Circuit was adopted.
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2938.498,2939.824,--Blue binding?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2940.795,2948.01,--I believe that the appendix from the Fourth Circuit was submitted by the petitioner.
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2948.01,2952.038,Nine copies?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2962.832,2964.911,"That's correct, and that was granted."
1982.81-1180,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2964.911,2967.737,"So it has just been... it has been filed here, like a record."
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2968.657,2969.655,That's correct.
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2969.655,2972.076,Ask the clerk over there.
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2980.777,2986.197,"Yes, the record has been filed."
1982.81-1180,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2986.197,2990.319,Where is it?
1982.81-1180,1,34727,lewis_c_lanier,,2990.319,3014.855,"The fact of the expunction has been addressed, as I stated previously, under Ferguson, Frier, and Arrington, and in those circuit courts the court has held that the federal expunction under the Youthful Offender Act effectively lifts the disabilities imposed upon the federal Gun Control Act."
1982.81-1180,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3019.85,3021.523,Very well.
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3023.352,3025.867,"One or two things, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3031.314,3032.27,Does not?
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3032.27,3032.894,Does not.
1982.81-1180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3038.47,3055.573,"Mr. Geller, supposing you had exactly the same procedure you had here in Iowa, and 30 days after the guilty plea was accepted and there was a conviction entered, the defendant came in by his attorney and moved for leave to withdraw his guilty plea, and said he had misunderstood, just, whatever charges."
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3063.49,3068.348,"I would... My position would be, I think the government's position would be that there would not be a conviction in that case."
1982.81-1180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3075.375,3077.407,But the same finding... I want to have the same finding that you got here.
1982.81-1180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3077.407,3081.891,"Yes, but an expunction is not a finding that the defendant did not commit the crime."
1982.81-1180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3082.671,3083.888,"Well, but in my hypothetical, the same thing."
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3083.888,3084.781,Yes.
1982.81-1180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3086.918,3094.697,"Supposing two years later, then, just instead of expunging, he came in and said, I move to withdraw my guilty plea, and the judge said, motion granted."
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3094.697,3097.743,"--Well, I think I would have to know more about the state procedure to see whether this is--"
1982.81-1180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3097.743,3099.993,Same state procedure you have got here.
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3099.993,3103.365,"--If there is no... if it is just an expunction, if there is no finding that the--"
1982.81-1180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3103.365,3111.582,It just gives the judge the authority to allow the defendant at the end of the probation period to withdraw his guilty plea.
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3111.582,3118.219,"--I would think that if the basis for the relief, it has nothing to do with the fact that the defendant did not commit the crime--"
1982.81-1180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.219,3122.232,"He just says in his motion, I want to withdraw it, and the prosecutor doesn't oppose it."
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3123.905,3124.81,--We don't.
1982.81-1180,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3151.081,3156.235,"Well, do you think Boykin was attempting to categorize guilty pleas in a strictly technical sense?"
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3156.235,3159.811,"--No, of course... of course not, but we are trying to categorize what Congress meant by... what it meant when it used the word ""conviction""."
1982.81-1180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3210.588,3213.055,"I don't mean to be too repetitious, Mr. Geller, but I am not sure I understand your answer to my question."
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3213.055,3213.414,Yes.
1982.81-1180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3213.414,3214.085,And it really would be helpful to me.
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3214.085,3214.961,Yes.
1982.81-1180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3214.961,3216.443,Take my hypothetical.
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3239.186,3242.528,"Well, if I may, I would like to give a somewhat more extended answer than one word."
1982.81-1180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3245.277,3246.088,I understand that.
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3246.088,3253.587,"On the other pole, it seems to me we have the Kennison situation, where there is no question that the conviction was expunged for reasons wholly unrelated to guilt."
1982.81-1180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3262.77,3264.439,Are you able to answer my hypothetical?
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3264.439,3272.016,"--I think the answer is that if the judge has not made a finding that the defendant did not commit the crime, then there has been a conviction."
1982.81-1180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3274.499,3276.671,"Your answer is, under my hypothetical, he would be disabled."
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3279.23,3283.933,"I think that's my answer, but I'd like to know more of the facts before I commit the government to that position."
1982.81-1180,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3283.933,3289.416,But those facts and the hypothesized statute aren't present in this case.
1982.81-1180,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3289.416,3291.79,Are not what the Court has before us here by any means.
1982.81-1180,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3292.804,3293.584,"Thank you, gentlemen."
