1965.58,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,26.534,"Number 58, Edward J. Brenner, Commissioner of Patents, Petitioner, versus Andrew John Manson."
1965.58,0,29930,j_william_doolittle,,27.833,30.732,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.58,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,38.171,39.322,Motion is granted.
1965.58,1,37685,paul_bender,,57.965,61.526,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.58,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,123.071,131.733,I've read the other day that they're making wonderful things out of garbage these days.
1965.58,1,37685,paul_bender,,131.733,136.534,"If you can make wonderful things out of garbage, then that would be a useful process."
1965.58,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,180.538,184.67,"But last time, as Mr. Justice Douglas just pointed out, eventually do."
1965.58,1,37685,paul_bender,,184.67,185.621,That's true.
1965.58,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,185.621,191.011,We've all read about the days when they used to dump gasoline -- as a -- as a waste byproduct when they were making the kerosene --
1965.58,1,37685,paul_bender,,191.011,191.795,That's true.
1965.58,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,204.102,206.392,(Voice Overlap) Mr. Bender is that maybe you can't now.Yes.
1965.58,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,206.392,212.351,But who is to say that it is not going to be anything that you might mention that can be very useful.
1965.58,1,37685,paul_bender,,212.351,214.467,That's true.
1965.58,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,273.441,284.008,"Your thought is that -- that in order to find out or to have any hope of someday ascertaining whether Product A is useful, you should not have a patent on them."
1965.58,1,37685,paul_bender,,284.008,286.401,"Right, just on the hope that it may be useful."
1965.58,2,21116,dean_laurence,,3179.052,3183.499,-- questions and I trust the same situation will prevail this afternoon.
1965.58,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3243.167,3246.009,It's the only compound that makes this (Inaudible)
1965.58,2,21116,dean_laurence,,3246.009,3248.022,It makes a class of compounds.
1965.58,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3259.102,3265.812,"Are all of them or whatever the claims are, I gather Bremner's completion is through all the use."
1965.58,2,21116,dean_laurence,,3265.812,3268.428,That is the position of the Government.
1965.58,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3268.428,3270.171,Is that conceded?
1965.58,2,21116,dean_laurence,,3270.171,3273.551,"No, Your Honor, that is not conceded."
1965.58,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3273.551,3282.673,I thought I understood Mr. Bender to say that there was no disagreement on who's to -- as to whether the product was useful or not.
1965.58,2,21116,dean_laurence,,3282.673,3287.496,"I think, he so stated, Mr. Chief Justice but we do not concede that."
1965.58,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3306.417,3311.173,Was it accidentally discovered or did you set out to discover that particular kind.
1965.58,2,21116,dean_laurence,,3311.173,3327.155,"In answer to your question Mr. Justice Black, there was an article published in a journal, antecedent, anything that occurred here involving Manson or involving the Ringold patent which we're trying to get into interference with."
1965.58,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3379.212,3381.999,You mean the article showed that it would have a use?
1965.58,2,21116,dean_laurence,,3381.999,3384.453,"Yes, that is why we say --"
1965.58,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3384.453,3386.176,What field?
1965.58,2,21116,dean_laurence,,3389.903,3394.842,"It very definitely has something to do with the legal point, Mr. Justice Black."
1965.58,3,37685,paul_bender,,7026.991,7037.041,"In light of the confusion which seems to exist of what the issue is before the Court, I'd like to respond to any question if the Court still has on that."
1965.58,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7076.538,7085.554,"Well, do you think they proceeded on the hypothesis that the product was useless because they -- even on that hypothesis they held that the process patent was still valid."
1965.58,3,37685,paul_bender,,7085.554,7088.808,"Yes, it makes sense in terms of the rule of law they were adopted not to get into these allegations."
1965.58,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7088.808,7103.441,"Right, and so assuming this Court might agree -- disagree with them on the rule of law should not be responded have the opportunity of litigating the fact of whether or not the product was useful."
1965.58,3,37685,paul_bender,,7103.441,7107.567,"Well, certainly he should only have it if he raised that issue before the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals."
1965.58,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7107.567,7108.45,Well do you say you don't know the answer?
1965.58,3,37685,paul_bender,,7108.45,7110.049,I don't know the answer to that.
1965.58,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7178.73,7185.013,"But Mr. Bender, suppose it's not this case, so I get the Government's argument."
1965.58,3,37685,paul_bender,,7224.076,7227.719,That would depend upon whether Manson was in the prior art.
1965.58,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7241.951,7243.31,"Well, suppose it was?"
1965.58,3,37685,paul_bender,,7243.31,7243.878,Then --
1965.58,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7243.878,7244.838,Neither of them get a patent.
1965.58,3,37685,paul_bender,,7244.838,7246.217,Then neither of them would get a patent.
1965.58,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7246.217,7250.426,"What this earlier case that we heard argued this morning it's co-pending patents, is that right?"
1965.58,3,37685,paul_bender,,7250.426,7250.996,Yes.
1965.58,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7250.996,7252.885,You've just given that one away --
1965.58,3,37685,paul_bender,,7252.885,7254.62,"Which, that one?"
1965.58,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7254.62,7257.947,I thought you did.
1965.58,3,37685,paul_bender,,7257.947,7259.501,I don't understand which --
1965.58,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7259.501,7265.514,"If you win the co-pending patent case automatically in Justice Brennan's example, neither one of them can get a patent."
1965.58,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7265.514,7268.302,"In this case, on the hypothetical example."
1965.58,3,37685,paul_bender,,7268.302,7269.68,Oh no!
1965.58,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7269.68,7270.933,Who gets the patent?
1965.58,3,37685,paul_bender,,7270.933,7281.738,"Because as I said in the -- if Manson's application was denied, and Manson did not publish his findings because he has no obligation to publish."
1965.58,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7285.325,7289.716,Isn't it a pending -- it's just like the earlier case.
1965.58,3,37685,paul_bender,,7289.716,7290.31,Yes.
1965.58,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7290.31,7293.145,Manson's application is a co-pending application.
1965.58,3,37685,paul_bender,,7293.145,7294.214,"No, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1965.58,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7330.302,7331.764,-- may I ask this question?
1965.58,3,37685,paul_bender,,7331.764,7336.079,Yes.
