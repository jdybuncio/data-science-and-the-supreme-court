1980.79-5949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.106,We will hear arguments first this morning in Watkins against Bordenkircher and Summitt against Bordenkircher.
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,15.176,18.395,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-5949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,69.494,75.298,This is as to the admissibility of any identification evidence?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,75.298,78.933,"Yes, be it a show up, line up, or--"
1980.79-5949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,78.933,81.452,Or a proposed identification in Court?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,81.452,82.82,"--That's correct, Justice Stewart."
1980.79-5949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,83.854,87.856,What you're saying is that cross examination is not sufficient?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,87.856,89.224,--Exactly.
1980.79-5949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,132.068,139.907,"The first three cases you mentioned had to do with; the first two with a line up and the third one with a show up, so called?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,139.907,140.991,That's correct.
1980.79-5949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,140.991,150.012,"And the second cases, category of cases you mentioned, had to do with identification in court?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,150.012,168.39,"Well Biggers, when the... I believe when the test shifted to Biggers, there was a show up conducted in the Biggers case and the Court determined, rather than to rely only on the... the only test was that various factors had to be determined--"
1980.79-5949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,168.39,182.131,"The question in Biggers, as I remember it, I haven't read it recently, was how much of an opportunity did the victim of the rape in that case have to, actually have to identify the defendant, isn't that it?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,182.131,182.566,--Exactly.
1980.79-5949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,196.541,197.326,In Court?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,197.326,198.459,Yes.
1980.79-5949,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,198.459,200.861,"There was not a line up in Biggers, was there?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,200.861,202.828,"No, just the show up."
1980.79-5949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,271.207,284.682,"Counsel, did you make and preserve this right to counsel argument as opposed to the Wade, Stovall, Denno argument all through the Kentucky courts into the District Court in the Sixth Circuit?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,284.682,289.384,"--Justice Rehnquist, I don't think anyone ever questioned the individual's right to counsel."
1980.79-5949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,320.605,334.864,"You mean that when the in court identification was offered by the prosecution, did you then at that time ask for a hearing outside the presence of the jury?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,334.864,338.566,"--In Watkins' case, there was a pretrial motion filed to suppress."
1980.79-5949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,338.566,340.232,That isn't what I asked you.
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,344.053,345.053,That's correct.
1980.79-5949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,345.053,350.724,And did you ask at the time when the trial was going on for a hearing outside the presence of the jury?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,350.724,351.34,Pretrial.
1980.79-5949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,368.602,370.052,You still haven't answered Justice Rehnquist's--
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,371.371,371.821,No.
1980.79-5949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,372.988,375.222,--So that you didn't raise the point in the state court?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,375.222,380.893,"It was raised and it was considered by, particularly, the Sixth Circuit."
1980.79-5949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,380.893,387.999,"Well, but the Sixth Circuit on a habeas can't consider a point that wasn't raised and considered in the state courts, can they?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,387.999,391.784,The state courts did not specifically address the Jackson issue.
1980.79-5949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,391.784,393.903,Because you hadn't raised it?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,393.903,398.521,"It had been... Jackson had not been, specifically raised."
1980.79-5949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,398.521,409.929,Well why did the federal habeas court think that you had exhausted your state remedies on this particular question?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,409.929,415.399,"Well the Kentucky Supreme Court just found, in both of these cases, that there was no due process right."
1980.79-5949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,415.399,417.349,"To what, to what?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,417.349,421.303,To have the in camera hearing before eye witness identification could be admitted.
1980.79-5949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,421.303,423.32,"Well, so you did raise it in the state court?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,423.32,426.022,That specific issue was raised.
1980.79-5949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,426.022,429.326,"Yes, but was it... on the grounds of what?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,431.876,432.611,Due process.
1980.79-5949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,438.432,442.217,Well Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked you if you had presented that issue in the state courts?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,442.217,448.121,"Well Justice White, it had not been raised specifically in Jackson v. Denno terms in the state court."
1980.79-5949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,448.921,457.726,"Well I don't care whether you... it isn't so much whether you cited Jackson against Denno, but it's whether or not you claimed that the federal constitution as a matter of due process--"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,457.726,458.543,"--Yes, it was claimed--"
1980.79-5949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,458.543,462.13,--requires you to... requires an in camera hearing.
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,462.13,462.813,"--Yes sir, it was."
1980.79-5949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,464.513,470.034,"You've now embellished it with this, it's really a right to counsel, due process argument, is that it?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,470.034,476.121,"--It has certain ramifications for effective assistance of counsel, that's our position."
1980.79-5949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,476.121,477.64,"Well the evidence was admitted, wasn't it?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,477.64,478.473,Yes sir.
1980.79-5949,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,478.473,481.675,And you don't challenge that it wasn't admissible?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,490.715,496.285,That's the issue to be determined and that's the value of the in camera hearing.
1980.79-5949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,542.813,554.788,"The rule you're advocating would apply, I take it to, as equally, to six witnesses, identification witnesses or 12, as it does to one, would it not?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,554.788,555.473,--Yes.
1980.79-5949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,555.473,578.319,"And it would apply outside the identification field, I would take it, because a trial attorney has to make that sort of determination you're talking about, how much did the prosecutor accomplish on direct, with respect to every single witness in the case, whether to decline cross examination, make an extensive cross examination, or the like?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,578.319,579.755,That's true.
1980.79-5949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,632.573,654.986,"So you're saying, in effect, that the Constitution requires that there be this in camera or pretrial exploration so that the attorney can decide whether he wants to cross examine and if so, how much; isn't that what it adds up to?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,654.986,659.04,"--It adds up to a question of the effective assistance of counsel, and--"
1980.79-5949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,659.04,660.523,"No, just answer my question."
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,662.909,663.575,--Yes.
1980.79-5949,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,664.109,684.905,"Now, if it's a hold up of a bank, or a supermarket, and you've got 12 witnesses, eyewitnesses, you're going to, on your theory, have to have the in camera examination of each one of those witnesses to see how fallible or how strong their identification may be?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,684.905,685.807,That's correct.
1980.79-5949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,685.807,698.248,"Would you extend the same rule to the testimony of a police officer in a drug case who testifies that yes, this white substance was a controlled substance?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,698.248,698.715,No sir.
1980.79-5949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,702.736,706.771,But what logical ground is there to separate one from the other?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,706.771,718.162,"Well, you would not... I think, primarily, the constitutional ramifications of suggestive identification procedures and unreliability of identification evidence."
1980.79-5949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,742.159,745.044,Well you're talking about reliability?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,745.044,745.977,Exactly.
1980.79-5949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,747.413,754.3,Would you also give the state the right to examine alibi witnesses ahead of time?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,754.3,759.303,"--I think that's a matter, Justice Marshall, of state procedural law."
1980.79-5949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,759.303,767.476,Well why isn't this also a matter... what part of the Constitution says you have to have a rerun of your evidence?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,767.476,771.511,"There's nothing in the Constitution that says you have to have a rerun of your evidence, but the Constitution says--"
1980.79-5949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,771.511,777.165,What is there in the Constitution that says that the government has to help you in your case?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,777.165,779.784,--I don't know if it's so much... there's nothing--
1980.79-5949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,779.784,787.973,What is there in the Constitution that says that the government should do what you should do yourself as defense counsel?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,787.973,790.09,--I think the Sixth Amendment requires the hearing.
1980.79-5949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,790.09,792.775,That the government should do what you ought to do yourself?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,792.775,795.21,The Constitution requires the government to do it.
1980.79-5949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,797.078,806.867,Well what in the Constitution says that you should have the right to examine one class of witnesses before they are put on the stand?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,806.867,808.886,--I think it's the nature of the evidence.
1980.79-5949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,808.886,810.536,"Oh, it's the nature of the evidence."
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,810.536,811.003,"Yes, this--"
1980.79-5949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,811.003,813.305,In any kind of case?
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,813.305,815.055,"--No sir, not at all."
1980.79-5949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,815.055,817.673,"What kind of a case, a rape case?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,817.673,821.125,One's a rape case and one's a robbery case.
1980.79-5949,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,821.708,823.743,"Well, is it restricted to those?"
1980.79-5949,0,24092,frank_w_heft_jr,,823.743,824.843,--No sir.
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,1851.245,1854.964,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-5949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1994.12,2010.082,"I suppose it would be an advantage to both the prosecution and defense if there could be a complete dress rehearsal and make believe trial in advance with cross examination of every witness and direct examination, would it not?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2010.082,2017.07,"Not only in trial, but before this Honorable Court, I would certainly appreciate a rehearsal of this argument before standing up here."
1980.79-5949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2056.528,2061.349,"Attorney General Fox, isn't there another consideration which you at least think about in a case like this?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2080.412,2085.78,"Well, that which we're going after is the likelihood of irreparable misidentification."
1980.79-5949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2085.78,2093.82,"And is it not true that if inadmissible show up identification testimony went in, it could be highly prejudicial?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2093.82,2095.838,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-5949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2095.838,2100.874,And the purpose of the pretrial suppression hearing would be to avoid that kind of prejudice?
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2100.874,2103.809,There is an alternative to that.
1980.79-5949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2159.428,2177.474,"Mr. Fox, in your response to Justice Stevens' question, at what point did you assume that the determination was made, that the identification witness or testimony was unduly suggestive?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2181.794,2189.532,"No, Your Honor, I made the assumption that the motion, it was following a motion by defense counsel during trial."
1980.79-5949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2189.532,2197.038,After the testimony had gone in?
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2197.038,2198.572,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-5949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2245.201,2271.686,"Well what you're positing then, is a situation where, on a question by question basis, which is the way cross examinations and direct examinations take place, the judge allows a witness to testify in such a manner, overrules objections to individual questions, and then at the end of a line of questioning, comes to the conclusion that he should have sustained them?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2271.686,2274.221,"It can go both ways, Your Honor."
1980.79-5949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2362.695,2365.545,"Attorney General Fox, let me change... just give you a hypothetical."
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2392.465,2400.452,"Normally there would be a motion to suppress, based on those grounds; there would be conduct of a hearing to determine that particular issue."
1980.79-5949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2402.736,2408.724,"Then there's the point in this case, that the evidence was clearly admissible and therefore there was no need for the hearing."
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2420.365,2423.584,--If there were sufficient... I think it would be--
1980.79-5949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2423.584,2430.238,"Well in the case I gave you, say, I say you say you think they would allow hearing, would you say the Constitution would require it in that situation?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2430.238,2432.273,"--Per se, no, Your Honor, I do not."
1980.79-5949,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2440.612,2448.717,Such as the fact that the witness said that the man looked like he was around 30; and the man was actually 17?
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2448.717,2450.001,That could be a factor.
1980.79-5949,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2450.001,2451.336,Well that was Watkins.
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2451.336,2457.573,"That was Watkins, however, Watkins was identified in Court without any reference to the pretrial."
1980.79-5949,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2465.827,2473.5,"I'm sorry, Mr. Fox, did I understand your brother to say that Kentucky has now adopted a rule governing this question?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2473.5,2476.702,"No, Your Honor, in fact, not to my knowledge."
1980.79-5949,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2476.702,2479.071,Perhaps I misunderstood him.
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2479.071,2488.692,"Normally, in our jurisdiction, a motion to suppress... there is, it's made pretrial, and the courts go into it."
1980.79-5949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2490.294,2491.478,I didn't hear you.
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2491.478,2502.102,"--I said normally there is a motion made pretrial to suppress, and there is at least a hearing, a determination as to whether or not the motion will be granted or not."
1980.79-5949,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2503.452,2506.304,"Well what happens at that, in that proceeding?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2508.256,2509.956,"--It can be, Your Honor."
1980.79-5949,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2525.465,2528.752,"I guess you have to come prepared to put on evidence, if you have to?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2528.752,2529.735,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-5949,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2529.735,2531.002,Should you be?
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2531.002,2542.81,"You should be, and basically, when they do take the evidence is that they put on... a police officer who either took the photographs out and showed them or conducted the line up, or something of this nature."
1980.79-5949,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2556.003,2563.224,"Well are there instances in which the trial judge in a suppression hearing will say yes, I find that it was suggestive?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2563.224,2563.841,"--Oh yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-5949,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2563.841,2567.293,"And therefore, you may not use that evidence, that identification evidence at trial?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2567.293,2568.026,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-5949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2598.662,2610.036,"Do I understand you to say that in Kentucky practice, there is always a pretrial motion available to suppress either identification or other evidence?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2610.036,2610.62,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-5949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2624.396,2631.299,Does your practice require giving a list of witnesses to the defense in advance of the trial?
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2631.299,2634.085,Witnesses are available.
1980.79-5949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2650.03,2652.565,"You mean, that's--"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2652.565,2653.249,Pretrial.
1980.79-5949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2653.249,2653.715,--pretrial.
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2655.099,2672.193,"In addition, we normally hold a preliminary hearing, in which there is sufficient information put on normally, as to, it's used as a discovery motion."
1980.79-5949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2677.447,2686.62,"Well, I would have thought from your answer to some of the other questions that it was accorded under Kentucky procedure now."
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2703.748,2715.639,"He can move to suppress for any grounds that he wishes, whether it be identification or witness identification."
1980.79-5949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2721.293,2731.999,"Well, does the trial court have to hear whatever the defense counsel has to say at that time, and is it a factual determination?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2731.999,2732.499,It's the--
1980.79-5949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2732.499,2734.649,Will they call witnesses at the hearing?
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2734.649,2737.617,"--There can be, it's not required."
1980.79-5949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2752.31,2753.512,Well here it was denied.
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2753.512,2756.197,--Both were denied in this particular instance.
1980.79-5949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2756.197,2759.066,There was a motion and they said no hearing.
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2759.066,2767.053,The motion was to suppress because there was no attorney present at the photographic ID.
1980.79-5949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2777.194,2784.114,Well was there a motion to suppress any in court identification; I thought there was?
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2784.114,2785.381,The grounds--
1980.79-5949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2785.381,2788.466,On the... because the pretrial identification was--
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2788.466,2791.085,--Because counsel was not present at pretrial.
1980.79-5949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2791.085,2795.572,"--Well anyway, he made the motion and it was denied?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2797.722,2800.59,There was no full blown hearing with evidence taken.
1980.79-5949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2800.59,2807.463,"--Yes, well, he was... but he claims he was entitled to a hearing on admissibility outside presence of the jury."
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2807.463,2809.313,Admissibility of any evidence.
1980.79-5949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2818.319,2826.858,"So you say however broad the right to a pretrial hearing is, it doesn't cover this case?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2826.858,2829.358,"No, Your Honor, that was not--"
1980.79-5949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2829.358,2838.297,"Under Kentucky practice, you would say if this very same case came up again tomorrow, the request for a pretrial hearing would be denied?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2838.297,2845.403,"--Under the same facts, yes, Your Honor, and the same motion, same grounds to suppress."
1980.79-5949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2914.528,2921.049,"And if the trial court is wrong, the reviewing court can reverse and order a new trial on that ground?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2921.049,2921.749,"Yes, Your Honor,--"
1980.79-5949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2921.749,2923.116,"Under Kentucky practice, is that correct?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2923.116,2925.335,--That is correct.
1980.79-5949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2936.143,2951.486,"And basically I take it your, or the state's case, is that it is the function of cross examination to expose the flaws in any testimony, or flaws in the credibility of any witness?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,2951.486,2954.788,"Right, credibility is always an issue for the jury."
1980.79-5949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2978.803,2999.983,"Mr. Fox, suppose in these cases, the... let's say in the Watkins' case, the prosecution witness is about to testify and identify, making an in court identification and the defense objects and says this is a tainted identification, I'd like a hearing outside the presence of the jury; denied."
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3034.973,3043.495,"As defense counsel, I would move for a mistrial or, at the very least, a directed verdict of acquittal."
1980.79-5949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3043.495,3052.351,"But let's assume there's other identification, going to be other identification testimony."
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3068.646,3073.932,"I would, unringing bells is a very difficult task."
1980.79-5949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3073.932,3076.884,Well that was part of Jackson against Denno.
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3080.703,3092.261,"Well let me answer that by saying this, that in your hypothetical there was other identification evidence which pointed to the defendant."
1980.79-5949,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3119.329,3123.864,You don't think that kind of a case would come down to harmless error?
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3123.864,3130.201,"--Well that's basically what I'm saying when you set it aside, you set aside the error and taking a look at it."
1980.79-5949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3130.201,3147.83,"Is this not a matter of discretion, the sound discretion of the trial judge, if he thinks the testimony is very damaging and that he can't unring the bell, as you put it, then you either grant a mistrial, grant a new trial, or after verdict a judgment notwithstanding the verdict?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3147.83,3149.282,Which we permit.
1980.79-5949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3149.282,3153.567,So there are a whole range of remedies to deal with this that have always been available?
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3162.29,3165.024,"We have both in Kentucky, Your Honor."
1980.79-5949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3165.024,3171.88,"Well, I realize you have both, but aren't they generally posited on different grounds?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3171.88,3177.082,"I really do not know, it depends, I think personally, upon the counsel."
1980.79-5949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3190.973,3192.342,It's just a question of time?
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3192.342,3194.042,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-5949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3194.042,3219.425,"Then the motion for new trial simply says that there was some procedural unfairness or evidence admitted that may not have been reliable, and the defendant ought not to be sentenced on the basis of the first trial, but nonetheless, there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3219.425,3224.111,A motion for a new trial is still within the discretion of the trial court.
1980.79-5949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3224.111,3233.669,"But a motion for directed verdict of acquittal says there simply was not enough evidence to persuade a reasonable juror to convict, doesn't it?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3233.669,3237.804,Our motion for directed verdict of acquittal must be made before it is given to the jury.
1980.79-5949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3246.892,3248.761,And those are the same standards?
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3248.761,3249.944,"Basically yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-5949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3249.944,3253.046,Which is basically the sufficiency of the evidence?
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3253.046,3253.998,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-5949,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3253.998,3265.038,"And a motion for a new trial would basically be some error that occurred during the trial, having nothing to do with his ultimate innocence or guilt, or the sufficiency of the evidence."
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3265.038,3266.473,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-5949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3266.473,3297.509,"The judge's motion, if the judge decided at the end of the case, after the verdict, to enter a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, he would do that only if he decided that, excluding the challenged evidence as to which he had instructed the jury to disregard, there was no evidence upon which a reasonable jury could return a verdict of guilty, that would be the process of the judge's thinking, would it not?"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3297.509,3303.079,"Well, we basically have a standard that where it would clearly not be unreasonable for the jury to reach a verdict of guilty."
1980.79-5949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3303.079,3305.015,But if he was in doubt on--
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3305.015,3309.15,He'd probably deny it and let it go up on appeal.
1980.79-5949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3309.15,3312.002,--Or order a new trial?
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3312.002,3321.524,"He'd probably still let it go up on appeal, and let the appellate court, since we have elected judges, would let the appellate court direct that a new trial be granted."
1980.79-5949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3321.524,3334.717,"Of course, Mr. Fox, in Jackson against Denno, as I remember it, there was evidence other than the confession, which was sufficient to sustain the verdict, but the court nevertheless held that due process required a separate hearing."
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3350.894,3367.838,"Yes, I think in fact we're talking two separate constitutional rights, and one is the Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate oneself; and the other is the right to counsel, and the... you know, in Pinto, it said it's prudent to hold the hearings."
1980.79-5949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3428.829,3435.816,"Except that such a distinction is drawn by this Court's cases, there are some special cases dealing with identification evidence--"
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3435.816,3436.233,Identification evidence.
1980.79-5949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3436.233,3439.101,--there is no doctrine pertaining to identification of automobiles.
1980.79-5949,1,43588,victor_fox,,3439.101,3443.755,The standard is basically that which is the fundamental unfairness.
1980.79-5949,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3462.947,3465.582,"Thank you, gentlemen."
