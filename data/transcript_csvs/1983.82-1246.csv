1983.82-1246,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.268,We'll hear arguments next in Bose Corporation against Consumers Union.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,52.008,56.631,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1246,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,448.028,448.745,Mr. Hieken.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,448.745,449.767,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1246,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,449.767,460.443,As to the disparaging nature of the language which you just referred to both the District Court and the Court of Appeals ruled in your client's favor on that point.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,460.443,463.358,"That is correct, Your Honor, yes."
1983.82-1246,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,493.375,495.336,You don't sound like you are on stereo.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,496.317,505.834,"That is probably because we are sending the signals and faced both channels simultaneously so you get mono, right."
1983.82-1246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.78,977.134,May I ask you... What do you think the Court of Appeals' job was?
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,977.134,982.756,We have set that out in our reply brief I think beginning on page 4.
1983.82-1246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1001.309,1011.507,"Well, are you suggesting that the New York Times standard does not require any different review of factual findings than in any other kind of case?"
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1011.507,1014.877,--In terms--
1983.82-1246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1014.877,1020.733,As I understand the Court of Appeals they said this is a First Amendment case under New York Times against Sullivan.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1025.646,1026.347,--No.
1983.82-1246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1037.443,1042.215,So that to the extent that the court did independently examine the whole record it did the right thing here.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1042.215,1043.407,--If it did that.
1983.82-1246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1045.969,1047.11,That part was right.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1047.11,1057.336,"--Conducting a de novo review in effect disregarding the findings of fact is not correct, and that is not what the Court of Appeals did."
1983.82-1246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1101.297,1102.739,Let me try.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1102.739,1104.149,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1104.149,1109.782,Do you think the court should have been bound by the findings of fact?
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1109.782,1114.256,"Yes, Your Honor, unless clearly erroneous."
1983.82-1246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1114.256,1115.866,He should not read the record?
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1115.866,1119.239,"No, the Court of Appeals should read the record, Your Honor."
1983.82-1246,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1119.239,1122.932,They can set them aside if they found them clearly erroneous.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1122.932,1124.021,Absolutely.
1983.82-1246,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.023,1133.177,But you do not think they can set them aside by relying on testimony from a witness that the District Court said he did not believe.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1133.177,1134.428,Absolutely not.
1983.82-1246,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1136.62,1147.028,So you think the Court of Appeals is at least bound by if they can tell by the District Court's rulings on credibility.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1147.028,1148.728,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1246,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1156.512,1158.666,How can you tell that?
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1158.666,1159.585,I do not know.
1983.82-1246,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.585,1161.708,If the judge says I think you are lying--
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1161.708,1162.399,I do not know.
1983.82-1246,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1162.399,1163.778,--You do not make findings on credibility.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1163.778,1164.709,I do not know.
1983.82-1246,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1164.709,1169.282,"The judge does not say I disbelieve this witnesses because of factors a, b, c, d."
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1180.929,1185.243,"I think that is fair to say, Your Honor, but of course that is not this case--"
1983.82-1246,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1185.243,1186.382,"No, I know it is not."
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1186.382,1188.914,"--I know, but I think you are correct on that point."
1983.82-1246,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1190.536,1194.279,I take it you are not asking us to cut back on the New York Times?
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1194.279,1195.398,--That is correct.
1983.82-1246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1240.769,1243.08,May I just ask because I am really not sure.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1253.007,1263.413,--I think that we are asking you to take a look and see whether the Court of Appeals did its job--
1983.82-1246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1263.413,1266.825,So there really is not any question of law of any particular significance at stake.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1266.825,1267.867,"--Well, I think there is."
1983.82-1246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1268.716,1270.168,"If there is, what is it?"
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1271.768,1293.242,"--What it is is that the Court of Appeals said it was not bound by the clearly erroneous rule of Rule 52(a), and we submit that that is inconsistent with the trilogy of cases that this Court decided in 1982 beginning with Pullman-Standard v. Swint and followed by Inwood Laboratories or Ives Laboratories--"
1983.82-1246,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1293.242,1302.388,"The other side of that is you say that, therefore, the Court of Appeals could not have, should not have purported to make de novo findings."
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1302.388,1303.169,--Absolutely.
1983.82-1246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1303.858,1312.974,What do we do with the testimony of the witness that the judge said was incredible?
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1312.974,1314.206,Not credible?
1983.82-1246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1314.206,1314.747,Yes.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1314.747,1315.688,Disregard it.
1983.82-1246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1317.268,1318.21,Can we read it?
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1318.21,1321.011,"Oh, you can read it, but I think you have--"
1983.82-1246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1321.011,1322.151,But that is all?
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1322.151,1322.612,--Yes.
1983.82-1246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1322.612,1323.864,We cannot do anything about it?
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1323.864,1324.405,No.
1983.82-1246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1324.405,1325.213,But read it.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1325.213,1329.437,I think that it should be disregarded when it is not credible.
1983.82-1246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1332.409,1335.0,What happens if we think it is credible?
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1335.0,1338.212,--That is not your function.
1983.82-1246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1338.212,1349.409,I mean suppose the testimony of the witness says it is now ten minutes past two and the judge said that is incredible.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1350.751,1352.571,Then that is--
1983.82-1246,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1352.571,1354.873,I cannot recognize that.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1354.873,1363.028,"--No, I think you may well find the judge's ruling on that point being clearly erroneous under that circumstance, but anyway--"
1983.82-1246,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1517.438,1522.283,"Well, of course, the Court of Appeals expressly said they were not reviewing credibility determinations."
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1522.283,1540.312,"They said they were not, but then they went ahead if you will look at what they actually did and so far as we can see they do not mention under the heading ""review"" of the impact of the testimony of Seligson of what he knew."
1983.82-1246,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1626.549,1629.071,Do you have a comment on the Baumgartner case?
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1636.487,1646.423,May I comment on it after in my rebuttal period because I would like to save five minutes for rebuttal if you do not mind.
1983.82-1246,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1646.423,1650.105,I do want to hear from you on it because I find nothing in your briefs about it.
1983.82-1246,0,19257,charles_hieken,,1650.105,1651.387,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1983.82-1246,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1651.387,1655.418,Mr. Pollet.
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,1655.418,1659.162,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-1246,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.208,1709.164,"Mr. Pollet, I did not understand you to challenge in your brief the finding of the District Court upheld by the Court of Appeals that CU's article was in fact disparaging."
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,1710.806,1712.305,We do indeed challenge that.
1983.82-1246,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.69,1720.141,You did not cross petition.
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,1720.141,1722.424,"No, Your Honor, we did not."
1983.82-1246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1725.635,1728.688,We judged this case on the basis that it was disparaging.
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,1729.797,1738.194,"--Well, I do believe we raised that point in the course of our argument in the petition although not as a separate point."
1983.82-1246,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1738.194,1744.707,You are relying on the proposition if you cannot sustain your judgment on the ground given maybe you can in this one.
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,1744.707,1745.719,That is right.
1983.82-1246,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1751.411,1754.183,We agree with your adversary on the other point.
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,1756.875,1757.986,--Yes.
1983.82-1246,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1768.493,1771.705,I gather you argued below that it was not disparaging.
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,1771.705,1774.357,"--Oh, yes, very clearly."
1983.82-1246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1860.363,1866.708,Is it your submission that the clearly erroneous standard just does not apply in a First Amendment case?
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,1866.708,1872.601,"It does not apply in any event to the ultimate fact, the question of law--"
1983.82-1246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.601,1875.182,I asked you does it apply at all.
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,1875.182,1881.167,--If it applies at all it would apply only to historical facts.
1983.82-1246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1881.167,1892.263,"Let's just assume for the moment... You probably will not agree with it, but let's just assume that the question of knowledge is a historical fact."
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,1900.29,1903.743,Are we talking in the context of a defamation suit?
1983.82-1246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1903.743,1915.59,"Where the claim is that the person who wrote the article or made the defamatory statement knew that it was false, just knew."
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,1922.884,1928.788,"No, because that is the ultimate conclusion drawn from historical facts."
1983.82-1246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1932.461,1937.323,But if it were you would think that the clearly erroneous standard applied to it.
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,1937.323,1952.124,"--No, because I believe that this Court recently held in Connick v. Meyers just this past April that the inquiry into the protected status of speech is a matter of law and not subject to the clearly erroneous rule."
1983.82-1246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.124,1958.217,So I take it your submission is that the clearly erroneous standard just does not apply at all.
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,1958.217,1960.288,It does not apply at all when we are--
1983.82-1246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1960.288,1961.489,In the First Amendment cases.
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,1961.489,1962.601,--That is right.
1983.82-1246,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1964.642,1982.914,What principle of the First Amendment suggests that it is desirable to allow a Court of Appeals such as it did in this case to simply second-guess a trial judge's finding that a witness whom the trial judge heard testify was not credible?
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,1982.914,1992.251,"Well, with all due deference, Justice Rehnquist, the facts in this case as you have posed them are not as they occurred."
1983.82-1246,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2014.484,2019.206,Each is entitled to his own opinion.
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,2019.206,2026.913,The publisher before the Court here is Consumers Union of United States.
1983.82-1246,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2056.312,2064.897,I supposed by the same token if it is such an authoritative voice it is capable of inflicting great damage.
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,2064.897,2069.749,"Your Honor, the facts in this case is not show great damage."
1983.82-1246,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2333.657,2341.472,Do you think falsity is a mixed question of fact and law or is it a historical fact or is it just a straight question of law?
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,2341.472,2348.526,I think falsity is at least a mixed question of law and fact if not a pure question of law.
1983.82-1246,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2348.526,2354.891,Why would it have any legal implications rather than factual implications?
1983.82-1246,1,36459,michael_n_pollet,,2354.891,2355.652,Falsehood?
1983.82-1246,2,19257,charles_hieken,,3560.213,3562.965,"If, Your Honor, please."
1983.82-1246,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3754.289,3755.16,"Thank you, gentlemen."
