1969.230,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,26.622,"Number 230, Porter Company against the National Labor Relations Board."
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,42.81,46.648,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.230,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,131.321,132.862,What substantive provision?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,132.862,152.606,The substantive provision Mr. Justice Black was a dues checkoff provision -- a provision of course and a collective-bargaining agreement by which the company pays and assist the union in the collection of dues by deducting the due -- union dues from the employees’ wages and then transmits them to the union.
1969.230,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,152.606,163.555,In other words that the Board said that this was a demand of the union to which the company must agree?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,163.555,169.344,"The way the case worked out Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, it actually worked that way."
1969.230,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,247.698,251.586,"Well, did not the original opinion of the Court of Appeals suggest that very thing."
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,251.586,254.565,It suggested that in order to avoid contempt.
1969.230,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,338.909,351.059,"Now, why are you using citation to a place where the Board compelled by words the other party to agree to specific provision on the contrary?"
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,351.059,361.358,It is in the supplemental order issued by the Board and shown Mr. Justice Black on page 4 of Porter’s brief under statement of the case.
1969.230,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,361.358,362.685,Is it in the appendix also?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,362.685,364.216,"Yes, it's in the appendix also."
1969.230,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,364.216,366.377,You can get to us in both -- give us both citations if you will.
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,366.377,367.647,Yes.
1969.230,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,367.647,370.893,"Now, what part of the appendix, I now have it before me?"
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,372.313,380.269,"It's on page 137 of the appendix, supplemental orders first on left hand side page 136."
1969.230,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,391.747,393.853,That's the phrase that you relied?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,393.853,398.892,Yes.
1969.230,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,553.77,555.459,Where is that in the record?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,557.161,561.009,Yes.
1969.230,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,606.729,609.085,"You don't know where that is in the appendix, do you?"
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,609.085,612.681,I doubt if the briefs would be in the appendix Your Honor.
1969.230,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,612.681,616.934,"I know, I mean the -- wouldn't that order of the Board be in appendix?"
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,616.934,619.928,The original Board -- order of the Board is in the appendix.
1969.230,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,619.928,627.477,That's what I mean.
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,627.477,633.229,The original order is on page 55.
1969.230,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,633.229,634.467,"So, it will be somewhere there?"
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,634.467,636.121,Yes.
1969.230,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,636.121,637.799,Of the appendix?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,637.799,639.601,"Well, they adopted the recommended orders."
1969.230,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,728.094,741.044,"As I read the Government's brief and its questions that were presented, it agrees with you that the issues whether it has power to compel the making of that agreement?"
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,741.044,744.647,"Yes, that is the issue Mr. Justice Black."
1969.230,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,744.647,750.308,Is there any denial of it in any other part of the Government's brief?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,750.308,753.052,"That is the issue, we're all in agreement."
1969.230,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,753.052,765.657,"All agreed that the question is, whether under the law the Board on any circumstances has power to compel a company to agree to a specific term in the contract?"
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,765.657,769.228,That is -- I think we are all in agreement that that is the specific issue.
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,912.771,925.606,"Well, Mr. Winson I gather that the Board found here that Porter had taken a bad faith or otherwise impermissible bargaining position, is that right?"
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,925.606,925.83,"Yes, Mr. --"
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,925.83,927.181,Or did so fine?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,927.181,929.497,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan the actual --"
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,929.497,943.024,"And I understand the Board's argument to be that 8 (d), it doesn't permit a party to refuse to agree to a proposal or a reason which violates the statute, do you take a different position?"
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,943.024,943.978,"Yes, I do."
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,943.978,949.35,And that is you take the position that 8 (d) protection with regard to good or bad faith?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,949.35,961.988,I think it has to Mr. Justice Brennan for the very reason that everybody is in agreement to the 8 (d) prohibits the Board from using a refusal to agree as evidence of bad faith.
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,975.555,987.542,Is there any in the legislative history of 8 (d) which indicates the Congress dealt with its application in the context of a finding of bad faith?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,987.542,989.924,"In the context of the finding of bad faith, yes."
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,989.924,992.193,There is in the legislative history?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,992.193,1004.666,"Yes, I think we're all in agreement that on the finding of bad faith that is on the use of a refusal to agree as evident to bad-faith bargaining that I think the intent of Congress is clear than everybody agrees with it."
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1054.686,1065.511,Of course Insurance Agents didn't involve the situation like this whether is a finding of bad faith on the part of the employer?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1065.511,1067.956,"No, it was not --"
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1067.956,1070.299,"That actually was conduct of the union, wasn’t it?"
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1070.299,1075.396,Yes and that was a case of regulating the economic weapons.
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1159.035,1165.714,"Do you support taxes, any support for the -- or is there any problem fuel up, to put it that way?"
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1165.714,1173.163,"It doesn't present any particular problem, I don't think it present any particular problem for me, what do you have in mind specifically Mr. Justice Brennan?"
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1173.163,1182.526,"Well, that was an instance wasnt it of conduct on the part of an employer which was in violation of that statute?"
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1182.526,1189.692,"But I don't believe there was an order, I don't believe the order went beyond a restoration type remedy, did it not?"
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1189.692,1191.424,"No, it didn't try."
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1191.424,1195.007,And the union of the Board or cites that as a “basis.”
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1201.909,1204.526,"Well, may I ask you Mr. Winson."
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1220.567,1230.816,"Well, no Mr. Justice Brennan for the reason that the bad faith has to be there or we wouldn't be to the point of the remedy in a bargaining case."
1969.230,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1281.966,1288.014,I'm not too clear on your response about the factor of good faith.
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1337.282,1342.507,"Of course taking the last part, I take the position that in no circumstances can a party be ordered to agree."
1969.230,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1418.111,1421.626,"But we are only dealing with the remedy problem here, aren't we."
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1421.626,1434.189,It's only a remedy problem where the Court of Appeals distinguishes and says that it's a matter that 8 (a) 5 is relating only to the determination issue -- the evidence issue.
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1434.189,1455.59,"Yes, but even though it's only a remedy problem, am I wrong in thinking that your position is that the language of 8 (d) that such obligation does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of the concession that that language operates as a limitation upon any remedy?"
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1455.59,1455.855,Oh!
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1456.941,1457.944,That's your basic position?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1457.944,1459.508,That's the position --
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1459.508,1469.246,"It doesn't make any difference to all whether the position that the company has taken in bargaining is a good faith, bad faith, one or the other."
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1469.246,1471.259,"That's my position, exactly."
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1471.259,1482.203,And 10 (c) may be a broad power to the Board to address grievances but it doesn't a 10 (c) however broad doesn’t go that far?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1482.203,1488.761,It doesn't go that far because the 8 (d) policy stands on its way.
1969.230,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1509.249,1510.528,That won't help much here.
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1514.394,1516.75,You mean on the Ronald case?
1969.230,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1518.694,1520.404,You must pick a much better authority from that?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1520.404,1529.961,"Well, I think your reasoning Mr. Chief Justice is completely applicable here and that is the question of holding even though you don't have a business reason."
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1555.656,1567.766,That I take it it's one thing Mr. Winson about the issue of checkoff is either there will be or there won't be checkoff it’s not to compromise that one.
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1567.766,1568.34,That's true.
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1568.34,1571.929,Are there other any middle grounds of whether the will it won't be a checkoff?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1571.929,1581.187,There are middle grounds of course in dues collection and this is what the company offered to discuss with the Board after the original or with the union after the original board order.
1969.230,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1602.391,1609.429,But that's not the only provision of collective-bargaining contract it's either or is it?
1969.230,0,21707,donald_c_winson,,1609.429,1610.292,No it isn't.
1969.230,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1714.517,1715.322,Mr. Cohen.
1969.230,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1715.322,1719.323,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.230,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1742.939,1748.439,You said I understood both of you say the petition has never been presented to the Court before?
1969.230,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1748.439,1764.644,"No, I said the Board neither the Board nor the Court nor even any commentator has suggested up to this case that the Board has the power to dictate and tell the parties to a collective-bargaining association that these are the terms you must agree to."
1969.230,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1764.644,1769.133,That you must never been a Court which never been presented to us without standing?
1969.230,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1769.133,1771.678,"It's never been directly presented to this Court, that's correct."
1969.230,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1771.678,1772.689,Argued?
1969.230,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1772.689,1778.606,And it's never been argued to this Court of course by implication in numerous decisions of this Court.
1969.230,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1789.196,1790.088,"Well, Mr. Cohen."
1969.230,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1790.088,1791.154,Yes?
1969.230,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1791.154,1799.122,Has there ever been an order like this requiring agreement of the insertion of a particular provision in a collective-bargaining agreement?
1969.230,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1799.122,1801.406,This is the first case that's ever involved this question.
1969.230,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1801.406,1803.525,That's good reason why it's never been here before?
1969.230,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1803.525,1804.675,That's correct.
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2119.9,2133.199,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.230,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2154.421,2159.741,I just want to get your position straight to you.
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2176.474,2178.572,"I believe that is correct, Your Honor."
1969.230,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2178.572,2191.769,"And you say that this is therefore not a very important but nonetheless it is not a very important case because this is unique (Voice Overlap) it's not very unique but I think that’s tautological if it's unique, it’s unique."
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2204.32,2208.479,"That is correct as I will attempt to show very, very briefly."
1969.230,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2208.479,2210.359,May I ask about one question?
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2210.359,2211.103,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.230,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2211.103,2221.686,"I thought I had a big recollection that we had in a point of any contempt case before, is that right?"
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2221.686,2226.017,"Not, to my knowledge Your Honor --"
1969.230,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2226.017,2228.879,Because you'll probably know?
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2228.879,2254.577,The closest that this Court has had has been a case like Times for example very early today where an employer agreed to a contract and refuse to put it into writing and that situation the Board ordered him to execute the contract and this Court sustained that remedy.
1969.230,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2254.577,2256.237,"Yes, he must do that, doesn't he?"
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2256.237,2263.32,The Act now in 8 (d) specifically says that he must do that.
1969.230,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2264.827,2265.939,May I ask this Mr. Come?
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2265.939,2266.652,Yes.
1969.230,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2266.652,2278.783,"I take it if the Board has this power, this is a two-way street and then maybe circumstances in which the union can be require to sign a -- accept a particular course, is that right?"
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2278.783,2285.49,That might be if you get a union in the situation that this employer got himself into.
1969.230,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2305.59,2313.23,"Did the Board see in that light in the first instance before it went to the Court of Appeals, first time?"
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2313.23,2321.291,"Well, I think that the Board did Your Honor in so far as the basic violation --"
1969.230,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2321.291,2323.155,But you can do with this remedy?
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2323.155,2371.316,"The Board thought that the stereo type refusal of the bargain remedy would cure the situation but in the light of the post decree and negotiations, the further in like moment that the Court of Appeals gave the Board and after all the Board and the Court of Appeals are partners in this business of trying to work out a satisfactory administration of the Act, long appreciated that for this unusual type of situation something more than the conventional order to bargain was required."
1969.230,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2406.62,2419.505,How would the refusal to agree with checkoff frustrates any agreement with the union unless the union said they wouldn’t agree to any contract without a checkoff?
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2419.505,2421.127,"Well, --"
1969.230,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2421.127,2426.1,"That's the only way it could produce some impasse, isn't it?"
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2426.1,2436.408,It could produce an improper impasse if the employer's reasons for refusing to agree are bad faith reasons.
1969.230,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2554.159,2568.226,What if the employer wanted to save the checkoff concession for a year when he couldn't depart to give a very large wage increase?
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2578.279,2622.604,"I know that Your Honor has suggested that would be so in the Ronald case (Voice Overlap) and I think I could assume arguendo that perhaps it might be, but there was no suggestion that there was anything like that here because you had five years of bargaining negotiations, there was no suggestion at all that the checkoff was being used as a trading device certainly in the course of five years of negotiations where you are bargaining back and forth if the checkoff is going to be use as a trading device, that would have appear."
1969.230,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2637.961,2641.894,Is that an illegitimate reason?
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2641.894,2673.628,"I submit that in the context of this case, it is an illegitimate reason that has hypothetical to the basic tenants of bargaining in good faith because if you have to recognize a union as the collective bargaining representative as this employer did in bargain in good faith with a view toward entering into a contract -- anything that you're given a contract is going to give aid and comfort to the union."
1969.230,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2788.067,2806.894,"May I say this as I understand your adversary's argument do you think could good faith has nothing to do with that the law does not justify the Board in commanding that the particular provision be put on contract, isn't that right?"
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2806.894,2808.824,That is correct Your Honor and I --
1969.230,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2808.824,2818.744,"I suppose Congress will pass the law providing the checkoff, can you think of any constitutional objection to that?"
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2818.744,2822.45,"No, I cannot."
1969.230,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2905.08,2918.495,"Where Mr. Come assuming the breath that you argued for in 10 (c) as a -- to that extent at least some qualification on the prohibition of 8 (d), where do you draw the line on this?"
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2935.403,2975.341,"Well, I think that key is to the -- that the nature of a violation afford the standard where you have a situation like you have here where the employer has not only bargained in bad faith but he has indicated that he has no legitimate reason for withholding agreement other than this bad faith reason."
1969.230,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3033.867,3035.032,May I ask you one other question?
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3035.032,3035.8,"Yes, sir."
1969.230,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3035.8,3041.708,"It seems to me like most of this is rare, what do you mean by bad faith and what that means?"
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3056.385,3057.018,I think so.
1969.230,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3069.799,3071.941,Do you say they're going through a form?
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3071.941,3072.735,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.230,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3072.735,3077.794,Of collective-bargaining and agreeing to bargain but in reality they won't bargain --
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3077.794,3078.304,That is correct.
1969.230,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3078.304,3087.323,"Now, what is the remedy if this is not the remedy I mentioned it sometimes for years to state, well, I don’t want to do this, right?"
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3099.571,3110.735,"If that were his reason and that is all that you had, there was no -- there would not be an unfair labor practice finding here to begin with."
1969.230,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3110.735,3118.766,"But on the other hand if instead that being, you say the Board is entrusted with the power to determine."
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3124.933,3125.481,That is correct.
1969.230,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3125.481,3127.388,You're not bargaining at all.
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3147.41,3152.143,That is correct Your Honor and that is exactly what happened here because --
1969.230,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3152.143,3165.143,I frankly think then that your answer to Mr. Justice Black's question would mean that the Board could impose this remedy in any 8 (b) and (c) (5) violation.
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3175.803,3181.636,"I respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
1969.230,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3181.636,3183.26,But isn't that broad Mr. Come?
1969.230,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3213.456,3228.516,"Let me add to that, especially if the corporation said if the employers said, we're a corporate body and our ability to agree cannot be to make contracts, cannot be delegated by us to anyone else, suppose they added that to Justice Brennan’s?"
1969.230,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3228.516,3233.887,"Well, I think the usual argument; I used to make that kind of argument in Court.[Laughter]"
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3233.887,3246.934,"I think as an original proposition those are all valid, good faith reasons for refusing an arbitration of the law."
1969.230,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3246.934,3250.566,"Well, the law in the area of aid and comfort, they're not going to lend that practically."
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3250.566,3275.962,"Well, I think that aid and comfort in this case has to be read in the light of all of the facts that I have laid up which shows that this isn't an employer who has turned down a checkoff either because he doesn’t want to get in to the dues collection business because it’s inconvenient for him."
1969.230,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3304.991,3313.911,"What about saving it for the future that I mentioned before, would that be a legitimate business reason?"
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3313.911,3319.545,"I think that it might be yes, but this record, I’m not --"
1969.230,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3319.545,3321.172,We are not coming to other thing.
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3331.986,3345.068,"Well, I think that at some point those reasons should come out if you're going to have good faith bargaining as this Court pointed out in Detroit case."
1969.230,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3345.068,3345.839,In which case?
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3345.839,3361.967,In Detroit case which Your Honor it involves the problem as to whether or not an employer who claims inability to pay had to substantiate his claim at some point by bringing forth his records.
1969.230,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3389.914,3395.981,I thought it was the essence of negotiation that a negotiator was entitled to keep his cards covered.
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3499.402,3505.939,I don't think so Your Honor because I don’t think you’d have an unfair labor practice there to begin with for two reasons.
1969.230,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3521.672,3526.729,How did dues checkoff get to be negotiable bargaining issue?
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3526.729,3533.906,"Well, I think that it is well settled and the company does not --"
1969.230,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3533.906,3535.801,I mean how did it generally?
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3546.511,3564.348,"Well, I don't know that it is that recent but in any event most people in the field would readily agree that that is within the area of wages, hours and other conditions -- terms and conditions of employment."
1969.230,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3619.268,3628.049,"Would it be certainly be consistent with the spirit of the Labor Act and the Landrum-Griffin and the great many things to improve union democracy this way, wouldn’t it?"
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3628.049,3640.696,"Well, that may well be, Your Honor but as yet the statute only requires bargaining about wages, hours, other terms and conditions of employment."
1969.230,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3642.945,3647.802,Well then you picked one that would be within the orbit of mandatory bargaining.
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3657.309,3665.151,"Well, I haven't thought about it Your Honor."
1969.230,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3895.414,3897.267,May I ask you about that legislative history?
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3897.267,3898.128,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.230,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3898.128,3924.51,I was over there at that time and I don't know but is there anything that you see in any way indicated that any of the Senators or Congress had in mind that the Board could do this or is it more in the line but following the ideas of the Railroad Labor Act which when you reach the end you still got to strike a lockout.
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3946.507,3960.434,I think that the legislative history was silent on the question of what kind of remedy the Board could impose once it found an unfair labor practice.
1969.230,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4007.557,4026.302,"Now, Mr. Come surely the very basic premise of our whole labor relations instruction is that it regulated to see that the parties sit down to bargaining table and come out with agreements that they agreed upon and that Government shall not voice agreements upon them."
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,4028.651,4030.194,That is correct Your Honor but --
1969.230,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4030.194,4042.783,"Doesn't -- does it whether under the guides of remedy or anything else, isn't that rather to assert such power to that in conflict with that basic premises."
1969.230,2,37058,norton_j_come,,4042.783,4045.533,"Well, I think there are two answers to that."
1969.230,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,4749.337,4752.096,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.230,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4759.768,4763.547,"Yes, you got about 10 minutes that is left I think."
1969.230,3,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,4763.547,4765.869,The company and the Chamber are here Mr. Chief Justice --
1969.230,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4765.869,4767.479,Whom do you represent?
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,4767.479,4773.203,"United Steelworkers of America, we’re the charging party for the National Labor Relations Board, Your Honor."
1969.230,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4773.203,4775.996,"Counsel, if you run under pressure we will take that into account."
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,4775.996,4777.206,"Thank you, sir."
1969.230,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4839.64,4843.744,"Isn't that the concession, is that actual?"
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,4843.744,4848.847,"Compel an agreement -- to compel an agreement, require an agreement or compel a concession."
1969.230,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4850.168,4854.653,Is it concession knowing where you sign this agreement or else.
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,4854.653,4865.396,"No, I'm referring Your Honor to the statutory language of making a concession in the company’s view this was making them concede to something by having to execute it to the contract."
1969.230,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4865.396,4871.272,But the very word “concession” implies agreement however reluctant doesn’t it?
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,4871.272,4873.745,It required an agreement of this nature.
1969.230,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5023.49,5031.427,"But Mr. Cohen, does that answer the problem for us even if you had no 8 (d) would this problem still?"
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5031.427,5031.675,No.
1969.230,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5099.539,5115.722,And I suppose that it is an arguable that because of the basic premise of regulation to bring about collective bargaining ought to leave the terms of the agreement to the parties are also -- will be the agreement.
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5128.54,5134.704,I think I would respond by saying when you say “but to leave the substantive terms to the parties.”
1969.230,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5153.424,5156.244,"Well, I should go a little beyond that."
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5170.749,5171.221,"Well, that --"
1969.230,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5171.221,5180.02,"Now, if that so then I would suppose that’s very powerful argument that the Board can assert in the problem."
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5180.02,5187.201,"Well, that language I believe, that holds segment of the legislative history which you have so ably referred to in Insurance Agents."
1969.230,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5286.52,5289.771,May I -- I thought you're arguing on the other side?
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5289.771,5291.98,"No, Your Honor."
1969.230,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5291.98,5294.04,Are you arguing against the Board's order or Court’s order?
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5294.04,5310.991,"No, I'm arguing for the Board’s order and I'm suggesting that the Board discretion that the Congress left would be NLRB in Section 10 (c) supports the issuance of a remedy that was issued in this particular case."
1969.230,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5315.36,5316.741,Are you concurring the Act?
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5323.251,5333.818,No Your Honor I'm not but I am -- what I'm saying is 10 (c) empowers the Board to take the effective action that is necessary to remedy the particular violation found in giving case.
1969.230,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5333.818,5342.684,"Well, do you think if remedy is necessary to tell people they got to sign a contract with that power?"
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5342.684,5354.499,There could certainly be a situation where a -- this is happened numerous times before this case so yes Your Honor but there's been a violation found.
1969.230,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5356.664,5364.726,But I say the violation is that they just stick to one view and they won't leave it five years.
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5365.909,5372.912,You mean are they bargaining in bad faith that we got a basic finding of bad-faith bargaining when you say stick to one --
1969.230,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5372.912,5389.911,"Do you mean then that if the Board finds a reasonable fact, reasonable support theory that the man really is not interested in against union’s checkoff but then they can force him to sign a checkoff provision?"
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5389.911,5395.297,"Well, the mere fact that an interest that they are not interested, I don't think it would be determined."
1969.230,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5437.573,5438.602,He did?
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5438.602,5440.227,"In this case, yes Your Honor."
1969.230,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5445.774,5447.925,Sure thing but he was against it?
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5447.925,5455.696,He was against it -- he was against it for a bad faith purpose of frustrating collective-bargaining that was the key to the finding.
1969.230,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5455.696,5468.356,"Well, suppose the union have been bucking, it said, we don’t want the checkoff, we want to collect that money out of sales appear to word, is that compare?"
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5468.356,5478.212,If it could be demonstrated that we had no bad faith on either side of table then we wouldn’t have a violation that we wouldn’t be involved in these remedies (Voice Overlap).
1969.230,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5478.212,5488.704,How are going to be able to demonstrate bad faith so that you can read it real loud as not to put a man in jail for contempt to court?
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5488.704,5501.783,"Well, bad faith has we all acknowledged and we realized when it was written into the statute is a subjective standard but nevertheless, it is one of the basic course of the entire Labor Act."
1969.230,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5533.706,5546.851,"The counsel this morning Mr. Cohen mentioned that the union come witness for speaking for the union said, they would never agree to agreement without a checkoff, is that in the record something like that?"
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5546.851,5553.271,I believe it is clearly in the record that the union was insisting on a dues checkoff provision.
1969.230,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5553.271,5555.933,And they would not sign a contract without it?
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5555.933,5558.979,I don't know of those specific words --
1969.230,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5558.979,5565.99,"Let's assume for the moment whoever said that was accurate, would you think that was in adamancy (Voice Overlap) --"
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5565.99,5579.833,"Absolutely, but the key distinguishing factor Mr. Chief Justice is nothing under this Act to preclude a party from adamantly in good faith insisting on a particular bargaining position."
1969.230,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5601.864,5609.57,"Well, you're then doing on the same theory that Mr. Come suggested that a bargainer is always obliges to state all of his reasons (Voice Overlaps) --"
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5609.57,5612.274,That is not the problem that we have before us Your Honor.
1969.230,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5619.286,5622.943,The reasons I'm talking about the reasons for the position.
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5629.953,5650.817,The essence of bargaining is I'm sure you are well aware is to behave in a manner consistent with the good faith requirement of the statute and where that finding is made as it was made here and where this company has put themselves into this box where they were using the checkoff to frustrate reaching an agreement.
1969.230,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5659.311,5663.013,Let me pursue the question on 10 (c) that you mentioned --
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5663.013,5663.078,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.230,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5663.078,5679.435,"-- the latter part of 10 (c) where the statute discusses under what circumstances where it says, and to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without bad faith."
1969.230,4,25102,george_h_cohen,,5704.634,5720.388,"Well, I would answer that by saying this, I don't -- as a so often the case, the legislative history of statutes don't communicate there are the legislature’s concern with every potential problem that could have been post."
1969.230,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5750.183,5753.889,I think your time is up now Mr. Cohen if you got to close.
1969.230,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5753.889,5762.865,"Before you close, I like to say I had the (Inaudible) comment said Mr. Cohen representing the Chamber of Commerce and that's acted and (Voice Overlaps) --"
