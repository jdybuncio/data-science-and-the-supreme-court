1982.81-1506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,We will hear arguments next in Federal Election Commission against the National Right to Work Committee.
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,62.573,72.012,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1506,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,656.54,669.115,"Mr. Steele, I take it from your brief that it's 441b(4)(C), is it, that contains the exemption that was construed by the court of appeals?"
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,669.115,669.865,"Yes, it is."
1982.81-1506,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,669.865,682.691,What is the precise operative language of 441b that would prevent these people from doing what they seek to do if it weren't for the 441b(b)(4)(C)?
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,682.691,691.011,"Again, the structure of the statute is that 441b, the prohibition is contained in 441b(a)."
1982.81-1506,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,705.121,712.127,"Well, which line or which clause of (a) sets forth the prohibition against what these people are trying to do?"
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,712.127,718.53,The prohibition is that of making a contribution or expenditure in connection with any federal election.
1982.81-1506,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.153,727.836,Okay.
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,740.794,747.198,--The corporation is making an expenditure; it is expending the corporate funds for the purpose of the solicitation.
1982.81-1506,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,763.64,773.765,So that now the complaint is the expenditure of this membership corporation or a membership corporation's assets to undertake the solicitation.
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,773.765,781.669,"--The solicitation is permitted in the exceptions if it is two member, so the question revolves around the question of whether they are members or not."
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,788.691,793.643,And the exception to that prohibition applies only if the solicitation is of members.
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,793.643,794.179,Yes.
1982.81-1506,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,840.806,861.787,"Mr. Steele, is this the precise language in 441b(a) or for any corporation, whatever, or any labor organization, to make a contribution or expenditure in connection with any election at which a presidential and vice... and if not, what is?"
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,861.787,863.572,That is the operative language.
1982.81-1506,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,916.457,923.21,"Mr. Steele, I suppose there could be less restrictive ways of addressing the problem."
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,938.454,941.608,I think that could be done.
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,961.669,967.973,"Well, they could have left the statute the way it was, before 76."
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,967.973,968.925,They could have.
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,974.46,980.899,"That corporations should be able to spend some of its money for solicitation, subject to some limitation."
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,980.899,984.601,--But that solicitation was only for its--
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.601,985.018,Yes.
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,985.018,986.218,--Its shareholders.
1982.81-1506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,989.586,991.586,We'll resume there are 1:00 o'clock.
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1010.063,1031.413,"If I might pick up where I left off before the lunch break and take advantage of the Chief Justice's invitation to discuss the Bellotti case, I would like to note first that what is here is a case in which there is not challenged the basic prohibition of 441b on corporate expenditures."
1982.81-1506,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1059.48,1060.515,I can't answer that now.
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1061.582,1069.704,"--Well, in discussing the prohibitions of the statute, I alluded to the overall provision in 441b(a)."
1982.81-1506,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1099.204,1119.416,It seemed to me that 441b(4)(i) was a good deal closer to a precise proscription than the more... what I thought was the more general language in 441b(a).
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1119.416,1125.653,"I think that's correct, and that is really what is at issue in this case, and that's why I think by dwelling only on the broad prohibition."
1982.81-1506,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1142.447,1156.873,Do you think Congress intended to do other than have a paraphrase in subsection (4) of the more general language in 441b?
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1160.659,1161.859,--I think not.
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1271.289,1278.645,"Well, you certainly don't need to get to the constitutional considerations to pose the issue of what does a membership mean."
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1278.645,1280.211,"No, you certainly do not."
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1280.211,1298.54,"And would you be here arguing if they had... I think you probably would, but would you be here arguing if the corporation had said that anybody who... in their initial solicitations they said anybody who gives us $5.00 is a member."
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1298.54,1302.844,I don't know whether they would have challenged that.
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1303.411,1309.747,"Well, suppose they, in their initial circulation, said anybody who gives us $5.00 is a member."
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1316.068,1316.603,"--No, I think--"
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.603,1323.924,"Now, there is a definite intra-organization definition of membership."
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1323.924,1328.994,"--No, certainly in that sense, if they had an externalized offering--"
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1328.994,1329.844,"You wouldn't be here, right?"
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1329.844,1335.148,--I don't think we would be here if they had what we would consider a genuine membership structure.
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.732,1346.789,"Now, they didn't say that when they initially solicited it, but everybody who gave them anything, they sent a membership card to."
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1352.626,1355.061,--I don't think that they did because--
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1355.061,1356.495,What do you mean?
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1359.513,1367.286,--They sent them a piece of paper at the end of the year at the end on the renewal saying we want you to renew your membership.
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.286,1369.119,"Well, nevertheless, they recognized them as members."
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1369.119,1372.904,"But when they solicited them, they never told them that they were soliciting them for membership."
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1372.904,1374.106,That may be so.
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1384.212,1387.949,A policy of the organization I think is a strong statement of it.
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1390.984,1395.519,"So if they put a little footnote to their initial solicitation, by the way, anybody who gives us money is a member."
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1401.69,1406.911,"--I think that the Commission in its opinions has said that you have, at the very least, to have that."
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1410.779,1411.981,"Well, would you have to have anymore or not?"
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1411.981,1415.933,"--In the Commission's view, you would have to have a voluntary acceptance of that."
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1417.167,1423.373,"Well, a voluntary acceptance in the sense that if you have that footnote and the guy sends in his money, he has accepted membership."
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1423.373,1428.74,"--That you not only have to have that... and in a knowing sense, that people know that."
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1481.392,1487.696,You don't suggest that it was illegal under state law for the corporation to treat these people as members.
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1487.696,1490.898,--Not if they organized themselves as a membership corporation.
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.898,1492.183,"Well, that isn't my question."
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1500.539,1504.991,They don't have members under state law.
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1507.027,1507.46,All right.
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1509.728,1511.844,"--Well, they would have to give them notice of annual meeting."
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1517.382,1523.738,So your answer to my question is under the state law they were not permitted to treat these people as members.
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1523.738,1531.825,"--Not without constituting themselves a membership organization, which carries with it certain obligations to its members."
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1531.825,1532.925,And they didn't.
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1532.925,1533.891,And they did not.
1982.81-1506,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1533.891,1537.527,"Mr. Steele, I wonder how confident you are of that answer."
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1558.273,1559.156,"No, I do not."
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1565.962,1571.616,And are you saying you're also obligated to say that you are a membership organization?
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1571.616,1572.799,--That's the third requirement.
1982.81-1506,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1592.078,1595.78,And what did these articles provide?
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1595.78,1599.148,--These articles provided that they were not a membership organization.
1982.81-1506,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1599.148,1611.29,"Mr. Steele, if your restriction as to membership is agreed to, then I guess we get to the constitutional question, do we?"
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1611.29,1616.074,"Certainly, the court of appeals seemed to have constitutional questions underlying it that--"
1982.81-1506,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1616.074,1621.311,But isn't there a constitutional question here on the premise of your interpretation of membership?
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1621.311,1629.601,"--Well, I think it's really a question of... I mean, the constitutional question in the sense that if Congress did make that limitation, is there something that prohibits that."
1982.81-1506,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1629.601,1632.453,"Well, what's the governmental interest in that limitation?"
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1632.453,1647.129,"Well, the governmental interest I think, once again, is in distinguishing between the overall statute where you have a prohibition on corporations with the exceptions in between, that there's an underlying governmental purpose there of controlling the corporation's expenditures, the amounts."
1982.81-1506,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1647.129,1650.331,How does this membership restriction further those interests?
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1650.331,1654.367,It furthers it in the same way that... it's a quid pro quo.
1982.81-1506,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1677.648,1680.398,No less restrictive way of doing it than this?
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1680.398,1695.258,"Well, in regard to Justice O'Connor's question, it might be less restrictive if Congress said no corporation shall send more than $5000 in soliciting anyone, and put them under that restriction that was the one in Calpak."
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1707.6,1731.366,"Mr. Steele, if we have to reach the constitutional issue, which I would suppose we would if we accept your definition of membership, wouldn't resolving that question almost resolve the constitutionality of the pre-1976 situation with respect to membership corporations?"
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1731.366,1734.485,I would think it might.
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.59,1761.652,"If you say... and then the question is well, how does this restriction serve the purposes of the statute, answering those questions could easily resolve the constitutionality of the general restriction with respect to membership corporations."
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1761.652,1763.754,--I suppose in that sense that it's implicated here.
1982.81-1506,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1772.36,1781.715,"If that's the case, then, if you would sustain the general prohibition with respect to membership, wouldn't you necessarily have to sustain this one?"
1982.81-1506,0,20154,charles_n_steele,,1781.715,1789.619,"--In that sense, yes, it is implicated I would reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal."
1982.81-1506,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1789.619,1796.391,Mr. Mansfield.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,1796.391,1799.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1843.372,1845.789,They certainly have taken the position that these people are not members.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,1845.789,1846.924,--They do.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1846.924,1849.693,So they defined it to that extent.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,1849.693,1857.597,Only to the extent where on the public record the Federal Election Commission has stated it knows what a membership corporation is.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.597,1862.381,"They claim to know that these people are not members, but in that extent, it's defined."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,1862.381,1863.833,To that extent it is defined.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.833,1868.452,Why don't we talk about whether that's defensible or not?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,1868.452,1873.272,"Well, it is not defensible for numerous reasons."
1982.81-1506,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1928.443,1930.126,You say this Court has sanctioned it.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,1930.926,1935.347,--That's in the Hunt versus Washington State Apple Advertising Commission case.
1982.81-1506,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1935.347,1938.882,That really didn't involved federal election controls.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,1938.882,1939.482,Not at all.
1982.81-1506,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1972.186,1981.828,But our organizational standing cases have frequently dealt with just groups of people or associations that didn't attempt to have corporate status.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,1998.92,2002.657,"--I believe that the analysis holds, though."
1982.81-1506,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2023.671,2034.093,I can hardly believe that Congress meant to incorporate the definition that this Court used in Hunt versus Washington State Apple Commission when it was enacting the Federal Campaign Contribution Act.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2034.093,2046.317,"Not at all, but the question faced by those individuals such as the National Right to Work Committee when they are faced with how do they comply with the statute is when they're deciding what is a member."
1982.81-1506,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2049.203,2061.529,"I would think before they looked even to this Court's prior guidance they might figure out what they were incorporating under, under the laws of Virginia, and if they get a status that says it has no members, I would think they might feel they were in trouble."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2061.529,2063.446,"--Well, there are two answers to that."
1982.81-1506,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2081.207,2082.54,But wait a minute.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2100.252,2108.524,"--Not in this case, and I would say not in this case because two reasons."
1982.81-1506,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2148.065,2150.851,Your client made that inquiry of the Commission?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2150.851,2151.317,Yes.
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2167.86,2168.61,What is it now?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2170.979,2175.549,"--It is, for the purposes of state law, it is a corporation without members."
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2175.549,2177.432,"Now, will you answer my question."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2180.334,2184.036,"Undoubtedly, it is a membership corporation."
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2184.036,2185.088,Do you have a membership list?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2185.088,2186.521,There is a membership list.
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2186.521,2188.023,Is it in the record anyplace?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2188.023,2189.023,It is not in the record.
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2189.023,2191.809,Do they hold regular meetings of the membership?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2191.809,2194.142,There are not regular meetings of the membership.
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2194.142,2200.463,Do you know of any other membership corporation that doesn't hold annual meetings?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2200.463,2206.735,"That's the issue in the case with respect to the organization documents, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2206.735,2210.937,My final question is where did you raise your constitutional point?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2213.805,2218.423,"The constitutional point in this case is that the FEC, the statute--"
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2218.423,2220.559,Not is.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2223.994,2227.613,--This case came up through the courts as follows.
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2245.508,2250.062,"--And as of that, I haven't found out yet where the constitutional part--"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2250.062,2251.079,--At the district court.
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2251.079,2252.93,--Did you raise it?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2252.93,2255.013,We raised the constitutional issue.
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2255.013,2256.265,Can you point to it?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2256.265,2260.55,"It is in the complaint, in the original--"
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2260.55,2261.4,That's good enough.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2262.033,2281.547,"--To just finish my answer with respect to the organization documents, the FEC, the Federal Election Commission's interpretation of congressional intent is that regardless of whether or not you're a membership organization under state law, that's enough."
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.333,2293.021,"That might apply to another case, but here the organization was not a membership organization."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2293.021,2294.239,--It was not a membership organization.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.239,2301.46,"And certainly, one of the positions of the Commission is if you're not a membership organization under the state law, you're not a membership--"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2301.46,2310.566,But there's never been a substantial reason in First Amendment terms why an organization must have this threshold criteria.
1982.81-1506,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2313.518,2321.958,--You're talking as if we're construing the assumption on a kind of a common law basis... there's no substantial reason in First Amendment terms.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2325.41,2333.681,"--Congress... there is nothing in the record at all, nothing in the legislative history that Congress dealt with the question of what is a member."
1982.81-1506,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2334.399,2338.633,Then you look at... if there's nothing in the legislative history I suppose you could look at the statute.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2338.633,2339.585,--Indeed.
1982.81-1506,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2365.487,2374.675,"Well, if there's nothing in the legislative history and only that language to support it, do we have any basis for speculating as to why Congress left it rather open ended?"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2374.675,2379.627,We have nothing from the record as to speculation.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.329,2387.816,"But you say, I guess, the First Amendment would limit the discretion of the Commission to say what a membership organization is."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2387.816,2388.45,--Yes.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2412.968,2423.156,"If the only restriction of the Commission was that you should be a membership organization under state law, and if you aren't you don't solicit anybody--"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2423.156,2427.441,"If that were the case, then this case never would have been before this Court."
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.441,2428.027,--Why?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2428.027,2439.868,"Because long ago at the conciliation period, the National Right to Work Committee offered to amend its articles of incorporation, and this was refused."
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2448.105,2460.697,"Mr. Mansfield, you give the impression that you have done almost the same thing as if you had gone and converted your Virginia charter to a corporation with members."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2483.778,2485.563,That's true.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.358,2507.81,It also puts a lot of restrictions on what the managers can do.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2507.81,2508.543,--Absolutely.
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2508.543,2513.63,And he'd have to hold annual meetings and a lot of other meetings you would have had to hold.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2514.814,2515.364,Right.
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2528.139,2529.289,May I ask you a question?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2535.609,2538.895,It is a Section 501(c)(4) organization.
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2543.763,2547.584,There's no provision for distributing among the directors or anything like that?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2547.584,2548.617,"No, sir."
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.617,2550.369,That would be the case even if there were members.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2550.369,2552.452,"And if there were members, I suppose it would--"
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.452,2555.237,"Well, would it go to members or would it go--"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2555.237,2558.106,--It would not go to members; it would go to the same sort of organization.
1982.81-1506,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2558.106,2606.539,"--Mr. Mansfield, if we were to determine that indeed, the FEC is right and your organization did not have members, and furthermore, that you were right in arguing that the provision of Section 441b(b)(a) is unconstitutional, then would the restrictions in Section 441(a) still prohibit your company from giving more than $5000 to this committee that it formed?"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2606.539,2612.073,"Of course, we don't hold that it is not our position--"
1982.81-1506,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2612.073,2613.275,Is that what would happen?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2613.275,2617.561,--It is not our position that the statute itself is unconstitutional.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2617.561,2618.346,It isn't?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2619.613,2621.215,Not the general prohibition.
1982.81-1506,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2632.171,2634.189,"Yes, that was my assumption."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2642.129,2651.234,"--To the extent that it infringes upon the rights of the members of the National Right to Work Committee to associate through political contributions in the political sphere, that is true."
1982.81-1506,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2651.234,2657.304,Precisely what section is it that you're contending would be unconstitutional?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2657.304,2665.91,Section 441b(b)(4)(C) is the section that's--
1982.81-1506,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2665.91,2670.862,"The one starts out, ""This paragraph shall"" But that's an exemption."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2670.862,2674.064,"--Yes, that's an exemption."
1982.81-1506,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2688.074,2707.321,"I suppose then the question is would Congress... if you're correct that the (C) perhaps is ""under-inclusive"" or whatever the lingo is, I suppose then the question would be whether Congress would have preferred the statute without any exception or with one as broad as you propose."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2711.273,2717.343,"No... if there were no exceptions, we would be in the same position as everyone else."
1982.81-1506,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2721.062,2728.901,Let me ask you a factual question that maybe isn't too important.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2734.887,2744.576,That's a very good question because the Federal Election Commission in its brief failed to distinguish between two types of solicitations.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2789.189,2794.343,"Well, you never said that in your solicitation... we would like you to become a member."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2794.343,2796.795,The solicitations are as follows.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2797.911,2799.178,They never mentioned membership.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2799.178,2801.747,--They all speak of joining with.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2821.076,2822.326,"Well, the people who contribute are people... yes."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2822.326,2827.064,"--Well, the people who contributed are additionally, active members."
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.401,2838.538,But there's nothing that defines members in your bylaws or in your articles or anything.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2838.538,2839.205,Nothing in the bylaws.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2839.205,2842.824,So these are just telling us that that's the way you treat--
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2842.824,2847.828,The individuals refer to themselves as members.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2878.163,2879.449,--How did they know that?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2879.449,2889.971,"They knew that because the rights and obligations, as Mr. Steele calls them, of the committee... once you become a member, the committee sends you regularly and routinely information."
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2889.971,2890.471,I know that.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2891.757,2895.059,They knew because the solicitation... the membership solicitation.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2896.575,2899.343,"They suddenly, after they gave money they suddenly got some distributions that said they were a member."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2899.343,2899.66,Yes.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2899.66,2900.795,Or treated them as a member.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2900.795,2901.928,"Yes, they got a membership card."
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2913.92,2927.494,"Do you suppose the state, the attorney general, could have closed you down if he said I understand you're sending out membership cards, and yet you've filed with the Secretary of State that you're not a membership organization."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2927.494,2933.815,"For the purposes of state law, members, under the statute, have certain rights."
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.235,2942.004,"Well, take it the other way."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2945.456,2947.908,"--Under state law, if you call them in your charter."
1982.81-1506,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2967.035,2969.237,Let me go back to my million dollar question.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2973.356,2980.462,"The National Right to Work Committee has, the Committee itself has, both corporate and noncorporate members."
1982.81-1506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2986.783,2991.401,Is there a membership list maintained somewhere in the central office?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,2991.401,2998.923,There is a membership list maintained because the Committee actively and constantly communicates with its members by mail.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3003.994,3008.112,How long do you stay a member if you've given $10 one year and--
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3008.112,3010.064,You get your member--
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.064,3017.135,"--some association wants to solicit them for political contributions two years later, and yet there's never been any intervening contributions."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3017.135,3017.652,--On the factual--
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3017.652,3018.352,Is there some rule about it?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3018.352,3020.504,"--Yes, there is, as a matter of fact on the records."
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3027.61,3028.476,When he gives some money?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3028.476,3029.31,When he gives some money.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3029.31,3029.926,Yes.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3029.926,3030.645,He becomes an active member.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3040.25,3041.4,What does he send them for?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3044.635,3045.169,Yes.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3045.654,3046.937,So there's no standard membership fee?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3046.937,3048.439,--There is no standard membership fee.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3048.439,3051.808,"If you give a million dollars one year, you get billed for a million dollars the next year?"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3051.808,3052.541,"Well, whatever you can afford, because--"
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3053.841,3065.866,Is there any way for us to rule with you without at the same time admitting that we are knowingly ignoring the laws of the State of the Commonwealth of Virginia?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3065.866,3067.201,"Yes, there is."
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3068.568,3069.353,Please tell me.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3069.353,3078.625,"--The laws of the State of the Commonwealth of Virginia deal only with the rights of the members, if they are members, or the individuals of the organization."
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3078.625,3079.659,But you just said you have a membership list.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3079.659,3089.814,We have a membership list but they don't accord these individuals the rights that they would be accorded under the law of Virginia if they were to lose accorded--
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3089.814,3092.349,"Or to use your phrase, they're second-class members."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3095.801,3097.236,--We have members who are--
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3097.236,3098.336,Second class.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3098.336,3099.372,--They are not second class.
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3100.155,3101.538,"Well, they are not first class."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3103.74,3107.894,--We would like to... we would like to believe that they're all first-class members.
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3112.846,3116.584,Which are guaranteed by the laws of Virginia; right?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3116.584,3119.869,--Only if you declare yourself as a membership organization.
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3119.869,3121.136,"Well, do they have any rights at all?"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3126.555,3127.089,No.
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.074,3131.343,"No, I am serious in my question."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3131.343,3131.959,--Yes.
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3131.959,3137.83,"Does a member of your organization, either supporting or active, have any rights at all by virtue of his membership?"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3137.83,3145.901,He has the right to receive the materials and he's asked to... to take the action in support of the philosophy.
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3145.901,3147.803,That's true of both the supporting and the active members; right?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3147.803,3148.403,Yes.
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3148.403,3152.59,Why is it that you say that only... the only issue before us is the active members?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3154.54,3154.959,Well--
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3154.959,3157.175,--under the regulation and under the statute.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3157.175,3163.296,--In 1976 the case arose by the fact that the National Right to Work Committee made solicitations.
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3170.884,3176.122,"But if you are right in your position, you would also have the right to solicit the others, too; wouldn't you?"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3177.855,3178.907,"Well, depending upon the--"
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3178.907,3181.224,"Because they're all members, under your definition of membership."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3181.224,3186.478,"--It is our position that all members of the organization, of the Committee, are members."
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3186.478,3188.013,And have an equal right under it--
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3188.013,3188.58,And have an equal--
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3188.58,3189.146,--to be solicited?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3189.146,3189.613,--Right.
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3195.0,3196.05,Right.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3196.05,3199.488,--they believe in the philosophy and they've taken an affirmative step to further that philosophy.
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3199.488,3203.44,So that the issue before us applies equally to the supporting members and the active members--
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3203.44,3203.856,The issue--
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3203.856,3207.307,--I mean the legal ramifications of what we are asked to decide in this case.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3207.307,3210.843,--We would like this Court to decide on the broad basis.
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3223.569,3225.805,We have to rewrite the regulation or the statute to do that.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3225.805,3227.021,--Excuse me?
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3227.021,3230.857,"We have to rewrite the regulation or the statute to draw that distinction, it seems to me."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3230.857,3235.911,"No, we don't have to write... rewrite any... either one, because the statute simply says, membership... membership--"
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3235.911,3236.344,Right.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3241.231,3241.731,--In the organization--
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3241.731,3242.881,And they're all required to satisfy that.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3242.881,3243.517,--Yes.
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3243.517,3245.082,So they're all members.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3245.082,3249.95,"Well, all of the members of the National Right to Work Committee are members for that--"
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3249.95,3250.384,That's right.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3250.384,3250.867,--for that.
1982.81-1506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3250.867,3254.854,"Now, this membership list, is it in the record?"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3254.854,3260.258,The membership list is not in the record.
1982.81-1506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3273.399,3278.303,Does Virginia allow or permit the membership list to remain confidential?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3278.303,3287.659,"It... it does unless the membership, unless it is a membership organization, at which time individuals would have... members might have the right to view the membership list."
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3287.659,3295.848,"For your information, the membership list of NAACP is controlled by the State of New York, not Alabama."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3297.231,3300.05,"In NAACP v. Alabama, however--"
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3300.05,3302.419,It was the same way there.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3304.204,3305.721,"--Yes, sir, but the State--"
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3305.721,3306.804,--And it still is.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3306.804,3311.791,--The State tried to get those members made as a condition precedent for the--
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3311.791,3315.077,"If there wasn't, he could have gotten the list in New York."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3316.46,3318.445,--Yes.
1982.81-1506,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3321.647,3322.73,You know more about it than I do.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3338.407,3340.49,--No.
1982.81-1506,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3373.544,3377.115,Does that same limitation apply to the corporate--
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3377.115,3377.982,It doesn't--
1982.81-1506,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3377.982,3378.665,--collection?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3378.665,3379.498,--It does not.
1982.81-1506,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3397.446,3402.313,"Well, does that perhaps suggest an equal protection problem lurking behind this?"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3402.313,3406.884,--We would hope that this Court would not have to go that far to find that.
1982.81-1506,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3442.224,3453.413,Do you think Med Cal then suggests that these classifications between individual and corporate committees would be... would not run afoul of the equal protection?
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3453.413,3454.548,"I am sorry, I couldn't hear the first part."
1982.81-1506,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3454.548,3467.423,"I say, are you suggesting that Med Cal has said anything to indicate that these classifications would pass muster under the... under an equal protection attack?"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3467.423,3468.006,Not directly.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3468.006,3476.426,No one suggests that your initial mailing to the public is by any means violates any law.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3476.426,3477.362,"No, not at all."
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3477.362,3482.931,"And so you're free to solicit for membership, as you would like to have it interpreted--"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3482.931,3483.381,Yes.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3483.381,3484.248,--the public generally.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3496.823,3504.595,With the exception that you can use... you can use that money to... to finance political solicitation only if that solicitation goes to your members.
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3504.595,3505.112,--Yes.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3505.112,3511.499,"And, of course, it's our position that these individuals is a more than sufficient nexus between these individuals to be our members."
1982.81-1506,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3511.499,3524.508,"But you don't... you don't... if you didn't claim to be a membership organization, you wouldn't be in here challenging the general restriction on forming these groups."
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3524.508,3528.96,"No, because we would then be in the same position, I suppose, as the California Medical Association was."
1982.81-1506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3528.96,3529.61,Yes.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3593.45,3598.252,"Well, because this is an advocacy organization, Mr. Chief Justice, and not an economic organization."
1982.81-1506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3609.043,3610.412,Let's make it a little bit closer.
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3619.166,3634.777,"--Only if they believed... since it's not an economic relationship, it's a philosophic relationship, I would believe that they would not be disqualified unless they believed that it would somehow prevent them from reaching an equitable decision under the law."
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3634.777,3637.229,"Well, but isn't it even a little harder than that?"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3648.501,3649.203,Yes.
1982.81-1506,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3649.203,3660.226,"Then would it not be true that any individual, such as the Chief Justice suggested, who without perhaps realizing it is a member under your definition, he is in effect a party to this litigation?"
1982.81-1506,1,39941,richard_h_mansfield_iii,,3676.687,3683.508,"I hadn't thought of it in those terms precisely, but I suppose that there is justification in that."
1982.81-1506,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3683.508,3685.143,Very well.
1982.81-1506,2,20154,charles_n_steele,,3686.61,3689.245,"No, Your Honor, unless there are further questions."
1982.81-1506,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3689.245,3691.53,Very well.
