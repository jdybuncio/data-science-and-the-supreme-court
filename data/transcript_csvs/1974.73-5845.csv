1974.73-5845,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,35.055,"We'll hear arguments next in Number 73-5845, Jackson against the Metropolitan Edison Company."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,37.657,39.984,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,74.811,77.048,Consumer or customer?
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,77.048,81.348,Customer.
1974.73-5845,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,111.444,116.803,"But Mr. Greenberg, what could be the scope in this particular case of the hearing?"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,120.917,132.954,"Our suggestion on the hearing procedure, the hearing on crimination would be that we adopt the position of the brief amicus curiae of the New York State Public Utilities Commission."
1974.73-5845,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,163.77,166.667,"I'm not so concerned about the procedure, Mr. Greenberg."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,168.397,175.049,"In this particular case would be whether or not the consumer was liable for the payment of this disputed bill and if so, how much?"
1974.73-5845,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,175.049,176.375,"No other issue, would there?"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,176.375,178.978,"Not in this particular case, no."
1974.73-5845,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,178.978,184.478,And as a generality would that not likely to be true?
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,184.478,203.897,"That is again, I think the brief of the New York State Public Utilities Commission is very useful and that is typically the dispute -- the kind of dispute and frequently those kinds of disputes are resolved by sending out an independent meter reader but they sometimes may involve other kinds of issue that may have to be regarded in other way."
1974.73-5845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.845,211.196,"When you use the term consumer, Mr. Greenberg, are using it in counter-distinction to customer?"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,211.196,211.99,"No, I'm not."
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,218.142,225.117,"Well, we're going to get on into this case and find that if I understand it, that your client is not a customer, in fact."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,225.117,226.868,"Well, --"
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,226.868,230.371,That's from the -- that's the -- what you call it in this case.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,230.371,233.854,That is one of the issues that it's been raised by the respondent in this case.
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,242.302,245.902,"Well then, you did -- you meant any consumer than rather the --"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,245.902,247.455,"Well, this is service to her home."
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,247.455,252.938,"You've been advertently, I think, then gave from your point of view, the wrong answer to my question."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,260.598,264.89,"Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, the company in view to such."
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,265.022,267.319,She's a former customer but she isn't that correct?
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,267.319,275.511,"No, they came to her and they asked her to get $30.00 by Monday because the power is going to her home and they're looking her as being responsible and liable for paying this bill."
1974.73-5845,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,315.95,326.087,"I suppose from the utilities' point of view, they would be somewhat indifferent as to who paid the money if the amount due is paid."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,326.087,328.171,"Well, the amount due for all we know may have been paid."
1974.73-5845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.341,363.394,"But cutting off -- the cutting off of service to this particular home isn't the same thing as asserting of claim for the deficiency in the bill against Ms. Jackson, is it?"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,363.394,364.559,"Well, they did both."
1974.73-5845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,374.828,382.63,"But is that an ambiguous as to whether the threat was, “I'll cut off your power or I'll seek a judgment against you?”"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,382.63,385.313,There was never any power for seeking a judgment against him.
1974.73-5845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,385.313,386.951,"So, it's just basically cutting off the power."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,386.951,393.65,"The cutting off of power but throughout this case, they maintained until now that they're cut it off because she has not paid the bill."
1974.73-5845,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,398.867,402.807,Because I understand that the service had been resumed under order of the Court.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,402.807,404.069,Under a temporary restraining order.
1974.73-5845,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,404.069,409.989,And has any payment by -- had been made by anybody for utility service rendered since it was restored?
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,409.989,419.096,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, they have not sent her any bills and I think that may perhaps be preserved some legal position they are asserting that they haven't said."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,424.571,432.572,"But you wouldn't -- I would suppose, you would have objected if the -- under the temporary restraining order, the Court could have ordered to pay currently quite for her power?"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,432.572,443.632,"Without a doubt and in fact, at a point of my argument when I discussed some of the issues that might arise under fair hearing procedures that certainly could be a condition precedent to a hearing."
1974.73-5845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,501.725,511.018,"In your brief, you speak about the public function notion rely on Munn v. Illinois and you cite the Nebbia case."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,513.943,546.351,It is a part of the argument only in the sense that the Court of Appeals in the Third Circuit in deciding either the state action issue or the fair hearing issue or both would somewhat merge together in the Court of Appeals' opinion makes a point that the furnishing of electricity is not state action when the relationship to a subscriber is concerned.
1974.73-5845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.179,612.295,"Well, that's really a narrower argument than you make in your brief, isn't it, because if you take that public function in effect and with the public interest doctrine in Munn and follow it through the Nebbia in our decision."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,617.828,619.08,We do not contend for that.
1974.73-5845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,645.115,647.468,Hospital care would be included?
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,647.468,650.242,"Well, hospital care would involve questionable alternatives."
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,667.469,681.026,"Why, Mr. Greenberg is the question whether the necessity of light fell none relevant to whether or not it's action of the state?"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,681.026,683.643,It's not relevant to whether it's action of the state.
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,683.989,684.791,But that's the issue here.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,684.791,688.431,It's relevant to whether a due process hearing is required in these circumstances.
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,689.765,694.591,"Of course, there was no due process hearing required until unless it is action of the state please, that's a common ground, I suppose."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,694.591,704.962,"Yes, the Court of Appeals and I find that others too sometimes tend to and perhaps the law merged to questions together."
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,706.357,708.575,"Well, that confuses everything, wouldn't you agree?"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,708.575,711.46,"Well, it does but I'm responding to --"
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,711.46,711.736,"Well, --"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,711.736,714.911,The decisions on which we're taking to this Court.
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,716.907,717.053,Right.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,717.053,720.038,And there's action of the state whether it's a necessity of life or not.
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,720.038,720.798,Right.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,726.877,730.322,That's right but it has to do with whether or not a due process hearing is required.
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,730.891,749.579,"Well, of course to do -- if it is action of the state, then any state action that deprives anybody of liberty or property has to be taken within the meets and bounds of due process and the question is what does due process required in here in this situation?"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,749.579,750.617,It doesn't require a hearing.
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,758.887,762.629,But due process was required and the question is what does due process?
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,762.629,763.597,That's correct.
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,763.597,766.347,Mean or requiring in that -- in a particular circumstance.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,766.347,768.444,"Well, I subscribe to announce Mr. Justice Stewart."
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,790.339,795.263,But necessity of life or not does -- you're not arguing that hasn't anything to do whether or not this is state action --
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,795.263,802.224,"No, but it certainly does have to do with whether or not a hearing is required and I think the opinion speak of that does the petitioner --"
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,802.224,804.396,"Well, your passing a wide state action at that point --"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,804.396,806.091,Does he have an option.
1974.73-5845,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,813.539,814.58,Right.
1974.73-5845,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,814.58,823.932,"Mr. Greenberg, would you have found state action in this case if no tariff had been filed with the State Utility Commission?"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,830.608,832.738,"Mr. Justice Powell, I believe I would."
1974.73-5845,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,867.83,880.015,Would your basic issue be any different if you were dealing with let us say cable television which had been licensed and was regulated?
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,880.015,880.587,"Yes, it would be."
1974.73-5845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,935.429,938.703,"You're now, you've know left the state action argument there?"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,938.703,940.769,For the moment.
1974.73-5845,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1140.433,1141.311,-- put this in your brief?
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1144.193,1149.711,These points are not treated in the brief as systematically as I'm trying to present them in the argument.
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1247.867,1256.046,"Isn't the only thing at issue is $30.00, do you concede the -- that if the company was to continue service, there should be current payment."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1256.046,1256.962,"Oh, without a doubt."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1256.962,1269.201,And also if it's found -- if it's found that that she really doesn't know that $30.00 if she goes ahead and pays it as the odds are she's going to get it back.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1269.201,1270.256,"Oh sure, certainly."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1270.256,1285.494,"So, that there's no risk of loss on her part and the real question is whether $30.00, whether it‘s without notice or anything, without a hearing, she should be required to put up $30.00 pending a hearing on the matter."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1285.494,1287.637,"Well, she was agreeable for doing that."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1294.616,1298.892,"Well, I don't understand that."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1302.941,1304.734,"Well, the --"
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1304.734,1305.177,Do you think that --
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1305.177,1309.062,"The record says, they said, “Have $30.00 by Monday” and she said, “Okay.”"
1974.73-5845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1310.393,1312.485,Was there any tender?
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1312.485,1315.81,"No, because when they came on Monday morning, they just cut off the electricity and wouldn't talk to her."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1315.81,1325.391,"You don't suggest, you don't suggest that the company would have turn it off if she have paid for $30.00 and told them, “Look, I don't know that $30.00 and I'm going to try to get it back, huh!”"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1325.391,1335.861,"Well, I think they would have in this case because the only thing -- the only thing that we know is that they came on Thursday and said, “Have $30.00 by Monday” and they came on Monday and they wouldn't talk to her."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1338.918,1341.139,Let me get it clear.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1357.1,1359.307,"Oh, I think the Due Process Clause would have been satisfied."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1362.159,1363.708,Alright.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1367.59,1380.187,"No, no Mr. Justice White because while she's not received the bill, her counsel had been, I mean, the company's counsel have informed her counsel as set forth in the complaint that she owns a $110.00."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1380.187,1383.057,-- but you concede Mr. Greenberg that she had to pay currently?
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1383.057,1383.607,"Oh, yes."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.763,1384.466,"Well, alright."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1385.43,1389.361,"So, the $110.00 is for past due date, at least that's what they told her lawyer."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1391.268,1393.441,"You mean, the -- of her own past due bill?"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1393.441,1394.127,"Yes, yes."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.127,1395.096,Not the $30.00.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1395.096,1395.39,That's right.
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.059,1406.634,"Well, I'll put it to you again."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1410.399,1411.19,Yes.
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1411.19,1418.69,"And whether or not she is fair to say, you put up the money now and we'll keep your power going."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1421.472,1421.595,No.
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1421.595,1423.913,Because she's finally getting her money back if she wins.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1423.913,1427.234,"Well, the issue in the case, is she entitled to notice in hearing before cut off?"
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.222,1431.585,Before paying $30.00 or before paying the bills?
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1431.585,1434.369,"Well, she claims that she doesn't owe anything."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1434.369,1439.243,I understand that Mr. Greenberg but the question is who has to take the risk?
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1439.243,1439.718,That's right.
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.718,1444.343,Whose money is going to be up meanwhile?
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1444.343,1444.626,Right.
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1444.626,1446.582,Who's losing it if he's talking about meanwhile.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1446.582,1446.993,Right.
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1452.685,1453.847,I understand your submission.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1462.813,1463.936,"Well, she didn't at that time."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.115,1474.507,"If she had the $30.00 to put up, why she -- she put and the power would stay on and if she wins, she'd get it back."
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1474.507,1476.471,"Well, presumably, yes."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1493.718,1500.592,"I just take it, there's no issue that the hearing available sometime in real place. It is whether the before --"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1500.592,1500.793,That's right.
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.793,1502.552,-- put up the $30.00.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1502.552,1513.713,"That's right and the issue is this sufficient property right of some of the cases referred to it, so that there has to be notice in hearing before her -- before her right of is set before the property's cut off."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.713,1520.973,But the burden on her is having to put up $30.00 pending litigation?
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1520.973,1521.749,Or maybe more.
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.999,1538.811,"Mr. Greenberg, whatever the sum is, that's what we're talking about is the burden on her of having to put up what her unpaid bill is pending litigation?"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1538.811,1539.92,"Well, that may not be --"
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1539.92,1541.63,I don't know why you don't say yes.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1545.265,1552.365,"Well, because I'm not certain that that's the fact because she has -- she has made some tenders of partial payment and they haven't wanted to take it."
1974.73-5845,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1558.2,1560.508,What tenders of partial payment has she made?
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1561.79,1566.855,The record only -- the records in some of the opinions refer and except the fact that she made some efforts to make partial payment --
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1566.855,1570.662,And that even makes -- that even makes my question more an element.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1580.039,1584.793,"Well, was the some of the -- or the only burden on the person whose garnishing is --"
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.793,1586.65,-- Due Process Clause doesn't require a hearing.
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1588.748,1589.742,She could've -- she could've --
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.742,1591.172,put all the burdens on the --
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1591.172,1604.238,"Yes, she could've put up the money first, in what amount one does not know because the linemen said have $30.00 but she has never received the bill."
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1613.286,1621.583,"Well, you say we shouldn't look this case as the one involved -- this necessity of putting up $30.00 pending litigation?"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1621.583,1625.353,I think it might -- it might involve very much more.
1974.73-5845,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.353,1628.17,"Now, when you cut off the same way though, it was only $30.00, wouldn't it?"
1974.73-5845,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,1628.17,1629.903,"I would come up the same way, yes."
1974.73-5845,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1636.964,1641.165,"Very well, Mr. Greenberg."
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,1643.502,1648.324,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1696.05,1700.001,Does the record show why not change in billing occurred?
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,1700.001,1701.307,No.
1974.73-5845,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1720.517,1721.359,And not to her?
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,1721.359,1736.408,"And not to her and during that period, she made no effort to pay the bill that was outstanding for the service prior to that termination."
1974.73-5845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1856.224,1859.245,Did somebody tell her to pay $30.00?
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,1859.245,1861.533,That is her testimony and --
1974.73-5845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1861.533,1863.148,And it is uncontradicted.
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,1863.148,1866.0,And it is uncontradicted.
1974.73-5845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1869.058,1871.727,What didn't they recognize her as a customer?
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,1871.727,1878.987,"No, it recognized that she was a former customer as counsel with an outstanding bill of over a hundred dollars."
1974.73-5845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1878.987,1882.09,Did they tell her anything about $110.00 then?
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,1882.09,1884.572,There is nothing at this time in here on the 100 --
1974.73-5845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1884.572,1892.992,"Because the only thing in the record is that somebody said, “Lady, give me $30.00 or I will cut, it's your guess or electric down?”"
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,1892.992,1893.707,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-5845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1907.3,1912.656,And what -- all I'm dealing along now is whether you would treat her as a customer or not?
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,1912.656,1923.112,I believe Your Honor that it was not -- there was a discussion about new service that had to be because she testified.
1974.73-5845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1932.609,1936.01,Do you did change service if somebody comes in the house?
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,1945.415,1956.866,"Well, Your Honor, maybe it would be a help if I took just a minute before getting the state action to tell you the company's procedures in regard to delinquent accounts."
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.67,1970.033,How many notices went out?
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,1970.033,1972.3,"217,000."
1974.73-5845,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1972.3,1973.79,"Is this in the record, Mr. Debevoise?"
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,1973.79,1975.128,"It isn't, Your Honor."
1974.73-5845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1978.451,1982.628,"Is 217,000 in New York?"
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,1982.628,1987.024,In the service area of Metropolitan Edison which includes more than New York.
1974.73-5845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1988.202,1988.996,And you have many more --
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,1988.996,1989.483,Somewhat less than --
1974.73-5845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1989.483,1992.928,"17,000 customers in New York, do you?"
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,1992.928,1994.174,"I don't believe we do, Your Honor, no."
1974.73-5845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1994.174,1996.961,"No, I believe after all."
1974.73-5845,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1996.961,2002.969,"That suggested some customers may have received multiple notices, is it not?2"
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2002.969,2019.82,"Now, that goes out after 30 days after the bill, and when no response is heard to from that, and there 129,000 such cases, those cases were referred to the credit managers."
1974.73-5845,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2317.772,2327.481,"First, the petitioner contends, I guess that the inaction of the commission after the filing was tantamount to affirmative approval."
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2327.481,2329.052,I think that is the issue.
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2363.391,2368.416,"You say, that you stated if the commission had entered an affirmative order of proving the tariff."
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2368.416,2370.004,"In saying, you do it this way."
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2370.004,2373.221,"Well no, it didn't say, you do it this way just to prove it."
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2373.221,2374.694,"It accepted a for filing, I believe this is --"
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.694,2378.807,"Well, I know but let's assume they had entered an order of proving."
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2395.473,2409.827,"I think in that case, that the company acting under it would get support and encouragement from state action and a suit against those procedures rely."
1974.73-5845,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2415.65,2424.885,"Well, we assumed against those procedures would lie in fact my brother White's hypothetical, he assumed that there was a suit brought against those procedures and they were unsuccessful, as I understood his question."
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2424.885,2427.486,"Right, but then the utility went out --"
1974.73-5845,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2427.486,2427.941,But the --
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.941,2432.531,submission turns the power off without a hearing.
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2432.531,2432.82,Right.
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2432.82,2438.247,And the issue is whether the act of turning the power off without a hearing is action of the State.
1974.73-5845,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2438.247,2438.592,Right.
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2438.592,2438.653,Right.
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.653,2439.506,And you would say it would be?
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2439.506,2439.972,Yes.
1974.73-5845,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2439.972,2441.418,Alright.
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2444.287,2444.827,"Well, --"
1974.73-5845,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2444.827,2448.248,You can say safely in this case maybe but that's pretty big concession to say.
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2448.248,2452.457,"Well, it is for the purposes of this case that I am conceding it, Your Honor."
1974.73-5845,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2452.457,2459.17,Do you feel bound by the Pollak case in that regard?
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2459.17,2469.262,The reasoning behind conceding for this case is we are a very heavily regulated industry.
1974.73-5845,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2522.109,2538.074,"But of course, that was Justice White's -- what you thought to be Justice White's hypothetical but what I understood him to say was not his hypothetical situation A, whether utility says, you do it that's whether Utility Commission says, you do it this way."
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2551.796,2556.644,"Well, that -- that to me is not action and I'm sorry if I misunderstood."
1974.73-5845,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2556.644,2558.644,"Actually, this case isn't it."
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2558.644,2559.297,It is.
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2559.297,2572.842,"Right therefore my examples simply meant that if the Court -- if they make -- if they filed a tariff and there is litigation of -- about the validity of the termination rule and the commission says, this is perfectly consistent with state law."
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2577.741,2582.252,"I think that still is non-action, Justice White."
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2584.346,2589.673,"No, no, just to prove it, but they did it, but there was affirmative proof of the tariff."
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2589.673,2591.567,But not saying that this is the way you have to do.
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2591.567,2595.577,"But you could file another tariff, you wanted to."
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2603.258,2603.617,Right.
1974.73-5845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2619.273,2621.24,Could you reading from a newspaper?
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2621.24,2625.911,"Unfortunately, Your Honor, it was late last week in Manhattan."
1974.73-5845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2625.911,2630.11,But was it a hearsay or what?
1974.73-5845,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2630.11,2631.196,It was a Court decision in Vermont.
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2631.196,2631.982,It's a Court decision.
1974.73-5845,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2631.982,2634.228,It's reported out on a newspaper.
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2637.599,2659.283,"It is the Rutland Herald of last week, Your Honor, reporting the motion by Vermont Welfare Rights Organization asking the Supreme Court to reconsider its decision voiding the policy of the Public Service Board in connection with termination procedures."
1974.73-5845,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2723.287,2727.469,"Mr. Debevoise, before you move on, I want to be clear."
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2745.568,2750.966,"In the case that I can visualize at the moment, Justice Powell, I would, yes."
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2794.416,2803.018,"Otherwise, any private act is consistent with state law and then in one sense would have the approval of state law would be state action?"
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2803.018,2813.047,"Exactly, exactly, in all of the regulated businesses and there are very, very few businesses that are not regulated in some degree today."
1974.73-5845,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2845.176,2852.841,What do you say Mr. Debevoise about the order is if the state has ordered the companies that furnish electricity?
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2852.841,2865.286,I believe that there is no right to receive electric service except under --
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.286,2869.368,-- is not a statutory obligation for the companies that take part in the electricity --
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2869.368,2870.474,There is a statutory --
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.474,2871.69,Without discrimination?
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2871.69,2876.269,"Without -- exactly, I was going to say except under the Equal Protection Clause."
1974.73-5845,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2893.819,2899.925,"But again, it would be if only if you were a state."
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2902.089,2902.556,Excuse me --
1974.73-5845,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2902.556,2904.073,Private individuals as --
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2904.073,2907.686,"There, we were dealing with a municipal company."
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.922,2932.826,"But if a -- alright, but if a person is willing to leave up to the rules of the company without this tariff, there's a statutory obligation to furnish service."
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2932.826,2944.051,"Once -- once we have hooked somebody else, accepted somebody as a customer, there's a statutory obligation for reasonably continuous service, I think it is."
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2954.199,2959.848,But you're saying that a State may order a company to furnish electricity.
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2975.082,2984.862,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor, because the state can only order as to supply electricity within the context of the rights of the utilities."
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.437,2995.297,"Well, it could, I suppose, in order to get a hearing before a termination."
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2995.297,2998.112,I believe that the Public Service Commission could --
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2998.112,2998.739,Yes.
1974.73-5845,1,42591,thomas_m_debevoise,,2998.739,2999.675,Direct that.
1974.73-5845,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2999.675,3005.533,"So, that they wouldn't made -- they wouldn't be violating any rights of yours if they ordered it?"
