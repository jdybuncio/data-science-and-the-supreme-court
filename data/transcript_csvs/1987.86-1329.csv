1987.86-1329,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.856,"We'll hear argument now in No. 86-1329, Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation versus Mayacamas Corporation."
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,12.574,15.676,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,115.975,123.629,"Mr. Bien, as I understand it, the Georgia suit went to trial and there's a judgment."
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,123.629,125.081,I will be addressing that.
1987.86-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,125.081,125.714,Is that right?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,125.714,126.281,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,126.281,137.889,And have you filed any motion in the Federal District Court now to dismiss the suit on res judicata grounds or something?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,137.889,137.972,No.
1987.86-1329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,173.276,177.078,But you haven't reached the appellate stage yet?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,177.078,177.68,No.
1987.86-1329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,177.68,180.113,Surely you will appeal?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,180.113,184.767,I can state on Gulfstream's behalf that we will not appeal.
1987.86-1329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,184.767,185.683,You will not appeal?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,185.683,186.15,We will not appeal.
1987.86-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.339,204.278,No further motions have been filed in the Federal District Court as a result of what's transpired?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,204.278,204.778,--Not as of yet.
1987.86-1329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.578,212.265,You would acknowledge that it's moot if Mayacamas doesn't take an appeal?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,212.265,231.81,"If Mayacamas does not take an appeal and if a Federal Trial Judge, District Judge finds res judicata to be applicable, and if there's a dispute that is resolved in favor of res judicata on appeal, then I think technical mootness would apply."
1987.86-1329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.464,238.131,Wait a minute.
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,249.237,251.688,"--Well, we don't reach the res judicata issue here."
1987.86-1329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,251.688,257.092,You don't think that's essential to your contention that this is duplicative litigation?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,257.092,268.566,"Well, assuming that a final decision in one forum or the other, let's say in a State forum, was reached and there was finality, then we would certainly argue that--"
1987.86-1329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.566,269.233,Right.
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,282.326,292.681,"--I think the judgment would have to be afforded full faith and credit in the Federal Court, and that would effectively end the dispute."
1987.86-1329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,298.669,304.239,"Indeed, you're arguing that there is res judicata, that's part of your argument?"
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,304.239,322.051,"Well, again, I don't believe that the reason to avoid duplicative litigation is that the prospect of a res judicata now here in the Federal Court, but in either Court, creates the kind of tension and pressure on both courts that's undesirable."
1987.86-1329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,380.073,382.608,Between these parties?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,384.741,385.81,--Not these particular parties.
1987.86-1329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.81,390.012,--But isn't that what the capable of repetition requires?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,390.012,397.701,"Well, I believe that under the Roe v. Wade in the pregnancy situation and some others, that it doesn't necessarily have to affect the particular party."
1987.86-1329,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.701,398.668,But what of the some others?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,398.668,426.452,"I believe the Blumstein case, the Dunn v. Blumstein, where the challenge to election rules where even if the particular plaintiff that brought the case may not have been in a position to vote in a state with a challenged election procedure that there might have been other voters who are facing the exact same situation which if it was not adjudicated by this Court might once again have the issue evade with you."
1987.86-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,432.522,437.058,May I ask just one question to be sure I understand the result of the trial.
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,444.045,445.378,No.
1987.86-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.33,448.913,Net award.
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,448.913,450.663,"We would have to pay them $900,000."
1987.86-1329,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,450.663,451.03,Okay.
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,452.282,453.348,Right.
1987.86-1329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,551.528,556.015,Do I understand you to say that they could have removed it of course?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,556.015,558.234,Why is that?
1987.86-1329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,558.234,563.871,You have just said that they could have removed it to Federal Court?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,563.871,565.371,That's correct.
1987.86-1329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,565.371,575.493,"If that step had been taken, could the case have been transferred to the Northern District of California... is that where it was?"
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,575.493,589.003,"Mayacamas, if it felt that California was a more convenient forum, certainly had a Motion under Title 28 Section 1404 for a transfer for the convenience of parties and in the interests of justice."
1987.86-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,604.178,618.486,"And if we thought that the action could have been filed in the California District Court, I guess you could have filed a motion there to change venue back to the Georgia District Court."
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,618.486,618.669,Certainly.
1987.86-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,618.669,620.188,Did you ever file such a motion?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,620.188,621.638,No.
1987.86-1329,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,621.638,622.14,No.
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,622.14,626.424,Our position was that the case shouldn't even proceed in California.
1987.86-1329,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,676.024,684.796,"Mr. Bien, as a practical matter, what were the consequences to your client of the District Court's denial of your stay motion?"
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,689.165,693.236,"There were discovery proceedings, as I understand it, going forward in both forums."
1987.86-1329,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.873,729.342,"Of course, you said that they insisted on proceeding with it."
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,740.381,763.913,"I think that at the threshold that the ruling in question on our motion citing the availability of removal and arguing under Colorado River that the District Court shouldn't proceed at all, I think that was... and I'm anticipating the problem of appealability here... I think that was a conclusive type of ruling."
1987.86-1329,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1040.341,1052.649,"Well, what if the District Court here had said, Mr. Bien, I'm going to deny your motion to dismiss but I'm going to stay all proceedings in this case for six months, and then you people come back and tell me how the Georgia litigation is coming."
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,1053.934,1055.451,I believe so.
1987.86-1329,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1081.936,1087.905,"Well, you say then that the Northern District of California actually did not have jurisdiction of this action?"
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,1087.905,1088.488,"No, no."
1987.86-1329,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1093.873,1095.992,So it's just a question whether the Court should have proceeded with the case?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,1095.992,1096.592,That's correct.
1987.86-1329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1300.658,1306.312,Suppose you had filed in the Federal Court when you filed your suit in Georgia.
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,1306.312,1306.812,Right.
1987.86-1329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.514,1311.883,And then there was a suit filed in California.
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,1317.085,1319.287,--You're assuming a State court?
1987.86-1329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.287,1329.493,"Neither, both Federal Courts, you filed in the Federal court, and the defendant in your suit filed in a Federal court in California."
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,1329.493,1337.164,"I think in that instance, I think we would have objected to having to try the same case twice, but I don't think it would have been so much of a problem."
1987.86-1329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1352.008,1354.608,"One or the other is stayed, isn't it."
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,1358.595,1364.582,"Well, I think that decision is a prudential one, purely prudential and discretionary."
1987.86-1329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1364.582,1370.386,"You filed one day in Georgia, and the defendant filed the next day in California."
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,1375.172,1387.063,"When there's nothing of the importance of the removal policy involved, I think the Federal judge in that case has to look to a whole panoply of practical considerations."
1987.86-1329,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.585,1407.357,"I take it then that the only difference between the case I posited is that here, removal was available from the State court."
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,1407.357,1416.499,This is the over arching concern here where you've got an historical policy not to allow duplicative suits like this.
1987.86-1329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1433.525,1445.666,"Mr. Bien, I may have missed something here but is jurisdiction over your opposition still contested, jurisdiction of the Georgia Court over your opposition still contested?"
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,1445.666,1454.955,Mayacamas I believe maintains its position that it's not subject to in personam jurisdiction on long arm principles.
1987.86-1329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1464.128,1465.496,What kind of an appearance have they made?
1987.86-1329,0,21865,elliot_l_bien,,1468.698,1470.465,Have they made a special appearance?
1987.86-1329,1,26252,gregory_h_ward,,1556.404,1566.195,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1987.86-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1610.057,1621.513,"Mr. Ward, can you state categorically at this point whether your client is going to appeal from the Georgia judgment if your motion for a new trial is denied?"
1987.86-1329,1,26252,gregory_h_ward,,1621.513,1630.186,"Your Honor, it is the intention of Mayacamas to move the trial court for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict."
1987.86-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1630.186,1631.238,I understand that.
1987.86-1329,1,26252,gregory_h_ward,,1631.238,1632.554,And also to request a new trial.
1987.86-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1649.432,1652.801,Are you going to answer my question?
1987.86-1329,1,26252,gregory_h_ward,,1652.801,1653.967,Yes.
1987.86-1329,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1653.967,1654.467,Are you going to appeal if--
1987.86-1329,1,26252,gregory_h_ward,,1654.467,1656.767,"Oh, are we going to appeal if those motions are denied?"
1987.86-1329,2,21865,elliot_l_bien,,2947.212,2949.648,Thank you.
1987.86-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3013.802,0.0,You say it's clear.
1987.86-1329,2,21865,elliot_l_bien,,3017.504,3030.412,"Well, the next comment that I was going to make was that this Court had a decision called Polizzi v. Kels Magazines, I can give you the cite now or subsequently, in which there had been a removal."
1987.86-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3030.412,3031.212,Do it now.
1987.86-1329,2,21865,elliot_l_bien,,3031.212,3031.847,Certainly.
1987.86-1329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3039.0,3040.619,Thank you.
1987.86-1329,2,21865,elliot_l_bien,,3040.619,3054.26,It's a 1953 decision in which this Court ordered the District Court following removal to proceed to examine the challenge to in personam jurisdiction to the sufficiency of the service of process.
1987.86-1329,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3234.661,3237.728,"Thank you, Mr. Bien."
