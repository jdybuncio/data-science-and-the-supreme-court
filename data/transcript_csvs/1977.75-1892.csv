1977.75-1892,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,90.698,We will hear arguments next in United States against Mc Donald.
1977.75-1892,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,98.272,101.524,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.75-1892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,350.272,358.921,What case is from this Court did the Fourth Circuit cite to support its concept of pendent Jurisdiction over the Speedy trial.
1977.75-1892,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,358.921,364.239,My recollection Mr. Justice Rehnquist is that it cited none.
1977.75-1892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,466.885,477.74,Could the speedy trial claim had been presented a new to the District Court in a motion for judgment NOV or judgment of acquittal of the conclusion if the guilty verdict had been retained?
1977.75-1892,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,477.74,507.861,"Yes, it can and it is our position that that would be the preferable way in which to present it because as I will get to in a moment, it is often impossible to rule on such a motion until you see what the evidence is a trial because frequently the defendant's contentions would be that he has been prejudiced in his ability to defend himself by the delay that might have been caused by the the government and it is only after trial that such a claim can be intelligently assessed."
1977.75-1892,1,18087,bernard_l_segal,,1429.055,1433.178,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.75-1892,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1531.236,1545.007,"How does the military establishments finding, bear on indictment, leader brought by civil authorities?"
1977.75-1892,1,18087,bernard_l_segal,,1545.007,1556.264,"If Your Honor pleases, both of these proceedings both the military proceeding 1970, and the proceeding of Federal District Court were proceedings by the same sovereign, the United States."
1977.75-1892,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1567.679,1571.768,Under two wholly different systems of justice are they not?
1977.75-1892,1,18087,bernard_l_segal,,1571.768,1572.979,"That is right, if Your Honor pleases and--"
1977.75-1892,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1572.979,1581.412,"Military code is one and the civilian code is quite another, is it not?"
1977.75-1892,1,18087,bernard_l_segal,,1581.412,1589.143,"Yes Mr. Chief Justice, I might just point out, that it is a matter of fact it was the election of the Government as to which of these two systems it might go to."
1977.75-1892,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1625.367,1627.226,"It was not a trial, was it not?"
1977.75-1892,1,18087,bernard_l_segal,,1627.226,1627.691,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor."
1977.75-1892,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1627.691,1628.783,It was not a trial.
1977.75-1892,1,18087,bernard_l_segal,,1628.783,1644.094,"We do not-- because of the special circumstances concerted to be a trial, no Your Honor, that is not the issue for Court which is develops on the Double Jeopardy argument which the Court of Appeals said had merits but reserved any decision on and therefore has not been decided and not before this Court this time."
1977.75-1892,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1644.094,1647.052,And then what bearing does it have here?
1977.75-1892,1,18087,bernard_l_segal,,1647.052,1647.682,The military proceeding--
1977.75-1892,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1647.682,1650.918,It was not a trial it was just an investigation.
1977.75-1892,1,18087,bernard_l_segal,,1650.918,1652.381,"No if Your Honor pleases, the-"
1977.75-1892,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1652.381,1655.527,"It was just an investigation, was it not?"
1977.75-1892,1,18087,bernard_l_segal,,1655.527,1660.377,"Your Honor, I would not â€“ I do not think that is correct characterization Mr. Justice Marshall."
1977.75-1892,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1662.029,1668.679,Well was he at any time subject to be sentenced by this hearing?
1977.75-1892,1,18087,bernard_l_segal,,1668.679,1671.356,"No Your Honor, not the Article 32 proceeding."
1977.75-1892,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1671.356,1674.089,"Well I am talking about, is that all what we are talking about?"
1977.75-1892,1,18087,bernard_l_segal,,1674.089,1681.202,"The article if I may respond Your Honor in this way, the Article 32 proceedings encompasses more than just a phase that I am now referring to."
1977.75-1892,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1690.058,1695.288,And their conclusion is that we shall call a general court that is all it says.
1977.75-1892,1,18087,bernard_l_segal,,1706.338,1724.59,"The language of the formal order at the conclusion of the military proceeding was to dismiss the charges, but that was a formal piece of language that we did not take cognizance of what the uniform code a Military Justice required to be found by Colonel Rock, at the end if Your Honor pleases."
1977.75-1892,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1785.041,1792.506,"It is not any more than a conclusion of an investigatory authority,as Mr. Justice Marshall has suggested."
1977.75-1892,1,18087,bernard_l_segal,,1792.506,1793.684,The finding--
1977.75-1892,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1793.684,1795.449,That is not trial.
1977.75-1892,1,18087,bernard_l_segal,,1795.449,1795.849,"No Your Honor, it is not a trial."
1977.75-1892,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1795.849,1798.525,"He was not exposed to Jeopardy, was he?"
1977.75-1892,1,18087,bernard_l_segal,,1798.525,1810.116,"Not by virtue of being before Colonel Rock, no Jeopardy attached Your Honor -- it is the argument that we think has not been decided by the Fourth Circuit clearly is not the result."
1977.75-1892,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3320.598,3329.286,"Mr. Chief Justice, first briefly I would like to address the suggestion that the government somehow been inconsistent, the position we are taking in this case and the position."
