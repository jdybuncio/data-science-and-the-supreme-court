1967.705,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,30.745,"Number 705, George William Bruton, petitioner versus United States."
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,32.08,35.449,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.705,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,609.453,612.597,And you're not asking to overrule Delli?
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,612.597,616.037,I don't believe that it is necessary to overrule Delli Paoli.
1967.705,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,637.965,647.554,"Well, I gather the -- when you say legally obtained, it -- quality, it's perfectly fine evidence, isn't it?"
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,659.495,659.912,That's correct.
1967.705,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,659.912,669.246,There's no question as to your clients co-defendant was highly proof of evidence --
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,669.246,669.736,That's correct.
1967.705,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,669.736,671.201,His own admission.
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,671.201,675.25,His own admission but it was prejudicial of course also to my defendant despite that --
1967.705,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,675.25,677.873,"Well, I know that's why I'm asking you."
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,696.335,699.864,I don't think that it is necessary in order to obtain another trial for us to -- for this defendant.
1967.705,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,699.864,702.804,"Well, I have difficulty understanding that."
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,702.804,707.429,I think that the Delli Paoli rule is improper.
1967.705,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,716.259,718.241,I rather stopped at you myself if --
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,718.241,718.907,That's correct.
1967.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,718.907,726.746,But this is really your objection to the confession to his setting as to the co-defendant?
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,726.746,727.921,That's correct and --
1967.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,727.921,732.701,You wouldn't have any objection to the confession unless it mentioned your client?
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,732.701,734.572,"Well, if it --"
1967.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,734.572,742.971,If Evans' confession hadn't mentioned your client why Evans' reversal wouldn't be a ground to reversing your client's case?
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,742.971,743.436,No.
1967.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.663,763.257,The reason for requiring the Court to instruct the jury about the -- to use this evidence is that hearsay and admissible against your client?
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,763.257,764.375,That's correct.
1967.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,764.375,768.64,That's a basic reason for objection of Delli Paoli in this case?
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,768.64,770.256,That's correct and I think --
1967.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,770.256,788.942,"And you're saying that when you have an objectionable hearsay that gets before the jury, it's just -- it isn't sufficient for the Court to instruct the jury to disregard it?"
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,788.942,792.318,That is true and in this factual situation indeed --
1967.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,792.318,805.739,I don't know why you wouldn't argue that Delli Paoli should be overruled and indeed that any case I would suppose you would say that the rule ought to apply to all instances where objectionable hearsay is to the jury?
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,805.739,813.355,I don't think that it is necessary in this factual situation because I think the case here is weak.
1967.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,813.355,818.873,You mean you don't -- you think this rule wouldn't have any implications in all the situations?
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,818.873,823.547,I'm quite sure that they are highly important in other situation.
1967.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,823.547,825.376,Like Delli Paoli?
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,825.376,827.926,"Well, I think the case can be distinguished from Delli Paoli--"
1967.705,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,827.926,829.442,"Well, it can --"
1967.705,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.442,831.571,Well it can in the name of the case.
1967.705,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,831.571,851.091,"It can in the sense that it was held that his own admission was improperly admitted against your co-defendant but I really don't see how that makes a distinction which would make attainable to suggest that if we go with you, that doesn't overrule Delli Paoli?"
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,852.519,866.044,I think that a defendant in the role that Bruton had here is not sufficiently protected by an instruction or the instructions that this Court had given which are -- were not objected to and are proper.
1967.705,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,898.065,903.469,Do you agree then with the position of the government?
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,903.469,905.023,No.
1967.705,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,943.805,958.259,"In sum it's your position that Delli Paoli is a bad law and it should be overruled, but it is necessary to rule that part to have your client's conviction reversed?"
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,958.259,958.646,That's correct.
1967.705,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,958.646,961.279,And therefore you attempt to [Inaudible] isn't it?
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,961.279,961.884,That's correct.
1967.705,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,961.884,963.661,I see.
1967.705,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,963.661,967.524,"At least two other Court of Appeals have done that, haven't they?"
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,967.524,967.85,Yes.
1967.705,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,967.85,978.051,I guess I have been reading Judge Friendly's opinion in the Bozza case and Judge Smith's opinion in the same court in Floyd against Wilkins and Judge Skelly Wright's opinion in Greenwell --
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,978.051,978.347,That's correct.
1967.705,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,978.347,997.677,All of them faced with Delli Paoli and all three of those judgments reversed convictions under situation similar to yours pointing out that Delli Paoli stands for no inflexible rule at all.
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,997.677,1000.279,That's correct.
1967.705,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1000.279,1006.941,"Either that this is always permissible or never permissible, but Delli Paoli just was decided on the facts of that case."
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,1009.864,1011.19,Yes.
1967.705,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1024.38,1048.314,"On that basis even if the Court were not willing to overrule Delli Paoli to the extent that it held that this was sometimes permissible, you would still prevail if the Second Circuit in the District Court's approach were adopted -- District of Columbia's approach --"
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,1048.314,1049.166,That is correct.
1967.705,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1069.629,1097.066,"Well, actually this is arguably anyway a stronger case for reversal than Greenwell and Bozza and so on because here, you have the fact which is not present in the other cases that the confession was held inadmissible on the appeal and was in Greenwell?"
1967.705,0,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,1097.066,1100.542,It was in Greenwell and -- but not in Bozza.
1967.705,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1119.586,1123.737,Very well.
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1126.291,1129.277,May it please the Court.
1967.705,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1198.44,1201.701,And one of them -- and at least one of them has confessed?
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1201.701,1204.014,And at least one of them has confessed.
1967.705,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1385.525,1389.844,You would agree Mr. Solicitor General I suppose that that in logic doesn't really --
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1389.844,1394.145,"I agree that logically, it makes no difference."
1967.705,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1514.758,1529.485,"Well, generally if logic doesn't lead us to that conclusion, is it just expediency in the prosecution the cases that does lead us to that conclusion, your conclusion?"
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1529.485,1531.5,Expedience in the prosecution of cases?
1967.705,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1531.5,1543.342,-- wise to make it easier to convict people by trying them jointly where one confesses and in his confession he names the other?
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1543.342,1561.54,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that it is just a matter of expediency in getting confessions, in getting convictions which leads to the desirability of trying a number of people at once."
1967.705,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1627.717,1629.708,That's number 3 in the 1956 term?
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1629.708,1633.223,Number 33 in 1956 term.
1967.705,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1633.223,1636.128,"And is that Delli Paoli itself, no?"
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1636.128,1637.331,That is Delli Paoli.
1967.705,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1637.331,1638.591,That is Delli Paoli.
1967.705,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1638.591,1652.726,"Mr. Solicitor General, I take it whether there shall or shall not be a joint trial is perhaps entirely in the discretion of the United States attorney, is it?"
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1662.044,1665.426,"As far as I understand it, the counsel for any defendant can also ask --"
1967.705,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1665.426,1666.051,Yes.
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1697.999,1702.072,"Mr. Justice, in some cases, I think that is possible."
1967.705,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1744.98,1754.166,"Well, what I'm trying to suggest is I don't see why necessarily overruling Delli Paoli means the end of joint trials."
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1768.942,1770.212,It could have been done here.
1967.705,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1780.018,1799.678,"Well then may I suggest, I don't know why that doesn't present to the United States Attorney then a choice, is he going to try them jointly if he needs that confession so badly in its complete form or in that kind of situation if he must then ask for severance?"
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1801.391,1804.385,"I think its -- Mr. Justice, I think it's more complicated."
1967.705,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1804.385,1804.793,I see.
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1807.579,1826.763,"In the brief in the Delli Paoli case, the government said that such trials remain a proper and necessary measure of counteracting the equally serious problems intrinsic, in separate and successive trials of joint defendants."
1967.705,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1921.887,1930.632,But isn't this sometimes to Mr. Solicitor General -- it seems to me at least and many of the records that come here.
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1940.237,1941.389,I agree Mr. Justice.
1967.705,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1944.926,1955.607,"Well, if the rule is that Delli Paoli is overruled, I suggest that maybe we will have to give some more thought this sort."
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1955.607,1963.238,I know that it is easy in my position to second guess the man who were on the firing line.
1967.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1969.466,1976.016,"Mr. Solicitor General, I would like to see what I quite understand your position."
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2007.402,2011.717,That standing alone is not sufficient to warrant a new trial.
1967.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2011.717,2012.435,Alright.
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2012.435,2016.263,I have change your question a little bit.
1967.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2023.426,2026.47,Objectionable in a technical sense.
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2026.47,2041.094,"I do not think that that alone without further facts which show that on balance, this had an appreciable effect in the conclusion reached in the trial that it should be sufficient to establish a new trial."
1967.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2041.094,2042.314,"Well, what is this?"
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2055.678,2068.013,"I think Mr. Justice that it may be analogous to the no prejudicial error rule which I think if you look at it, it's logically hard to defend in a particular case."
1967.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2074.637,2100.495,A trial judge may not know until a whole -- until all of the evidence is in whether he did the right thing or didn't do the right thing in permitting this confession to -- in permitting the trial to go forward with the -- without severance in view of the use of the confession.
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2102.394,2103.718,And I would suggest that the --
1967.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2103.718,2104.473,-- is that right?
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2104.473,2107.758,-- the prosecutor may not know that either.
1967.705,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2215.666,2216.935,"Probably compellable, isn't it?"
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2216.935,2220.038,"And compellable to testify, he has been acquitted."
1967.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2242.079,2246.307,Forgive me for asking you to take your time to ask you one more question.
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2260.954,2262.234,I believe it did Mr. Justice.
1967.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2262.234,2263.741,Oh it did?
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2277.412,2280.629,I have no such information Mr. Justice.
1967.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2304.991,2333.664,"Of course, that's kind of the key question I think because at least in terms of an assessment of this problem because if we're talking about most trial when we confront the confession problem, we're talking about most trials in which there are co-defendants that's one thing if we're talking about a small percentage of them that's another thing."
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2333.664,2335.076,"Well, may I say Mr. Justice."
1967.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2337.383,2340.199,I said that you have been talking logically.
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2340.199,2342.468,"No, I appreciate that."
1967.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2362.721,2370.641,"Because if you want to take this up logically, I think we're going to have to unwind the great deal of your argument?"
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2370.641,2371.918,I agree.
1967.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2494.03,2497.143,"Well, that is your position here."
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2505.311,2509.155,"No Mr. Justice, I am saying that in all of the circumstances of this case --"
1967.705,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2509.155,2514.241,"Yes but in all of the circumstances, this is the key operative point."
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2527.501,2545.291,"I'm trying to say Mr. Justice that even though such an instruction is given, it may not be enough in the actual facts to satisfy the court that the instruction was actually effective."
1967.705,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2569.332,2571.635,Is there any stopping point?
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2581.649,2598.431,No Mr. Justice except in terms of the usual function which courts performed in criminal and in civil cases of overlooking the whole transaction and trying to see that justice has been done.
1967.705,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2614.74,2627.27,"Well, is that to suggest perhaps that the mere comment itself against this background of very slim evidence is more likely you convict then if nothing whatever it has been said about?"
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2627.27,2661.906,"Well, I think Mr. Justice that you could have had a case that even if I could see the writing of an opinion in this case that even if the evidence against Evans had been admissible that there should have been a reversal against Bruton on the ground that the other evidence against him was slim and under the Delli Paoli rule the reference to Bruton on the whole was one which should not have been allowed."
1967.705,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2661.906,2668.766,And the judge's emphasis on telling the jury to forget it only drove --
1967.705,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2668.766,2670.628,"Well, that's a kind of dilemma."
1967.705,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2742.589,2745.367,Mr. Reardon.
1967.705,2,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,2745.367,2748.981,"Mr. Chief Justice, I have nothing further."
1967.705,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2748.981,2749.67,I beg your pardon.
1967.705,2,21416,daniel_p_reardon_jr,,2749.67,2750.773,I have nothing further.
1967.705,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2750.773,2776.55,"Mr. Reardon, I understand that you were appointed by the Court of Appeals of the Eight Circuit and I want to say to you that the Court considers that that is a real public service that is performed by lawyers in those circumstances and we feel comforted when the lawyers will undertake that to move forward for the public good."
