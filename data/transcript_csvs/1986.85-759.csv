1986.85-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.837,We will hear argument next in Maryland versus Garrison.
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,51.349,75.964,"Thank you very much Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, we are here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Maryland which reversed the conviction of respondent Garrison because in the judgment of the Maryland Court of Appeals the evidence necessary to sustain that conviction was the product of an unconstitutional search of respondent Garrison's apartment."
1986.85-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,472.218,474.634,Unlike the appearances on the first and second floors.
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,474.634,475.42,--Absolutely.
1986.85-759,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,778.43,787.218,"Mr. Attorney General, looking at this diagrams you have Garrison's name here at the right, a bedroom."
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,790.57,810.651,"No, Your Honor, the entire apartment, as it turns out, and as the police, as they did their securing tour of the premises later discovered, but only after the heroin was discovered in the bedroom, the entire apartment, Your Honor, would be... the bedroom of Garrison would be what is marked ""bedroom""."
1986.85-759,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,832.814,836.349,But did you have to get into Garrison's apartment by that common stairway?
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,836.349,837.515,"--Oh, absolutely, Your Honor."
1986.85-759,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,837.515,838.015,You did?
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,838.015,838.915,"Oh, absolutely."
1986.85-759,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,847.121,850.073,Did you have to pass through the other apartment to get into Garrison's?
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,850.073,851.942,"No, Your Honor, absolutely not."
1986.85-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,861.814,864.932,"General Sachs, we will resume there at 1:00 o'clock."
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,883.144,884.83,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-759,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,938.631,944.368,"If I may, I thought there was only one door on the third floor--"
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,944.368,945.57,There was--
1986.85-759,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,945.57,946.403,--into the apartment.
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,946.403,962.746,"--There was one door, Mr. Justice, that led, only one door on the third floor that entered into what we now know to be the two apartments of McWebb and Garrison."
1986.85-759,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,984.278,985.461,Off which there are doors?
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,985.461,1003.323,"Off which there are doors, but at the moment they entered all the police saw, so the Court found, was two doorways, not even doors, two doorways, the one on the right into Garrison's bedroom, and what we know to be his apartment, and on the left into McWebb's."
1986.85-759,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1017.667,1017.967,0 xxx.
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1017.967,1024.653,"Well, there were doorways, and all that was visible to the police were doorways."
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1128.451,1139.009,"Well, what do you do with the judicial finding that the warrant covered only McWebb's apartment?"
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1139.009,1141.878,The Court of Appeals--
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1141.878,1145.163,How did the Court of Appeals know it covered only McWebb's apartment?
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1145.163,1149.382,"--The Court of Appeals, with all respect to it, from hindsight."
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1155.019,1160.606,"Maybe they thought if they could tell, maybe the officer should have told."
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1160.606,1169.361,"--What is striking about the Court of Appeals opinion, Mr. Justice White, is that it absolutely eschews any analysis of reasonableness whatsoever."
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.083,1212.122,"Well, suppose that it would have been perfectly clear to anybody that there were two apartments on the third floor."
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1212.122,1217.776,Then we should have lost this case and we would not be arguing what we are here arguing.
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.154,1246.111,"The warrant actually authorized a search of the premises of McWebb, didn't it, at 2036 Park Avenue, third floor apartment?"
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1246.111,1247.961,--That was its intention clearly.
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1247.961,1248.48,Is that what it said?
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1248.48,1252.699,"What it said literally, Mr. Justice White, is this, ""For the person of""."
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1257.169,1257.619,All right.
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1257.619,1262.99,"It reads, ""For the person of"", and then the name McWebb is there."
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.99,1263.74,Yes.
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1263.74,1266.275,"And then it says ""for the premises known as""."
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.851,1295.975,Does the warrant tell you that you are entitled to search... that the assumption is that McWebb lives on the whole third floor?
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1295.975,1307.014,"--The warrant doesn't address literally that, sir, but the warrant assumption is, the affidavit recites the information received from the gas and electric company."
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.972,1326.928,"And obviously if they had arrived at the third floor and there actually was only one apartment, you could have searched the whole apartment."
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1326.928,1335.165,"Exactly so, and had they arrived at the third floor and suddenly found two closed doors, one of which said McWebb and the other Garrison, they should not have--"
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.165,1336.2,They should have found out which one to search.
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1336.2,1336.65,--Absolutely.
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1336.65,1345.056,But they arrived and you think it is just like there was only one apartment because it was reasonable to think so.
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1345.056,1345.456,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1349.157,1351.775,So this is just no violation of the Fourth Amendment.
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1351.775,1352.575,Precisely so.
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1352.575,1354.477,You don't have to get any farther.
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1354.477,1355.394,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1355.394,1355.994,Like Hill.
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1355.994,1364.267,"Precisely like Hill, and exactly as in Hill, officers'... the recognition that Officers' mistakes can be understandable."
1986.85-759,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1383.129,1394.702,"General Sachs, you argue in the alternative, as I read your brief, that this is a reasonable search and therefore not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and B, this is a reasonable search and therefore... and you are entitled to the good faith exception."
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1399.19,1403.642,--In this... certainly not in a case that involves an alleged mistake of fact.
1986.85-759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.325,1458.145,xxx making a mistake that these facts add up to probable cause.
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1458.145,1460.345,--The legal judgment is a much tougher situation.
1986.85-759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1498.137,1502.658,"Mr. Attorney General, not that it matters to this case, do you remember what block of Park Avenue this was?"
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1502.658,1503.824,--Twenty-six thirty.
1986.85-759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1503.824,1504.691,Twenty-sixth?
1986.85-759,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1504.691,1509.409,"I am sorry, 2036 Park Avenue."
1986.85-759,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1514.297,1517.582,"Thank you, General Sachs."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1519.534,1523.236,"Mr. Chief Justice, and Honorable Justices of the Court, good afternoon."
1986.85-759,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1668.026,1671.295,"May I just interrupt for a second, Mr. Kroop?"
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1671.295,1671.628,Certainly.
1986.85-759,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.628,1686.905,"As I read the warrant, which I think, incidentally, is on Page 9, not Page 4 of the Joint Appendix, the premises, a description of the premises, the premises known as 2036 Park Avenue, third floor apartment, described as a three-story building with the numerals 2036."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1686.905,1687.671,That's correct.
1986.85-759,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1687.671,1692.206,And so they did search within the area described in the warrant.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1692.206,1699.212,"They searched within the area described in the warrant, but they also, as General Sachs pointed out, there is a place on the warrant."
1986.85-759,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1705.382,1706.866,"Yes, but it doesn't say the premises--"
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1706.866,1708.318,"No, it does not."
1986.85-759,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1709.484,1710.918,"--It doesn't identify, associate the premises with him."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1710.918,1712.12,--That's correct.
1986.85-759,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1712.12,1713.153,Okay.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1713.153,1718.924,"What they were looking for truly, we know for a fact, was McWebb's premises, not Garrison's or not anybody else's."
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1718.924,1724.494,Didn't the Maryland courts read the warrant as authorizing only the search of McWebb's apartment?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1724.494,1726.28,"Do you know what the Maryland courts, Justice White--"
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1726.28,1727.246,What about my question?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1727.246,1728.796,--I don't think so.
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1728.796,1729.462,All right.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1729.462,1729.846,Yes.
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.818,1744.77,Because the warrant authorized only the search of McWebb's apartment.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1744.77,1745.12,That's correct.
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.77,1746.47,Is that what they held?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1746.47,1752.507,"--very similarly to what I am arguing to the Court today, that because McWebb is mentioned, and the affidavit, we can't forget that."
1986.85-759,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1761.564,1765.532,"Yes, but it also describes the premises the same way the warrant does."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1774.304,1765.532,That's correct.
1986.85-759,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1839.461,1840.144,Was McWebb ever arrested?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1840.144,1842.413,"That is just what I was getting to, Justice Brennan."
1986.85-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.762,1884.437,"Mr. Kroop, what if an arrest warrant were put out for a specific individual and the police in fact arrested someone who matched the description but didn't turn out to be in fact the one arrested, and they search, and in the process discover drugs."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1884.437,1885.52,"The simple answer, I think--"
1986.85-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1885.52,1886.32,Mistake of fact.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1887.639,1888.322,--Yes.
1986.85-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1888.322,1895.726,"Why don't we apply exactly the same sort of thing with the search of the premises, a reasonable mistake?"
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1895.726,1895.993,Because the Court never has.
1986.85-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1897.409,1897.743,But shouldn't we?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1899.611,1914.269,"--Well, yes, because if you elevate the citizen on the street being arrested to the premises, which you never have, nor have you done it with a vehicle or a motor home, which Chief Justice Burger struggled to make a distinction between that mobile home and a vehicle, why struggle?"
1986.85-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1942.636,1953.009,"Well, we are talking about a warrant and whether there is room for making a reasonable mistake when all the outward circumstances would indicate there is one apartment on the third floor."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1953.009,1967.769,"--I think with the individual, without question, to answer you, yes, because this Court has seen fit that the individual does not have that same degree of protection under the Fourth Amendment nor does a car, nor does anything traveling out on the street, including that mobile home again."
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.941,1979.327,We are protecting the premises more than the Individual?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1979.327,1980.21,This Court has.
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1980.21,1982.261,You are saying--
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1982.261,1982.711,Why?
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1982.711,1983.463,--it is a good thing.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1985.346,1986.332,I happen to disagree with the Hill decision.
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1986.332,1986.815,You are saying we should do it.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1986.815,1987.865,I think you should not.
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1993.402,1994.636,"You think Hill was wrong, basically."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,1994.636,1997.538,Was it wrong?
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.258,2003.024,That is the second time you have said it.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2003.024,2006.393,--Let me go back to Hill for a minute to show you why.
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2035.979,2037.495,That is the only reason you think it is wrong?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2037.495,2037.828,No.
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.828,2038.445,That isn't what I meant.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2038.445,2039.295,"No, I don't."
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2041.613,2042.863,"You think the arrest shouldn't have been allowed, too?"
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2042.863,2044.415,--I think the Fourth Amendment says what it says.
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2053.271,2055.373,From unreasonable searches and seizures.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2055.373,2056.44,That's correct.
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2056.44,2061.943,You acknowledge that you can wrongfully issue a warrant because you think that the warrant is proper and in fact it is not proper.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2062.693,2063.926,There is a big distinction--
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2063.926,2064.812,--What is a difference?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2064.812,2065.445,"--in that, too, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2116.927,2124.35,"Mr. Kroop, let's take this step by step, and you tell me when the police went wrong."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2129.469,2130.171,"So far, so good."
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2130.171,2132.706,And when the man gave them the key.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2134.406,2136.491,"McWebb, incidentally, was named in the warrant."
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2136.491,2137.225,Is that your case?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2137.225,2137.675,Yes.
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2137.975,2140.776,"We go up to the third floor, he is still okay?"
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2140.776,2141.226,Yes.
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2141.226,2143.894,And he opens the one door with the key.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2143.894,2144.43,Yes.
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2144.43,2145.496,He is okay.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2146.346,2153.084,Went wrong the moment he walked in through that threshold of that house that this Court has always held above everything else.
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2154.619,2155.836,How would he know that was wrong?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2155.836,2156.321,Didn't know.
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2170.129,2172.748,This Court has said the blunder is not enough.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2172.748,2175.616,The blunder of the magistrate.
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2175.616,2175.983,That's right.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2175.983,2178.235,"There's a difference, because you have that neutral--"
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2178.235,2180.019,"Oh, you say the error now is the magistrate?"
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2180.019,2181.269,"--I am sorry, sir?"
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2181.269,2182.702,The error was of the magistrate?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2182.702,2183.185,"No, not in this case."
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2183.819,2185.471,"Well, I am talking about this case."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2185.471,2186.454,"In this case, the error--"
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2186.454,2187.256,Once they went in--
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2187.256,2189.206,"--even though in good faith, was the police."
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2189.206,2190.958,--If they had gone in the other door it would have bene okay?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2190.958,2198.981,"Absolutely, because McWebb by inference, by the affidavit, we can't disregard the affidavit or the fact that it mentioned McWebb."
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2206.817,2209.936,xxx man is given his key.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2209.936,2211.371,"No, that's McWebb."
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2219.108,2221.394,Did Garrison's apartment have a separate key?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2221.394,2223.512,Did Garrison ever accept the key?
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2223.512,2226.131,Did Garrison's apartment have a separate key?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2226.131,2234.737,"I believe it was clear that... not on the record, but I think it is very clear without any equivocation that they were two separate, absolutely distinct apartments."
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2234.737,2235.654,With the same door.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2235.654,2237.606,With the same common door.
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2237.606,2238.872,The same lock.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2238.872,2240.189,"Most respectfully, Your Honor--"
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.189,2242.74,"The same lock, and the same key."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2242.74,2244.259,--Let me say this to answer that.
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2244.259,2245.342,Is that correct or not?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2245.342,2245.909,Correct.
1986.85-759,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2245.909,2246.627,Thank you.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2246.627,2252.531,"Also on the first floor, all seven apartments had the same door with the same lock and the same key."
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.083,2261.554,"xxx If they were closed, and for all we know lockable."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2261.554,2262.071,That is true.
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2268.291,2269.993,"Mr. Kroop, it is no big deal in this case."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2272.327,2273.112,"Well, no."
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.112,2286.836,"--your argument would be the same had they found... had they found in walking into the wrong apartment, which they thought was the right one, they are behaving properly, and they find a murderer there, the same thing would be the case."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2287.752,2287.902,Absolutely.
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2287.902,2289.788,You don't want to reward them for their mistake.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2289.788,2290.004,That's correct.
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2290.004,2291.921,And therefore you have to turn the murderer loose.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2291.921,2292.471,That's correct.
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2293.49,2295.323,Because otherwise you would be rewarding them for their mistake.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2295.323,2298.375,"--No, because we want to look out to the future to protect the other people."
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2299.644,2300.327,You are not protecting anybody.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2305.631,2306.114,I don't agree with that.
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2308.0,2311.034,"Well, now you are arguing whether it was reasonable or not, but we are assuming it was reasonable."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2311.034,2314.736,"I am saying assuming arguendo it was, I still believe without any equivocation--"
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2314.736,2315.186,Who are you protecting then?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2316.855,2323.775,--I am protecting you when you go into your chambers so when the police walk in for a warrant for Chief Justice Rehnquist they don't bungle into yours by mistake.
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2323.775,2326.311,They are going to make the same mistake because it was reasonable.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2331.365,2333.365,Not if we set up new guidelines.
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.848,2363.467,A buzzer goes off and says I am a multiple dwelling unit.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2363.467,2363.784,"--No, no."
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.784,2365.034,They didn't know it was a multiple dwelling unit.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2365.034,2365.234,"Yes, they did."
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2365.234,2365.734,How did they know it?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2365.734,2368.319,There were seven mailboxes and seven bells outside.
1986.85-759,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2389.482,2391.767,You are arguing it was not a reasonable mistake then.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2395.703,2396.755,I am arguing... I am arguing obviously two ways.
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.783,2477.373,--What if in the process of just walking around for this security check they see contraband--
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2477.373,2478.556,Coolidge versus New Hampshire.
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.229,2489.514,--Do you think they were rightfully in Garrison's apartment?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2489.514,2491.883,--No.
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2492.966,2493.766,I thought you said they were.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2493.766,2495.885,"--No, I said if I have to retract that."
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.42,2500.137,I understand.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2500.137,2500.803,--they violate it.
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.991,2506.724,Garrison's apartment was all right?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2506.724,2508.609,"--In what regard, sir?"
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2508.609,2512.144,"Well, do you say it was all right to enter Garrison's apartment on your fallback position?"
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2512.144,2512.294,"No, I do not."
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.644,2516.579,"I know, but what about your fallback argument?"
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2516.579,2521.031,"Fallback, I say if we allow them to walk in we have to put some guidelines on them, some bridles."
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2524.768,2525.268,So if they find--
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2525.268,2526.735,In open view.
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2526.735,2533.79,"--after walking around as you say they could on your fallback argument, if they see a gun lying on the table they can't seize it?"
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2533.79,2534.64,No.
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.723,2536.873,You don't say that or not?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2536.873,2542.675,"I say they cannot seize it because it is not contraband under Article 2736(b) of our Maryland law, for instance."
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.675,2544.341,"All right, let's get something else that is contraband."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2544.341,2545.258,"Let's get something that is obvious, heroin."
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2545.258,2546.06,"Yes, all right."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2549.495,2551.495,"Well, it is marked heroin and it looks euphoric."
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2551.495,2551.728,"Yeah, it's got a sign on it."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2551.728,2553.88,"I mean, I am trying to say, yes, if they truly--"
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2553.88,2555.399,"The bag says ""Plain View Heroin""."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2555.399,2556.032,"--Right, that's it."
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.135,2566.087,All right.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2566.087,2573.408,"Now go back to a magistrate, where you have always urged the police to do, get that neutral and detached magistrate, and say, look what happened to us."
1986.85-759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2580.012,2582.428,Or unless you are a police officer.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2582.428,2582.612,We picked it up.
1986.85-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2586.416,2590.301,"Well, what is supposed to have been happening to the place while they went back to the magistrate?"
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2590.301,2590.618,They secure it.
1986.85-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2601.49,2606.144,"Okay, your position is that the warrant simply didn't cover Garrison."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2606.144,2606.844,--That's correct.
1986.85-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2606.844,2608.927,"If you are right, why can they take Garrison away?"
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2608.927,2610.679,"Well, they can detain him."
1986.85-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2610.679,2611.346,Why?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2611.346,2615.298,Because you said so in your case of Michigan versus Summers.
1986.85-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2626.819,2629.771,"Well, where was the probable... but I thought under your analysis there was no probable cause to search--"
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2629.771,2630.171,There is not.
1986.85-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2631.587,2635.455,"--Will you wait until I finish my question, please, and slow down just a little?"
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2635.455,2636.022,Excuse me.
1986.85-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2636.855,2643.676,I thought that under your analysis there was no probable cause for entering Garrison's apartment.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2643.676,2646.378,"That's correct, and I stand by that as my first proposition."
1986.85-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2661.137,2663.839,But where is the probable cause to arrest Garrison?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2663.839,2664.455,There is not.
1986.85-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2665.707,2670.326,"Well, what is the level at which they have to have to detain him?"
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2670.326,2676.063,"They have a warrant, which this Court feels, many of the members, that that should give the police the right to search."
1986.85-759,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2682.884,2687.288,It seems to me that your argument on this point is quite contrary to your argument on the rest of the case.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2687.288,2687.704,It is.
1986.85-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2727.963,2747.01,"Mr. Kroop, what if the policeman who goes to get the warrant is acting on the basis of information given him by a reliable informant who happens to be wrong, dead wrong, but the informant says you will find the marijuana in Mr. Garrison's apartment."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2755.496,2755.932,That's correct.
1986.85-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2755.932,2757.082,--but we are going to hold that that is okay?
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2757.082,2758.717,I do not hold that okay.
1986.85-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2764.002,2767.054,They get the Warrant for the Garrison apartment--
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2767.054,2767.573,"Yes, because--"
1986.85-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2767.573,2771.442,--but it has been on a mistake made by the police and their informant.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2771.442,2776.429,"--Well, you have already touched on that, I believe, in the case of Franks versus Delaware."
1986.85-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2776.429,2778.096,"Yes, we have said that is all right."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2778.096,2778.462,That's okay.
1986.85-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2779.964,2786.035,"So that is a case of a reasonable mistake that is comparable to what is being urged here, is it not?"
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2786.035,2786.701,I don't think it is.
1986.85-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2799.792,2806.445,I thought you were taking the position that we had never permitted a mistake of fact on the part of the police or their informants--
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2806.445,2807.297,"--Oh, you did, you have."
1986.85-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2807.297,2810.916,--to reach into the premises.
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2810.916,2811.683,That's correct.
1986.85-759,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2813.201,2814.851,"Well, Franks versus Delaware."
1986.85-759,1,25561,gerald_a_kroop,,2814.851,2826.676,"No, Franks versus Delaware did not... Franks versus Delaware allowed you to go beyond the four corners of the warrant to show that the police willfully and wantonly presented facts into the warrant."
1986.85-759,2,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,2978.785,2981.387,"Just briefly, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-759,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3081.252,3087.673,"General Sachs, with respect to your first argument, not the good faith one, is your argument, do you think, entirely consistent with Massachusetts against Shepherd?"
1986.85-759,2,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,3092.31,3098.048,"--Well, I read Massachusetts against Shepherd, Mr. Justice Stevens, as a defect of law."
1986.85-759,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3101.933,3105.702,"But for the same sort of reason that you have here, there was a kind of a mechanical error."
1986.85-759,2,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,3105.702,3110.272,"Well, it falls in a sort of sui generis category that some could call a technical error."
1986.85-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3129.267,3129.852,"General, could I--"
1986.85-759,2,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,3129.852,3130.852,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-759,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3130.852,3160.204,"--Suppose it was perfectly clear there were two apartments on the third floor and everybody knew it at the time the warrant was issued, but all you knew was that drugs were being sold out of the third floor, and everybody concedes there was probable cause to believe that drugs were being sold out of the third floor, but they didn't know which apartment, and the warrant then authorized the search of both apartments."
1986.85-759,2,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,3160.204,3175.298,"It doesn't sound to me in your hypothetical, Mr. Justice, that you have described sufficient probable cause to enter two different... two persons' places just because one of them... this is the lady and the tiger... just because one of them is likely to be dealing drugs."
1986.85-759,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3239.074,3241.457,"Thank you, General Sachs."
