2010.09-152,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.272,"We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 09-152, Bruesewitz v. Wyeth."
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,12.058,14.658,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-152,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,147.808,148.391,"What is -- I'm sorry, Mr. Frederick."
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,160.282,175.875,"--My point is that when one looks at the specific language of 22(b)(1) against the backdrop of these other provisions, it's clear what Congress was intending was to enact a national defense, but not to displace State law completely."
2010.09-152,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,186.766,195.539,"I would have thought the argument would go the other way: That because they set up a compensation scheme, that was a good sign that they didn't want to allow State law claims."
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,195.539,207.847,"And if one looks, Mr. Chief Justice, at sections 21, 22, and 23 of the Act, what 21 provides is that the Claimant can elect not to accept the vaccine court judgment."
2010.09-152,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,228.84,240.964,Section 22(b)(1) refers to side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,268.863,277.451,"What Congress was intending to do, Justice Alito, was, with the word ""unavoidable"", to use a word that had a settled meaning in the common law."
2010.09-152,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,307.319,316.342,"But isn't it true that at the time, there was a distinct minority view that you could not recover for design defects for vaccines?"
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,316.342,318.208,There certainly was a debate.
2010.09-152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.941,374.845,But you haven't really answered Justice Alito's question as to why the later language is not surplus.
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,381.833,408.983,"--It is not surplus if one reads comment k and understands what the drafters there were intending to get at, which was: If, based on current scientific knowledge, the risks are unavoidably unsafe, meaning there is no way in science we can design a safer product, there will be a defense to a claim of strict liability unless or provided that the product is properly manufactured and warned against."
2010.09-152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.307,472.823,Say that again.
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,475.259,482.329,"--Under their -- Justice Scalia, looking at (b)(1) on page 19A following the date October 1, 1988."
2010.09-152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,482.329,482.946,Right.
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,482.946,487.4,"Under their view, after the word ""if"", the phrase"
2010.09-152,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,520.235,531.81,I take it that the government is urging that FDA approval.
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,531.81,536.512,"--Justice Ginsburg, that position is incorrect."
2010.09-152,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,555.608,559.81,So you are asking us to interpret this statute in light of his testimony at a hearing?
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,559.81,568.333,"What I'm saying is that Congress had choices, and one of the choices was to adopt a regulatory compliance defense for design defect claims, and it chose not to do that."
2010.09-152,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,568.333,576.772,"It seems to me the language supports the reading Justice Ginsburg has just suggested, or the government has just suggested, with the use of the word ""the""."
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,591.209,591.459,Right.
2010.09-152,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,595.775,597.127,"I don't see the word ""if""."
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,597.127,599.41,"--It's right after the date, 1988."
2010.09-152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.151,616.786,"Mr. Frederick, I have this problem with -- with your interpretation."
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,648.657,652.293,"Justice Scalia, let me try to clear this up in this way."
2010.09-152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,665.501,674.622,"I understand that, but the plaintiff comes in and says, Look, you could have eliminated this, this, and this, and these side effects would not occur."
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,681.526,689.346,--And that's why the concept of unavoidability as a defense always rested on the current State of scientific knowledge.
2010.09-152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.132,693.215,"Well, that doesn't answer my question."
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,721.549,738.642,"--Justice Scalia, the way these cases were construed, and we have cited them in our reply brief, the standard was whether or not it was as safe as a feasible alternative but was -- sorry, as efficacious but safer as a feasible alternative."
2010.09-152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,740.861,742.545,It has to be just as effective?
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,742.545,744.545,--It has to be efficacious.
2010.09-152,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,744.545,746.061,Just as effective?
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,746.061,746.278,Sure.
2010.09-152,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,756.519,757.269,You keep saying that.
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,764.023,765.206,--No.
2010.09-152,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,788.284,789.72,--Was it proven that it was as effective?
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,789.72,793.338,"Yes, it was, and it had 65 % of the market."
2010.09-152,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,793.338,801.777,And could it be used for all five -- there are five inoculations in this series.
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,801.777,802.527,That's correct.
2010.09-152,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,802.527,805.395,And only one of them was not approved for the first three.
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,805.395,808.697,That's the second one for Justice Sotomayor.
2010.09-152,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,843.468,853.559,"If there is a safer alternative, it must be pursued regardless of cost?"
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,853.559,856.344,"--No, there is a reasonableness standard."
2010.09-152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,868.668,884.328,"In a question of fact in a case-by-case determination in every State, the manufacturers would probably be worse off under your approach than if they didn't have the law at all, because the law seems to at least qualify section -- comment k."
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,884.328,904.14,"--Justice Kennedy, that was the whole design of the vaccine program, because if you channelled most claims into something that the manufacturers didn't have to defend against or pay the judgments of, the thought was that the vast, vast majority of people would never go to State court."
2010.09-152,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,920.233,921.483,Why was it taken off?
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,921.483,923.935,There was a debate in the scientific community.
2010.09-152,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,942.146,951.768,And so didn't the special master find what -- in the compensation proceeding that causation had not been proved?
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,951.768,952.152,Yes.
2010.09-152,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,959.358,969.713,"Well, you -- you say that in court you could prove causation, because you had discovery, although you couldn't prove it before the special master because discovery was very limited?"
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,969.713,970.629,That's our submission.
2010.09-152,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,980.751,985.639,"And can you -- maybe this is a good point, but I would like to know what your response is."
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1049.515,1053.632,"If I may, let me make two points, Justice Breyer, the legal point and the policy point."
2010.09-152,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1071.591,1076.626,"Well, there is another case on that where we are going to have to go into -- which is, does that mean every bit of it has to be clear?"
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1081.778,1087.998,"--Here, 22(a) answers that question as a matter of law, because it says the State law provides the general rule."
2010.09-152,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1087.998,1088.517,Right.
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1089.2,1090.167,"Now, that's the legal point."
2010.09-152,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1121.85,1122.2,Explain why.
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1122.2,1131.639,"--Because proving causation and proving the availability, based on science, of an alternative design is not something that is a relatively easy thing to do."
2010.09-152,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1131.639,1134.424,--But that's -- that's why I asked the question.
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1154.535,1156.718,"It happened in the moment to come to mind, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-152,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1212.871,1216.84,"It would depend, I suppose, on what they thought the judgments were going to be in the 1 percent of the time."
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1216.84,1217.44,--And--
2010.09-152,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1217.44,1222.208,It doesn't take too many $60 million verdicts to make you come out on the other side of your calculus.
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1222.208,1235.766,"--And that's why, going back to the wording of the statute, Mr. Chief Justice, in section 23, where Congress said for someone who had elected not to accept the judgment in 21, you get to go to State court and try to prove your claim."
2010.09-152,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1235.766,1247.839,"Anyone could go to the State -- I mean, somebody who won in the vaccine court could go to court on the argument that the amount was insufficient, the amount of compensation."
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1252.31,1252.976,That's correct.
2010.09-152,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1262.166,1275.307,What would happen if a drug manufacturer sought FDA approval of an alternative vaccine and the injury occurred during the period while that was under consideration by the FDA?
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1276.674,1281.044,"--A harder case, but not one that couldn't be proved under State law."
2010.09-152,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1312.829,1325.969,"In the -- when it was -- when Tri-Solgen was owned by Lilly and you said that it was approved and marketed, was that one available for all five inoculations?"
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1325.969,1326.219,--Yes.
2010.09-152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1366.277,1375.466,"Does the secretary -- does the secretary have the authority to -- to withdraw certification on the ground that it is no longer safe, fair, and potent?"
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1375.466,1377.549,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2010.09-152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1378.085,1381.203,You are assuming that the manufacturer knows something that the secretary doesn't?
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1381.203,1382.387,--No.
2010.09-152,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1411.639,1412.422,If the language--
2010.09-152,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1412.422,1421.845,Is there any provision in the regulations that require a manufacturer to withdraw a drug earlier than when the FDA tells them to?
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1421.845,1422.864,Not that I'm aware of.
2010.09-152,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1422.864,1429.684,"So this immunity would come along until they go to the FDA and say, Well, we've gotten enough incidents to prove--"
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1429.684,1431.418,That's correct.
2010.09-152,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1446.479,1458.287,"--But I'm not sure that in most cases you are going to be able to tell immediately -- you are marketing one vaccine and something else is being tested or about to be approved, or it's on the market -- that that's safer."
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1486.767,1489.736,"And the manufacturers win that case, probably, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1489.736,1500.194,But -- but you assume that there is no clause or burden to the manufacturers who defend these suits to assess settlement offers.
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1502.979,1505.496,Only if you accept the--
2010.09-152,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1505.496,1509.632,It -- it may well be that the manufacturer has to settle a meritorious case; we all know that.
2010.09-152,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1509.632,1510.149,--Yes.
2010.09-152,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1538.53,1539.613,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
2010.09-152,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1543.601,1546.117,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-152,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1558.776,1561.395,So why didn't they make the vaccine court exclusive?
2010.09-152,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1575.486,1589.813,"--Because, Justice Sotomayor, the kind of lawsuits that caused Congress concern were the very kind of lawsuits that are expressly preempted by 22(b)(1), and that is design defect claims, which have the exact problem that was just being discussed."
2010.09-152,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1609.29,1611.207,"So, how -- couldn't they have taken care of that with Daubert?"
2010.09-152,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1617.378,1619.378,"--Not design defect claims, Your Honor."
2010.09-152,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1642.54,1662.888,"Point me to the FDA regulations or law where the FDA, in giving a license to or permitting a new vaccine, actually looks at whether that vaccine is the most efficacious way with the least serious harm to the population."
2010.09-152,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1669.125,1670.808,"--There is not, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-152,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1679.397,1679.764,All right.
2010.09-152,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1709.097,1710.466,--The Act itself.
2010.09-152,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1725.707,1743.268,"Ms. Sullivan -- Ms. Sullivan, if Congress had wanted to do that, they could have said simply that no vaccine manufacturer may be held civilly liable if the vaccine is properly prepared and accompanied by proper directions and adequate warnings."
2010.09-152,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1788.761,1793.914,"--Justice Ginsburg, let's go back to the text and put -- read the two clauses together."
2010.09-152,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1845.013,1856.138,"Under your view, when does the manufacturer have to come forward and acknowledge that there is a defect in the design?"
2010.09-152,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,1856.138,1863.576,"Well, Justice Kennedy, the manufacturer is subject to ongoing reporting requirements under section 28 of the statute."
2010.09-152,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1871.646,1873.515,Could you please just answer that question?
2010.09-152,3,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1904.467,1905.236,"--Well, Justice--"
2010.09-152,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1905.236,1907.303,What is the inducement for them to do it voluntarily?
2010.09-152,3,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1907.303,1907.536,--Yes.
2010.09-152,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1913.073,1915.423,I am not asking about the FDA.
2010.09-152,3,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1915.423,1916.025,But the reason why--
2010.09-152,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1916.025,1917.791,I said the manufacturers' motivations.
2010.09-152,3,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1917.791,1928.663,"--And -- and, Justice Sotomayor, the reason why the FDA has never had to use that nuclear option is that it -- it works closely with manufacturers long before it needs to be used, and that's because of the rest of the structure of the Act."
2010.09-152,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1933.448,1943.839,"Before you get to that, I think your answer to Justice Sotomayor's question is: Nothing; the manufacturers have no reason to take the vaccine off the market until the FDA tells them to."
2010.09-152,3,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1943.839,1945.106,"--That's not correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-152,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1964.901,1978.343,"But if the manufacturer is slow or remiss or negligent or willful in not giving the information to the Government, there is nothing the injured person can do."
2010.09-152,3,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1980.676,1984.247,"--Of design defect claims, Justice Kennedy, but not of warning claims."
2010.09-152,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1992.75,1996.488,Does the victim of that withholding have a private cause of action?
2010.09-152,3,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1999.054,2000.773,--There is not a freestanding cause of action.
2010.09-152,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2015.032,2015.299,The warning--
2010.09-152,3,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2015.299,2016.032,And if you look at--

2010.09-152,4,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,2846.116,2846.866,Well--
2010.09-152,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2846.866,2850.135,--and it was now -- there is a safer alternative?

2010.09-152,4,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3041.267,3044.136,CDC does not issue a license.
2010.09-152,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3044.136,3044.719,No--
2010.09-152,4,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3044.719,3061.229,"But the way the statute works is that the statute only covers, in its present form, the way -- I'm referring now to the present version of the provision in the statute that explains how vaccines become subject to the Act, because not all vaccines are."
2010.09-152,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3089.581,3091.031,--Where do I look at that?
2010.09-152,4,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3110.328,3110.778,Yes.
2010.09-152,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3110.778,3111.778,We know the FDA is not.
2010.09-152,4,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3116.898,3128.306,"CDC makes that judgment and announces it in a reasoned, published announcement in its official journal which is the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report."

2010.09-152,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3176.271,3184.56,So it doesn't make a determination that the one that they are listing in their morbidity report is better than one that's out there?

2010.09-152,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3362.849,3368.119,The committees have manufacturers and Government scientists and university professors and others?
2010.09-152,4,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,3368.119,3373.857,My understanding is actually the manufacturers are -- are -- are relatively less represented on these -- on these committees.

2010.09-152,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3550.377,3559.433,"--that would permit a lay jury relying on experts produced in court, the CDC got this wrong, the Salk vaccine was really the better one."
2010.09-152,5,20869,david_c_frederick,,3559.433,3564.153,"Yes, yes, that would be a viable design defect claim."
2010.09-152,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3644.938,3648.057,Their argument is that the CDC will do it better than juries.
2010.09-152,5,20869,david_c_frederick,,3650.109,3670.756,"And, Justice Breyer, there are now six DTaP vaccines on the market that CDC doesn't distinguish between them, but if it comes to pass that the science would indicate that one of them was woefully not as safe, and here, their argument is that the vaccine industry is going to go out of business."
2010.09-152,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3675.791,3685.265,I thought Mr. Horwich told me that the CDC does compare new vaccines to the ones that are out in the market?
2010.09-152,5,20869,david_c_frederick,,3685.265,3686.282,He cited no law.
2010.09-152,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3686.282,3689.134,You think he was incorrect in that assertion.

2010.09-152,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3703.81,3706.862,I'm just trying to find out what your position is on that.
2010.09-152,5,20869,david_c_frederick,,3709.195,3714.366,We found no law that gives the CDC the authority--
2010.09-152,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3714.366,3716.366,"I'm not asking about law, I'm asking matter of fact."
2010.09-152,5,20869,david_c_frederick,,3716.366,3718.199,"--Whether, I'm not."
2010.09-152,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3718.199,3718.432,You open up the weekly report.

2010.09-152,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3758.24,3759.173,"Thank you, counsel."
