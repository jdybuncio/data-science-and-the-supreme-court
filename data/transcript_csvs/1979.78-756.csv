1979.78-756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.374,"We will hear arguments next in 78-756, Ohio against Roberts."
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,42.723,47.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,105.099,107.993,Who called the witness that's in question here?
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,107.993,108.288,All right.
1979.78-756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.238,154.989,"But he couldn't have objected, the other side couldn't have objected, could he have? Hadn't Ohio abolished the voucher rule?"
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,154.989,157.826,"Technically, we have abolished the voucher rule."
1979.78-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,186.622,192.485,"Well, you say there were some questions he wanted to but didn't ask, because of any rule of Ohio law?"
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,192.485,192.673,No.
1979.78-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,197.171,198.229,"Well, I know, but he didn't."
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,203.143,204.111,"Of his own free will, yes."
1979.78-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,204.111,209.25,But short of asking some questions that he wishes now he had asked?
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,209.25,211.274,That's totally within the mind of the attorney.
1979.78-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,214.91,217.821,"As far as the record shows, he was free to ask any question he wanted to?"
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,217.821,219.019,And I believe he did.
1979.78-756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,320.318,330.968,"Well, are you challenging here, Mr. Shoop, the finding -- the Supreme Court of Ohio is generally for you in result."
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,338.995,339.972,Not at all.
1979.78-756,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,372.21,377.054,"On that issue, the Supreme Court of Ohio was unanimous, was it not?"
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,377.054,381.373,"It appears that -- yes, even though we had a four to three decision in the Supreme Court of Ohio --"
1979.78-756,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,381.373,384.776,They all agree he was unavailable?
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,384.776,392.103,"Yes, both the majority and the minority agreed that the witness was unavailable."
1979.78-756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,392.103,398.696,"Unavailable in the sense, ultimately, that she wasn't there, or unavailable in the traditional sense?"
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,401.278,411.694,"I read that as unavailable in the sense that there was no way the State could produce this witness at the trial, in order to present her testimony."
1979.78-756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,430.541,451.023,"Under Ohio law -- going back now to the preliminary hearing -- under Ohio law is it required that the person have been subjected to cross-examination, or simply that the witness was available for cross-examination by the adverse party?"
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,451.023,476.525,"That's the very essence, I believe, of our argument here before the Court, that the opportunity for cross-examination, in the proper circumstances, satisfies the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment, whether or not actual cross-examination transpires."
1979.78-756,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,476.525,480.103,"Mr. Shoop, may I ask a question on availability."
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,502.358,517.462,"I read the Supreme Court's argument, or decision, as that both unavailabilities are satisfied in this case, both for the purposes of any Federal implications, and for the purposes of the State statute."
1979.78-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,517.462,521.419,Do you agree there is a Federal constitutional requirement on availability?
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,521.419,522.296,"Yes, I do."
1979.78-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,526.936,532.279,"You, in effect -- you read the Ohio court as, in effect, having decided two questions on availability."
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,543.544,545.035,"Yes, I do."
1979.78-756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,545.035,567.038,"You really could hardly argue otherwise, could you, in light of page 19 of the petition, the blue volume, where it says, chief justice -- the late Chief Justice O'Neill as saying, at the beginning of the paragraph, ""In the instant cause the appellee argues that the state failed to show a good-faith effort to produce the witness in person, as required by the rule in Barber."
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,571.23,572.35,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,572.35,578.187,"That's right, but if you read the last sentence of the paragraph, the reference is just to state law that's how he answered the question."
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,582.373,583.501,"I'm assuming that they are, Your Honor."
1979.78-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,583.501,584.517,They are the same?
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,589.769,596.792,"And in this case, that's what I believe was decided."
1979.78-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.865,677.473,Now let me get that straight.
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,681.888,684.706,That is the holding of the Ohio Supreme Court.
1979.78-756,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.706,690.196,Did the Ohio Supreme Court actually hold that you had made a good-faith effort?
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,690.196,691.51,They found that --
1979.78-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,691.51,697.278,Or did they say that due diligence would not have procured the witness?
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,699.429,701.922,I don't think that they are that different significantly different.
1979.78-756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,711.847,719.484,"Well, it seems to me the Ohio courts put some gloss on the good-faith standard."
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,719.484,721.418,"I believe it's a matter of semantics, Your Honor."
1979.78-756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,727.495,736.377,Are you relying on the ancient maxim that people aren't required to do what is fruitless and pointless?
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,736.377,738.488,"That is one, Your Honor, yes."
1979.78-756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,749.659,758.683,"But Chief Justice O'Neill's opinion states, ""Therefore the trial judge could properly hold that the witness was unavailable to testify in person."""
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,781.89,783.389,That's correct. Your Honor.
1979.78-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,822.026,830.599,What did the prosecution do other than to serve these subpoenas at the residence of the parents?
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,830.599,832.73,In the --
1979.78-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,832.73,839.289,What did you do when the requested telephone calls did not come in?
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,839.289,843.923,At that time we were in contact with Mrs. Isaacs.
1979.78-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,893.368,899.338,"Mr. Shoop, is your answer to Justice Blackmun, that because of the prior history, you did nothing more?"
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,899.338,900.472,There was nothing more for us to do.
1979.78-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.472,904.424,You did nothing more than he described in his question?
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,904.424,906.137,That is correct.
1979.78-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.137,912.542,"Your answer to both my questions is ""Nothing""?"
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,912.542,918.06,I -- I apparently have forgotten the other question.
1979.78-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,918.06,923.929,"I asked, generally, what you did other than serve the subpoenas at the residence of the missing witness' parents."
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,923.929,925.695,We did talk with the parents.
1979.78-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.695,933.145,"And I take it the answer to that is nothing, and I asked you positively what else you did."
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,938.011,938.534,"Yes, and they did not know where she was."
1979.78-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.534,942.668,"But you also knew she had been in San Francisco, some other places, didn't you?"
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,942.668,945.955,"Yes, we knew there had been a contact in San Francisco."
1979.78-756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,960.232,973.838,"Are you referring to page 11 of the transcript, where the question is Oh, you talked to your daughter, and is that the last time you talked to her and the answer is, no, she called again later in the summer."
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,976.438,977.637,"Correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-756,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1002.128,1009.151,"Well, suppose there hadn't been this opportunity to cross-examine at the preliminary hearing."
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1026.796,1028.577,"Oh, it's -- yes, Your Honor, it is."
1979.78-756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1272.105,1285.634,"Well, frequently, counsel, at a preliminary hearing, your defense lawyer's best tactic is to keep his mouth shut, because all the prosecution has to produce is a probable cause to bind over."
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1290.331,1290.948,That is correct.
1979.78-756,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1290.948,1292.819,And that is this particular witness.
1979.78-756,0,32909,john_e_shoop,,1292.819,1299.635,And that is this particular witness that we are now confronting this Court with.
1979.78-756,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1664.161,1665.019,Very well.
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,1682.663,1687.459,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1806.592,1818.18,"That's pretty much of a tactical judgment, isn't it, on the part of a defense lawyer at a preliminary hearing, whether you call any witness or not, and if you call anyone, how much you ask him?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,1818.18,1821.014,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is correct."
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.391,1839.949,"Well, you say it's not cross-examination, but when he saw she was beginning to crawfish on him, so to speak, he began asking her adverse questions."
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,1839.949,1845.756,"Well, he asked her adverse questions right from the start -- I shouldn't say adverse he asked her leading questions right from the start."
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1845.756,1853.959,"Yes, and when the leads weren't followed, he began asking really genuinely hostile questions, the way you would on cross-examination?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,1853.959,1855.42,I would respectfully disagree.
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1864.738,1866.834,"Well, I don't mean an extended thing."
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,1878.788,1881.787,I can assume not that's correct.
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2009.792,2019.275,But you didn't -- you had a clear holding from the Ohio Court of Appeals that the showing of unavailability was insufficient.
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2023.812,2025.343,"No, sir, I did not."
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2037.18,2042.609,So you didn't even argue to the Ohio Court of Appeals on the unavailability question?
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2042.609,2045.673,"Yes, I did, sir."
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.673,2049.056,But you don't -- you didn't petition for certiorari here?
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2049.056,2051.344,"That's correct, I did not."
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.344,2054.786,"Well, aren't you just defending the judgment?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2054.786,2059.79,"Yes, but I would -- if I had it to do over again, I certainly would raise the issue."
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.79,2063.371,"Certainly the Ohio courts all the way along have considered the issue, have they not?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2063.371,2064.223,Yes.
1979.78-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2081.15,2106.497,"What do you have to say about the Ohio Supreme Court's statement in the opinion from the facts which you have recited and which the judge digested, that the trial judge could reasonably infer that Anita had left San Francisco, and that it would have been fruitless for the prosecutor to contact the San Francisco social worker in order to locate her?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2112.451,2118.657,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I disagree with the late Chief Justice O'Neill in that holding."
1979.78-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2118.657,2120.499,"Yes, I know you disagree with it."
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2123.5,2134.492,"The Court of Appeals -- the Court of Appeals said there were about five different areas in which this could have -- in which they could have -- in which they could have done more investigation, or done things in and they did nothing, the prosecutors' office."
1979.78-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2144.973,2160.215,"Here's -- this holding of the Ohio Supreme Court tells us, does it not, the statute is constitutional, in one sense, does it not?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2160.215,2168.353,"Well, the area -- the issue was not addressed in my brief in the Ohio Supreme Court it was only addressed in the Court of Appeals."
1979.78-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2178.562,2199.238,"Well then are we not confronted with a statute held constitutional by the highest court of the state which had authority to pass on it, and a further factual determination that it would have been fruitless for them to do any of the things which you now complain they did not do?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2199.238,2206.488,"We are here before the Court with a statute which must be presumed to be constitutional, yes, although I personally have other feelings."
1979.78-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2254.98,2261.197,"Well, perhaps to anticipate the argument that you're now making that they didn't do anything."
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2261.197,2267.337,"Well, the subpoenas indicate, according to the record, that they were served upon her."
1979.78-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2283.511,2286.339,"Do they still have the ""syllabus rule"" in Ohio?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2286.339,2288.155,"I'm sorry, sir, syllabus rule?"
1979.78-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2288.155,2289.127,Yes.
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2289.127,2290.492,I don't know.
1979.78-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2290.492,2302.288,"If they do, then the opinion of Chief Justice O'Neill is just a little essay, and the law of the case is in this one paragraph syllabus."
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2302.288,2303.815,"Oh, yes, yes, we would --"
1979.78-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2303.815,2304.403,You still have that rule?
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2304.403,2310.027,"Yes, I do believe we have it, now that I think about it."
1979.78-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2451.055,2454.641,Does this record show how long this preliminary hearing --
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2454.641,2460.687,"Well, I don't really know, timewise, but I would gather it was less than an hour."
1979.78-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2460.687,2462.44,"Well, that's more than a few minutes, isn't it?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2462.44,2465.378,I'm talking about all the witnesses.
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2488.419,2489.68,Mr. Plasco?
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2489.68,2490.458,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2490.458,2507.54,"On page 28 of your brief, you have a quotation from Green v. California, an opinion offered for the Court by Mr. Justice White, where you set forth four elements."
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2539.654,2540.213,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2540.213,2541.794,Okay.
1979.78-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2541.794,2552.523,"Well, on -- if we're talking about pages 24 and 25 of your belief, you say it's from Justice Brennan's dissenting opinion in Green."
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2552.523,2555.764,I was talking about page 28 of the brief.
1979.78-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2555.764,2557.9,"Oh, I beg your pardon."
1979.78-756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2558.948,2560.144,Mr. Plasco?
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2560.144,2561.01,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2561.01,2571.159,"I take it that you feel Green was inapplicable here for one reason only, and that is that there was not the same counsel at the two --"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2571.159,2572.713,They certainly were not the same counsel.
1979.78-756,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2586.809,2593.62,"Yes, but your quotation on page 18 doesn't emphasize that at all -- or page 28, it is."
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2593.62,2596.864,28?
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2596.864,2599.36,It goes off on the opportunity aspect.
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2599.36,2600.079,Yes.
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.244,2605.227,Who was the defense counsel at the preliminary hearing?
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2605.227,2606.946,His name was Richard Swain.
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2606.946,2608.446,Was he from your office?
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2608.446,2609.907,"No, no."
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.09,2614.208,Was he retained?
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2614.208,2615.379,He was appointed.
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2615.379,2616.053,Appointed?
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2616.053,2616.997,Yes.
1979.78-756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2642.391,2650.283,"If the first counsel had been someone else in your office, would Green fit this case like a glove?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2650.283,2656.888,"Not like a glove, sir, because again the indicia of reliability, there was extensive cross-examination of the witness."
1979.78-756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2664.386,2672.624,"But if your quotation on page 28 is a correct one, there is no reliance there that I see on the extensiveness of the cross-examination."
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2672.624,2674.159,"In that part of it, yes, sir, that's correct."
1979.78-756,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2697.108,2711.825,"You don't think that the court was merely emphasizing, stressing, everything that was present to support its conclusion, and that it would reach the same conclusion whether or not number two were there?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2712.513,2715.202,"No, I don't."
1979.78-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2962.085,2967.041,How often is a preliminary hearing waived by the -- in your county?
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2967.041,2968.857,"In my office, never."
1979.78-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2978.185,2979.244,Yes.
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,2983.096,2986.825,A lot of times it'll be done for information.
1979.78-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2991.557,2999.043,"Suppose you don't waive, and you go, and the government puts on some--the state puts on some witnesses to show probable cause."
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3001.055,3001.973,"Yes, sir, I do."
1979.78-756,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3001.973,3003.337,Always?
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3003.337,3007.543,I've never waived cross-examination at a preliminary hearing.
1979.78-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3007.543,3010.267,"You don't, habitually, though, call witnesses of your own, do you?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3010.267,3010.664,No.
1979.78-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3014.186,3015.636,-- that's a probable cause hearing.
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3015.636,3016.5,Right.
1979.78-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3018.338,3023.074,"It's almost an ex parte -- well, it's a one-sided proposition, isn't it?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3023.074,3024.618,"Yes, yes."
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3026.671,3030.776,Did you ever succeed in preventing a binding over because you cross-examined someone?
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3030.776,3031.801,"I'm sorry, sir."
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3031.801,3036.82,"I say, have you ever succeeded in avoiding a binding over by cross-examination at a preliminary hearing?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3036.82,3036.982,Yes.
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.982,3037.709,You have?
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3037.709,3039.557,"Yes, I've been lucky a couple of times."
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3039.557,3041.145,You certainly have been lucky.
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3041.145,3042.844,It's not the usual rule.
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3042.844,3043.866,It surely isn't.
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3043.866,3045.034,Usually it's --
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3045.034,3053.322,"In my state, as long as the witness testifies something that adds up to probable cause, the magistrate doesn't even weigh credibility."
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3053.322,3060.662,I had one as an assistant prosecutor many years ago where they pointed out somebody in the back of the room and not the defendant at the trial table.
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.966,3077.185,"Well, why don't you waive?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3080.306,3081.159,I learn what I can learn.
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3135.945,3140.245,Why would it require you to bring in your own witnesses?
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3140.245,3142.54,"Well, I might not bring in my own witnesses."
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3142.54,3144.06,I would think not.
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3144.06,3145.493,"Because then there testimony -- well, it depends."
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3160.955,3166.209,"Well, you're talking about a very, very rare type of case where it's not your witness that you're calling --"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3166.209,3166.697,"No, I would never --"
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3166.697,3170.35,-- but a state's witness that the state is not calling.
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3170.35,3170.985,"Correct, Mr. Justice --"
1979.78-756,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3170.985,3174.179,"Why would that be so wrong, anyway, as a matter of tactics?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3174.179,3184.66,"Because you're putting your own witness under oath at a prior recorded testimony, and they cannot change -- not that we would have them change their testimony don't get me wrong."
1979.78-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3288.847,3302.845,"Under your Ohio syllabus rule that Mr. Justice Stewart, I think, referred to, what are we to do with respect to the opinion written by the -- on behalf of the court?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3305.396,3313.664,"Well, I believe this Court has the authority to review the matters and make its own determination."
1979.78-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3314.591,3324.677,"What's the status of the statement in the opinion that it would have been a waste of time for the state to try to pursue this witness, to find this witness?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3324.677,3328.101,"Well, the court below them said otherwise."
1979.78-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3328.405,3333.355,"Well, the last word we have is from the Supreme Court of Ohio."
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3337.103,3337.541,"I don't know, sir, I --"
1979.78-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3337.541,3340.653,"Or is it just a law review article, like a law review article?"
1979.78-756,1,36495,marvin_r_plasco,,3340.653,3343.395,"Well, I would give it more weight than a law review article."
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3418.803,3420.548,Just very briefly.
1979.78-756,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3430.676,3432.534,"That's exactly what I was going to ask you, too."
1979.78-756,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3432.534,3436.743,I would be happy to.
1979.78-756,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3470.287,3473.595,"Thank you, gentlemen -- I guess you have a couple of minutes, don't you?"
1979.78-756,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3476.46,3478.727,"Thank you, Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-756,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3491.91,3497.106,What do you take it that the opinion of Chief Justice O'Neill is?
1979.78-756,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3499.295,3500.839,The headnote is --
1979.78-756,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3500.839,3502.052,"The headnote, the syllabus."
1979.78-756,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3502.052,3502.408,Correct.
1979.78-756,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3502.408,3503.233,The one paragraph?
1979.78-756,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3503.233,3503.954,That's it.
1979.78-756,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3503.954,3505.841,That's it.
1979.78-756,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3511.026,3515.409,"The forgery in this case, it might be critical to listen to the facts of the forgery."
1979.78-756,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3581.767,3584.524,Could you have used this testimony in your case in chief?
1979.78-756,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3584.524,3585.536,Which testimony?
1979.78-756,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3586.936,3590.675,"No, no, about the prior -- did you use this in your case in chief?"
1979.78-756,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3592.527,3595.514,"No, we didn't bring this testimony in."
1979.78-756,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3595.514,3596.415,"No, the --"
1979.78-756,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3596.415,3597.57,The unavailable witness?
1979.78-756,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3600.093,3601.072,"Well, could you have?"
1979.78-756,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3604.106,3605.61,We probably could have.
1979.78-756,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3613.718,3615.457,It may not have been relevant at all?
1979.78-756,2,32909,john_e_shoop,,3615.457,3619.047,It may not have been relevant.
1979.78-756,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3664.826,3665.478,"Thank you, gentlemen."
