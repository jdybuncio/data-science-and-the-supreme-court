1969.632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.104,"Number 632, Alexander and others against Holmes County Board of Education and others."
1969.632,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,17.993,21.271,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,54.574,73.965,"Mr. Greenberg, I overlooked advising you and your co-counsel and friends that Mr. Justice Brennan is unavoidably detained but he will participate in the case on the basis of course the entire record, the briefs and the tape recording of the oral arguments."
1969.632,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,76.856,79.089,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1969.632,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,342.815,347.464,"Mr. Greenberg, your -- the statements you just made about cross the ties."
1969.632,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,347.464,349.562,"Yes, pardon me, that's in the opinion of the --"
1969.632,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,349.562,351.089,"Well, I missed what you said, could you repeat it."
1969.632,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,351.089,368.856,"Well, the reason why they said freedom of choice might work in -- freedom of choice had failed to work was because the Court of Appeals, Jefferson orders said that school districts could not go out in to the community and urge children to attend certain schools."
1969.632,1,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2648.294,2652.915,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,3332.028,3337.023,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.632,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3527.154,3531.231,The 40% accurate or not is 40% of what?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,3531.231,3534.804,Of the total number of Negro children involved.
1969.632,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3534.804,3535.77,Who are in what?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,3536.99,3541.873,Who are in these school districts in these southern states.
1969.632,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3671.422,3675.827,"And by that, do you mean as to those 400, that there are, there's no pending litigation?"
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,3675.827,3677.581,There's nothing going on here.
1969.632,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3690.783,3700.535,"Do you have any figures for say the north of the -- north land, New England midwest?"
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,3700.535,3717.934,"Mr. Justice Douglas, I'm frank to say that where our figures for the north are very scarce but I want to point out to the Court that the department has commenced the jury type litigation against northern school districts where it has been found."
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3907.46,3908.466,Terribly what?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,3908.466,3910.962,Complicated Your Honor.
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3910.962,3914.424,Do you have the brief of the American Educational Association?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,3914.424,3917.314,I have Your Honor and I disagree with it.
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3917.314,3919.101,Do you agree with it or disagree?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,3919.101,3919.965,I disagree with it.
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3946.539,3953.673,"Why do you have to have a plan to just say, we're not going to have a delayed session?"
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,3953.673,3956.265,"Justice Black, I was going to do it now."
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3957.703,3960.713,What does that do anything except delay?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,3960.713,3979.522,"Justice Black, what this Court has required in Green is a reorganization of school districts, a reorganization that is really in fact a merger, a merger of two separate and distinct school systems, one black and one white into one."
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3992.195,3998.36,Why not do it and put it in effect and let the arrangements be made thereafter.
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,3998.36,4000.788,"Well, the “what” is the problem, Justice Black."
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4000.788,4001.314,The what?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4001.314,4003.178,The “what” is the problem.
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4010.768,4016.762,Start it in each one of these schools and said now we're not going to have any dual system of schools.
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4028.174,4032.408,"Justice Black, that is the position of the petitioners in the case."
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4034.196,4038.548,"No, I'm asking you why that view is right and whether it's right or not."
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4040.628,4041.702,I think it's wrong.
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4048.247,4051.645,"The frustrations from the 15 years, isn't it?"
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4051.645,4057.729,My point is that the frustration I think is more properly directed to the 18 months because it was with Green that this Court --
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4057.729,4060.49,You want to divide it up into segments.
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4060.49,4060.795,Pardon?
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4060.795,4062.406,You want to divide it up into segments.
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4062.406,4064.605,"No, I really don't.[Laughter]"
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4074.204,4081.644,Would anything -- would anything be precipitous in this appeal now?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4082.184,4084.222,"Mr. Justice Black, let me --"
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4084.222,4086.787,Since our order was given?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4086.787,4097.173,Let me say that many hundreds of thousands of the children that we're talking about are children of very tender age.
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4120.785,4126.781,Are you arguing -- are you arguing for perpetuation of the term with all deliberate speed?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4126.781,4127.437,I am not.
1969.632,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4133.349,4142.263,"Mr. Leonard, can you and I compromise you could say, pay no attention to Brown too, pay attention to Green."
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4147.712,4153.919,"Well, I think that Aaron and Cooper is an entirely different situation."
1969.632,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4156.023,4169.353,Green in which this Court have agreed to sign each Justice's name to it which is very seldom done and said that all nine agreed.
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4172.816,4180.538,I think that it was Mr. Justice Marshall but I think it was in Green that this Court articulated the need to have plans.
1969.632,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4206.675,4216.394,"In this case, we have -- we have before us and there have been formulated plans for these 14 school districts."
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4231.565,4239.547,"Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, let me point out to you that I don't think there's any disagreement about that."
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4386.15,4389.268,They've had six or seven weeks since September 1st.
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4389.268,4394.716,And they have been meeting with the school districts during that period of time.
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4394.716,4407.505,"Well, are there any plans that have developed within the last six or seven weeks different from the ones that were originally filed?"
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4407.505,4411.518,"Mr. Justice White, I honestly don't know the answer to that question."
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4413.532,4422.467,"Well, apparently, the two witnesses, if you have testified for the United States indicated some dissatisfaction with these plans."
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4422.467,4431.81,Not dissatisfaction so much with the total plan as with the lack of ability to validate the plans to conduct uncertain peripherals.
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4431.81,4434.416,I'm not sure I know what you mean by that --
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4434.416,4437.033,"Well, I think --"
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4437.033,4443.163,Did the two witnesses you had on the stand disagree with these plans?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4443.163,4444.085,Not basically.
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4445.541,4448.089,"And as far as you know, they still don't."
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4448.089,4452.524,I'm certain that they still do not at least at the last juncture of my talking to --
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4452.524,4467.856,The gentleman who propounded these plans and filed them not only said that they were sound substantively but they could be put into effect in a timely manner.
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4469.393,4470.901,They did.
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4470.901,4473.174,Is that -- and do they still?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4473.174,4474.266,They still do.
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4474.266,4479.83,So what is their -- what have been -- what they proposed?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4479.83,4489.066,"I think, I doubt very much that there was any testimony that related specifically to any period of delay."
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4494.138,4507.217,"The experts -- so your two experts or then some others who were advising the Secretary thought that these plans might be perfectly sound but they just had to make more arrangements to put them into effect, is that it?"
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4507.217,4511.702,"But they had two things, as I indicated it."
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4514.797,4515.857,Validate?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4515.857,4518.616,That is to conduct some additional studies to determine.
1969.632,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4572.956,4575.069,Just one question if I may.
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4601.811,4625.694,"Mr. Chief Justice, the plans if this Court does nothing with this lawsuit between now and December 1st, the plans will be submitted on December 1st and all of those elements of the plans which can be implemented according to the decision of the Fifth Circuit, all of those which have any reasonable hope of being implemented during this school year."
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4666.138,4668.206,What -- can you give me an example?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4668.206,4669.459,Yes.
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4669.459,4670.489,If you think might have --
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4670.489,4671.806,You have a --
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4671.806,4675.757,-- might not be able to implement this year?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4675.757,4688.147,"You have one of the school districts, I think has some 11,000 and there are some others in the package of 33 here that have some fairly good number of students."
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4731.855,4741.428,"Well, I thought the -- I thought these plans had failed to cover those counties where that sort of a problem would come up at all."
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4741.428,4742.466,"No, Mr. Justice White."
1969.632,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4747.256,4756.785,"That does not necessarily follow that this plan is not, can't be feasibly implemented during this year."
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4756.785,4767.417,"Well, I think Mr. Solon's testimony was that in his opinion, he's the one who worked on the Holmes County, the big district, or Heinz County."
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4791.044,4793.746,"Mr. Leonard, one more year or this year?"
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4793.746,4796.535,That's only for part of the plan.
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4796.535,4799.859,But it's another year.
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4799.859,4800.115,That is the --
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4800.115,4802.568,"Contemplation, another year."
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4802.568,4803.646,For a part of the plan.
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4803.646,4804.017,Yes.
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4804.017,4805.132,That's correct Justice.
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4805.132,4808.836,But it's all done into parts or segments.
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4808.836,4809.847,"No, not always."
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4811.938,4816.149,"So, that wasn't the first one that said that they had to do it now."
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4827.738,4830.353,"Well, --"
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4830.353,4831.141,What about the Virginia?
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4831.141,4833.034,I may be wrong Mr. Justice Black (Voice Overlap).
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4833.034,4838.11,What about the Virginia school which had said substantially the same thing.
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4838.11,4838.866,The Fourth Circuit --
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4838.866,4844.558,Two years before this Court.
1969.632,2,31414,jeris_leonard,,4844.558,4845.573,Let me say that --
1969.632,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4845.573,4854.478,"That the time for deliberation was out and the thing to do it, do it now."
1969.632,3,17068,a_f_summer,,4911.176,4914.866,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.632,4,33127,john_c_satterfield,,5179.887,5180.681,Mr. Chief Justice --
1969.632,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5180.681,5182.317,Mr. Satterfield.
1969.632,4,33127,john_c_satterfield,,5182.317,5184.726,-- and then the Court.
1969.632,5,30616,jack_greenberg,,6902.838,6905.036,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.632,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7244.523,7245.734,"Thank you, Mr. Greenberg."
