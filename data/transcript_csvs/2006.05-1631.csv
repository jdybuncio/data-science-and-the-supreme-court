2006.05-1631,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.802,"We'll hear argument next in Case 05-1631, Scott versus Harris."
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,7.487,10.206,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,76.75,78.2,Can I ask this question about the shopping center.
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,83.154,84.537,"It would, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,84.537,87.939,So that we really don't have to get distracted by the shopping center?
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,87.939,89.908,"There is a... yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,113.773,116.391,I'm not sure why you concede that.
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,134.003,137.639,"--But Scott... yes, Your Honor, I think that is part of the analysis."
2006.05-1631,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,137.639,143.442,"So how do I know whether, which of these things is directly or not indirectly... well, you go ahead."
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,147.846,148.946,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,160.82,171.545,Is the rule that you propose that the policeman must balance the risk of harm to others versus the risk of harm to the fleeing person?
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,171.545,174.747,"Your Honor... yes, essentially."
2006.05-1631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,174.747,184.102,"Your brief says that the officer reasonably believes that doing so, i.e., terminating the chase, would avoid a greater risk of bodily injury or death."
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,184.102,185.002,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,185.971,187.104,Greater than what?
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,187.737,190.506,--Greater than not taking action.
2006.05-1631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,192.208,195.493,--Without reference to the possible harm to the driver?
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,196.61,199.795,--I think that... I think that is one of the factors to be considered.
2006.05-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,199.795,200.731,I don't know that I agree with that.
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,225.012,225.562,"Well, Your Honor--"
2006.05-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,225.562,227.012,I'd stop him.
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,231.333,232.516,"--Yes, Your Honor, I would agree with that."
2006.05-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,232.516,235.535,I think you're giving away too much.
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,235.535,246.093,One thing I did want to point out is that a speed of 90 miles per hour... and of course there's evidence in the record that the vehicles were at times traveling over 100 miles an hour--
2006.05-1631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,246.093,247.962,I didn't mean to put words in your mouth.
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,256.531,258.651,"--Yes, that's probably a better articulation."
2006.05-1631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,258.651,260.185,"Well, it's your brief."
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,260.903,265.756,"I think that's a better articulation of what the appropriate test would be, the way--"
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,265.756,273.593,"Well, isn't the speed also relevant to the likelihood that... that running into a car at that speed would cause the death of a driver?"
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,273.593,275.029,"--It would, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,275.029,283.016,"Isn't it a fair high probability that if you hit someone at that speed that there will be something, either death or serious injury as a result?"
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,283.016,290.122,"Your Honor, my answer to that question would be that that's always going to be the case whenever force is used to stop a vehicle at this high rate of speed."
2006.05-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,290.122,301.863,"Well, I suppose there is also a high probability where you're going 90 miles an hour on a one-way road, crossing over the double yellow line, with oncoming traffic, that you're going to hurt somebody else."
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,301.863,302.53,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,302.53,306.049,"I mean, the more you increase the speed the more likely he's going to be hurt."
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,309.683,310.102,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,318.522,325.545,"But Mr. Savrin, there was an episode in the parking lot where things came to a temporary halt."
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,343.457,347.759,"Well, Your Honor, I would disagree with that, that in fact--"
2006.05-1631,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,347.759,350.427,"Well, he was speeding before the police knew about him, right?"
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,352.279,365.603,"--The initial offense was speeding, and Mr. Harris, instead of pulling over or slowing down as would might be expected by a reasonable person, sped up and continued to drive recklessly."
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,381.965,389.904,"Well, do you contend that an officer can always use deadly force to stop a high-speed driver who's creating this kind of a risk?"
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,389.904,392.47,I think it depends on how you define deadly force.
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,393.756,397.974,Running into him with a high probability that he'll get killed.
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,397.974,404.497,"--I think that, that would be the case, as I indicated, whenever an officer uses force to stop a vehicle at this speed."
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,412.401,415.103,"Wasn't that acknowledged in the district court, in the trial court?"
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,415.103,416.722,--In this case?
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,416.722,417.272,Yes.
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,417.272,421.107,"No, the district court found that it did not need to resolve whether or not--"
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,421.107,422.876,But the jury might find that it was deadly force.
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,422.876,426.744,--The Eleventh Circuit found that the jury might conclude it was deadly force.
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,426.744,430.279,And do you conclude that the jury could not find that it was deadly force?
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,430.279,434.683,"I believe, again, Your Honor, I believe that it depends on how broad the test is."
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,437.885,444.289,"Well, but is your... is it your view that a jury could not find on these facts that there was deadly force?"
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,444.289,451.645,"--I believe, yes, under, under the test as articulated in some of the circuits, yes, this would not be deadly force."
2006.05-1631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,453.061,464.619,"--I thought we had a test for deadly force in Garner and it's whether or not there is... it's more likely than not, whether or not there is a serious risk that death will ensue."
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,466.488,476.943,"--Your Honor, as I read the Garner opinion, the court did not need to reach a definition of deadly force because shooting someone in the back of the head is clearly going to be deadly force."
2006.05-1631,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,514.967,520.621,"What test, what of deadly force would not be met here?"
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,520.621,521.255,A likelihood--
2006.05-1631,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,521.255,523.006,Considering that it's a summary judgment issue.
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,523.006,523.657,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.23,559.364,Finish that.
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,559.364,560.214,--I'm sorry.
2006.05-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,562.48,563.249,Excuse me.
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,579.276,583.06,"Your Honor, his intent was to end the pursuit, not to cause an accident."
2006.05-1631,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.06,587.697,"Well, but the Third Circuit case you just described didn't talk about intent."
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,590.733,594.018,"Well, let me cite another case then, the Adams case from the Eleventh Circuit."
2006.05-1631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,594.018,597.237,"Before do you that, will you go back to the Philadelphia case."
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,611.563,612.363,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,613.03,614.099,I don't understand that.
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,617.717,621.936,--Let me cite the Court to the Eleventh Circuit's own reasoning in the Adams case.
2006.05-1631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,644.051,645.82,That doesn't answer my question.
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,645.82,646.42,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,646.42,658.378,"Why, why would it be reasonable to believe that a car could be bumped at 90 miles an hour plus without raising a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm?"
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,660.662,666.214,"Because there are vehicle collisions every day, Your Honor, that do not end in death or serious bodily harm."
2006.05-1631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,666.214,667.316,Some people are lucky.
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,675.589,681.041,"Your Honor, because Mr. Harris could have regained control of his vehicle."
2006.05-1631,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,694.734,698.955,"Well, that's a different issue and you may prevail on other arguments in the case."
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,711.262,719.784,"I believe in the context of the Fourth Amendment and the Graham factors and the question of probable cause, that it's not the same as simply a jury question."
2006.05-1631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,732.842,750.637,"Mr. Savrin, one technique that Officer Scott asked permission to use was described as a PIT technique that would be a life and limb... sparing measure."
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,776.121,779.323,"Your Honor, if I could respond to that in two respects."
2006.05-1631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,817.198,820.067,Where is that?
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,820.067,826.82,"--That's in Mark Faninger's deposition, and he is the supervisor that was--"
2006.05-1631,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,826.82,832.457,And he said he gave permission for more than PIT procedure?
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,832.457,832.907,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,838.211,840.897,"Well, the phrase used was ""take him out"", wasn't it?"
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,840.897,841.73,Yes.
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.213,853.638,"Does a police officer have any obligation in a situation like this to consider other alternatives, and if so what other alternatives might have been available to this officer?"
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,853.638,854.438,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,863.111,872.916,"And even with letting him go, isn't it possible they could get other roadblocks up ahead or get other people involved in the attempt to catch him?"
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,872.916,874.851,"--Yes, there always are other potentials."
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,885.359,889.061,Isn't it true that there's no traffic on the road at that particular time?
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,889.061,900.869,Deputy Scott took the action that he did because there was a low likelihood of injury to third parties other than to Mr. Harris because there was no one in his immediate path of travel.
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.869,906.089,"Well, in that circumstance why wouldn't he just consider discontinuing the chase?"
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,906.089,915.528,Because there were... the videotape shows that Mr. Harris passed approximately 36 cars during this period of time.
2006.05-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.871,933.69,Would that have been likely if the officer had discontinued the chase?
2006.05-1631,0,38333,philip_w_savrin,,933.69,941.679,"Whether he discontinued the chase or not, Mr. Harris could still injure whoever might be around the next corner, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,944.631,946.031,"Thank you, Mr. Savrin."
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,952.201,954.653,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1631,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,972.615,976.317,Does it matter exactly what the nature of the escape was?
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,989.426,990.526,"It does, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1000.551,1005.836,I would think that would apply to all high-speed cases; would you not agree?
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1005.836,1007.788,"I agree that it does, Justice Kennedy."
2006.05-1631,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1023.481,1023.947,Yes.
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1031.569,1032.986,"--Well, that's true, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1044.96,1054.685,"No but if you're thinking of the likelihood of harm if they discontinued the chase, is it not reasonable to assume he might go back to going 72 miles an hour in a 55-mile zone?"
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1054.685,1056.252,"--Not on this record, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.218,1064.041,It would might also be reasonable to assume that anyone who was chased by the police will immediately speed up to 90 miles an hour.
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1064.041,1065.874,"--That's exactly right, Justice Sc alia."
2006.05-1631,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1065.874,1073.146,"It doesn't seem to me a very good rule to give to police forces: Anybody who's going 72 miles an hour, let him go."
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1074.863,1075.865,"We agree, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1631,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.217,1081.002,There isn't a question.
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1086.989,1098.279,"--The question in our mind, Justice Stevens, is whether Deputy Scott reasonably believed that Respondent posed a serious risk of injury or death to other motor vehicles, bystanders or police on the roadway that night."
2006.05-1631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1098.279,1100.314,Why are these absolute?
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1119.627,1120.66,"We agree, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1120.66,1125.281,"All right, if that's the law, then whether... of course an automobile could, could kill people."
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1165.073,1171.143,"Justice Breyer, to answer the second question first, Scott did not know that he was initially in a chase."
2006.05-1631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1171.143,1173.362,And a reasonable juror could not conclude to the contrary?
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1173.362,1176.48,"Well, Scott, I believe, Scott's testimony was that he did not know."
2006.05-1631,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1195.541,1203.547,Is it reasonable for him to suppose that there might be something more going on if the guy is trying this hard to get away from a speeding ticket?
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1207.683,1208.366,Absolutely.
2006.05-1631,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1208.366,1210.785,Is that a factor that goes into the analysis?
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1210.785,1213.737,"It is, certainly, at a commonsense level."
2006.05-1631,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1222.243,1228.247,What if they knew there were drugs in the car that he would dispose of if he had got caught.
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1231.799,1234.916,"--I'm not sure that it would, Justice Scalia... uh, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-1631,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1234.916,1236.685,"I'm rather clear it would not, isn't it?"
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1239.97,1240.87,Well... that's true.
2006.05-1631,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1254.88,1262.836,But your position would be the same even if Scott knew that the only reason they were trying to stop him initially was the speeding violation?
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1262.836,1263.403,--Yes.
2006.05-1631,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1277.945,1278.695,"Why, why wouldn't it matter?"
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1302.711,1313.019,"Because, Your Honor, regardless of the reason the chase began, at the moment that Deputy Scott used the force, this car posed a serious risk to everyone else on the road that night."
2006.05-1631,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1331.73,1333.246,How do you deal with the Brower case?
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1354.595,1358.647,"--Justice Ginsburg, the holding in that case was that a roadblock amounted to a seizure."
2006.05-1631,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1384.978,1385.63,May I just make this one point?
2006.05-1631,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1391.784,1401.324,"Well, the... ultimately to determine whether this decision could be made at the summary judgment stage you would have to consider whether a jury could find it unreasonable."
2006.05-1631,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1432.611,1433.945,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1436.813,1439.265,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.05-1631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1461.262,1468.868,Is there any doubt that Mr. Harris was likely to cause death or serious injury to the other cars on the highway that he was passing?
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1468.868,1473.236,Mr. Harris was simply a... an unsafe driver.
2006.05-1631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1481.559,1484.194,We are not talking about driving in violation of traffic laws.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1489.965,1490.965,"--Well, we're talking--"
2006.05-1631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1490.965,1495.269,--Hitting... after hitting Officer Scott's car and continuing on.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1496.936,1500.171,"--Well, those are not the facts before the Court, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-1631,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1509.361,1510.761,He used the turning signal.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1514.98,1521.586,When he turned into the... when he turned into the shopping center he wasn't weaving through a parking lot.
2006.05-1631,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1550.07,1551.605,"Mr. Jones, I looked at the videotape on this."
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.628,1565.532,"He created the scariest chase I ever saw since ""The French Connection""."
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1568.9,1569.684,As a--
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1569.684,1577.59,"A frightening amount of speed, and cars coming in the opposite direction, at night, on a two-lane windy road--"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1577.59,1583.659,"--Well, as the Court below found, and as the tape indicates, Mr. Harris didn't run anybody off the road."
2006.05-1631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1587.628,1591.932,The question was whether he was creating a substantial risk doing that.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1591.932,1592.532,He was creating--
2006.05-1631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1592.532,1597.05,"And my, my question is how could a jury find otherwise?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1623.331,1626.366,"--Well, the jury could certainly find he's creating a risk."
2006.05-1631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1637.155,1650.148,Garner was not talking about someone who at the time the deadly force was used was himself creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm to others.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1675.614,1684.302,"--Well, a jury could find that the pursuit by the officer escalated the risk rather than diminishing the risk to others."
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1698.379,1699.929,"Did Scott, know that?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1708.401,1711.437,We have evidence that it was called out on the radio.
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1713.689,1716.455,And Scott has testified he didn't know it.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1716.455,1717.507,Scott has testified he--
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1717.507,1722.426,"Now, do you think you can get to the jury on the question of whether he knew it."
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1722.426,1723.095,--Scott--
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1723.095,1725.078,I'd like a yes or no answer.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1725.078,1729.215,--The testimony--
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1729.215,1731.032,That doesn't sound like yes or no.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1731.032,1734.435,--I'm not certain I understand the question.
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1734.435,1735.585,"The question is, can you--"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1744.291,1746.008,Scott did not know that was it.
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1746.008,1746.376,All right.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1782.916,1788.32,"Well, there is certainly a credibility issue as to whether Scott says he knew or didn't know."
2006.05-1631,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1794.891,1805.782,"Well, as the Chief Justice indicated through a question earlier, isn't it reasonable for an officer to assume that it is... he is trying to escape because there is something more serious than speeding at stake?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1809.734,1814.22,--That assumption would not be based upon probability or based upon police training.
2006.05-1631,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1817.422,1822.91,You mean just as many people take off in high speed chases for speeding as for serious crimes?
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1822.91,1825.945,--The vast majority have committed minor crimes.
2006.05-1631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1827.428,1833.366,"But at the moment Scott came into this case, what difference does that make?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1875.859,1877.545,--That's the issue.
2006.05-1631,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1880.247,1890.603,"So you agree that whether Scott knew or didn't know, that this whole scenario had eventuated out of a speeding situation was irrelevant?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1890.603,1891.505,--It's not relevant.
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1908.682,1910.532,That's exactly where I started.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1943.939,1944.955,"--Well, that's a good question."
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1944.955,1947.057,"Well, what is the standard?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,1950.509,1955.145,"Well, whether you apply Garner or Graham, the result is the same in this case."
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2004.311,2029.895,"So you're saying I cannot do the following under the law, which would seem to be contrary to common sense, to say there is a big difference between a policeman shooting a person who is running away and threatens no harm to others, and a policeman using a gun... using a car on a highway to try to get a person to stop who is threatening others."
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2032.747,2033.38,Yes.
2006.05-1631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2046.271,2064.032,"The Eleventh Circuit gave the exact opposite answer in the Adams case, which if you're looking at what the... was clearly established law from the point of view of the officer that provides him guidance that the Garner case does not dictate a result in the use of deadly force in the police chase case involving an automobile."
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2064.032,2090.85,"--Well, the holding of the Adams versus St. Lucie County case was that in 1985, an incident which occurred six weeks after the Garner decision and four years before the Brower decision, there is no way the officers could have known at that time that their act of ramming a police car to prevent an escape of another fleeing vehicle would have been considered deadly force in violation of the Fourth Amendment."
2006.05-1631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2108.045,2112.532,"So when Officer Scott was trying to figure out what the law was, he should have relied on the dissent in the case?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2112.532,2124.007,"--Well, another case came about later which held that as early as 1998 in another case involving the same department, that there was clearly established law."
2006.05-1631,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2124.007,2139.183,"Was there any case at the time of the action in this case, any decision that said ramming, ramming a car to end a chase violates the Fourth Amendment?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2139.183,2141.719,Brower versus County of Inyo says--
2006.05-1631,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2141.719,2145.086,Brower was a roadblock case.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2145.086,2146.17,--It was a roadblock which--
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.234,2170.386,--But the issue in the case was quite simply whether there had been a seizure.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2171.102,2171.821,--That was the first holding.
2006.05-1631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2188.163,2188.796,Go ahead.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2189.532,2208.844,"What I liked about your decision in that case, Justice Scalia, was that you said that the officer's culpability for using excessive force is not diminished by the fact that perpetrator chose to continue running, whether it was the fleeing burglar in Garner or the fleeing driver in Brower."
2006.05-1631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2209.91,2211.479,--If I could just get back to an earlier point.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2218.283,2219.218,That was one option.
2006.05-1631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2229.907,2234.477,Even though he doesn't know at that point that he will ever be able to arrest him later.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2236.461,2237.346,That's correct.
2006.05-1631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2237.346,2241.665,"And he doesn't know why he is being pursued, whether it's for mass murder or terrorism or anything else."
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2241.665,2242.833,"Well, that's correct."
2006.05-1631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2276.321,2278.173,"Once they have gotten away, I assume."
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2278.173,2280.14,"--Well, sometimes you have to let them get away."
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2292.85,2295.968,Not if he is shooting his way out of the house and endangering other people.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2295.968,2296.335,That's correct.
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.335,2298.302,"I mean, that's a factor here, of course."
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2311.894,2312.627,You can shoot him.
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2314.279,2315.113,Of course you can shoot him.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2315.113,2319.417,"Let me take that distinction and apply it to the vehicle, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1631,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2334.36,2341.931,"Can you tell me as of the time he exited the parking lot, by that point, had he committed any felonies?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2341.931,2342.331,No.
2006.05-1631,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2345.985,2349.102,"90 miles an hour would not be a felony, not a reckless driving?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2349.102,2352.638,--Are you talking about the traffic pursuit?
2006.05-1631,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2352.638,2353.054,Yes.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2353.054,2356.09,"No, none of those are felonies under Georgia law."
2006.05-1631,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2356.09,2358.542,At no point did he commit a felony?
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2358.542,2359.292,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2361.744,2363.527,But he certainly committed a lot of--
2006.05-1631,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2363.527,2365.579,"If he had intended to hit the police officer, was it--"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2365.579,2371.1,"If he had intended to hit the police officer, if that was shown by the evidence, so they could have charged with aggravated assault."
2006.05-1631,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2377.787,2383.091,--The key point is that he is endangering the lives and safety of others.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2398.583,2417.681,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I hope I don't have you on my jury if that's... but what the trial court found was that construing the facts in a light most favorable to the Plaintiff as a nonmoving party, that reasonable jurors can find that this was simply a person who was driving fast."
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.639,2432.173,"Is that a factual finding of the, of the trial court here?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2432.173,2433.456,That is a factual finding.
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2433.456,2434.875,Are we bound by that fact?
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2434.875,2435.742,We are bound by that.
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.322,2463.56,"Even if having watched the tape, there is no way that, that factual finding can be accurate?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2463.56,2472.515,"If you want to repeal Johnson v. Jones and Mitchell v. Forsythe, then yes."
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2508.605,2513.575,"I don't see how... I mean, you know, given our prior discussion here, I don't see how that's the issue."
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2521.848,2524.148,"Well, I'm not talking about the underlying violation here."
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2530.454,2534.839,"That conduct... it could be conduct... you could say exactly your same question, just as the Chief just said."
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2542.995,2543.995,This is the issue.
2006.05-1631,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2566.793,2584.922,"When someone is fleeing and creating a grave danger, let's just assume that that's the case, creating a very danger for other drivers on the road, when in your view is it reasonable for the police to use deadly force to stop that, as opposed to breaking off the chase?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2586.291,2594.544,"Well, under Garner the test is they have to be threatening violence or inflicting violence against someone."
2006.05-1631,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2611.489,2614.024,How could you possibly give a warning in this situation?
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2614.024,2617.643,"--It's academic in this case, because the first two factors were not met."
2006.05-1631,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2626.182,2628.284,Why wasn't there warning?
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2636.473,2640.758,There was certainly warning that he needed... that he was expected to pull over.
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2644.293,2645.662,--What am I... you said factually.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2675.181,2676.648,"Well, I didn't see that."
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2676.648,2677.481,You didn't see that?
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2677.481,2677.966,I--
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2677.966,2679.566,You didn't... I thought that... you didn't see that?
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2679.566,2687.656,"--Well, the point is most people use the word weaving to describe the motion of Mr. Harris's car is when they are going through the, the shopping center--"
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2687.656,2688.122,"No, no."
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2711.022,2712.872,--The... feel free to look at it again.
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2712.872,2713.39,--Yeah.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2713.39,2715.874,But those are not the facts that were found by the court below in this--
2006.05-1631,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2715.874,2717.291,"Well that's, that's what I wonder."
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2724.095,2728.399,"--Well, I think you apply the law, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2728.399,2729.183,--The district--
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2760.62,2769.643,"Well in theory perhaps they could be if the officer was a joint proximate cause of the accident, but in most states--"
2006.05-1631,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2769.643,2773.262,"Well, aren't they the proximate cause if they continue the chase without trying to terminate it?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2773.262,2773.978,--That's correct.
2006.05-1631,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2784.07,2784.503,No.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2788.188,2794.859,"--Well, if he terminates the chase using deadly force, that that creates a whole host of other problems."
2006.05-1631,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2794.859,2805.733,"But isn't there... but isn't that one way to assure that the police are not liable, both from a moral standpoint and a legal standpoint, for causing the injury of other people?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2805.733,2810.637,Now from a constitutional standpoint the Fourth Amendment doesn't protect other people.
2006.05-1631,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2814.922,2819.041,"Well, you mean it's irrelevant to our analysis to consider that he might injure other people?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2819.041,2832.717,"The potential for danger to others is certainly part of the justification for deadly force, just as, if deadly force cannot be used endangering other people, then that certainly goes into the matrix, too."
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2832.717,2833.767,"Mr. Jones, could I--"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2833.767,2834.253,Yeah.
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2834.253,2845.524,--Could I ask whether the portion of the opinion that you say establishes that he was not endangering anybody is this portion?
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2855.999,2856.382,Yes.
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2856.382,2858.784,"""# that he maintained control over his vehicle. """
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2889.97,2903.997,"Well, this is my point is that if, if the drive... if the hazard caused by driving in and of itself is the only threat here, does that rise to a level of imminency and immediacy that justifies the use of deadly force?"
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2921.941,2929.547,"It depends on how fast... if depends on how fast the car is going, whether it's a two-lane road or four-lane divided highway."
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2956.282,2956.848,Well that's--
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2956.848,2958.234,I would have let the guy go.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2958.234,2958.766,"--Now what he, if he--"
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2958.766,2964.22,"Driving 90 miles an hour and comes up, approaches that car, that car swerved."
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2966.07,2966.67,--Absolutely.
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2967.939,2974.859,So I don't think we need a whole lot of disincentive to stop police officers in engaging in frolicsome conduct.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,2974.859,2976.711,"--Well, not only that, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3005.028,3006.464,Let me just ask this question.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,3022.807,3023.176,The officer--
2006.05-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3023.176,3024.342,Just as we did in Garner?
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,3024.342,3026.961,--The officer has both options.
2006.05-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3056.563,3068.888,If it were... clear that a jury could find that there would be no unreasonable risk to innocent motorists if they discontinued the chase... assume that's a possible finding.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,3072.507,3074.192,Not under the Fourth Amendment.
2006.05-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3081.763,3084.23,You're saying there is a duty not to use deadly force.
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,3084.23,3087.849,"--That's what Garner says, if you don't use deadly force."
2006.05-1631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3089.518,3101.692,"And aren't you concerned that that creates an incentive in every case for anyone who, that sees the blue lights behind them to know that all they have to do is keep fleeing and the police are going to have to give up eventually?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,3101.692,3107.596,"Well, let me respond by reading a portion of Garner that deals with that point, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-1631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3120.121,3123.022,"Well, Garner... Garner was the case involving shooting the guy in the back, right?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,3123.022,3123.541,--Yes.
2006.05-1631,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3145.621,3153.811,"But your, your answer to Justice Stevens as I understand it was the police not have the duty to discontinue the chase?"
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,3163.966,3170.772,"--Well, I think there is an independent duty, it doesn't rise under the Fourth Amendment, but there is an independent duty to do that."
2006.05-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3176.759,3185.782,"It is certainly the case that if there is going to be a, a risk of deadly harm to innocent third parties, there would be a duty to discontinue the chase rather kill him."
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,3188.015,3196.888,"--Well, experience shows most of the time when you discontinue a chase, the person who is running discontinues driving unsafely."
2006.05-1631,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3203.409,3209.147,Did this study show what future fleeing speeders would do?
2006.05-1631,2,19296,craig_t_jones,,3236.048,3240.517,"--Well, the rule simply says you don't kill him just because he is driving unsafely."
2006.05-1631,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3259.977,3261.413,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
2006.05-1631,3,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3264.531,3266.115,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-1631,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3313.446,3314.214,What am I supposed to do?
2006.05-1631,3,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3325.403,3340.615,"--Your Honor, I think the answer to that question was provided in this decision in Ornelas versus United States, a decision by this Court in 1996 that came up in the context of a criminal, a direct criminal appeal involving the question of probable cause."
2006.05-1631,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3357.458,3360.993,"Whether he is endangering anybody is a historical fact, no?"
2006.05-1631,3,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3362.693,3364.945,I don't believe that is historical fact.
2006.05-1631,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3364.945,3365.378,It is.
2006.05-1631,3,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3365.378,3378.954,"The historical facts here are whether Mr. Harris was driving excessively, whether he was driving across the line, whether he was driving at high rates of speed, whether there was anybody in his path, whether he had collided with anyone."
2006.05-1631,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3398.785,3426.435,"What is the, the court saying... and this is on page 39 A of the petition appendix... when Harris was driving away from officers and when there, when there were no other motorists or pedestrians nearby, thus casting doubt on defendant's assertion that at the time of the ramming, Harris posed an immediate threat of harm to others."
2006.05-1631,3,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3434.458,3439.01,And that is a fact that we accept as true in the immediate vicinity.
2006.05-1631,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3449.134,3456.788,"I would hope he would wait until there were no pedestrians or vehicles coming before he, before he did the ramming."
2006.05-1631,3,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3456.788,3457.705,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3457.705,3460.858,I assume he waited precisely for that kind of a gap in the traffic?
2006.05-1631,3,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3460.858,3461.525,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3470.581,3477.035,Do you agree with Mr. Jones' statement that none of Mr. Harris' conduct rose to the level of a felony?
2006.05-1631,3,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3477.035,3478.487,"--I would not, Your Honor."
2006.05-1631,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3532.62,3533.986,"Thank you, Mr. Savrin."
