2008.07-542,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.904,We'll hear argument next in Kennedy v. Plan Administrator for Du Pont Savings and Investment Plan.
2008.07-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,26.732,29.483,Do you have any views on the other case?
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,31.102,32.102,"None whatsoever, Your Honor."
2008.07-542,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,127.315,137.253,"But not if it occurred in the station house, right, if the -- if the arrestee had been taken into the station house?"
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,137.253,138.17,Correct.
2008.07-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,139.503,140.72,Or location.
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,140.72,141.955,"Time and location, Your Honor."
2008.07-542,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,141.955,155.446,"Well, why isn't this situation more like the station house than it is like -- the Belton situation is the police apprehend the -- a driver."
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,183.382,187.767,The arrestee is still at the same location at the scene of the arrest.
2008.07-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,210.097,212.33,"And this is important, but you had three -- three points."
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,215.365,219.567,--The third is requiring a justification is anathema to a bright-line rule.
2008.07-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,231.125,237.195,"Well, we do have a -- we do obviously require a justification for the bright-line rule itself."
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,291.764,302.554,"I think in Belton this Court did apply Chimel and simply said, in this recurring situation we need a bright-line rule that can be easily determined and enforced by officers--"
2008.07-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,302.554,312.077,But the bright line swallows up the rationale in this hypothetical where already he's handcuffed; he is in the car.
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,318.414,324.801,--The fact that officers have for 27 years applied it; it's a workable rule.
2008.07-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.801,326.003,That's not a long time.
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,367.997,372.818,"Your Honor, there is not much on searches incident prior to 1914, the Weeks case."
2008.07-542,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,375.634,377.369,Something was happening back there.
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,379.304,380.404,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2008.07-542,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,380.404,383.689,The automobile exception is much older than that.
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,383.689,388.493,"Right, but the -- the search incident language and application--"
2008.07-542,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,388.493,392.879,"But, you know, the automobile exception could provide a rationale that would cover all of these cases."
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,394.481,396.516,"--Yes, I do, very well, Your Honor."
2008.07-542,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,405.622,416.41,It's for officer safety when the defendant is no longer in the car and is under -- under the control of the officer?
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,416.41,418.096,There is still a risk.
2008.07-542,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,418.096,419.679,Which are not the facts of Belton.
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,419.679,421.214,"Belton, no."
2008.07-542,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,424.083,428.218,"You are asking for the expanded Belton rule, not the rule of Belton itself."
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,428.218,428.987,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,445.247,445.947,That's a reasonable rule.
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,462.624,463.791,"Well, Your Honor--"
2008.07-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,463.791,465.743,"Realistically, he is not at risk."
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,474.016,483.872,--In -- in our reply brief we pointed out in 2007 there were 93 reported cases where arrestees cuffed in the back of a patrol car escaped.
2008.07-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,487.64,490.609,Do you know of any one of those cases in which the officer got hurt?
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,510.772,519.728,"--In one of the cases the arrestee went to his vehicle but simply took off and led the police on a high-speed chase, but none in -- where they went to the vehicle and grabbed a weapon."
2008.07-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,519.728,522.997,Did he -- did he have -- have his hands handcuffed behind his back?
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,522.997,523.53,Yes.
2008.07-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,524.199,525.632,And he was able to drive the car?
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,525.632,526.149,--Yes.
2008.07-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,532.119,533.305,I'd really like to meet him.
2008.07-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.688,536.506,I wouldn't.
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,549.247,553.349,"--And, Your Honor, in -- in ten of those cases the officers were searching the vehicle when they escaped."
2008.07-542,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,553.349,561.638,"Counsel, if you don't have -- I thought the whole point of a bright-line rule is that you don't have to justify in every particular case applying the -- the rule."
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,568.228,573.78,And that was the point I was trying to make is -- is there is going to be -- security is a matter of degree.
2008.07-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,591.057,601.032,Are there other -- are there other reasons that it's hazardous or dangerous or at least risky to leave an unattended car where other people can go in and maybe find weapons and contraband if the police aren't guarding it?
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,604.751,611.655,"--Certainly, in -- in the case of an automobile, which is different from the Chimel home situation, if a vehicle is being left there."
2008.07-542,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,638.922,640.174,What happens to this car?
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,658.402,667.074,"--In this case the police impounded the car, but that was only because after they did the Belton search, they found drugs."
2008.07-542,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,667.074,667.607,But suppose they didn't?
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,682.584,684.786,It depends on the department.
2008.07-542,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,755.03,759.498,But it isn't true that we didn't have the recent occupant problem at the time of Belton?
2008.07-542,0,31664,joseph_t_maziarz,,759.498,760.032,--Right.
2008.07-542,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,831.078,834.863,"Thank you, Mr. Yang -- Mr. Maziarz."
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,836.915,843.735,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2008.07-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.867,934.06,Once you -- once you eliminate the -- the need to show that the officer's safety was threatened why -- why would you limit the search just to the passenger compartment of the vehicle?
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,938.531,946.518,"Well, I think Belton -- when Belton was decided there was some question in terms of the trunk in terms of this Court's decision in Sanders."
2008.07-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,957.89,970.883,"I know -- I know you're not but it just doesn't make sense to me to -- to abandon the requirement that the -- that the officer's safety be threatened and yet to say oh, but he can only search the -- the passenger compartment."
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,977.87,987.595,"Certainly in another case, you know, the Court can revisit the scope of Belton but I think Belton as established certainly makes sense with respect to the ambit of the passenger compartment."
2008.07-542,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,988.144,992.896,"In Belton, wasn't the notion what was within grabbing distance?"
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,998.95,1002.687,"--Well, I'm not sure that that's -- that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1018.114,1024.768,What is the basis for your wanting us to adopt what we might call a bright-line rule for automobile exception?
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1032.206,1040.194,"Well, the -- related to officer safety is the question of the administrability of the rule in these highly fluid contexts."
2008.07-542,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1062.143,1069.897,"I take it you agree it's perfectly workable to say that if the defendant has been taken to the police station, they can't then search the car--"
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1069.897,1070.581,Yes.
2008.07-542,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1071.798,1077.085,"--Why isn't it equally workable to say when the defendant is handcuffed and put in the back of a cruiser, they can't do it?"
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1077.085,1086.508,"--Well, Justice Souter we think that -- in some ways that does have the benefit of a bright-line rule, but we don't believe that the -- that's a question of where you're going to draw that line."
2008.07-542,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1086.508,1087.125,Right.
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1099.566,1101.818,We actually would draw the line a little closer than the police station.
2008.07-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1117.194,1126.585,"Why wouldn't the rule of requiring just the automobile exception, where you would require probable cause to search a vehicle, why wouldn't that be a bright line rule that would fit into everything else."
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1126.585,1134.239,"It is, but the difference between the probable cause exception and a search incident to arrest is a search incident to arrest doctrine--"
2008.07-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1134.239,1139.476,Are you more concerned about the ability to search the vehicle or the protection of the officer?
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1139.476,1142.845,"--Well, certainly the protection of the officer is what motivates the doctrine."
2008.07-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1142.845,1149.582,But doesn't -- don't these rules apply to ordinary traffic arrests where there really is very little risk to the officer?
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1149.582,1157.104,"Actually, Your Honor, very common-day traffic arrests have high risk to the officer due to the unknowns."
2008.07-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1169.095,1175.749,The need to search the vehicle is primarily justified by the interest in officer safety?
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1175.749,1179.637,"--Primarily, but also the interest in preserving evidence."
2008.07-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1180.937,1187.124,But the interest in preserving evidence really should only be present when there is probable cause to believe there is some evidence.
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1187.124,1198.181,"--Oh, no; when a suspect is put under custodial arrest, the -- there is increased incentive both to escape, to get weapons, and also to destroy any incriminating evidence that might be--"
2008.07-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.181,1201.566,You've arrested this guy for -- for reckless driving.
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1211.941,1212.874,--To preserve--
2008.07-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.874,1214.641,You're going to allow the search nonetheless.
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1224.166,1226.249,"--Well, we would take issue with respect to the officer safety."
2008.07-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1226.249,1227.284,I understand that.
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1227.284,1229.903,But in terms -- in terms of the evidence the Court recognized in Maryland v--
2008.07-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1229.903,1242.626,You have to link -- if you're going to use that rationale you have to link the reason for the arrest with the likelihood that there would be any evidence found in the car that would support the arrest.
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1242.626,1256.6,"--The Court recognized in Maryland v Wilson that when you pull someone over for a traffic stop, there is a risk of escalation of the encounter because evidence of a more serious crime might be revealed in that stop."
2008.07-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1256.6,1264.79,"Oh, so -- so you, you avowedly say that once you arrest somebody you can rummage around for evidence of a different crime, right?"
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1264.79,1265.223,No.
2008.07-542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1270.777,1273.062,"Well, you keep coming back to danger."
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1306.117,1315.739,"Well, on the point of officer safety, Your Honor, I can understand the Court's reluctance to think that a person handcuffed in a car is likely to escape."
2008.07-542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1328.413,1330.065,"Fine, if you want to go back to that, fine."
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1333.934,1339.338,"--But the point is, on a continuum, Belton provides an administrable rule where officers in the field can guide their conduct."
2008.07-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.357,1371.242,"Normally, to overcome the privacy interest, you need probable cause."
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1375.777,1384.367,"--In terms of the balancing that's conducted, it can be a risk to officer safety, the need for administrable rule balanced against the privacy interest."
2008.07-542,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1396.341,1398.559,Could they have impounded this car?
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1405.38,1407.665,It was in a private house owned by someone else.
2008.07-542,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1421.325,1424.694,"So they could have impounded, and then could they have done an inventory search?"
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1424.694,1433.65,"Correct, which underscores the diminished privacy interest that an arrestee would have in the contents of a vehicle."
2008.07-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1434.283,1436.084,Why -- why can they impound it?
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1447.023,1457.165,"--Well, once someone has been arrested and if it's all-night parking, if the person is going into a custodial arrest, going to jail for purposes of protecting--"
2008.07-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.165,1459.367,"He says, ""Let me lock my car""."
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1465.604,1481.03,"--Well, for purposes of the impound and inventory search, so long as there's a reasonable basis, and the reasonable basis would be to secure the vehicle to get it off the street when the occupant has been arrested and wouldn't be able to retrieve it, I think--"
2008.07-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1481.03,1492.088,"I can see some situations where -- where, for public safety or other reasons, you have to remove the car from where it is, and I guess the best thing to do is to drag it off to the police impoundment yard."
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1501.11,1518.488,"--It's not automatic, but it does go against the expectation of privacy that one has in the personal effects in the vehicle, and is greatly diminished because, you know, the State -- I believe it was your decision in Wyoming versus Houghton -- the State regulates cars on a daily basis."
2008.07-542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1525.392,1530.094,Diminished expectations of privacy are not a reason to search.
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1530.094,1531.779,"--Correct, but what it's balanced--"
2008.07-542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1531.779,1537.117,The only reason to search that I can find from you so far is officer safety.
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1537.117,1541.502,"--Officer safety and the need for an administrable rule, which is--"
2008.07-542,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1541.502,1542.521,Where -- where is it?
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1588.945,1592.032,--The likelihood of that event occurring is relatively small.
2008.07-542,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1603.303,1604.088,I got that point.
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1608.707,1611.992,"--It will depend on the circumstances, Your Honor."
2008.07-542,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1612.527,1614.961,I mean are we going to have one of these spectrum things?
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1614.961,1616.729,"--Well, that's exactly the point."
2008.07-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1660.941,1662.208,So -- a fine-line rule.
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1676.667,1677.886,I--
2008.07-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1677.886,1679.069,That's certainly a bright-line rule.
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1679.069,1683.623,--I doubt that -- the hypothetical that someone--
2008.07-542,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1683.623,1695.515,"Well, that's actually a serious point, maybe in your favor because it -- what was worrying me about this is, if you lose the case, there would be policemen who would then let dangerous people stay in the car so they could search it."
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1699.133,1699.967,--We think that that would be the exception.
2008.07-542,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1707.988,1708.972,"--No, nobody would."
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1708.972,1720.896,"Custodial arrests are dangerous in themselves, and this is one step, a reasonable step, that officers can take to secure their safety, among others, in the instance of a custodial arrest on the street."
2008.07-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1720.896,1731.854,But really what's at stake here is the right to search the vehicle for things that are not right out in front at the time he does the custodial arrest.
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1731.854,1734.806,"For instance, like a gun right underneath the seat, which would--"
2008.07-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1734.806,1749.732,"If it was right there, obviously he had a right to search the whole vehicle under the automobile exception, but in the normal case, I don't see why officer safety is an adequate justification for going beyond the authority that it would have under the automobile exception."
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1755.053,1755.986,--May I?
2008.07-542,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1755.986,1756.536,Sure.
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1756.536,1760.207,"Officer safety underlies the Chimel exception, to begin with."
2008.07-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1760.207,1760.84,"I understand Chimel, but--"
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1760.84,1761.757,And Chimel--
2008.07-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1761.757,1762.59,--underlie Ross.
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1762.59,1765.009,"--That's correct, but it's a different doctrine."
2008.07-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.527,1773.365,"My basic question is: Why doesn't that different doctrine apply the bright-line rule, simply administered, that you need?"
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1773.365,1776.217,"--When we're talking about custodial arrest, there are unknown risks."
2008.07-542,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1785.672,1786.607,Thank you Mr. Yang.
2008.07-542,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1786.607,1787.807,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-542,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1787.807,1794.761,Mr. Jacobs.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,1794.761,1803.117,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd first like to address the issue of the historical basis for the Fourth Amendment that was raised earlier."
2008.07-542,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.742,1845.294,Why -- why is that so for searches of the vehicle?
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,1892.008,1908.802,"If the Court, Mr. Justice Scalia, if you're suggesting that a bright-line rule might be adopted that is essentially exactly like the search of person incident to arrest, the problem is that in an arrest situation the police have exclusive dominion and control over the person."
2008.07-542,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.107,1943.807,What's -- what's the history there?
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,1944.84,1946.724,In -- in terms of extension of the car rights?
2008.07-542,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1946.724,1950.176,"Yes, Thomas Jefferson's conveyance--"
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,1950.176,1956.58,"I -- I can refer the case to the LaFave treatise in terms of a complete history upon that, but the Court has always--"
2008.07-542,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.58,1957.147,--There is not much there.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,1957.147,1958.366,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2008.07-542,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.366,1959.249,There is not much there.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,1959.249,1970.007,"The -- the Court has raised a good point, but what we -- what is consistent, whether it's cars or not cars, is the requirement that searches under the Fourth Amendment be supported by warrants or an exception."
2008.07-542,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1970.007,1972.876,But the absence of dominion or control works the other way.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,1986.017,1986.767,The--
2008.07-542,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1986.767,2001.126,"It seems to me that the absence of the dominion and control is -- is just a conclusory statement to explain what happens in the case the person is arrested, but it -- it doesn't seem to me to provide a rationale."
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2001.126,2012.684,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, it explains the difference between a person and something that is not the person, something that is divorced physically from the person, in the same sense that Mr. Chimel's house was separate from his person."
2008.07-542,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2012.684,2015.719,"It actually works the other way, because it means there is more reason to search."
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2019.271,2025.325,"Well, keeping in mind the police have no right to search the car except under delineated exceptions."
2008.07-542,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2026.677,2027.877,That is what they are asking about in this case.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2027.877,2043.888,"--Well, what the Petitioner is asking, Justice Kennedy, is that the Belton rule be interpreted so expansively that it's no longer simply a bright-line rule of what you can search, but it's actually a bright-line rule that removes judicial review from when you can conduct that search."
2008.07-542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2044.688,2050.709,But don't you have to show that there are special circumstances here justifying the overruling of Belton?
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2050.709,2051.876,--No.
2008.07-542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2051.876,2052.911,No?
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2052.911,2054.694,"No, Mr. Justice Alito."
2008.07-542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2060.315,2073.741,"Now, is this a fair summary of the holding of Belton: When a police officer has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest search the passenger compartment of that automobile?"
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2073.741,2076.859,"That is an accurate statement of the holding of Belton, Justice Alito."
2008.07-542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2076.859,2080.411,"And if that rule is applied in this case, you would lose; would you not?"
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2080.411,2081.68,"Well, we do not lose, Justice Alito."
2008.07-542,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2100.725,2103.36,I -- I mean I don't know if it can go off on that.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2124.507,2126.459,There are two views of that.
2008.07-542,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2126.459,2129.577,"Well, I'm sure there are, but what is your opinion?"
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2187.414,2197.036,"Justice Breyer, we are here to focus on exactly the issue of what is contemporaneous and I believe that it's important to focus on exactly what Belton arose out of."
2008.07-542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2219.302,2221.421,What does contemporaneous have to do with officer safety?
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2223.154,2231.109,Well if we consider Justice Alito that officer safety is a function of when you make that assessment.
2008.07-542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2242.6,2247.635,"Let's say when an arrest is made, 25 SWAT team officers are there."
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2258.693,2263.346,If one were to assume a search was conducted at that moment.
2008.07-542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2263.346,2265.512,And they immediately search.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2265.512,2266.762,I'm sorry.
2008.07-542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2266.762,2268.178,And immediately they search.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2268.178,2282.086,"If immediately they search after they have finished restraining the person and there is a defined period between it, be it 30 seconds or minute or 2 minutes, that's not contemporaneous because the reasons supporting that search are not supported by the facts in the exigency."
2008.07-542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2288.906,2292.191,--You're looking at the specific facts of Belton.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2317.173,2332.098,"Mr. Chief Justice we look at Buie, we look at Mincey, we look at Chimel, and in each of those cases this court affirmed that the focus is on the risk posed by the arrestee; in Mincey the court noted that a search conducted to address the immediate risk."
2008.07-542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2332.098,2334.298,--Was that all pre-Belton?
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2334.298,2337.4,Those are not all pre-Belton Your Honor.
2008.07-542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2337.4,2338.4,Which one is not.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2338.4,2342.852,"Mincey was after Belton, Your Honor."
2008.07-542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2342.852,2345.137,Are those all pre-Thornton.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2345.137,2347.772,Those are all pre-Thornton Your Honor.
2008.07-542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2347.772,2355.092,Well the point is that in Thornton of course the guy was handcuffed in the back of the police car and we no less applied Belton.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2355.092,2365.382,"In Belton, your Honor, the Petitioner in this case specifically waived this analysis that we are dealing with in this case but it is true that the arrestee was secured."
2008.07-542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2372.051,2376.836,I guess my question is what is left of the Belton bright-line rule if you prevail.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2376.836,2380.121,"Exactly what was left when it began, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2380.121,2387.608,Well now we have got to have a case by case inquiry to determine whether there is actually in that case a threat to officer safety.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2387.608,2403.819,"If we assume that that assessment is something new, Mr. Chief Justice then we are accepting without a basis Petitioner's interpretation of Belton's bright-line rule as extending beyond simply what is the permissible scope of the search."
2008.07-542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2415.877,2427.148,"The bright-line rule is set out in one sentence which is the sentence that I read to you but if you just assume for the sake of argument that in order to prevail, in order for you to prevail Belton has to be overruled."
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2450.531,2456.685,"--Well Justice Alito stare decisus of course always counts except where we're wrong, now in the case that you are proposing."
2008.07-542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2456.685,2461.053,"--Except if you're wrong, stare decisis comes into play only assuming the decision is wrong."
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2461.053,2461.553,That's correct.
2008.07-542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2467.957,2472.925,That's enough if we think Belton was wrong that's enough for overruling it.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2472.925,2493.588,Yes and if the court is considering it Mr. Justice Alito if we would like me to answer the question assuming we should overrule Belton why we should do it the answer is that Chimel provides us with sufficient tools for officers to protect their safety in the field because we recall there are other exceptions to automobile searches which are based on actual grounds.
2008.07-542,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2493.588,2505.396,Well are you saying do you have any in my own mind perhaps differently from you I think that the stare decisus is really brought into play when you think the earlier decision was wrong.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2505.396,2506.212,Yes.
2008.07-542,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2506.212,2519.953,And at that point I'd still need a reason why you should depart from that earlier decision at the moment what the other side says is we tell our police a simple thing.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2550.306,2561.946,"I understand, Justice Breyer, and the answer is that -- two things: One, and first and foremost, Belton's general assumption, which is essentially required for the application of the bright-line rule, is empirically not true."
2008.07-542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2588.664,2592.251,Just not to get back -- Mincey was 1978.
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2593.518,2594.818,"Yeah, I misspoke then."
2008.07-542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2599.421,2601.69,"Yes, but I'm trying to see -- you cited three cases."
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2607.074,2612.728,"--If Mincey was, then I would hazard a guess that the other three were as well, Your Honor, except for Buie."
2008.07-542,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2617.882,2628.924,"Of course, one of the really contentious issues at the time Belton decided is whether you can search containers in the back in the passenger part of the car."
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2657.474,2659.543,"I would agree with that statement, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-542,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2689.462,2701.103,"You are not asking to overrule Belton; you are asking to take it in the context in which it was presented, where there was genuine concern for officer safety."
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2701.753,2703.972,"Justice Ginsburg, that is exactly correct."
2008.07-542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2706.424,2712.578,"Just to explore that, that does seem to me to be overruling Belton to the extent Belton adopted a bright-line rule."
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2721.434,2726.735,"Mr. Chief Justice, and I'm not being articulate enough, I think, because I keep coming back to the same thing."
2008.07-542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2759.64,2766.212,"So you think after Belton -- you think after Belton, we still have to look and see what's reaching distance on a case-by-case basis?"
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2766.212,2778.27,"Belton only requires that if the passenger compartment of the vehicle is arguably within the reach of an arrestee who was a recent occupant, that the police may contemporaneously search the passenger compartment without regard for how far."
2008.07-542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2778.27,2780.086,"I don't understand that part: ""Arguably within the reach""."
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2791.494,2792.78,Belton--
2008.07-542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2792.78,2799.017,Do you think Belton kept the requirement that the person be arguably within the reach of the compartment?
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2799.017,2800.567,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2845.497,2851.401,What about the situation where there are multiple occupants but there's probable cause to arrest only one of the occupants?
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2851.401,2864.625,"The consistent holdings of this Court, in analyzing this type of situation under the Fourth Amendment, have held that the arrestee is the focus of the inquiry into determining whether there is an exemption to the Fourth Amendment requirement."
2008.07-542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2874.997,2880.551,Isn't that going to be -- aren't cases like that going to be difficult calls as to whether there's officer safety concerns?
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2880.551,2881.235,No.
2008.07-542,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2886.139,2889.823,"One person is arrested, three people who were occupants are not arrested."
2008.07-542,2,42881,thomas_f_jacobs,,2900.631,2909.07,"--Officers have -- well, first of all, again, the focus for the analysis is on the danger from the arrestee, and we know that from Buie and the many cases that go with it."
2008.07-542,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2951.297,2951.897,"Thank you, counsel."
