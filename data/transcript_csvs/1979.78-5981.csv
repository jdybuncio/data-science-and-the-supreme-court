1979.78-5981,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.278,We will hear arguments first this morning in Ferri against Ackerman.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,12.241,15.245,Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please the Court.
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,251.12,271.529,"If we should agree with you on the first premise, that they were wrong in believing that Federal Common Law was applicable, I suppose the appropriate action on the part of this Court would then be to remand the case to the Pennsylvania courts for them to decide it under state law, would it not?"
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,271.529,291.013,"Yes, that is what the Petitioner seeks and I think that is what -- even if the Court decides the question on the second issue and concludes that there is Federal Common Law but that Federal Common Law does not afford immunity, I think that the question of state law and whether state law affords immunity will be open nevertheless."
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,291.013,305.929,"Well, if we agree with the Pennsylvania courts that Federal Common Law is what is governing here, then we would proceed to decide whether or not we agree with them as to what the Federal Common Law is."
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,305.929,306.776,"Well, that is correct and --"
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,306.776,309.278,"And there would be no remand, would there?"
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,309.278,314.098,"Well, I would think, Your Honor, that if this Court concluded that Federal Common Law was applicable --"
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,314.098,314.533,Yes.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,314.533,318.865,"-- and that Federal Common Law afforded no immunity, I think it would still be within the --"
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,318.865,330.535,"Well, then there would be a remand but if we agree with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that Federal Common Law is applicable and that it grants the kind of immunity that Pennsylvania believed it did, that is the end of the case."
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,330.535,331.285,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,331.285,335.128,"Howard against Lyons was a diversity action, was it not?"
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,335.128,335.975,"Yes, it was."
1979.78-5981,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.68,347.354,But -- it was in the federal courts but they were required to apply either some sort of Federal Common Law privilege or the law of the state applicability.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,350.453,356.303,"No, it was purely a diversity, a State Common Law action for defamation."
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,356.303,358.79,So it was akin to this case in that it --
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,358.79,365.543,"Except that that was instituted in the federal court and this was instituted in the state court but aside from that, it is akin to this case."
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,376.929,378.094,It has done what with that question?
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,378.094,380.58,It has that case currently before it now.
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,381.015,382.107,It has not decide it.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,382.107,383.021,That is correct.
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,391.333,392.439,"Where, in the Court of Common Pleas?"
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,393.461,394.966,It has come from the Superior Court.
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,402.867,405.913,On some sort of an interlocutory appeal?
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,405.913,411.702,"No, the lower court dismissed the action on the grounds that there was an absolute immunity under state law."
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,411.702,413.22,And that question is now pending.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,413.22,417.233,"And that question is currently before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, yes."
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,417.233,421.386,That was was an appointed counsel?
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,421.386,422.79,A state public defender.
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,422.79,424.136,In a state court.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,424.136,424.388,That is correct.
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,424.388,425.155,A public defender in a state court.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,425.155,427.475,It is in civil Commitment action.
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,438.309,438.845,Right.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,438.845,442.209,It has subsequently come before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
1979.78-5981,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,442.209,453.957,"The Pennsylvania rule, if it is a state law rule, would not be binding, I suppose, in a 1983 action against this lawyer whom you refer that it is presently pending in the Supreme Court?"
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,453.957,455.944,"No, it definitely would not."
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,471.469,482.235,"What would you say if this involved an employee of the United States, an employee as a public defender?"
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,489.375,495.784,I believe that every district has a mixed plan.
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,495.784,497.514,"Well, what about a public defender?"
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,497.514,498.246,A public defender --
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,498.246,500.106,An employee of the United States.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,500.106,503.941,"A public defender does raise different situations, a different problem."
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,515.876,531.272,"Well, in that case let us assume that the public defender, an employee of the United State, did such a bad job of representing the defendant who was convicted that his conviction was reversed because of -- that he had inadequate counsel."
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,558.23,568.723,"Well, I think that in that particular type of case if it was under Bivens or if it was against the United States' Government under the Federal Court Claims Act, certainly more of an argument could be made that there was a color of law provision."
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,575.18,586.235,"Do you think that if you agree that federal law would govern the public defender, do you think that the rule would apply to his colleague who was just appointed?"
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,586.235,590.266,"Well, I think that the answer in both cases would be that there would be no immunity."
1979.78-5981,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,619.232,634.69,"Under our cases under the Federal Tort Claims Act, is it not reasonably clear that if it is a federal function, it is a discretionary federal function, it would be exempt from any liability on the government as distinguished from the individual."
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,634.69,641.008,"Well, Your Honors, I think that what took place in this particular case is not a question of discretionary judgment."
1979.78-5981,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,643.703,660.804,"Oh, no, no, I did not use discretion in that sense; discretion in the sense that it is used, a discretionary governmental function in the sense that is used under the Federal Tort Claims Act and under our cases relating to that Act and I am only speaking to the liability of the government, not the liability of the individual."
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,660.804,669.075,"Perhaps there would be no liability to the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act but not, I think, on the ground that that individual was not an employee."
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.68,743.047,"If I could change that a little bit, could Congress by statute grant absolute immunity to a Criminal Justice Act-appointed counsel and public defenders and do so consistently with the Constitution, in your view?"
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,743.047,749.259,"Your Honors, I believe that it might be possible."
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,770.37,774.787,"The first question would be one of Congressional power, under the Constitution, would it not?"
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,774.787,776.088,Whether Congress could grant that.
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,779.273,781.471,Under what provision of the Constitution?
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,784.332,787.798,"Well, probably pursuant -- perhaps pursuant to the spending clause."
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.713,831.511,"It may be true that you can talk that way about Congress but if you talk about the United States, the interest of the United States is broader."
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,857.02,858.538,"Well, Your Honor, not entirely."
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.538,866.685,"Well, I am sure it would be if the defendant appealed on the grounds that he had such inadequate counsel that his conviction should be reversed."
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,866.685,869.126,Perhaps under 2255.
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.323,906.078,Would you think that Congress could not prescribe the standards for lawyers who were operating in the federal courts?
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,906.078,908.437,"No, I would have no difficulty with that type of legislation."
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,908.437,912.379,And including those who were appointed to represent indigents.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,912.379,912.768,Certainly I think --
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.768,916.448,And providing for liability if they breach those standards.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,916.448,919.4,Certainly I think that Congress could do that.
1979.78-5981,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,964.415,968.689,Let's back that up with another hypothetical.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,988.208,990.164,I think he would have absolute immunity.
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.843,1074.8,What is your understanding about the obligation of an attorney in your state or in your district to respond to an appointment?
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1084.567,1093.035,"I am not sure, Your Honor, because the present procedures for the Western District of Pennsylvania do not utilize that type of involuntary appointment."
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1093.035,1096.756,"Well, anyone who wants out can get out in your district."
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1096.756,1100.492,"The person would have to volunteer to be put on the list, yes."
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.492,1100.99,I see.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1113.41,1114.034,That is correct.
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1117.291,1126.464,And if he volunteers he then at least purports to be competent to accept and discharge an appointment.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1126.464,1139.716,"Well, that is correct except that the District does engage in a certain type of standards, standard-making themselves in looking into the qualifications of the particular individual and people are, in fact --"
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.716,1143.3,"Well, at least it is not a situation where he says, ""Judge, I just am not a criminal lawyer."
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1147.182,1148.708,That is correct and I believe --
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.708,1151.043,And he purports to be able to satisfy the standard.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1151.043,1152.826,That is correct.
1979.78-5981,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1205.066,1213.219,"It is your position, then, that Pennsylvania could go either way as to immunity in this case as a matter of state law."
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1213.219,1214.726,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1256.7,1261.192,"Mr. Eule, as a matter of Pennsylvania law, what sort of immunity does a judge and a prosecutor get?"
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1261.192,1264.586,"Absolutely the same, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1264.586,1272.981,Do you think there would be a difference between the responsibility of the counsel in a civil case and a criminal case?
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1272.981,1273.561,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1286.174,1288.374,That is a federal right.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1288.374,1289.025,That is correct.
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1331.194,1350.241,"Well, supposing you are counsel for a defendant who is convicted in a federal court and you are suing the lawyer who represented him in the federal court and you are suing him under state law just like in this action and he raises a defense of immunity under state law."
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1355.502,1360.518,"No, indeed, I would think that under Erie that the Federal Court would be bound to --"
1979.78-5981,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1360.518,1361.754,This would not be the Federal Court.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1364.233,1375.056,Then certainly the state creating immunity to a cause of action it itself has create no problems insofar as the choice of law problem.
1979.78-5981,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1417.438,1425.54,Is it your position -- you do not really contend that neither the prosecutor nor the judge owes the defendant in a criminal trial any duty at all?
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1426.163,1435.722,"No, I do not contend that but I do contend that the problem is that there is a conflicting duty there and that the judge's public duty is to decide in the best interests of the public."
1979.78-5981,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1435.722,1439.29,"Well, there are some constraints on counsel representing a client, too."
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1439.29,1446.279,"Well, there certainly are with regard to the disciplinary rules that govern his conduct."
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1600.213,1612.328,"This part of your argument, at this stage in your argument, you are assuming that you lose on the -- and that Federal Common Law is applicable."
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1612.328,1613.737,That is correct.
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1627.816,1628.548,"Yes, yes, yes."
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1636.055,1636.344,"That is correct, yes."
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1636.344,1636.971,-- and now you are arguing that the Federal Common Law --
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1636.971,1642.241,The second issue is not necessarily to be reached if the first is decided.
1979.78-5981,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1642.241,1644.429,Right.
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1644.429,1650.053,"The Federal Government's interest, if any here, is in a standard of care for indigents."
1979.78-5981,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1730.352,1734.75,"But the government does not give MedicAid funds pursuant to the United States Constitution, does it?"
1979.78-5981,0,30166,julian_n_eule,,1734.75,1735.699,That is correct.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,1818.085,1821.724,Mr. Chief Justice and May it Please the Court.
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1889.168,1896.051,"And yet in this case, all this case tells the defense counsel is, ""Be sure and raise your defenses."""
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,1906.706,1916.139,"Your Honor, because that same theory or same set of situations could govern almost all of the activity of the appointed attorney and if he had to guard --"
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1916.139,1919.919,I do not know how many appointed attorneys run up against the statute.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,1922.027,1925.684,But whether or not to plead the statute of limitations --
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1925.684,1927.045,That is what this case is.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,1927.045,1929.232,That is what this case is.
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1929.824,1931.768,And you cannot read that out of this case.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,1931.768,1935.079,"That is correct but it is no more blatant, Your Honor, than --"
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1935.079,1938.646,This man is serving 20 years because of what this man did.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,1938.646,1943.618,"No, the 20 years, Your Honor, was for putting a bomb in a car and injuring someone."
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1947.616,1949.186,"Well, I am wrong on 10 years."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,1949.186,1949.86,Yes.
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1949.86,1952.124,But he got 10 years.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,1952.151,1965.321,"Yes and he has now filed a motion under 2255, as the Reply Brief of Petitioner has shown, which is perfectly capable of curing that error, if, indeed, it be error."
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1976.538,1978.813,"Well, you cannot sue the United States Attorney."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,1978.813,1979.12,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1979.12,1980.538,And you can't sue the judge.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,1980.538,1981.055,And we respectfully submit --
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1981.055,1990.423,"And now you can't -- so in a situation where the judge is asleep, the U.S. Attorney is asleep and the defense counsel is asleep, you have got 10 years coming."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,1990.423,1990.918,"Yes and Your Honor, you --"
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1990.918,1995.043,Is that what this case is?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,1995.043,1997.402,"In that context, certainly, Your Honor, it is."
1979.78-5981,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2021.979,2032.373,"Well, this case, if liability is to be imposed or immunity is to be granted, involves a great deal more than just forgetting about the Statute of Limitations."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2035.756,2037.085,"Yes, indeed, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2094.181,2095.565,Let me give you a hypothetical.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2143.969,2145.036,"Yes, Your Honor, it would."
1979.78-5981,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2145.036,2149.381,Under a holding of liability.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2149.381,2159.454,"If malpractice suits are to be permitted, any grounds which would smack of a counsel giving improper advice would be grounds for that action as a matter of law."
1979.78-5981,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2160.59,2169.463,"Or if the defense counsel decided not to cross-examine a prosecution witness, that might be a basis for a malpractice suit, too."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2169.463,2169.558,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2169.558,2171.64,Is not that true today?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2176.078,2176.914,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2178.323,2182.55,"In all this hypothetical, if it is paid counsel, you can try them for malpractice."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2182.55,2183.097,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2214.876,2218.684,Why is not the privately-paid counsel performing a governmental function?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2225.321,2225.876,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2225.876,2226.915,Is that not so?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2226.915,2233.625,"I think my answer would be, Your Honor, that court has said that that is a constitutional right."
1979.78-5981,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2258.376,2267.331,"But the root of the matter, the root of the matter, that is, the requirement of the presence of counsel stems from the Constitution in both cases, does it not?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2267.331,2271.274,"It does, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.928,2300.88,Mr. Arness?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2300.88,2301.622,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2301.622,2305.308,Could I ask you a couple of questions about the first branch of your adversary's argument?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2315.149,2316.436,We do not.
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2316.436,2316.843,You do not contend --
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2316.843,2318.321,We contend that it is constitutionally required.
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2318.321,2321.704,And you do not contend that it sources any statute?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2321.704,2322.822,It is not the source of any statute.
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.822,2326.823,So there is a Federal Common Law rule on which you rely.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2326.823,2329.727,"It is a rule based upon declared public policy, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2329.727,2342.822,"Now, if it is a Federal Common Law rule independent of statute, would it have applied to court-appointed counsel before the money was appropriated to pay him, you know, a lot of us used to do this sort of work without any money."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2344.548,2345.463,I think it would.
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.758,2347.942,So it really has nothing to do --
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2347.942,2351.263,"-- that that be a function, a governmental function, I think it would."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.263,2355.712,So it really has nothing to do with the fact that the Criminal Justice Act pays these people.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2355.712,2359.999,My friend has argued that all Congress did was provide payment.
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2386.919,2389.26,"But that is irrelevant to the rule, as I understand it."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2389.26,2389.714,I beg your pardon?
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2389.714,2392.352,"If I understand you correctly, that is all irrelevant to the rule."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2394.879,2395.859,That is -- that --
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.859,2412.636,"It would be the same right to immunity if you were appointed by a local bar association pursuant to some committee procedure or something like that and everybody worked free, to defend defendants in criminal cases because it helped the system work."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2412.636,2420.561,The federal court is involved because this attorney was appointed under the Federal Criminal Justice Act in performing a federal governmental function.
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2424.47,2443.287,"Well, no but supposing instead of being appointed under the Federal Criminal Justice Act the Philadelphia Bar Association where they had a committee that young lawyers did this on a volunteer basis and they appointed such a lawyer to defend the defendant in a criminal case, would such a lawyer be entitled to the immunity under the rule that you are advocating that we should recognize?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2444.606,2446.902,"I think so, on the basis of public policy but I believe it was --"
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2446.902,2448.33,"Well, that is all you have got going for you, isn't it?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2450.211,2450.902,That is correct.
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.902,2451.675,Yes.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2451.675,2462.192,We have going for us the public policy considerations which this Court has paid attention to in every case of this kind that has been before the Court.
1979.78-5981,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2486.407,2487.488,Mr. Arness --
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2487.488,2491.951,"-- whether a Criminal Justice Act attorney, appointed under the Federal Act, had immunity or not."
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2494.289,2497.792,"Let's get away from 50 states to one state, Pennsylvania."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2497.792,2498.531,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2498.531,2501.693,"There are two defendants, hypothetical."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2516.384,2518.557,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2518.95,2528.573,"Mr. Arness, I take it from the briefs that neither you nor your opponents think that Barr against Matteo has any bearing in the case."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2531.371,2539.721,"We think Barr against Matteo has been superseded by this Court's decision in Imbler versus Pachtman and in Butz versus Economou, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.721,2541.863,"By ""superseded,"" you mean overruled?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2541.863,2558.56,"No, Your Honor, certain parts of Barr versus Matteo, we contend, are still good law in problems that do not arise to the dignity of constitutional rights, for instance."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.384,2574.401,"Well, I would think -- you are not -- there is no claim in this case that there has been any violation of constitutional right."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2584.363,2585.267,"I think it would, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.034,2593.424,I think your big problem is that federal law controls and that Pennsylvania law has not got anything to do with it.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2593.424,2594.752,"Your Honor, yes."
1979.78-5981,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2613.207,2627.255,What about a case where a defendant chooses to exercise the constitutional right that the Feretta case accorded him and decides to represent himself and the court appoints stand-by counsel?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2634.484,2642.003,"If he is performing a governmental function and he stays within the scope of that governmental function, Your Honor, we respectfully submit that he has absolute immunity."
1979.78-5981,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2642.003,2645.548,And do you think that he is performing a governmental function?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2645.548,2655.909,"If he is appointed under the Criminal Justice Act to perform that service that indigents are constitutionally entitled to, yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2655.909,2661.679,"Well, but are they constitutionally entitled under Ferretta to have stand-by counsel?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2661.679,2680.573,"Well, I think the reason stand-by counsel is appointed, Your Honor, is to provide, even when the defendant does not want to have some semblance of effective assistance of counsel and that is a constitutional right."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.573,2712.451,"Well, let us suppose that a federal defendant is convicted and he claims that his constitutional rights were violated by the inadequate performance of his counsel and his conviction is affirmed, his claim is rejected because in that court the standard for performance is a mockery or a farce."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2714.582,2715.386,"No, it is not."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2715.386,2715.956,What is it?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2715.956,2717.013,"It is not, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2719.168,2730.924,"Well, let's just assume that the standard in the federal courts is farce or mockery and that the lawyer's performance was within that."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2755.653,2756.697,"I am not saying that, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.464,2775.269,"Well, you are saying that he would have an immunity defense to any state law claim."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2775.269,2776.255,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2777.632,2778.885,And that the state is not --
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2778.885,2787.877,Because he -- the liability he is being charged with arose during the course of his performance of a federal governmental function.
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2787.877,2792.179,What possible reason -- what are the reasons for affording immunity?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2795.825,2797.044,Your Honor --
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2797.044,2804.802,"The reason is that you do not want to deter, by a fear of liability, any of the performance of the officer's duty."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2808.607,2809.711,That is one of the reasons.
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2809.932,2811.812,"Now, just apply that to a defense counsel."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2817.568,2827.564,"Well, Your Honor, one of the ready things that comes to mind is, if his involuntary client insists that he --"
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2827.564,2829.47,It is not involuntary.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2829.47,2838.389,"Your Honor, he voluntarily becomes a Criminal Justice Act attorney but once he becomes on that list then he gets an appointment."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2845.605,2846.351,"Now, wait a minute."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2853.493,2863.087,"Your Honor, the standards do not permit him to get out just because he does not like the situation."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2868.618,2877.896,"Nevertheless he has held himself out as being a competent lawyer, competent enough to represent defendants in criminal cases by volunteering."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2880.21,2877.896,That is correct.
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2899.246,2906.107,"All right, well, go ahead, tell me why he is entitled to immunity, what would he be deterred from doing if he did not have immunity?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2906.107,2910.318,There are three reasons.
1979.78-5981,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2929.055,2929.438,Let us put it on a concrete --
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2929.438,2932.201,This would have a dampening effect on his representation.
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2932.201,2935.312,"Well, how does that differ from hired counsel?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2935.312,2952.74,"Hired counsel, because of the voluntary relationship and particularly the right of choice, is chosen because the defendant thinks their judgment is worth having and they are paying for it and they are more prone to follow it and be satisfied with it."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.39,2989.846,"So that he might be tempted to follow his client's requests and orders when, if he were hired counsel, he would not?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,2989.846,2990.388,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2996.546,3000.36,And then what follows from that?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3000.36,3010.083,"What follows from that is that in order to put him in a posture where he can effectively represent and do his duty, immunity should be granted, for that and for two other reasons."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.083,3014.991,"Yes, but suppose he does follow his client's directions where otherwise he would not?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3016.607,3020.967,"If he follows his client's directions, that is the path of the easiest way out."
1979.78-5981,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3032.598,3057.228,"Have there not been occasions where a defense counsel, paid, now, for the moment, a paid defense counsel privately retained, has informed the court out of the hearing of the jury that he has advised the defendant not to take the stand and that he wants the court to know that he has given that advice but the defendant insists on taking the stand."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3069.353,3075.992,"That situation, in its essence, of course is no different, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3086.859,3090.812,Is the fearlessness factor any different in the two?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3098.83,3109.281,"Yes, because the privately-retained attorney can say, ""If you do not want my advice, then here is your money and you can get another lawyer."""
1979.78-5981,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3109.281,3111.967,"Well, but in the middle of a trial, that is not very easy."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3111.967,3116.697,"Well, that should have been worked out long before the middle of the trial, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3135.378,3139.892,"Mr. Arness, I question the basic premise on which you are arguing."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3158.993,3159.665,"Your Honor, the public policy --"
1979.78-5981,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3159.665,3164.361,"I do not think that would be a defense to a malpractice suit to say that ""My client asked me to do this stupid thing."""
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3164.361,3166.769,"I think you are absolutely right, Your Honor but that is not the question."
1979.78-5981,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3191.713,3194.0,"Mr. Arness, one of the costs --"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3194.0,3197.847,-- that the conviction would have happened anyway.
1979.78-5981,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3197.847,3206.917,"One of the costs of taking on cases like this is exposure to the risks of complaints before the Ethics Committee, the Bar Association, malpractice suits, all these sorts of things."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3212.625,3226.604,"Yes and we contend respectfully that post-conviction relief procedures, court disciplinary procedures, Bar Association disciplinary procedures are much better-calculated to handle the situation that can be conjured up."
1979.78-5981,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3256.744,3264.032,"Mr. Arness, you told us earlier that there were three reasons and you gave one and then we hardly gave you an opportunity to talk about the other two."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3265.328,3265.963,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3265.963,3268.255,The 2255 and the disciplinary.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3268.255,3269.336,No.
1979.78-5981,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3278.6,3278.99,Right.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3278.99,3283.407,"And secondly, the recruiting problem."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3324.29,3329.395,"Do you think the actual fear of liability, damages liability, would deter?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3369.008,3370.82,"Yes, Your Honor, he could but --"
1979.78-5981,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3370.82,3373.066,You would not suggest it?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3377.38,3380.633,"Well, we do not believe that the Bivens situation is applicable here."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3408.748,3410.119,"It will do away with his lawsuit, too."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3410.119,3410.562,Pardon?
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3410.562,3412.263,"It will do away with his damages and his lawsuit, too."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3412.263,3418.481,"Yes, it would render this case moot and probably -- either that or it would probably grant him certiorari."
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3418.481,3426.533,"Having rendered his case moot, how would it stop the man from having done the wrong that he allegedly did?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3426.533,3431.158,"Your Honor, that should be done by courts and by Bar Associations disciplinary procedures."
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3431.158,3437.069,"Well, why have malpractice at all?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3437.069,3438.59,"Well, Your Honor --"
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3438.59,3441.464,You want malpractice on one but not the other.
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3441.464,3444.792,"I can only argue immunity on the basis of governmental function, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3444.792,3448.78,"Well, do you support malpractice for private attorneys?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3448.78,3449.612,"Yes, I do."
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3449.612,3451.161,Do you think that is fine?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3451.161,3459.624,"I think malpractice is--as a form of civil relief--is fine when a governmental function is not involved, and when public policy does not contraindicate it."
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3459.624,3464.231,You don't consider a private attorney as performing a governmental function?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3464.231,3465.095,I do not.
1979.78-5981,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3465.095,3468.949,Did you ever read the oath that you took?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3468.949,3469.97,"I hope so, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3471.462,3472.359,Mr. Arness?
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3472.359,3473.479,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3473.479,3488.344,"Does the record show, or do you happen to know, what an individual officer of the court would have to pay as a premium for malpractice insurance now, assuming he were regularly defending criminal defendants pursuant to appointment?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3488.344,3491.117,"I do not know, but I assume it would be high."
1979.78-5981,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3502.997,3516.829,"Well, why do you give that point away so quickly, if you were a sole practitioner, didn't have a law firm to provide malpractice insurance, would you rush to volunteer to defend these cases?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3516.829,3518.954,"No, and I don't give it away too quickly, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3524.777,3526.429,If you have the funds--
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3526.429,3527.95,"If you can afford it, yes."
1979.78-5981,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3527.95,3532.069,"Doctors, I understand, are paying, $20-, $25,000 a year premium."
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3532.069,3532.945,Yes.
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3543.397,3553.654,"Mr. Arness, do you happen to know how many states there's a rule in cases like this that the criminal defendant in order to recover in a malpractice action has to prove that he was innocent?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3557.963,3562.343,"Your Honor, I think the substantial weight and the authority requires that in a malpractice action."
1979.78-5981,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3573.217,3582.535,"There's a pretty large proportion of these cases where the plaintiff in the malpractice action could never carry that burden of proof, as a practical matter?"
1979.78-5981,1,28876,john_p_arness,,3582.535,3585.818,"I think it would be very, very difficult, Your Honor."
1979.78-5981,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3613.632,3614.496,"Thank you, gentlemen."
