1972.71-839,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1008.053,1029.353,"I suppose it is reasonably assumed isn't it Mr. Grubb that Congress was well aware that there were highly specialized newspapers as you kept your eyes this bulletin that catered particularly to people who were betting and to organized gambling, isn't that, accurate?"

1972.71-839,0,18971,charles_w_grubb,,1054.881,1084.783,"That is right and I think that these -- Section 1953, be the latest in the statute should control, I believe does control that the two seconds must be construed impaired material and I cited the what I think is a leading case on that and I believe that altered them Section 1952 to the extent it was not to be -- that it was a exempt for use."

1972.71-839,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1368.737,1377.077,"Mr. Tuttle, I don't suppose this is really bears on the statute, but is that all the kind of information a scratch sheet contains, is just what horses have been scratched?"
1972.71-839,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1377.077,1377.267,Oh!
1972.71-839,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1389.523,1392.888,But the reason it's called the scratch sheet is because it has the scratch information?
1972.71-839,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1392.888,1396.989,"That's right, but that's only one aspect of the information which is contained."

1972.71-839,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2091.629,2113.488,"If this material which is in this sheet, racing sheet that you have got was a special column on the sports page of a conventional newspaper and was transported in the ordinary course of sending thousands of them to Philadelphia or Richmond or somewhere else."
1972.71-839,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,2116.937,2117.063,Oh!
1972.71-839,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2131.358,2134.302,So it has to be connected that with some other activity?
1972.71-839,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,2134.302,2145.109,"Well, again it depends -- the act requires that it be shipped with a given purpose to promote an unlawful activity and requires also that act of the shipment is used to promote the unlawful activity."
1972.71-839,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2145.109,2159.601,"Well, if these are the same gentleman have, then purchase to 'x' a hundred of them and sent them by a special courier and delivered them to people in furtherance of this, then that would violate this statute in your --"
1972.71-839,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,2159.601,2167.032,"No question about it, in our view, assuming of course, that they were then used in furtherance of the unlawful activity."
1972.71-839,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2244.109,2244.98,"Thank you, Mr. Tuttle."
1972.71-839,2,18971,charles_w_grubb,,2249.246,2250.657,"I have no further, Your Honor."
