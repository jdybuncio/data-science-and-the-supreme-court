1969.300,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.617,"-- Tooahnippah, Atewooftakewa Tate and others against Hickel."
1969.300,0,37495,omer_luellen,,14.212,30.613,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1969.300,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,414.025,415.807,"That's not challenged by anyone, is it?"
1969.300,0,37495,omer_luellen,,415.807,417.21,No.
1969.300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,552.703,556.528,"There were what some five, at least five previous wills?"
1969.300,0,37495,omer_luellen,,556.528,557.99,"Right, Your Honor."
1969.300,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,557.99,568.9,"And normally, when a will is set aside for some reason or another you go back to the next previews will but that (Voice Overlap) he just set aside all of them."
1969.300,0,37495,omer_luellen,,568.9,570.54,He set all of them.
1969.300,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1736.049,1745.153,"Now, the Government's position Mr. Chief Justice is that this is an unreviewable power under Section 2 of the 1910 Act."
1969.300,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1765.843,1768.483,"Is that a question on merits, Mr. Stone?"
1969.300,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1770.056,1771.28,"Yes, I believe it is."
1969.300,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1771.28,1773.631,And that's just not reached by the Court of Appeals?
1969.300,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1773.631,1774.822,That question was not reached by --
1969.300,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1774.822,1777.601,Why does the Government has to reach?
1969.300,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1786.169,1792.323,"Well, I think that is a possible disposition of the case and it would understandable if the Court chose to decide this way."
1969.300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1809.976,1816.991,Would you think if the Court of Appeals having thought it had no jurisdiction at all?
1969.300,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,1823.753,1846.33,"I think it would be helpful Mr. Chief Justice if the Court of Appeals were given some standard of review and I think that the standard that they should be given is a very broad one that the Secretary has extremely wide powers in this area, and that a reversal would only be in order if the Secretary had grossly abused his scope of discretion."
1969.300,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2007.929,2032.569,"Mr. Stone, looking at the brief filed by the Solicitor General, he's posed two narrow questions whether the Section 372, that was apparently with 373 is final and conclusive posture or status to his decision and whether he may take equitable considerations into account now."
1969.300,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2041.271,2043.679,"Well, I'm about to that Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2190.339,2197.596,How about the answer to -- how about Mr. Justice White's question?
1969.300,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2209.405,2215.448,"No, the Secretary as far as I'm awareness no right to disapprove any disposition of that other property at all."
1969.300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2215.448,2217.598,"So, if he owns both kinds of property --"
1969.300,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2217.598,2219.536,The restrictions run only to the --
1969.300,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2219.536,2220.513,Allotted?
1969.300,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2220.513,2230.823,Both inter vivos and testamentary restrictions run only to the restricted property and of course tied in to the conveyance of the restricted property at the time the allotment is made.
1969.300,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2230.823,2235.1,Is that regardless of whether he's on the reservation on that?
1969.300,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2235.1,2240.815,I believe that it is regardless of whether he's on the reservation or not.
1969.300,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.815,2254.637,"Well, would I'd be correct in saying that Chief Judge -- former Chief Judge the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma Judge Barefoot couldn't make a will, because he was full-blooded Choctaw Indian?"
1969.300,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2254.637,2256.839,I'm not aware of any reason why he couldn't make a will Mr. Justice Marshall.
1969.300,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2256.839,2259.058,"Well, would it have to be approved by the Secretary?"
1969.300,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2259.058,2263.381,Only with respect to restricted property that he held an allotted restricted property.
1969.300,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2263.381,2266.818,He still would have to be approved by the Secretary?
1969.300,1,40553,richard_b_stone,,2266.818,2278.15,"Yes, I assume the Secretary in the case of such a testator would give great weight to the testator's will and would assume that the disposition that he made of the property was improvident."
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3463.004,3467.372,Mr. Chief Justice and Honorable Justices of this Court.
1969.300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3537.251,3552.067,"But the same statutory provisions in most states which give what is sometimes called the dower right to the surviving widow also give virtually unrestricted power of the testator to omit his children if he wants to, is that not true?"
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3552.067,3553.699,"Yes, sir."
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3570.825,3571.846,Who did you represent?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3571.846,3575.908,I represented Dorita High Horse and some of the other nieces and nephews.
1969.300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3747.637,3754.64,"Well, what relation if any -- and was there between that beneficiary and the decedent?"
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3754.64,3755.743,She was a niece.
1969.300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3755.743,3756.429,A niece.
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3756.429,3769.572,And then he made a will to a white man and then next he made a will to Sammy Schweitzer who runs a grocery store there.
1969.300,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3805.119,3807.712,Of what period time he made the six wills?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3807.712,3811.13,From 1956 to 1963.
1969.300,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3825.835,3828.632,"Well, isn't that what the lawyer draws the last will?"
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3828.632,3832.575,Yes that's true and the Government lawyer draws all these wills Your Honor and he testified --
1969.300,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3832.575,3834.554,Draws six of them?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3834.554,3836.823,"Well, somebody in there drew all at six of them."
1969.300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3869.979,3871.165,Who was Fred Benjie?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3871.165,3871.593,Sir?
1969.300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3871.593,3873.482,Who was Fred Benjie?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3873.482,3874.585,"Now that was a white man, I don't know too much about him."
1969.300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3874.585,3875.945,That's another white man.
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3875.945,3876.567,"Yes, sir."
1969.300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3876.567,3877.192,And so was a forger?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3877.192,3887.749,"Alright, but all the evidence was if the Court please that this Indian was an alcoholic and he would do anything to get a drink --"
1969.300,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3887.749,3896.272,"Well, if the Government lawyer who drew this will wasn't he required to find out whether the man was capable?"
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3896.272,3898.816,"Yes, but normally --"
1969.300,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3898.816,3901.097,Did he raise the question at all?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3901.097,3904.467,"He didn't raise the question at all, Your Honor."
1969.300,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3904.467,3906.225,He drew six wills?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3906.225,3907.085,"Yes, sir."
1969.300,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3907.085,3908.854,He talked to them at least six times --
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3908.854,3909.613,"No, no."
1969.300,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3914.212,3915.391,But he would be a government lawyer?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3915.391,3917.78,At least the officials change from time to time in the office.
1969.300,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3917.78,3919.519,"Well, they're all government lawyers?"
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3919.519,3923.029,"Yes sir, well it could be or it could have been somebody else down there."
1969.300,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3927.318,3930.386,"Well, did he represent the Government?"
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3930.386,3930.622,"Yes, sir."
1969.300,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3930.622,3935.62,And the Government had the responsibility of finding out whether this man was apparently --
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3935.62,3936.112,"Yes, sir."
1969.300,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3936.112,3937.032,-- capable?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3937.032,3938.799,"Yes sir, may I test --"
1969.300,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3938.799,3942.108,Obviously he was apparently capable?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3942.108,3949.979,Obviously and as they testified that they had no independent recollection when he came in the office to execute this last will.
1969.300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3949.979,3951.776,"Well, that issue is not before us now?"
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3951.776,3953.535,"No sir, it really isn't Your Honor."
1969.300,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3953.914,3955.244,Law forbids you --
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3955.244,3955.864,Sir?
1969.300,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3955.864,3960.946,Can this law fobid you by the solicitor or by the trial?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3960.946,3964.27,Well the Trial Examiner did hold Your Honor.
1969.300,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3964.27,3965.634,They found his property?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3965.634,3967.26,"Yes sir, they have found his property --"
1969.300,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3967.26,3967.835,(Inaudible)?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3967.835,3969.766,"That is right sir, yes sir."
1969.300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3988.585,3990.031,But it's not before us now?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,3990.031,4000.199,"No, sir and as a matter of fact when he was with this last beneficiary on the will, this Viola Atewooftakewa and children and the family."
1969.300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4015.123,4017.941,"But there's no evidence he ever live with his daughter, is there?"
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4017.941,4019.689,"No sir, there is not sir."
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4021.222,4025.394,Is there certain evidence that she is his daughter?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4025.394,4058.35,"There is substantial evidence, Your Honor that she was his legitimate daughter and under Section 371, I think it is, that where the cohabit that the Indian's cohabit and there are 0offsprings that for all intents and purposes that offspring is a legitimate child and the Examiner of Inheritance -- I mean the Secretary of the Interior acting by and through the Solicitor General so held that Dorita High Horse was the natural daughter of George Chahsenah who was a testator of his will."
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4058.35,4060.046,Suppose that there can be no doubt --
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4060.046,4061.22,That's right and other --
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4061.22,4063.521,There's no doubt that she is his daughter.
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4063.521,4064.731,Yes sir and under Section 372 --
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4064.731,4068.017,And part of the property (Voice Overlap) or all of it went to her --
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4068.017,4068.105,Sir?
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4068.105,4070.373,Part of the property or all of it went to her --
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4070.373,4071.255,"That's right, yes sir."
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4071.255,4072.475,An Indian?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4072.475,4076.959,"Yes, when this will was vacated and set aside."
1969.300,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4105.049,4113.546,But one thing at all these wills had in common was that they showed a very clear intention not to make Dorita High Horse the object to his bounty.
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4113.995,4115.979,"Well, at least she wasn't mentioned."
1969.300,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4122.83,4126.608,"And if he died and tested, I suppose she would've been sole heir."
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4126.608,4128.3,"She would've been the sole heir, yes."
1969.300,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4128.3,4136.613,"And the so, probably no one conceive the sole purpose of making a will was to see to it that she did not inherit his property, is that right?"
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4136.613,4144.969,"Not necessarily though I think this all purpose of making a will was to going to get some money and buy some liquor, (Voice Overlap) Your Honor."
1969.300,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4144.969,4147.62,If he hadn't made any will she would've have --
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4147.62,4152.363,"If he hadn't made the will, she would've been the one to inherit all these property, yes sir."
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4235.768,4242.205,"If your argument is accepted, does that settle who will get his property?"
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4242.205,4245.257,Yes it would Your Honor but I think here and I think the Court here --
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4245.257,4247.6,Who will get it?
1969.300,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4247.6,4249.772,Justice Black has a question.
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4249.772,4251.555,Who would get it?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4251.555,4252.47,Who would get this?
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4252.47,4253.733,"Yes, the property?"
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4253.733,4254.077,In the event --
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4254.077,4259.226,If you say this is finally settled and in case your argument is accepted?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4259.226,4262.349,"Dorita High Horse, the daughter would get the property if my argument is accepted, Your Honor."
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4262.349,4263.803,That's the legitimate child?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4263.803,4284.923,"And I want to bring this out and since this case has been in litigation, this Viola Atewooftakewa who was the niece is deceased now and the one of the other beneficiary, one of the other nephews, your grant nephew is also deceased so that only two children left."
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4284.923,4287.502,Does the record show how much of his property it would?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4287.502,4288.24,Sir?
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4288.24,4290.114,Does the record show how much this Indian have?
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4290.114,4296.145,Yes it does and it probably would in this -- and the Court here but before it went to the Circuit Court of Appeals it did show.
1969.300,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4296.145,4298.604,"If you could just tell us as an aside, couldn't you?"
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4298.604,4307.204,"Well, I would say this property is worth in the neighborhood of $50,000.00 to $100,000.00 because he's got some production on it if the Court please."
1969.300,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4307.204,4309.155,"$34,000.00 --"
1969.300,2,27228,houston_bus_hill,,4309.155,4310.173,"Yes, sir."
1969.300,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4310.173,4311.554,"That's the one, that's the official value."
