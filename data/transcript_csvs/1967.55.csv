1967.55,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.724,"Thomas Earl Simmons et al., Petitioners, versus United States."
1967.55,0,40526,raymond_j_smith,,10.484,16.318,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court."
1967.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,347.583,349.396,Were the pictures mug shots or just --?
1967.55,0,40526,raymond_j_smith,,349.396,355.272,"No, they were snapshots, Your Honor taken from the sister and sister-in-law of these two men."
1967.55,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,355.272,357.762,Didn't one of the witnesses say there were 50 or more pictures?
1967.55,0,40526,raymond_j_smith,,357.762,371.171,"Yes they did, Your Honor but as I will try to point out because of the circumstances of the case and because of what all the other witnesses said, I think she was mistaken in what she had said."
1967.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,418.73,421.299,Why do you say that it violated due process?
1967.55,0,40526,raymond_j_smith,,421.299,436.243,"It violated due process, Your Honor, because the police authority in this case the Federal Bureau of Investigation was focusing the attention of these witnesses on a particular suspect in this case of Simmons."
1967.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,436.243,437.949,Did you see the pictures?
1967.55,0,40526,raymond_j_smith,,437.949,438.808,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1967.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,438.808,440.529,Because they let them see the pictures?
1967.55,0,40526,raymond_j_smith,,440.529,446.688,"Not because they let them see the pictures because they -- well, yes they let them see the pictures and they used more than one of them."
1967.55,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,446.688,450.707,Suppose they had let them see the man itself.
1967.55,0,40526,raymond_j_smith,,450.707,457.139,"Under the circumstances of a proper lineup, it would not have been a violation of due process, Your Honor."
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1829.607,1832.946,May it please the Court.
1967.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2114.988,2131.567,"Mr. Solicitor General, what do you think the record reflects regarding the number of photographs shown to the bank witnesses and as well, how many different persons?"
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2131.567,2135.626,"Well, actually, we have no very good information about that."
1967.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2171.551,2177.541,"Does it appear that except for those group photographs, any of the photographs were people other than Simmons and Andrews?"
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2177.541,2192.037,"No, it does not appear that any of them were but let me point out again that this was on the afternoon of the holdup and when the pictures are obtained, these were available."
1967.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2343.967,2362.884,"Mr. Solicitor General, on that premise namely that they do not come within the producible statements as defined in the Jencks Act itself, Will that suggest the possibility that they might be producible within the principles of the Jencks case?"
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2362.884,2368.55,It seems to me that the producibility is not confined to the Jencks Act.
1967.55,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2458.799,2468.204,Was it just an abstract question as to whether this were -- came under the Jencks Act or did they argue in the Court --
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2468.204,2474.353,"No, the only question that was ever raised at the trial was whether this came under the Jencks Act."
1967.55,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2474.353,2479.978,Not the merits of whether they ought to be entered.
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2479.978,2506.62,That has not been brought into the case until the brief in this Court and the argument here where a general Fifth Amendment and a supervisory oversight of the Court has been referred to but the argument made in the District Court was confined solely to appearance -- to production under the Jencks Act.
1967.55,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2506.62,2508.192,How about the Court of Appeals?
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2511.183,2519.141,I don't believe so but I'm not entirely familiar with the brief which were filed in the Court of Appeals.
1967.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2526.436,2541.316,Did the defendant state to the trial court any reason to tell the judge why these pictures would be relevant or if to include that in this case?
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2541.316,2542.564,"I think not, Your Honor."
1967.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2581.302,2592.869,"It was not in the case, can you think of any conceivable benefits that they have to find relevant for him to have those pictures?"
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2592.869,2624.117,"I -- if the pictures have been mug shots, if they had themselves been suggestive in some way or another, I can imagine how it could have been useful in the cross-examination but there is no suggestion that the pictures were anything of that sort and the evidence is to the contrary, the evidence is that they were snapshots and that they were obtained from the sister of one of the defendants out of her elbow."
1967.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2624.117,2628.345,Is there any evidence at all that there were anything except known pictures?
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2628.345,2640.543,"There is no evidence whatever that they were anything except snapshots, and to some extent the group pictures but it isn't known who all the persons were in the groups."
1967.55,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2640.543,2645.027,I wonder why the judge wouldn't let them see the pictures so --
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2645.027,2646.727,"I think, Your Honor because --"
1967.55,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2646.727,2654.585,I understood that the prosecution was willing to produce the pictures but the Court said no.
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2654.585,2658.826,I think the problem was to find the pictures.
1967.55,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2679.838,2689.409,Am I wrong on my recollection that the prosecution showed the pictures to the witnesses the day before the trial?
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2689.409,2693.082,"No, I think it was no longer before the trial than that but --"
1967.55,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2693.082,2694.382,"Well, how long?"
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2695.753,2697.327,Matter of days.
1967.55,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2697.327,2698.582,Why would they disperse it?
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2698.582,2708.818,"I don't know, Your Honor."
1967.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.963,2944.57,"What if, Mr. Solicitor -- what if the lady had said why those suitcases belong to Mr. Garrett or is that right?"
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2944.57,2946.705,Garrett
1967.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2946.705,2951.09,But they are here in my house and you certainly may search them.
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2951.09,2955.552,I've suppose that would come within the Jones case.
1967.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2970.274,2980.661,"Well, what if -- what if she said no, “I don't know whose suitcases these are” but what if the police knew whose they were?"
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2984.164,2986.497,There's no evidence here that the police did know --
1967.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2986.497,2991.186,What if they did?
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2991.186,2997.063,"If she gives permission for them to be taken, I find it difficult to see that -"
1967.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2997.063,3011.384,Why -- why shouldn't the Constitution protect the facts as well as the house or some -- some living quarters?
1967.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3011.384,3011.765,Why the police --
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3011.765,3011.97,If --
1967.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3011.97,3019.604,-- have no right to get into that suitcase do they -- just because it happens to be in somebody else's house?
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3019.604,3025.601,"If the suitcases found on the public highway, I suppose it can be taken without a search warrant."
1967.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3025.601,3026.849,If it's been abandoned?
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3026.849,3034.532,If it's been abandoned then it might well be regarded that the suitcase under all the circumstances had been abandoned.
1967.55,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3044.519,3046.618,There was no evidence that he lived there?
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3046.618,3052.355,There was no evidence that he lived there or that he had any relationship whatever with the premises.
1967.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3400.522,3408.699,Is this where the contents -- is this the one Mr. Solicitor General where the contents were the bank wrappers or something money wrappers?
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3408.699,3413.196,But there is nothing to connect it with Garrett or anyone else.
1967.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3413.196,3414.759,What were the contents?
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3414.759,3420.315,"The contents were clothes and some money wrappers, I believe."
1967.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3422.623,3423.835,"The robbery, yes."
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3423.835,3427.308,But they were not connected with any of the defendant --
1967.55,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3427.308,3429.254,Any of the defendants at all?
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3429.254,3431.373,Not any of the defendants at all.
1967.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3431.373,3442.877,Do you think they -- you think there was a probable cause to -- do you think the officers could have shown probable cause to search the suitcases?
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3450.998,3457.149,It's not clear to me that they could under the facts which were no longer them at the time --
1967.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3457.149,3458.191,-- or the house either?
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3458.191,3468.801,Or whether this comes within a hot pursuit situation like that in Warden against Hayden.
1967.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3497.648,3509.81,"Yes, but if Warden against Hayden doesn't relieve the necessity for having probable cause or for getting a warrant except in an extraordinary circumstances?"
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3509.81,3520.932,"Well, what I'm trying to suggest is that Warden against Hayden might have been enough to show that there were the extraordinary circumstances here."
1967.55,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3536.77,3560.475,"May I ask you Mr. Solicitor General, suppose -- suppose he had a valid Fourth Amendment point and suppose the Court sustained it, would the statement that he made at the suppression hearing be usable before the jury?"
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3560.475,3572.395,The testimony that he owned the contents of the suitcase was not relevant as I see it to his Fourth Amendment point.
1967.55,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3577.164,3582.779,"Now, I beg your pardon but I'm really trying to get at a little different point."
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3620.441,3634.325,I would suppose that -- that in so far as the evidence he gave at the suppression hearing was relevant to the question of suppression that it would not be admissible at the trial.
1967.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3634.325,3638.103,Why not?
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3638.103,3639.482,"I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1967.55,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3639.482,3641.205,"Why not, Mr. Solicitor General?"
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3643.661,3654.91,Because then there would be a heavy barrier against the making of the claim under the Fourth Amendment.
1967.55,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3704.569,3708.799,May I ask you just to put a square case on.
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3762.263,3766.225,I think I was wrong in saying that.
1967.55,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3799.09,3810.956,"You go back to the point, I assume, that but it was not compelled to be given, he chose to give it in a proceeding that was to his own advantage to testify."
1967.55,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3810.956,3819.338,That would be the position and that is the view which has been taken by a considerable number of lower federal courts.
1967.55,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3819.338,3825.748,"Mr. Smith, your time has expired but I would like to ask you -- I would like to ask you a question or so."
1967.55,2,40526,raymond_j_smith,,3825.748,3826.422,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.55,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3826.422,3831.743,"On the constitutionality issue that you raised here, was that raised in the trial court?"
1967.55,2,40526,raymond_j_smith,,3831.743,3834.031,It was raised in the Court of Appeals Your Honor --
1967.55,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3834.031,3835.612,Was it raised in the trial court?
1967.55,2,40526,raymond_j_smith,,3835.612,3851.697,"Only in the sense that on the motion for judgment of the Court to let the close of all the evidence if this motion was -- if this evidence was obtained in violation of the due process then there would be no other evidence left but per se, it was not raised --"
1967.55,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3851.697,3852.77,It was not argued?
1967.55,2,40526,raymond_j_smith,,3852.77,3853.986,It was not argued as far as this --
1967.55,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3853.986,3855.69,The Jencks Act was argued?
1967.55,2,40526,raymond_j_smith,,3855.69,3856.715,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.55,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3856.715,3859.305,Was it in your briefs in the Court of Appeals?
1967.55,2,40526,raymond_j_smith,,3859.305,3860.388,"It's certainly was, Your Honor."
1967.55,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3860.388,3861.692,Did the Court pass on it?
1967.55,2,40526,raymond_j_smith,,3861.692,3862.306,Yes it did.
1967.55,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3862.306,3863.207,In what language?
1967.55,2,40526,raymond_j_smith,,3886.521,3891.082,"There is nothing in the opinion that speaks specifically of the due process question, Your Honor."
1967.55,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3910.04,3912.9,It was specifically raised as it is in this Court?
1967.55,2,40526,raymond_j_smith,,3912.9,3913.839,"Definitely, Your Honor."
1967.55,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3913.839,3914.613,The same --
1967.55,2,40526,raymond_j_smith,,3914.613,3915.652,Yes it was.
