2014.14-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.185,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case No. 14-144, John Walker v. The Texas Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Mr. Keller."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,10.185,16.895,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Messages on Texas license plates are government speech."
2014.14-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,50.275,68.365,"Well, one of -- one of the problems with the scheme is it's a nebulous standard: Would it be regarded as offensive to many people? I mean, is it government speech to say ""Mighty fine burgers"" to advertise a product?"
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,68.365,71.06,"The government -- yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.14-144,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,94.655,109.84,"Suppose Texas erected 500 electronic billboards around the State, and on those billboards they posted some government messages, wear your seatbelt when you're driving, for example."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,116.32,129.35,"Justice Alito, I think the portion that the government had final approval authority and sole control over, that would be government speech. If the government, though, doesn't have sole control or final approval authority over another portion, I think that could be --"
2014.14-144,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,129.35,133.715,"No, the bottom, the government has the same kind of approval authority that it has here."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,142.7,153.95,It would be government speech under -- I think the best reading of both Summum and Johanns together is precedent; that you have final approval authority when the government isn't abridging other traditional free speech rights. But even if that weren't the test --
2014.14-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,153.95,154.6,"But, I'm sorry."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,190.97,194.84,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, if you went on Summum, the Court indicated that --"
2014.14-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,194.84,196.07,That's the monument case.
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,197.725,218.61,"That -- that -- that's right. And in Summum though, the -- a private organization, the Fraternal Order of Eagles, put its name on the monument. It created the message; it then donated it to the park. In Johanns, yes, the government did create a program to espouse the message, ""Beef, it's what's for dinner,"" but even then, as the Court recognized the Secretary of Agriculture didn't write ad copy."
2014.14-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,254.91,255.31,Mr. Keller --
2014.14-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,255.31,265.0,"Well, do you want -- do you want us to hold that because it's government speech, the government can engage in viewpoint discrimination? Is that what I'm supposed to write?"
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,265.0,269.3,"That's right, Justice Kennedy. And the Court has recognized that in Summum and in Johanns."
2014.14-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,269.3,280.52,"And does that have any limits, Mr. Keller? I mean, suppose somebody submitted a license plate to Texas that said, ""Vote Republican,"" and -- and Texas said, yes, that's fine."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,290.45,294.9,"Yeah, Justice Kagan, I don't think our position would necessarily allow that, but I think that doesn't have --"
2014.14-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,294.9,296.06,But why -- why wouldn't it allow that?
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,296.06,301.44,"Because the Establishment Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, Due Process Clause, other independent constitutional bars could apply."
2014.14-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,301.77,303.64,"Well, this is not an Establishment Clause issue."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,314.63,315.75,"Absolutely, Justice Kagan."
2014.14-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,327.62,341.125,"I think all you have to say is -- is whatever prevents Texas itself in all of its other activities, never mind license plates, from saying vote Republican, right?"
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,341.125,341.74,Absolutely.
2014.14-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,341.85,352.485,"Then you put the same question: What stops Texas from -- from saying, in all of its election literature that it passes out, vote Republican? I think something prevents that."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,356.61,360.84,"That's correct, Justice Scalia, which is why that issue is -- is one of government speech in general."
2014.14-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,371.06,381.63,"Well, what -- what's the -- what case do you want me to read to show that the government can engage in viewpoint discrimination when it's its own speech? It's the monument cases?"
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,381.63,383.025,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2014.14-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,384.83,397.81,"Is this -- is this a case where the State, the government, has aided in creating a new kind of public forum? People don't go to parks anymore."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,411.135,426.0,"I don't think it's a public forum for private speech for -- for various reasons. The Court has never recognized a public forum for private speech when the government places its name on the message, when it completely controls the message in the forum, when it is receiving notice and comment from the public --"
2014.14-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,426.0,433.335,"No, but that's circular. The whole question is whether you -- whether you can control the message."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,435.565,442.63,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I think the Court has looked at governmental intent to determine whether there's a public forum for private speech."
2014.14-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,452.72,463.445,"I'm not quite sure why it's government speech since it's -- there's no clear, identifiable policy -- at least it's arguable there's none -- that the State is articulating."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,465.425,474.46,"Mr. Chief Justice, a singular programmatic message I don't think can be part of any administrable test for government because government must speak in all sorts of ways."
2014.14-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,483.54,487.44,"Well, but it's -- here, I mean, you -- you could have conflicting messages."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,494.705,499.56,The State of Texas can absolutely promote the educational diversity of its citizenry.
2014.14-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,499.56,499.84,"Well, okay."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,509.13,515.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, as a -- an Austin, Texas establishment, the State of Texas, if it wanted to, could promote that message."
2014.14-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,523.09,524.795,So it's endorsing speech?
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,524.795,530.475,It is the government's speech. The analogy would be an endorsement of such as a professional athlete.
2014.14-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,539.68,539.9,Right.
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,558.77,560.02,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think Texas --"
2014.14-144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,560.02,561.985,I bet he would if he could.
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,561.985,565.95,The State of Texas does not put its name on everything.
2014.14-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,568.59,568.95,"Well, it does."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,572.34,576.67,"Sir, every message that is actually appearing on a license plate, yes, that is the State's message."
2014.14-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,576.89,578.71,And how many of them are there? How many --
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,578.71,587.48,"At -- as of the beginning of this month, there were 438 specialty plates, 269 of which were available for general public use."
2014.14-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,587.48,590.105,How many have you disapproved other than this one?
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,590.105,593.355,We address that argument in our reply brief at pages 9 to 11.
2014.14-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,600.85,605.03,And in -- in -- which -- what other ones have you disapproved?
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,605.03,609.32,The board's predecessor denied a pro life plate.
2014.14-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,617.49,619.775,All on the ground of offense?
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,619.775,632.02,The -- the information is not clear as to what the grounds for those denials were. The legislature itself has also repealed multiple specialty plates that it also had created. So -- so this shows that --
2014.14-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,632.02,648.655,"And could -- could I ask, Mr. Keller, if you go down to Texas and you just stare at license plates, are most of them just the standard license plate and then these 400 license plates you see very carefully, or do most people actually have one of these specialty plates?"
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,648.655,653.98,"While there is a -- a wide range, I believe most plates are still the standard plate and --"
2014.14-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,653.98,660.33,But there's a very -- there's a substantial percentage that are not? There -- it's not by any means unusual to see a specialty plate?
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,660.33,663.425,It would not be unusual to see a specialty plate in the State of Texas.
2014.14-144,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,672.4,675.34,What is the limits of this argument? That's what concerns me.
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,710.13,728.18,"Justice Alito, I think there we're starting to cross over into a situation what this called -- what this Court in Summum called of a subterfuge, that if you are abridging traditional free speech rights, if you're limiting access to a traditional public forum, then that would be an instance where government speech is crowding out speech and therefore it raised constitutional --"
2014.14-144,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,728.18,728.46,"Well, what does --"
2014.14-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,728.46,733.995,"Why hasn't this become traditional? I don't mean to interrupt Justice Alito, but we're on, I think, on the same point."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,738.98,747.935,"Justice Kennedy, I don't think it has become traditional because Texas has always maintained control over its plates, and it has always exercised editorial control."
2014.14-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,754.96,761.26,"Well, do -- do you want us to say that public -- the public fora cannot evolve over time according to -- and people don't go to parks anymore."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,762.23,768.195,"Justice Kennedy, absolutely. The -- the public -- traditional public forum can evolve over time."
2014.14-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,776.4,801.05,"But in a world in which you have approved 400 license plates and they are pretty common in the State of Texas and you have only disapproved a very select few, you know, it does seem as though you've basically given -- relinquished your control over this and, you know, made it a people's license plate for whatever private speech people want to -- to say."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,801.05,815.925,"Justice Kagan, I think it would be odd to say that it -- it's private speech when the board is taking a public vote and receiving notice and comment, a very -- a governmental function of when the government wants to act, and then it is placing its name on the license plate."
2014.14-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,824.05,834.675,"Does -- does it have notice and comment for -- for every one of the 430-odd that it's approved? Every time there is a request, does it -- is there a notice and comment procedure?"
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,834.675,840.43,"If it's a legislature-created plate, the legislature, of course, would do it and then there wouldn't be an agency notice and comment proceeding."
2014.14-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,887.63,901.02,"Does Texas also have specialty plates insofar as the -- the letters or numbers of the plates are concerned? I mean, can you get a license plate that says ""Hot Stuff"" or something like that?"
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,901.02,904.8,"Justice Scalia, we do have personalized plates in Texas."
2014.14-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,904.8,910.315,"And are those censored? I mean, can you -- can you use a dirty word on those?"
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,910.315,915.0,The -- the speech there is controlled completely by the State of Texas.
2014.14-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,915.0,915.5,I would think so.
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,915.5,917.73,"Texas, and this is not in the record, but --"
2014.14-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,917.73,921.66,"Even though the individual selects ""Hot Stuff"" or whatever other message he wants to put."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,925.6,926.77,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2014.14-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.77,930.51,"Right? I mean, dirty words are -- people are entitled to use dirty words."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,930.51,931.09,That's right.
2014.14-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,937.44,946.505,"Well, I -- I'm not sure your analogy to the postal service really works because none of us can imagine the postal service having commercial advertisements on its stamps."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,951.65,962.43,"Mr. Chief Justice, it may be true that the U.S. Postal Service has not chosen to engage in that type of expression, but I don't think that defeats the fact that this is still government speech."
2014.14-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,992.15,998.075,"Well, but there is an easy answer to that, which is they don't have to get in the business of selling space on their license plates to begin with."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1006.785,1011.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe, though, that would be an answer to all of the government speech cases."
2014.14-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1026.44,1031.06,"Well, that might be because they've done that since, I don't know, the time of the pyramids or whatever."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1040.965,1053.85,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't mean to suggest that they are just like the monuments, but there is still a fixed medium; an intangible message is being displayed to a captive audience, as the Court recognized in Lehman."
2014.14-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.53,1064.325,"Personally, I would rather have the license plates than the pyramids."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1068.96,1071.94,"Justice Scalia, we also want to retain our license plates."
2014.14-144,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1086.77,1112.24,"Well, I don't want to beat a dead horse, but I -- if -- what -- what is the best distinction you can give me between what you do with license plates and billboards, a soapbox, an official State website where people can put up a -- a message that they want subject to State approval? If we were to write an opinion that drew -- tried to draw a distinction between the license plates on one side and those other things on the other side, what would we say?"
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1112.24,1113.1,"Sure, Justice Alito."
2014.14-144,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1116.81,1119.22,"Texas has its name on all the other things, too."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1119.22,1126.02,"In this situation, we have exercised selectivity and control as my previous answer to Justice Kagan suggested."
2014.14-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1165.64,1169.915,I really don't think that you've answered Justice Alito's question.
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1191.395,1192.12,Justice --
2014.14-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1192.12,1202.005,The ability to veto because that would then give you the ability to veto. You could create a program in every public forum that basically controls in the same way.
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1202.005,1208.73,"Justice Sotomayor, I think there -- there's a difference -- we need to be clear about what approval means."
2014.14-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1219.88,1228.27,Have we held that you can -- you can deny access to a park or to a forum on the basis of the content of the speech?
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1228.27,1230.89,"Justice Scalia, content-based regulations of speech --"
2014.14-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.89,1232.41,Absolutely wrong.
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1238.42,1239.44,"Justice Scalia, that is correct."
2014.14-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1240.59,1252.96,"But Mr. Keller, one of the -- one of the concerns that that raises, and this really goes back to what Justice Kennedy said, is that outside the traditional area of streets and parks, this is a new world."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1283.6,1294.71,"That's right, Justice Kagan. And I think for all of those reasons, a narrow ruling in this case would possibly be a beneficial way to go, but that --"
2014.14-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.71,1311.75,"Do -- do you know of any other expressive fora that are owned by the State that, are manufactured by the State that have the State's name on it as license plates do? I mean, if there are a lot of fora like that, boy, I -- I wouldn't really worry. But I don't know of any others."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1312.54,1313.2,"No, Justice Scalia."
2014.14-144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1314.25,1321.03,"What can you tell me, then, to help me which might not help others? But I don't think these categories are absolute."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1350.945,1357.19,"Justice Breyer, the State's interest is selecting the messages it -- it wants to put its --"
2014.14-144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1357.19,1357.89,I'm sorry.
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1386.575,1387.56,Justice Breyer --
2014.14-144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1387.56,1404.375,"If they have no interest at all in making such a distinction, then I think since speech is hurt at least a little, they ought to lose. But if they have a justifiable interest, since you can put the bumper sticker next door, I think they win."
2014.14-144,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1407.265,1416.025,"And the State of Texas interest here is propagating messages that show the diverse backgrounds, educational backgrounds, products of Texas."
2014.14-144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1416.025,1416.57,"Well, yes -- I --"
2014.14-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.57,1416.63,No.

2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2144.545,2157.28,The reason is that this has become -- and it's the numbers -- it's become a limited public forum for putting up messages.

2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2452.34,2452.91,I understand.
2014.14-144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2452.91,2454.58,I'm trying to go back to the basics of it.
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2454.58,2467.915,"Well, one of the -- one of the ideas that you have articulated, and others on this Court, is that what would the reasonable observer believe this was."
2014.14-144,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2483.26,2488.6,How about both? How about both in answer to that? It is the State's license plate.
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2507.305,2527.145,"Both -- the State has dozens of potential designs for plates that don't carry anybody else's message, and they have 480 designs for organizational messages and 50,000 personalized messages."
2014.14-144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2541.945,2546.84,Suppose the State had many fewer plates from which to choose.
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2556.355,2567.985,"It certainly is government speech in the sense that -- partly government speech, the ability to choose somebody -- the universities in the State."
2014.14-144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2590.05,2590.3,All right.
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2603.325,2606.755,They actually do those and those are not sponsored by anybody.
2014.14-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2610.74,2613.29,But answer -- answer the hypothetical.
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2618.56,2619.9,"Scenic places, they can -- they actually --"
2014.14-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2619.9,2620.97,And then I'm sure he has some other --
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2620.97,2621.605,-- they can and do.
2014.14-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2621.605,2622.275,All right.
2014.14-144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2622.275,2629.68,And suppose that there's some little town that thinks that it's really scenic and they -- there's a way in which they can petition to get on this list.
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2649.47,2678.2,"My view is that when the people get to create a message themselves, and then -- an organization in this case -- create the message for themselves, and then the people who look in the catalog, pick out the license plate that they want and put it on their car, then the speech is the speech of the person who communicated it is predominantly --"
2014.14-144,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2678.2,2685.545,"My -- my problem with this is, how do I know? There are three categories of plates, I understand."
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2725.025,2727.445,In the first place --
2014.14-144,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2727.445,2730.265,And doesn't want to be associated with directly.
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2730.265,2731.08,I understand.
2014.14-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2762.61,2783.34,"But what about Justice Alito's hypothetical -- we never did quite finish -- where the direction of his question was, suppose the State, all by itself, has 10 messages, 20 messages, 200 messages, 2000 messages, you can choose, but the State makes up all the messages and gives you all the choices. What results?"
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2783.34,2795.26,"Well, the result is if the State has -- controls all -- has all the messages and picks all the messages, and then the people from whom -- whom it picks -- who it sells the plates to --"
2014.14-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2795.26,2796.9,I know that's the result of the hypothetical.
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2800.58,2807.265,"Well, the State can design all kinds of license plates that it wants to choose --"
2014.14-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2807.265,2815.43,"Is the scheme that I proposed, and that followed from Justice Alito's questions, consistent with the First Amendment or not?"
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2815.43,2821.96,"My -- it is not First -- when the individual submits -- when people, other people submit the design --"
2014.14-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2821.96,2823.58,That's not the hypothetical.
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2823.58,2824.16,I understand that.
2014.14-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2824.16,2829.3,"The hypothetical is the State has 5,000 designs, and the State makes them all up, and you can choose."
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2831.75,2838.695,"I don't believe -- if the State does everything, then it's -- it's the creator of the message and the speaker is the driver."
2014.14-144,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2838.695,2846.29,"What happens if private people could submit messages, but they all had to go through the legislature?"
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2846.29,2857.7,"My view is that it is a much more difficult case for us if the legislature passes a statute, because that is a legislative act and a clear act of the State."
2014.14-144,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2857.7,2868.655,"Well, what's the difference, then? I mean, if you say -- if you think that that would be all right, you know, Texas has said, well, the DMV does it, not the legislature, a different branch of government, but it's government just the same."
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2868.655,2869.61,I understand that.
2014.14-144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2903.63,2904.66,"Well, if you --"
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2904.66,2906.76,What regard when anybody buys a license plate --
2014.14-144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2906.76,2910.15,"When -- in Wooley, go back to that for a second."
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2918.82,2919.465,Yes.
2014.14-144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2919.465,2920.255,Okay.
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2934.8,2935.43,Because --
2014.14-144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2935.43,2937.7,"I mean, the State represents X million people."
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2941.035,2941.98,I understand.
2014.14-144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2942.55,2943.46,What's the difference?
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,2943.46,2956.6,The difference is they invite people to make their -- they charge people and have them pay for the manufacture of the license plates by giving them the chance to design a message.
2014.14-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2993.815,2997.265,"Counsel, can I ask you, it's a somewhat technical question but you just touched on it."
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3002.765,3016.35,"I -- to the extent he's cited issues relating to the other design, I do not have an objection to that, because I think it's --"
2014.14-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3016.35,3020.36,You think that it -- it's the extrarecord materials are accurate --
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3020.36,3020.83,I think --
2014.14-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3020.83,3021.13,-- actually.
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3021.13,3021.36,I think so.
2014.14-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3025.725,3026.08,Okay.
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3026.08,3045.765,"And I -- the fact that we have gone from 350 to 480 organizational designs since the case was tried, I -- was not in the record either, but I don't doubt that he has sold a lot more organizational plates since then and they keep a better tally than we do."
2014.14-144,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3045.765,3066.565,"So what is your -- the choice, the choice that Texas had, am I right, that in your view if they're going to have this -- these vanity plates, it has to be open to everybody, or they can shut the program down and nobody gets vanity plates."
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3089.27,3111.39,"I -- I believe that the best analysis is the legislature or the Motor Vehicle Commission discriminates against people's speech on the basis of the content of the speech, that is subject to serious First Amendment concerns and is probably illegal, although there may be some exceptions to that. That's what I think the better rule is."
2014.14-144,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3122.66,3128.17,"Mr. George, could I just take you back to the Chief Justice's question for a moment and just make sure I understand it."
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3145.045,3166.05,"To the extent that they were done on the grounds of offense, I do, because he has one that I can -- that we have verified, and that one is that there was concern about a danger on -- to the driver's thinking that somebody's state trooper plate made them a state trooper."
2014.14-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3166.05,3166.87,What if the argument --
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3166.87,3168.205,"That's what he said, at least."
2014.14-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3168.205,3168.665,Right.
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3187.455,3209.83,"Well, the -- this Court's rule -- law on incitement, going back to Brandenburg v. Ohio and the Ku Klux Klan rally that this Court decided was not incitement, is -- is pretty thin at this point in our history, because I don't know what the rule of incitement would be today."
2014.14-144,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3209.83,3223.225,"No, but Mr. George, just the worst of the worst, whether it's the swastika or whether it's the most offensive racial epithet that you can imagine, and if that were on a license plate where it really is provoking violence of some kind."
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3225.685,3229.69,I just don't -- I don't think people can -- the government can discriminate on content.
2014.14-144,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3240.05,3242.375,Where is that going to fit on the license plate?
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3242.375,3243.98,Perfectly legitimate -- huh?
2014.14-144,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3243.98,3247.485,Where is that going to fit on the license plate? (Laughter.)
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3247.485,3257.835,"They -- but those, that's -- you can put -- we have ""Taxation Without Representation"" on the District of Columbia's license plate and that's a political message."
2014.14-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3259.055,3265.86,"Your position is that if you prevail, a license plate can have a racial slur. That's your position?"
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3265.86,3267.145,Yes.
2014.14-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3275.65,3280.56,"Do you have to put ""Taxation Without Representation"" on your D.C. plate?"
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3280.56,3281.66,That's my understanding.
2014.14-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3281.66,3283.355,Or can you ask for a clean plate?
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3283.355,3288.75,"I haven't -- well, I'm not living here, but I believe it is required."
2014.14-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3288.75,3293.02,"If somebody objects I guess it's like, ""Live Free Or Die,"" right?"
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3293.02,3296.33,They can put it -- put it on -- tape it over.
2014.14-144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3420.24,3423.205,Do you know how much money Texas makes from this?
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3423.205,3428.53,"I don't have that -- it's not a line item in the budget, but lots."
2014.14-144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3428.53,3430.62,"That is really all this is about, isn't it?"
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3430.62,3437.1,Yes. (Laughter.)
2014.14-144,1,39377,roger_james_george_jr,,3437.1,3439.645,That's why Texas is in the business.
2014.14-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3447.75,3451.84,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Keller, you have three minutes remaining."
2014.14-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3451.84,3454.95,You have very limited rebuttal time and I do have one question.
2014.14-144,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3468.775,3473.97,I believe it would be government speech and therefore there would not be a First Amendment problem.
2014.14-144,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3478.315,3480.29,No First Amendment.
2014.14-144,2,56070,scott_a_keller,,3480.29,3515.07,"Just as if a monument were put it would be the government speaking, however, it would not be allowed under other constitutional provisions. Justice Alito and Justice Kagan, if I can -- if I can suggest a way to avoid the billboard problem. When the government has its name on a speech and when the -- it is part of a regulatory process or a program of the government's and there's formal notice and comment and there's a public vote and there's no abridgement of traditional free speech rights, which is this case, I think that's government speech. Justice Breyer, to address some of the other interests that Texas has here."
2014.14-144,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3574.39,0.0,"Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted."
