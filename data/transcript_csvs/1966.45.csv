1966.45,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,116.235,119.721,Is a -- in Indiana is reckless homicide a lesser --
1966.45,0,32426,john_p_price,,119.721,119.867,No.
1966.45,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,119.867,125.378,A simple lesser included offense under involuntary manslaughter?
1966.45,0,32426,john_p_price,,125.378,126.621,No sir it is not.
1966.45,1,21225,douglas_b_mcfadden,,1952.628,1957.192,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.45,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2198.606,2220.054,"In that connection may I ask, I noticed your Supreme Court that in saying that it was not conclusively as an implied acquittal that they do that especially since this Court judicially know that trail court practice of telling jury to return the verdict on only one of the charges in view of the limitation on penalty."
1966.45,1,21225,douglas_b_mcfadden,,2225.502,2227.836,Your Honor it is not in the record to my knowledge and I --
1966.45,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2227.836,2229.075,But what if he in the original record?
1966.45,1,21225,douglas_b_mcfadden,,2229.075,2232.042,I am -- I'm quite convinced that it would be on the original record.
1966.45,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2232.042,2233.752,But you know as a fact whether --
1966.45,1,21225,douglas_b_mcfadden,,2233.752,2233.888,I do.
1966.45,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2233.888,2235.105,-- the jury was told this?
1966.45,1,21225,douglas_b_mcfadden,,2235.105,2236.363,I do not know as a fact.
1966.45,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2236.363,2238.409,I see.
1966.45,1,21225,douglas_b_mcfadden,,2238.409,2261.669,"The jury however, it would appear from the Supreme Court's opinion as Your Honor has pointed out was aware of this and therefore the jury's silence on the involuntary manslaughter count must be taken as a manifestation of mercy and certainly not acquittal because the fact that you have the identical fact patterns and proof required."
1966.45,2,32426,john_p_price,,3612.448,3615.503,"Mr. Chief Justice, please the Court."
1966.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3785.927,3812.256,"Counsel, I'm looking at this original transcript and the court's instruction number 10 has this in it, if you find defendant guilty on either count on the affidavit and say nothing about the other count that would be equivalent to finding him not guilty on the count you do not mention."
1966.45,2,32426,john_p_price,,3829.481,3832.564,"The jury was told the instruction which you read Your Honor, yes sir."
1966.45,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3832.564,3837.758,Well why -- we're not just relying upon some kind of a presumption or rule in this case then.
1966.45,2,32426,john_p_price,,3841.909,3852.326,"That is precisely what the jury was told, that is correct sir and I think the essence of that is that the jury did acquit the man for involuntary manslaughter for that very instruction."
