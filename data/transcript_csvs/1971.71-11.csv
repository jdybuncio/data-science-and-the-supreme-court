1971.71-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.389,"Next in number 71-11, James against Strange."
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,42.573,45.895,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,193.864,197.034,May I ask what was the expense embraced?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,197.034,204.501,The expense can embrace any amount of money expended under the Act for the provision of counsel.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,204.501,207.48,"Hold it right there, is there a fee provided for counsel?"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,207.48,208.598,Is it set by the Act?
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,208.598,213.347,"Or is there anything in counsel, are they awarded fees?"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,213.347,214.652,They are awarded fees.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,307.078,308.391,This are direct outlets.
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,315.827,317.606,I am not sure that I quite understand.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,317.606,320.951,Well I gather to understand that the administrator's and it's program --
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,320.951,337.039,"I am sorry, the program is administered by the Judicial administrator who does not receive any direct compensation for performing that portion of his job through the Aid Indigents Defenders fund.W"
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,342.253,343.604,They are employees of the state however?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,343.604,344.151,Yes sir.
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,344.151,345.964,Just receiving the salary from the State?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,345.964,346.541,Yes sir.
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,346.541,355.636,"And the lawyers appointed on -- by contrast are private practitioners who are appointed for a particular case, will get compensated by the state?"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,355.636,356.669,Yes sir.
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,356.669,361.088,You do not have a -- we do not have here a state legal aid?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,361.088,373.167,"No sir, there is a statutory authorization for a state public defender system, but to my knowledge that has not been implemented by the state."
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,381.569,382.543,Right.
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,393.613,396.229,"The statute appears to read that way, yes sir."
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,413.537,431.65,"I am familiar with the system of at least one state, at least the way it used to be where if the defendant was acquitted that was the end of it and the state absorbed the costs, but if he was convicted, he was supposed to pay off the cost over the period of his time."
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,431.65,434.386,Our research I think disclose several states where that was the case.
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,434.386,437.891,"I suppose an equal protection, an attack could be made upon that kind of system?"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,437.891,440.437,I would expect.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,572.479,577.987,Now I gather in this case the only expense was the $500 paid to the attorney?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,577.987,585.724,"It's -- that is my understanding, yes sir."
1971.71-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,773.726,783.103,Because to those extents that if I ever get money any time in my life you are going to take $500 away from me?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,783.103,792.8,"It is protected in that manner with same limitations that exist with regard to any other civil judgment at the time period, yes sir."
1971.71-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,792.8,795.604,"We are not talking about civil case, we are talking abut the criminal case?"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,795.604,797.017,I understand that the same…
1971.71-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,797.017,802.99,And Kansas I assume is in the business of rehabilitating prisoners?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,802.99,803.917,Yes Your Honor.
1971.71-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,803.917,820.949,"And so after the man has served his time and comes out and he says “well, I think I ought to get a job” and then he remembers there is no reason to get a job because I will have to give that money to the state, does that help with his rehabilitation?"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,820.949,824.567,I do not know that I can qualify as a penologist.
1971.71-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,857.073,860.284,But he has paid that.
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,862.594,864.005,"If he has, yea sir --"
1971.71-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,864.005,872.993,"But in this case he is told that if we give, we will give you counsel, but if ever you get your hands on a buck, we are going to make you pay for it?"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,872.993,877.948,"Well, the statute provides that that will occur if --"
1971.71-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,877.948,879.612,If he gets a buck?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,879.612,881.407,"Within a five-year period, I mean I do not --"
1971.71-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,881.407,882.431,If he gets a buck?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,882.431,887.179,Within five years and the state can collect it.
1971.71-11,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,887.179,888.78,"Mr. Collister, let us take an extreme case."
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,893.653,895.98,Yes Sir.
1971.71-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,895.98,911.751,"Or suppose in another hypothetical case that at the time of his arrest or his trial it developed that he had $500 in the bank he saved up, he would not get the free service then would he, necessarily?"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,911.751,917.29,"Well, that is in practice I think that is a lot more difficult to answer than it would appear."
1971.71-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,951.012,962.343,"And if he has a lawyer for $250 and he inherits a million dollars that lawyer can get another $250 from him, can he?"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,962.343,969.071,"No sir, I am assuming that they have a set agreement that he is to receive only $250, not something dependent upon acquiring money."
1971.71-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,969.071,980.032,Do you think -- does this help the guilty pleas in Kansas?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,980.032,983.892,I do not have any statistics that would lead to a conclusion one way or another.
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,990.803,995.826,"Who sets the fee, certainly the defendant has no say in the amount of the fee?"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,995.826,1006.77,A claim is made by the attorney to -- which has to be approved by the judge who presided over the case to the appointing in the appointing hearing.
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1024.04,1059.379,"What I have in my mind was I do not know that your brother on the other side makes this argument that the court did decide this case, but normally when a defendant is not an indigent, at least there is or might be some negotiation with his own selected lawyer as to the amount of the fee and while he may not be in a very good bargaining position at least he may negotiate a fee and here the fee, the amount of the fee is entirely beyond his control."
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1094.107,1104.299,There are conceivable situations which might be subject to a different kind of attack than the present statute where an unreasonable is charged.
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1104.299,1110.9,There is no claim that this amount is unreasonable I gather in this case or that the general fee schedule is on or fee system is on schedule.
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1110.9,1129.83,"I do not believe so and further more the basis of the Three-Judge Court's decision was that any attempt regardless of whether it was a 5% of what the regular minimum schedule would be, would be an unconstitutional burden on the exercise of the right of counsel."
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1129.83,1136.938,I suppose present counsel is in a very good position to challenge that reasonable as to the fee.[Laughter]
1971.71-11,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1136.938,1152.025,"Mr. Collister, does the existence of this recoupment statute in Kansas tend to reduce in anyway the type of inquiry or the extent of inquiry initially made by the Trial Court when a defendant claims to be indigent?"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1159.502,1165.774,"Well again I do not have, that is not a -- my answer cannot be documented."
1971.71-11,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1229.301,1234.895,But not because of the recoupment statute?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1234.895,1239.439,Correct.
1971.71-11,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1239.439,1263.963,"Fraudulent conveyance provision in the statute, has there been any experience in Kansas to your knowledge that suggests the legislature was motivated in the enactment of this statute by conveyances being made to enable individuals to take advantage of free legal counsel?"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1263.963,1266.07,Not to my knowledge.
1971.71-11,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1324.246,1327.669,"$17,000 in two years as I recall."
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1327.669,1352.164,"The period of time that the recoupment provision has been in effect from which approximately July 1 of 1969 through the first part of 1971 when the Three-Judge Court declared the statute unconstitutional, there has been no attempted collection since then, so it is about one year and eight or nine months."
1971.71-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1364.49,1365.975,I am not sure I followed your figures.
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1368.479,1370.269,"It is approximately $17,000."
1971.71-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1370.269,1372.282,About a thousand dollars a month?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1372.282,1402.456,"Roughly, whether or not the work that has to be done by the judicial administrator, the attorney general's office and the county attorneys in the state that justify that kind of recovery may be debatable, but that is the province of the legislature to decide what policy that it want to implement as long as of course it does not violate the constitution."
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1541.671,1562.921,"What do you currently have on the reasoning of the District Court that the statute deters indigents from exercising the right to the assistance of counsel, thus puts the accused in the position of deciding whether you can afford to consult even with court appointed counsel."
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1579.372,1582.668,The 90 days after the notice is sent.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1582.668,1587.982,But when is the notice sent?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1587.982,1591.59,The judicial administrator has 30 days in which to send out the notice and then the --
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1591.59,1593.17,30 days from what date?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1593.17,1595.849,The date the money is expended.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1595.849,1598.826,The date of the payment appear as --
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1598.826,1603.507,Which may come after the final action on the criminal case.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1605.32,1610.936,And when an if convicted he is probably serving a term?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1611.528,1612.884,Or on probation.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1612.884,1624.88,"Well, let us assume he is prison, now he was indigent when he went to trial he has no money and now he gets a notice after the lawyer has been paid that he must to do what, pay within."
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1624.88,1626.259,Within 60 days --
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1626.259,1628.264,Well obviously he cannot pay.
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1628.264,1631.514,"And if in fact he does not pay, a judgment is taken against him."
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1631.514,1633.478,And an interest runs on that judgment?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1633.478,1634.025,Inter strands on that judgment.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1634.025,1639.647,"And he is really helpless to do anything about it because he has been an indigent all along, assuming now he was got --"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1639.647,1641.422,Assuming that he's been indigent all along.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1641.422,1642.112,And (Inaudible)
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1642.112,1643.469,Yes sir.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1643.469,1646.062,He was appointed counsel because he was indigent.
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1646.062,1649.877,At some time prior he was whether anything intervenes or not I will assume that it in most cases --
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1649.877,1661.715,"Well, let's us assume he does (Inaudible) I guess that in most of this cases he is indigent when he gets counsel, he is indigent when he is tried, he is indigent when he is convicted, he is in prison as an indigent, he does not have a nickel."
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1668.232,1669.648,That is correct.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1669.648,1678.287,Then why is it not that observation of the Three-Judge Court sound?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1678.287,1683.154,The statute as it exists creates an impediment to his choice.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1683.154,1684.507,Not to his choice --
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1684.507,1687.572,To his choice of whether to accept --
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1687.572,1692.649,Whether he can afford or even to consult for court appointed counsel.
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1692.649,1694.252,I have to admit that is --
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1694.252,1702.46,Will not be in a position to accept court appointed counsel and it really means that he has at most 90 days grace in paying the cost of the legal services rather on his behalf.
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1702.46,1702.751,I --
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1702.751,1715.047,"The other side of coin of course is that he can very well afford it, if we assume he still remains indigent, the helpless party is the state not the indigent because they cannot collect a nickel."
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1715.047,1716.593,That is also true.
1971.71-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1740.281,1744.76,But even though if he pleads guilty he doesn't have worry about it.
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1744.76,1747.407,If he pleads guilty he --
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1747.407,1748.593,He has a right to counsel.
1971.71-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1748.593,1758.676,"But if he waives his right to counsel and signs an affidavit waiving it and pleads guilty you cannot collect a nickel from him, right?"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1758.676,1760.71,"If nothing has been expanded, yes sir."
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1760.71,1761.645,And that would be true.
1971.71-11,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1761.645,1765.121,That is one way of saving 500 bucks.
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1765.121,1765.75,Yes it would be.
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1765.75,1769.825,Another way would be to plead not guilty and waive counsel?
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1769.825,1784.905,"And that is what I gather what the Three-Judge Court is talking about in that circumstances, say then I will not take counsel if I have got this burden on my back if I am convicted when I come out I will just, if tried the case on my own."
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1784.905,1786.273,That is a possibility yes.
1971.71-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1786.273,1791.386,Do you know how many people have refused counsel since this plan went into effect?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1791.386,1796.674,To my knowledge I do not have any personal knowledge either way.
1971.71-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1796.674,1798.496,That means none?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1798.496,1799.46,To my knowledge none.
1971.71-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1799.46,1814.849,I would take judicial notice that the proposition that people in those circumstances do not give it any thought one way or another whether at some future date they maybe called upon to pay the $500.
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1833.134,1836.329,"That is correct, the attorney is paid on an hourly basis."
1971.71-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1836.329,1838.339,So his bill might --
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1838.339,1839.223,The maximum --
1971.71-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1839.223,1843.196,-- $90 or $125 and not $500?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1843.196,1852.4,That is correct and the rate is much below that which is charged in metropolitan areas of Kansas on the minimum --
1971.71-11,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1852.4,1854.747,Does Kansas sue him for the $500?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1854.747,1855.748,Yes Sir.
1971.71-11,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1855.748,1861.048,Does Kansas name that lawyer to represent him?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1861.048,1863.934,I do not think there is any provision for that sir.
1971.71-11,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1863.934,1869.972,Well does Kansas sue him or is the judgment entered by confession?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1869.972,1875.99,The judgment is entered in effect by confession and then it is enforceable by the state in a proceeding.
1971.71-11,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1875.99,1880.01,And then tell me what is your Kansas system?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1886.42,1893.071,The judgment is the lien against -- let me approach that question by answering this way.
1971.71-11,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1921.366,1928.252,"If the man remains indigent, who is truly indigent the first place remains indigent the judgment really does not have much effect on him?"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1928.252,1929.359,That is correct.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1929.359,1945.46,"Well suppose he gets twenty years prison term and I gather the state has -- gives him a sixty-day notice, he is in prison, he is still indigent and then within two years the state has to sue him, isn't that right?"
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1958.817,1965.731,I think that provision relates to the suit against the person to whom property has been fraudulently been transferred.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1965.731,1966.657,Only to that?
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1966.657,1967.231,Yes Sir.
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1967.231,1968.103,I see.
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1968.662,1974.012,Otherwise the judgment when it is filed would operate as a lien for five years just as --
1971.71-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1974.012,1979.237,So if he had a twenty year term that the lien runs out while he was serving his term.
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1979.237,1980.936,Yes Sir.
1971.71-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1980.936,1988.441,It is in his interest to get a long prison term.[Laughter]
1971.71-11,0,22093,edward_g_collister_jr,,1988.441,1990.47,I see that my time has run out.
1971.71-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2007.671,2009.426,Mr. Wilkinson.
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2009.426,2015.662,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1971.71-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2210.528,2220.447,Do you think this statute really puts the lawyer to option telling his client always to saying I will take the $500?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2220.447,2231.648,I think it would be who the lawyer to render this advise and I would not want to impose that burden upon any judge because I think in --
1971.71-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2231.648,2236.285,Well I take it you do not get the allowance without applying for it?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2236.285,2237.657,That is right.
1971.71-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2237.657,2243.05,"So if you had not applied for it, it had not been allowed, no judgment against the defendant would ever be entered."
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2243.05,2243.396,Yes Sir.
1971.71-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2243.396,2246.471,"It is not really a nice position to be in, I take it?"
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2246.471,2255.421,That is right it was not and I have thought about it at considerable length before I decided to go ahead and file my voucher for payment of my services.
1971.71-11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2255.421,2262.855,Mr. Wilkinson before the enactment of this statute in your state of Kansas what was the system?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2270.375,2281.748,"They were paid for by the county, expense of the county, the board of county commissioner is allowed to set aside a sum of money for the counsel for the indigent."
1971.71-11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2281.748,2284.151,And then without any recoupment?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2284.151,2285.017,Without any recoupment.
1971.71-11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2285.017,2288.162,And this was the first statewide state law on the subject?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2288.162,2292.028,Yes Sir it was a reaction to Gideon versus Wainwright.
1971.71-11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2292.028,2297.466,"Before that was there disparity, were there variances in the way the various counties handled it?"
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2297.466,2298.513,Well I would think so.
1971.71-11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2343.588,2348.316,But they are in control over the amount that is explained by your brother?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2348.316,2361.05,Yes sir and in answer to one of the circumstance I do know that there was a substantial judgment against an accused after the trial in Gallatin County.
1971.71-11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2370.826,2371.738,He was saddled with the judgment?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2371.738,2373.383,With the judgment.
1971.71-11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2373.383,2377.3,(Voice Overlap) $500 unless it was a capital case.
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2377.3,2383.406,"I think he says a maximum of $500, but there is an allowance."
1971.71-11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2389.803,2392.196,The county board is still in the picture?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2392.196,2394.159,"No the county is not, it is the state board."
1971.71-11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2394.159,2395.375,State Board --
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2395.375,2408.128,"And I did not contest that, the judicial administrator and one Supreme Court justice and three of them."
1971.71-11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2408.128,2410.028,And it's a state agency.
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2410.028,2415.868,They sort of act together primarily to the advise of the judicial administrator.
1971.71-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2415.868,2435.0,"After this statute went into effect Mr. Wilkinson and if you know, could you tell me whether the number of appointments went up or it went down as compared with the graph, if you were graphing it prior to the Act?"
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2435.0,2440.117,I would say that it stayed essentially the same.
1971.71-11,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2461.325,2467.301,"Mr. Wilkinson, does Kansas, the state bar of Kansas have a recommended minimum fee schedule?"
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2467.301,2468.402,Yes Sir.
1971.71-11,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2468.402,2480.815,How do the limits on the fees recoverable under this Act for represent indigents compare with the similar recommended fees in the Kansas state bar?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2480.815,2488.595,I would say it is less than half of what I work for.
1971.71-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2572.44,2575.655,You are know addressing yourself to the policy question are you not?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2575.655,2577.268,Yes Sir.
1971.71-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2577.268,2591.875,"I think you have probably find universal agreement on that but as a matter of policy that certainly is desirable, but does that reach the constitutional issue that is involved in this case of the recoupment?"
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2591.875,2596.112,Well I do not think that you can separate the two.
1971.71-11,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2631.962,2637.001,Mr. Wilkinson help me out on another aspect of deterrence.
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2671.394,2672.284,Yes sir I do.
1971.71-11,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2673.05,2677.354,How do you square his situation with an answer to Mr. James.
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2677.354,2678.645,The actual Mr. Strange?
1971.71-11,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2678.645,2680.624,Mr. Strange.
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2680.624,2703.896,"Well as far as squaring the person who has eleven or, just above the poverty line, I think probably the best way that that is provided for in the statute is through the judge's interrogation as to finding out what this man has in the way of the family."
1971.71-11,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2724.936,2728.583,To the point where there are some iniquities built into any system?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2728.583,2732.673,I think so and I think that the best way to give him free counsel.
1971.71-11,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2732.673,2743.8,That explains as to give the true indigent free counsel and let the just barely over the indigency line sink or swim?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2743.8,2777.084,"Well I know that Mr. Judge Temper, my ex boss and I have similar case in Federal Court gave free counsel to the man who was making $13,000 a year, making a determination that he had ten children that it was more important for him to have a counsel in this case, free counsel in the Federal District Court case."
1971.71-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2799.106,2807.162,Do you know the statutory definition of an indigent?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2807.162,2816.63,The national defenders association and I have to apologize to the Court I did not know enough about it.
1971.71-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2832.45,2836.185,You will hand to the clerk later on.
1971.71-11,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2839.751,2850.821,Mr. Wilkinson you state in your brief that this statute has had a chilling effect on the use by indigents of counsel.
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2853.838,2855.501,In this particular case?
1971.71-11,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2855.501,2856.01,Yes.
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2856.01,2863.273,No because you see I did not advise him that he was going to have to pay me back.
1971.71-11,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2863.273,2868.029,But what is the basis for the statement in your brief to that effect?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2868.029,2871.658,In my brief is in the District Court's finding.
1971.71-11,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2878.108,2881.181,They made a finding without anything in the record to support it?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2881.181,2886.335,When I filed -- I would say to some extent that is true.
1971.71-11,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2925.647,2929.441,So there is nothing in the record on this subject?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2929.441,2936.219,There is nothing in another in the notice that he had to -- there is nothing in the record that he'd ever have notice either and I do not want to lose Mr. David’s Stranger’s case.
1971.71-11,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2971.546,2983.724,The record does not show the number of indigents who have been provided counsel in the last two years since the statute became effective?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2983.724,2984.968,No the record does not show.
1971.71-11,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2988.912,2989.726,From Kansas?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,2989.726,3001.784,"From Kansas, I was going to put them in but I thought that $17,000 would not -- it does not look like even a good deal for the taxpayers."
1971.71-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3001.784,3009.758,"For Kansas might well decide in the short time and it is not worth the candle and give up the whole idea, is that possible?"
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3009.758,3017.027,Or they may decide particularly if this decision stands and they --
1971.71-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3017.027,3020.536,"Then they would have a choice then, they have no options."
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3040.256,3051.324,Except that the attorney general will probably test if there was help to keep down the problems in court so we can get more guilty pleas and we can keep better control --
1971.71-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3051.324,3054.724,"There is no evidence in this record that that has happened, is there?"
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3054.724,3055.945,No Sir.
1971.71-11,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3055.945,3063.467,"Mr. Wilkinson I have a grave problem with this no notice business, you knew about it?"
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3063.467,3065.596,I knew about the statute is what you mean?
1971.71-11,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3065.596,3066.793,You presume to have known about it.
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3066.793,3070.26,Yes sir there is a…
1971.71-11,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3070.26,3074.535,Is that a problem for you?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3074.535,3083.85,"It is a great problem for me because I was presumed to know the law and did not, and he was to the indigent accused that is presumed to know the law."
1971.71-11,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3093.803,3104.72,Well I should assume that the magistrate know that people would assume that the lawyer would tell him what the law was?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3104.72,3113.306,"I think that would, you could assume that if that were the actual case."
1971.71-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3125.316,3137.126,"On December 22, 1969 were you in court and in terms of what probation should be?"
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3137.126,3144.332,Yes sir I went ahead at that particular time and asked the judge to waive the statute and the indigent --
1971.71-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3144.332,3146.268,Was the indigent in court then?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3146.268,3149.638,Yes he was.
1971.71-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3149.638,3153.778,The assigned counsel asked the district judge to enter nor not requiring the defendant to pay back.
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3153.778,3155.383,That is right.
1971.71-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3155.383,3158.777,So he knew about it then.
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3158.777,3165.235,After the fees have already been earned so to speak.
1971.71-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.235,3169.104,After then or earned but there hadn't been any judgment entered yet?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3169.104,3171.758,No sir and the judge said he did not have any authority.
1971.71-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3171.758,3179.274,"Well I know, but there hadn't been any judgment entered yet, although he had to have notice before that by mail that he was suppose to pay it?"
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3179.274,3183.123,"Not at that time, well yes he did at time."
1971.71-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3183.123,3190.71,(Voice overlap) So he had notice before there was any judgment entered?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3190.71,3192.055,That is correct.
1971.71-11,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3192.055,3197.454,What is your due process contention and what other notice should he would have you say?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3197.454,3202.967,At the time he was to be afforded or provided a court appointed counsel.
1971.71-11,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3202.967,3209.577,"Well that is simply a question of knowing the substantive basis on which a judgment might ultimately be entered, is it not?"
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3209.577,3210.83,Well he did not know that.
1971.71-11,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3210.83,3222.131,Well what if ever of our cases ever held that specific notice of subjecting a provision of a particular law must be given to an individual before he could be made subject to it?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3222.131,3228.596,"I think Walker versus City of Hutchinson, the due process notice in them, the domain case."
1971.71-11,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3228.596,3235.521,"That was a lien and foreclosure, that was an action against a particular piece of property, was it not in Walker?"
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3235.521,3238.576,Yes sir.
1971.71-11,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3253.453,3257.368,Mr. Wilkinson I suppose in this lawsuit you are on your own.
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3257.368,3262.539,Yes sir.
1971.71-11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3262.539,3300.45,"I notice in your motion to dismiss the appeal that you filed here you did indicate to us that the primary issue before the Three-Judge Court as you saw it was whether or not that David Strange has been given notice at the time counsel was appointed to him that he would be charged with paying that counsel in the event he ever had any money and that was a matter that the district, the Three-Judge District Court eventually simply disregarded."
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3300.45,3301.268,Yes sir.
1971.71-11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3301.268,3320.904,"So I suppose if we should, in the event that -- in the event that this Court decided that the District Court was wrong on the constitutional issue it did decide we should remand it to the Three-Judge Court to decide the questions that you really thought were the primary questions in the case?"
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3320.904,3327.54,"I think that would be the case, Your Honor, because it was brought up before them."
1971.71-11,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3336.597,3337.942,Right.
1971.71-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3337.942,3343.207,Now there was no deterrence in this case at least that's clear?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3343.207,3349.004,"Well he had no notice, we do not know whether if there was --"
1971.71-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3349.004,3351.867,"He did have notice, he was not deterred."
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3353.106,3357.494,I have to admit that there was no deterrence in this case and I admitted it --
1971.71-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3357.494,3366.647,So you must go on -- so the Three-Judge Court decided that the case was not before us.
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3366.647,3370.312,"Well, they -- I tried to --"
1971.71-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3370.312,3372.228,And this is not the case you presented to them anyway?
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3372.228,3373.577,"That is right, that's right."
1971.71-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3376.047,3385.686,You were saying that he did not know anything about what the harm was and that he should not be saddled with debt that he did not know he was going to end with.
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3385.686,3386.741,That is right.
1971.71-11,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3386.741,3408.203,"Well I suppose you can in argument to the Three-Judge District Court though make an argument that your client has been saddled with this $500 judgment and it is invalid, the law imposing it because it would have a deterrent effect on other people even though it may not have that on your particular client, whether the court accepts that maybe something else, you were standing there?"
1971.71-11,1,33668,john_e_wilkinson,,3408.203,3411.044,That is what the Three-Judge District Court did.
