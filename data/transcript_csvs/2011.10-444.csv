2011.10-444,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.568,"We will hear argument next in Case 10-444, Missouri v. Frye."
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,6.504,9.622,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-444,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,48.347,54.418,"Counsel, sometimes one's experience has to be challenged."
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,95.912,100.464,"Well, the plea -- the plea occurred on March 3, 2008--"
2011.10-444,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,100.464,101.316,"No, that's the second plea."
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,101.316,103.649,--It went -- right.
2011.10-444,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,105.518,106.434,I'm talking about the plea--
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,106.434,109.821,"--The plea offer expired on December 28, 2007, I believe."
2011.10-444,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,109.821,112.939,--He commits the crime on the 29th or the 30th.
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,115.623,117.341,"That actually was the fifth offense, but yes."
2011.10-444,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,117.341,118.091,All right.
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,133.603,136.655,"It would be less than likely, but not impossible, I would say."
2011.10-444,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,165.339,170.043,"I suppose the defendant might think, you know, there is really bad evidence out there that they don't have yet."
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,179.499,180.751,It could be.
2011.10-444,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,182.268,183.62,"I mean, I don't know how often that happens."
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,183.62,183.986,--That is possible.
2011.10-444,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,196.193,201.497,I am really puzzled by what as a practical matter is at stake in this case.
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,240.539,242.556,The last part of the question is?
2011.10-444,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,242.556,243.758,I don't see what is at stake here.
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,251.395,256.066,"As a former -- as a former prosecutor myself, I would agree with this."
2011.10-444,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.181,287.451,But we take the case on the assumption that he hadn't heard of the earlier better offer.
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,290.153,294.791,"In this case, the defendant was unaware of the earlier better offer."
2011.10-444,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,315.02,325.743,"I mean, we've got to be -- aren't we taking this on -- isn't there an assumption that there is a finding, or some lower court judge made a finding that if he had known about the better deal that was offered, he would have taken it?"
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,325.743,331.13,That -- what is in the record is that he would have taken the 90-day deal on the misdemeanor.
2011.10-444,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,331.13,331.714,Yes.
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,331.714,348.426,"But there is also an important element in the record, that when he went in front of the court on March 3 and the felony offer was given to the judge, which was 3 years in deferral on probation plus 10 days shock time, the judge in Columbia, Missouri, gave the felony offer the back of his hand."
2011.10-444,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,351.544,352.861,So that's a causal problem.
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,362.001,362.885,--If the judge--
2011.10-444,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,362.885,363.635,Is that your point?
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,363.635,364.351,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-444,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,364.351,382.932,"Well, then there's a -- somebody must have found somewhere that this made a difference, that the failure to tell him about the special offer of the misdemeanor did in fact make a difference because he would have accepted it and he would have ended up with it."
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,382.932,386.284,"Well, and that is the problem that brings us here today."
2011.10-444,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,387.967,388.569,Yes.
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,388.569,400.96,"--Through a misrepresent -- a misinterpretation, we believe, of the Strickland standard and, more importantly, a misreading of where Hill and Premo takes us."
2011.10-444,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,427.794,430.746,Suppose he had snapped up this deal as soon as it was offered.
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,444.753,449.657,The court probably would have known as a result of a pre-sentence investigation.
2011.10-444,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,498.321,508.079,"Well, regardless, your legal position is that there is no basis for setting aside the plea if an earlier, better offer was not communicated."
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,509.429,516.868,My legal position is that a finding -- a conviction was entered on March 3.
2011.10-444,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,545.452,551.189,You're saying there's no Sixth Amendment violation when the counsel fails to communicate a favorable offer to the defendant.
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,551.858,552.475,No.
2011.10-444,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,582.644,587.531,"Well, I -- I didn't understand that to be your position."
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,619.669,623.304,I -- there is a question in--
2011.10-444,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,623.304,624.437,"I mean, you can say yes or no."
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,628.525,632.993,--Is the question whether I believe that plea negotiations are a critical stage?
2011.10-444,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,632.993,635.862,When they do not result in a guilty plea.
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,635.862,642.948,I believe they are not -- I believe that plea negotiations are not a critical stage under the laws of this Court.
2011.10-444,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,642.948,644.134,That's what we took the case for.
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,655.525,667.666,I do not -- there is a factual question as to whether or not plea negotiations in this case really ever engaged when all that ever occurred was the prosecutor sent a letter to the defense attorney.
2011.10-444,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.785,672.018,"Yes, but we don't care about that."
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,690.931,702.237,"--Plea negotiations I don't believe are a critical stage, because the fate -- in the back and forth between a prosecutor and a defense attorney the fate of the accused is not -- is not set."
2011.10-444,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.304,738.943,"And if it were a critical stage, I suppose that counsel would be ineffective, not only if he was a lousy lawyer and didn't know the law, but if he was a bad negotiator."
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,745.847,752.686,"I agree that that would be one of the extensions, if critical stage analysis was applied to plea negotiations."
2011.10-444,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.686,758.657,"You tell him to turn down a deal that in fact, you know, was a pretty good deal, that would be ineffective assistance of counsel."
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,763.559,767.279,I understand that that would be one of the ramifications.
2011.10-444,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,767.279,768.012,So Mr. Koster--
2011.10-444,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,768.012,769.212,This is on the basic question--
2011.10-444,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,769.212,773.849,It's -- it's very odd for you to say that -- to me -- that this is not a critical stage.
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,801.267,826.901,"My understanding, Your Honor, is that attorneys are guaranteed the accused at critical stages, such as arraignments, plea hearings, trials, but then there is an implied guarantee that comes with that critical stage, and that implied guarantee is that their -- that the attorney appointed will do research, analysis and preparation that prepares him for the critical stage."
2011.10-444,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,851.533,856.42,"--Well, the -- the question -- I make a counter-assumption."
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,966.575,974.08,"Ineffective assistance of counsel is a -- is a term of art, and it is a two-part test."
2011.10-444,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1001.065,1008.737,"Well, the open plea that wasn't made, that is a critical stage, that he took a the plea."
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,1034.469,1036.321,--In Tollett -- may I?
2011.10-444,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1036.321,1036.955,Yes.
2011.10-444,0,19385,chris_koster,,1036.955,1056.384,"In Tollett v. Henderson the question of the defendant Mr. Henderson's knowing waiver in that case, where the breach was infinitely more egregious in my view, which was the 1948 court packing that occurred and the African Americans citizens were excluded from that grand jury pool."
2011.10-444,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1093.707,1094.609,"Thank you, Counsel."
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1106.501,1109.017,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-444,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1110.786,1129.098,"Are you taking the same position your -- I don't want to call it co-counsel -- Petitioner's counsel is taking, that you are not entitled to an attorney at plea bargaining, unless you waive your -- unless your right to a trial?"
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1129.098,1130.116,"--No, we are not--"
2011.10-444,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1130.116,1130.766,It's not a--
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1130.766,1132.666,--We are not taking the view.
2011.10-444,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1180.882,1195.809,"So I think, Mr. Yang, what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting is that your position does in fact require you to say that if there were no counsel at all in the proceedings, that would be perfectly -- that -- you know, there would not be a constitutional problem with that."
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1202.063,1208.033,--A -- a guilty plea wipes free all kinds of constitutional violations.
2011.10-444,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1208.033,1218.672,"No, but the -- the guilty -- I mean, no, the reason why that is not true is that the guilty plea must be entered with advice of counsel."
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1219.672,1220.055,Correct.
2011.10-444,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.872,1224.659,So the guilty plea doesn't erase everything if it has been entered without advice of counsel.
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1224.659,1226.042,--Correct.
2011.10-444,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1243.97,1267.003,"So does that mean, Mr. Yang, a State could set up a system where it says we are going to do all our negotiating with the defendant with no counsel present in the room, but we are going to keep a lawyer on board just in the courtroom to advise him whether he should plead -- to advise him about the plea that he struck, even though he struck this plea with no counsel in the room, and that would be perfectly okay?"
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1267.003,1269.371,--We are not saying that -- that--
2011.10-444,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1269.371,1271.088,All the negotiations could be uncounseled.
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1271.088,1279.06,--We are not taking the position that States can deprive counsel or deprive counsel from participation in the guilty plea process.
2011.10-444,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1279.76,1287.066,"Well, I don't understand how you can say that, if you -- you know -- you are saying that; because you're saying that in the end the guilty plea wipes all constitutional error away."
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1287.066,1299.99,"--Just as we are not saying that there can be coerced confessions, not just like we are saying that a statute can impermissibly burden the right to trial by putting a death sentence on -- that's available only when you go to trial."
2011.10-444,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1359.696,1373.188,"If defense counsel gives wrong information to the defendant about witnesses that can testify in his behalf, and so forth, very bad legal advice, that can be grounds for setting aside the plea, correct?"
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1373.188,1374.772,"It can, and because what's relevant--"
2011.10-444,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1374.772,1385.163,"All right, so -- and that is because counsel pre the entry of the plea did not adequately advise his client."
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1385.163,1387.098,"--Right, right."
2011.10-444,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1388.348,1395.636,Why is there no problem when he doesn't adequately advise a client of earlier better offers?
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1395.636,1398.254,--It's a different prejudice.
2011.10-444,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1451.288,1453.657,"Well, Mr. Yang, there are different kinds of unfairness."
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1485.195,1496.153,"--Well, when -- again, once -- whether or not there was a prior error, once you plead guilty, the question is not whether there were other deals on the table, the question is whether that waiver of--"
2011.10-444,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1496.153,1496.853,"Well, I guess that is the question."
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1497.936,1516.748,"--Well, right, but if it were the question, it would call into -- this Court in, in going back to Brady and then in Boykin, explained that what's -- the relevant question when you enter a guilty plea is whether you have waived your right to trial validly."
2011.10-444,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1581.607,1584.559,"You have admitted that you got what you deserved, right?"
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1584.559,1585.127,Precisely.
2011.10-444,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1614.028,1627.821,"Mr. Yang, in your view is there any situation in which a defendant could regain a plea opportunity that he lost due to counsel's conceded inadequacy?"
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1643.514,1645.1,--If he pleads guilty?
2011.10-444,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1645.1,1648.484,"Yes, if he doesn't seek the trial right."
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1648.484,1649.986,"I'm sorry, I didn't catch that."
2011.10-444,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1649.986,1650.803,Yes.
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1659.742,1680.323,"If he has pleaded guilty and he validly waived his rights to trial, because he would not have asserted them, then I think under Hill what you have is a defendant who admits guilt, there is no real risk of any kind of error in that determination, and the judgment which must be set aside -- remember, we have to set aside the judgment."
2011.10-444,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1715.996,1716.746,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-444,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1716.746,1717.379,Thank you.
2011.10-444,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1717.379,1720.881,Mr. Queener.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,1720.881,1723.25,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.398,1748.933,Why?
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,1776.551,1787.942,"Fairness includes a whole range of sentencing options, and in this case the prosecutor was making a determination of what was fair in this case when he made the offer."
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.942,1790.644,"Ex ante, I suppose you could say that."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,1804.068,1820.663,Part of the consideration that a defendant has to make during the plea bargaining process or plea negotiation process is determining the liability that he's willing to accept in entering a plea of guilty.
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.663,1823.365,"That's true, and he did that when he entered the plea of guilty."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,1836.356,1847.914,"Well, he was -- the guilty plea in terms of what he was admitting to, he was willing to and had to agree that he had committed the crime of driving while -- while revoked."
2011.10-444,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1865.458,1867.91,"Counsel, I have a two-part question."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,1867.91,1868.544,Okay.
2011.10-444,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1868.544,1869.094,All right.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,1889.908,1909.304,"The plea was unknowing and involuntary because he was not made aware by his counsel's unprofessional representation of all of the circumstances available to him, the consequences of entering that guilty plea, that would have included the 90-day on a misdemeanor if he had been aware of that."
2011.10-444,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1909.304,1915.458,"Suppose he had been told that -- suppose he had been told that, and the prosecutor said, well, yes, that's true."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,1926.266,1933.77,"This offer was only no longer on the table at the time he entered the plea of guilty, because it had expired."
2011.10-444,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1949.798,1950.881,I understand that.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,1969.862,1978.649,I -- that's -- it seems to me that that's involuntary in the sense that he didn't know it then.
2011.10-444,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1983.952,1989.689,"Well, suppose -- suppose the case in which a plea offer's made, not communicated, and expires."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,1999.212,2003.349,There is -- there is an increase in sentence.
2011.10-444,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2004.699,2006.551,Is -- is the plea involuntary?
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2008.82,2010.653,It is--
2011.10-444,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2010.653,2012.555,And what would he -- what would he have done had he known?
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2012.555,2016.341,--It's unknowing in the sense that he did not know the--
2011.10-444,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2016.341,2019.626,"You mean, judge, I'm really sorry I didn't accept responsibility three months earlier?"
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2019.626,2031.266,--What he does -- what's unknowing about that is the potential consequence that he is choosing in deciding to plead guilty.
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.574,2069.558,"Doesn't -- doesn't the rule that the plea offer may be withdrawn at any time by the prosecutor -- indeed even after it has been accepted -- doesn't that well enough establish that there is no right to profit from that plea offer, that there is no constitutional right he's being deprived of, given that the prosecutor can withdraw it even after he accepts it?"
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2069.558,2087.27,"That can be with -- excuse me -- that can be withdrawn at any time by the prosecutor, but we're not arguing that there is a right to a particular plea -- a particular plea."
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2107.766,2121.176,"I -- I had hoped you were making some argument other than the knowing argument, because as prior discussion has shown, even if he had known, it would have made no difference to whether he had accepted the later plea."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2165.789,2176.861,"--The right is to enter that plea knowing the full consequences of what he's doing at that point, which includes the limitation on his exposure for the offense."
2011.10-444,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2183.934,2206.28,But the -- the Missouri Supreme Court said in what -- that the prosecutor -- it would not -- it would not order the prosecutor to renew that earlier plea.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2232.514,2233.849,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-444,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2250.993,2288.601,"What about as a constitutional violation that, in a context of a world where 95 percent of all people in prison are there as a result of bargaining and guilty pleas arranged with prosecutors, in that context, it's fundamentally unfair to deprive a person of his liberty for 40 years instead of six months because the lawyer which he is guaranteed fell down on the basic, fundamental, obvious duty of communicating the relevant plea agreement?"
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2288.601,2290.353,"I agree with you completely, Your Honor."
2011.10-444,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2290.353,2291.803,So is there any support for me?
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2295.172,2332.528,"That -- that is the issue where -- in terms of the sentencing outcome, this is knowledge that he is required to -- that is required by his attorney to provide him -- sentencing of difference is prejudicial under Strickland, and the remedy for -- I guess going back in -- even more basic than that -- is that ineffective assistance of counsel is -- has to be remedied."
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2332.528,2344.686,"But if that's ineffective assistance of counsel, surely it's ineffective assistance of counsel to advise him to turn down an offer that he should have snapped up."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2356.611,2363.499,I'm going to have to couch that in terms of saying it would depend on the circumstances -- what you have to--
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.499,2364.782,I gave you the circumstances.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2373.738,2377.909,--That would probably not be ineffective assistance.
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.909,2378.659,It would not be?
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2378.659,2381.794,The question would then be whether or not there is prejudice from that.
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2381.794,2384.913,It would be ineffective assistance and the question would be prejudiced.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2385.73,2394.436,I think an attorney can provide reasonable representation in making that sort of an offer.
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2394.436,2405.159,"Give me -- give me a yes or no to the question whether, if every reasonable lawyer would have told him to snap up this offer but his counsel tells him, no, turn it down."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2407.928,2416.049,"In that circumstance, it is ineffective assistance, because he has to do what is -- is a reasonable standard of representation."
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2416.049,2417.634,Then we are in the soup.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2443.868,2446.82,"Under that circumstance, that would -- may well be."
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2446.82,2447.336,Yes.
2011.10-444,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2447.336,2456.776,"Now, you have read these cases, and now we are right on what I think is the point, because we've both defined a possible constitutional right but there is a practical problem."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2490.93,2499.453,"As I understand these cases, the -- the standards being applied are the Strickland standard."
2011.10-444,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2506.541,2509.743,"Well, we get a lot of Strickland cases, and the lower courts do, too."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2514.295,2520.618,"--I mean, that -- that's certainly true."
2011.10-444,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2522.001,2526.286,Where the case goes to trial prejudice isn't going to be very hard to prove.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2535.461,2535.961,--Right.
2011.10-444,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2535.961,2544.317,So there's always going to be a very good argument for prejudice where a person turns down a favorable deal and then gets slammed after a trial.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2544.317,2547.351,I'm -- I'm going to qualify my answer a little bit.
2011.10-444,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2574.103,2574.919,Counsel--
2011.10-444,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2574.919,2576.319,The point is just -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-444,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2576.319,2576.955,"--No, go ahead."
2011.10-444,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2576.955,2580.407,"The point is just that prejudice isn't going to be very tough to show, is it?"
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2586.661,2587.661,That may well be the--
2011.10-444,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2587.661,2588.244,That's prejudice.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2588.244,2590.879,--That may well be the easier part of the -- of the equation.
2011.10-444,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2592.215,2592.548,Why?
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2600.168,2601.586,--That's -- yes.
2011.10-444,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2601.586,2607.224,"And if -- if you are going to use the words reasonable probability that he would have taken it, it might be fairly easy to show."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2616.346,2623.767,I -- I think reasonable probability is a -- is a workable standard that we have used for -- for many years.
2011.10-444,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2623.767,2631.354,But you are -- you are leaving out of the picture the prosecutor's prerogative to withdraw or flip.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2675.716,2703.65,"The -- this is a remedy for the Sixth Amendment violation, and that is to put the defendant back into the position as nearly as possible as he would have been in at the time; and at the time the offer was open -- this is not a situation where the prosecutor is being ordered initially or the first instance to make an offer; it -- this is being viewed as the offer that was originally made is still available and open to the defendant."
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2703.65,2708.368,"Yes, but at the time that offer could have been withdrawn by the prosecutor."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2714.889,2721.795,"There -- there is never going to be a perfect remedy for any of these violations, I don't believe."
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.795,2722.978,I think that's right.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2722.978,2723.495,Right.
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2723.495,2728.715,And that's one of the things that causes us to be suspicious of whether there is a constitutional violation--
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2728.715,2729.631,Well--
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.631,2731.4,--because there really isn't any perfect remedy.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2731.4,2732.55,--There can be a perfect--
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2732.55,2734.785,In some cases not even a close to perfect remedy.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2734.785,2744.225,"--I think this is close to perfect, as close to perfect as we can get, which is what is required for Sixth Amendment remedies, that it mitigated to the extent possible."
2011.10-444,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2766.39,2766.64,Counsel--
2011.10-444,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2766.64,2767.273,On the issue of--
2011.10-444,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2767.273,2768.806,--I'll go this time.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2781.566,2782.166,Yes.
2011.10-444,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2782.166,2792.721,On the next page you say when Frye entered his guilty plea before the trial court he was completely unaware that counsel's ineffective delay had forever foreclosed those options.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2796.842,2800.294,No it was--
2011.10-444,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2800.294,2808.733,"The question of validity is whether it's an intelligent choice, as you quote, among the alternative choices of action open to the defendant."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2814.304,2825.01,"--Well those were foreclosed simply as a result of trial counsel's ineffectiveness, which -- which caused him to be unaware that they had been ever available to him."
2011.10-444,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2851.507,2862.215,"--On the issue of remedy, as the Respondent are you not limited to the remedies that were provided in the judgment of the State court?"
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2862.215,2877.141,"No, I don't believe so, because the State court of -- court of appeals simply thought it was not empowered to put him back in the position that he was in, and I think that is the remedy under the Sixth Amendment."
2011.10-444,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2877.141,2880.343,You didn't file a cross petition and there wasn't one granted.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2889.965,2896.286,The second point in the -- in this case is what is the appropriate remedy.
2011.10-444,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2896.286,2899.487,And that's -- is that the question that the Court raised?
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2899.487,2900.839,"Yes, yes."
2011.10-444,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2900.839,2902.589,The Court was expecting you to address.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2902.589,2911.128,But we did file the petition challenging the -- the finding of the -- or the relief provided by the court below.
2011.10-444,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2911.128,2922.436,"You think that because we added a question that acts as the functional equivalent of a granted cross petition, that would permit modification of the judgment in your favor?"
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2922.436,2934.144,"No, but the last I -- the last I recall that cert petition was still pending, I may be wrong about that, I'm not sure, that it was just into this case."
2011.10-444,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2934.144,2957.693,"Are -- are you recognizing that the remedy that the Missouri Supreme Court did give was a futile remedy, that is, plead guilty, to have another open plea or trial, because this defendant apparently doesn't want to go to trial."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,2957.693,2967.899,"I think both of those are futile remedies, and -- and that's why it's really obvious that the remedy has to be something else."
2011.10-444,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2994.882,3009.473,"But why should -- now that we know what the judge's sentence was, and part of the plea offer was remade, the part about -- what was it, 3 years versus 10 days in jail?"
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,3009.473,3009.808,Yes.
2011.10-444,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3009.808,3016.828,"And the judge said, I'm not going to give him just 10 days, I'm willing to put him in jail for the whole 3 years."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,3029.986,3036.406,I -- I'm not sure that's entirely the only answer we can draw from this record.
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.657,3065.675,I'm not sure I understand the difference between an open plea and a plea agreement.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,3071.929,3076.8,The open plea basically means there is not an agreement between the parties.
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3083.821,3084.621,Okay.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,3084.621,3092.927,And I think that -- would leave the court with a little more flexibility than -- than he might otherwise exercise if they came to him with an agreement.
2011.10-444,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3092.927,3096.562,"I'm sorry, just to make sure."
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,3100.848,3101.498,Yes.
2011.10-444,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3101.498,3108.269,--always left it up to the judge whether to accept either the felony with shock treatment or misdemeanor with 90 days.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,3110.971,3125.898,"I think the deference to the trial court on probation was in that first one, the three years with defer to the Court on probation."
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3135.77,3136.72,"Well, he could still--"
2011.10-444,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3136.72,3137.439,Binding the judge?
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3137.439,3138.005,--He could--
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,3138.005,3138.939,--Not binding the judge.
2011.10-444,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3156.901,3158.267,He would have had to accept it.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,3158.267,3159.602,He would have had to accept--
2011.10-444,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3159.602,3161.368,But he would not have had to accept the 90 days.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,3161.368,3162.72,--He would not have had to accept the 90 days.
2011.10-444,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3162.72,3163.487,--But -- but you're--
2011.10-444,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3163.487,3164.17,I'm sorry.
2011.10-444,2,23000,emmett_d_queener,,3169.391,3174.362,I don't have proof in the record that he would have.
2011.10-444,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3209.533,3211.068,"Thank you, counsel."
