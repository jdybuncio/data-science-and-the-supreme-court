1977.76-944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.943,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 76-944, Nixon against Warner Communication and others."
1977.76-944,0,45144,william_h_jeffress_jr,,13.107,15.856,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-944,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,210.625,215.97,"Mr. Jeffress, during these proceedings, the trial was still going on in Judge Sirica’s Court, was it?"
1977.76-944,0,45144,william_h_jeffress_jr,,215.97,225.241,"During all of the proceedings that I have described so far, the trial was still going on and Judge Gesell’s December 5th opinion was entered before the trial was completed."
1977.76-944,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,342.884,355.99,"Mr. Jeffress, you said the ultimate question, but it may not be the ultimate question in the case is varied depending on the stage of other proceedings in the Courts involved?"
1977.76-944,0,45144,william_h_jeffress_jr,,355.99,368.808,"Your Honor if I understand your question, what I meant by the ultimate question in the case, was whether the tapes, given present circumstances, ought to be disseminated to the press and to members of the public."
1977.76-944,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,475.886,497.709,"Do you say then that even under this Court and the Court of Appeals and the District Courts, presume the housekeeping authority to decide what shall be done with exhibits until they are returned or exhibits that may not be the property of any one individual, it would not have the authority to grant the request of these respondents?"
1977.76-944,0,45144,william_h_jeffress_jr,,497.709,507.743,"Certainly, Your Honor, the Court has control of the exhibits and has authority to do with them anything that is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which they are in the Court’s custody."
1977.76-944,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1601.283,1604.194,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-944,2,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2443.129,2448.159,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-944,3,45144,william_h_jeffress_jr,,4131.569,4142.629,"If the Court please, to say that the injury that is involved here is one of the embarrassment, or one of mental anguish, does not it seems to me demean the importance of the injury that will be suffered."
1977.76-944,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4210.516,4219.607,Why was it that the Court did not restrict the tapes in Court and allowed them to be played rather than to transcript?
1977.76-944,3,45144,william_h_jeffress_jr,,4219.607,4221.512,That is a necessary --
1977.76-944,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4221.512,4234.853,"Getting back to my original discussion with you then not only the transcript was released from privacy, but also the voices were released from privacy, correct?"
1977.76-944,3,45144,william_h_jeffress_jr,,4234.853,4240.728,"Yes, Your Honor, the Court felt that that was an incident of a public trial that ought to be done."
1977.76-944,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4242.389,4252.663,"Could he not have ruled that you did not need, you should be satisfied with the transcript, but the Court said you needed both, did the Court not say that?"
1977.76-944,3,45144,william_h_jeffress_jr,,4252.663,4255.72,I am not aware of any order in which he said that there was a constitutional or other reason --
1977.76-944,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4255.72,4263.812,"Well, the Court did say that these could be played to the audience and everybody in that courtroom."
1977.76-944,3,45144,william_h_jeffress_jr,,4263.812,4264.773,"Yes, he did and he provided --"
1977.76-944,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4264.773,4267.792,They made it to that extent public?
1977.76-944,3,45144,william_h_jeffress_jr,,4267.792,4293.411,"That is correct Mr. Justice Marshall, but he did not rule at that time that while the tapes were going to be played in the courtroom and the trial was going to be conducted as publicly as a trial can possibly be, that once that trial was over, there was any right of the public, any interest in the public in obtaining copies of those tapes to do with them whatever the public pleased."
1977.76-944,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4376.476,4386.897,But does not the Act that we had before us last spring effect at least the property claim that your client might otherwise assert?
1977.76-944,3,45144,william_h_jeffress_jr,,4386.897,4394.939,"I believe the claim does affect any property right that he might assert, but as I have tried to say, there is no question here of title to the tapes."
1977.76-944,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4398.535,4402.716,Are you distinguishing between property and title?
1977.76-944,3,45144,william_h_jeffress_jr,,4402.716,4412.107,"One thing is clear, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, no I am not distinguishing between property and title, but I am saying that one thing that is clear is that the tapes are not the property of the Court."
1977.76-944,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4442.025,4451.134,Have these tapes now been delivered to the GSA pursuant to the opinions of sometime ago last year?
1977.76-944,3,45144,william_h_jeffress_jr,,4451.134,4456.01,"Mr. Chief Justice, I must confess that I do not know whether the underlying original recordings have been delivered."
1977.76-944,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4457.129,4468.265,"Assuming for a moment that they were in the possession of GSA and not of the clerk, would the GSA be a necessary party to any effort to reproduce them?"
1977.76-944,3,45144,william_h_jeffress_jr,,4468.265,4487.385,"Well, I certainly think that the Court could not grant effective relief if GSA were not a necessary party, but as the Court is aware and as explained in our reply brief, the GSA originally took the position that no tapes subject to that Act would be copied and provided to the media and the public."
1977.76-944,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4502.424,4519.888,"In other words, we are talking not just about a housekeeping policy, the Court or GSA is going to make its decision dependent on what the housekeeping policy of the clerks’ office of the District of Columbia is?"
1977.76-944,3,45144,william_h_jeffress_jr,,4519.888,4528.15,"Odd as that may seem, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that appears to be what is in the latest proposed regulations submitted by GSA to Congress."
1977.76-944,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4540.426,4541.56,"Thank you, gentlemen."
