1990.90-333,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.038,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-333, Lampf Pleva, et al. v. Gilbertson."
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,13.21,20.175,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.31,263.804,"Mr. Olson, these are problems that always exist whenever you borrow State statutes of limitations, but we've been doing it for a couple of hundred years."
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,274.001,283.748,"Well, it may... it may be from that standpoint generally preferable to pick a Federal uniform statute of limitations for a federally created right."
1990.90-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,308.757,311.707,Have you read the law of conflict of laws recently?
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,327.226,336.253,"Well, the commentators in the courts that have struggled with this, one judge from the Seventh Circuit said this is as enervating as it can possibly be in the Federal securities field."
1990.90-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,444.224,449.607,"Mr. Olson, do any of the States in causes of action like this apply a doctrine of latches?"
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,449.607,453.53,They do not apply the doctrine of latches--
1990.90-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,453.53,455.2,In lieu of a statute of limitations.
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,458.574,467.99,--They do not... the doctrine of latches generally would be applied in cases involving equity rather than cases for the vindication of private rights of action for damages in the 10(b) context.
1990.90-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.904,507.317,Has anyone sought to get legislation from Congress?
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,518.663,523.275,"Well, it's... as you know, Justice Scalia, it's not that simple necessarily to get a statute."
1990.90-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.275,524.447,"Well, maybe there isn't that much agreement."
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,524.447,531.641,Many of the commentators have agreed that congressional legislation in this area would be beneficial.
1990.90-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,539.357,560.458,"Well, Mr. Olson, in the Judicial Improvements Act passed a year ago, Congress did adopt a general 4-year statute of limitation, but apparently limited it to acts enacted after the enactment of the 4-year statute of limitations provision."
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,560.458,561.019,--Yes.
1990.90-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,561.019,563.56,"In other words, they didn't seek to apply it--"
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,563.56,564.802,"Yes, that's correct, Justice--"
1990.90-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,564.802,567.914,--to previous enactments or causes of actions.
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,571.157,579.422,"--I think that the Congress bit off in the judicial, or Justice Improvement Act, which was passed in 1990, about as much as it felt that it could chew at that particular point."
1990.90-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,584.024,587.858,"For all future acts of Congress, unless they provide otherwise expressly."
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,587.858,591.671,"--For all private remedies created by future acts of Congress, that's correct."
1990.90-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,591.671,594.185,"Well, maybe that should be a guidepost in this case."
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,594.185,604.3,"Well, the answer to that, I think, Justice O'Connor, is found in this Court's repeated statement, and most recently, or perhaps not most recently, but recently in footnote 1 in the Patterson v. McLean case."
1990.90-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,636.381,644.187,"Well, it considered some... a limitation period for those causes of action that Congress expressly created."
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,653.033,663.358,"--The court... the Congress at that time... that is correct, Justice O'Connor, because the cause of private right of action under Section 10(b) is implied from Section 10(b)."
1990.90-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,767.428,769.608,But are all those statutes identical with one another?
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,769.608,771.09,"No, they're not, Justice Stevens."
1990.90-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.382,905.208,"We weren't moved, evidently, by the fact that whenever Congress wanted a cause of action it adopted a statute of limitations for it."
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,908.48,909.67,--It... this--
1990.90-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,909.67,917.944,"I mean, you say every other, every instance in that statute where Congress created a private right of action, it enacted a statute of limitations for that cause of action, right?"
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,917.944,918.525,--That's correct.
1990.90-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.525,924.049,But we found that Congress really had in mind another cause of action without a statute of limitations.
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,924.049,926.142,You... this Court--
1990.90-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.142,928.292,"I mean, you can say we looked to it, but have we really used it?"
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,932.344,953.949,"--This... invariably when the Court has construed the scope and contours, whether sienter is required under Section 10(b), whether preponderance of the evidence or a clear and convincing standard, whether Section 10(b) is limited to purchasers and sellers, the Court has invariably turned to what Congress did in 1933 and 1934, the 73d Congress."
1990.90-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.943,1107.589,xxx true that the... is it the Insider Trading Act of '88 that the Commission relies on?
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1107.589,1109.209,"--Yes, Justice White."
1990.90-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1109.209,1121.146,"Well, isn't it true that that... that's the only time that there, that Congress has provided a statute of limitations with respect to a cause of action that can be... involve 10(b)?"
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1121.146,1124.609,It... in this sense only--
1990.90-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1124.609,1125.34,Isn't that right?
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1125.34,1127.11,"--Only in a very limited sense, Justice White."
1990.90-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1127.11,1128.282,"Well, that... well, anyway, it's right."
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1128.282,1131.714,"It's right only in a very limited sense, in the sense that a--"
1990.90-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1131.714,1133.675,"Well, tell me when it isn't right."
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1134.697,1135.178,--I will.
1990.90-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.592,1143.974,"Well, that's true, that's true."
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1152.609,1153.421,--That's correct.
1990.90-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1153.421,1157.091,And there is then an express statute of limitations for it.
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1157.091,1166.797,"Congress expressly decided... you're correct in stating that Congress expressly decided for a narrow band, a very peculiar type of Section 10(b) violations."
1990.90-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1170.77,1171.249,I agree with that.
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1173.252,1174.271,--It does involve 10(b).
1990.90-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.182,1180.396,Why shouldn't... why isn't that the closest statute that we should look to?
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1180.396,1182.529,"--Well, there are several reasons why that is not the closest."
1990.90-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1209.584,1223.495,So... so you suggest we have... there are two... you suggest two statutes of limitations that would be... that would apply this... different 10(b) actions?
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1231.87,1233.19,--There is already the one--
1990.90-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1233.19,1233.72,Is that right?
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1233.72,1242.846,"--Not... no, Justice White, because there are already the 1 and 3-year statute of limitations that apply to many of the facts that might be pleaded under Section 10(b)."
1990.90-333,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1242.846,1243.307,Right.
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1243.307,1259.339,"The 1988 statute carved out a very narrow niche of people trading on inside information who may sue contemporaneous traders for a very limited remedy, that is, they may only recover the profit of the contemporaneous trader in the same type of securities."
1990.90-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1292.258,1299.854,"Mr. Olson, were... are there any other overlaps in the 1988 statute?"
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1308.85,1326.612,"That limitations period covers any... let me put it this way, Justice Scalia, that that statute creates a right, a remedy for a violation of either Section 10(b) or other... violation of other provisions of the '34 act."
1990.90-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1326.612,1328.102,Which already have their own statute of limitations?
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1328.102,1329.905,Which already have their own statute of limitations.
1990.90-333,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1329.905,1342.511,"So it wouldn't be at all unusual for that 1988 statute to duplicate the 1 and 3-year statute that you're arguing for, it already duplicates other ones?"
1990.90-333,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1342.511,1343.993,That's exact... that's precisely correct.
1990.90-333,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1550.588,1552.188,"Very well, Mr. Olson."
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,1554.04,1559.334,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-333,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1609.897,1613.77,As it is where it's used elsewhere in the Federal securities acts.
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,1613.77,1622.085,--The other Federal securities acts are not antifraud remedies.
1990.90-333,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1661.9,1664.761,Even if you showed fraud it would do you no good.
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,1666.824,1668.585,Under the express remedies?
1990.90-333,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1668.585,1669.166,Yes.
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,1669.166,1669.887,Yes.
1990.90-333,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1688.598,1691.769,Is there always intentional fraud in a 10b-5 violation?
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,1691.769,1701.517,"No, Your Honor, most courts hold that recklessness is also sufficient, but they do not hold that negligence is sufficient or that there are strict liability causes of action."
1990.90-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1918.32,1921.71,Should have discovered in the exercise of reasonable care?
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,1921.71,1923.092,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2036.147,2048.164,"Well then one... another result is that the statute of limitations which you say is actually applied has really no connection with any other statute of limitations at all, if it doesn't even represent the State statute."
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,2048.164,2050.565,--I'm not following you.
1990.90-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2050.565,2059.801,"It's... well, from what you say, the duration is taken from the State, but the Federal courts are insisting that it be discovery based."
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,2068.085,2069.697,"No, I don't think it's right."
1990.90-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2072.08,2073.369,"But only part of it, you say."
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,2073.369,2077.934,"--They are... well, they have never acknowledged that they were borrowing part of it."
1990.90-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2086.139,2091.371,"Well, but Holmbrecht against Arm... what's the name of the respondent?"
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,2092.112,2093.463,Holmberg v. Armbrecht.
1990.90-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2093.463,2099.386,"--Holmberg against Armbrecht was never laid down as a formula to apply to all statutes of limitations, was it, by this Court?"
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,2099.386,2100.838,"I think it was, yes."
1990.90-333,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.065,2134.94,Are you going to... suppose we disagree with you on whether the State law should apply.
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,2143.184,2143.775,All right.
1990.90-333,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2335.903,2337.022,Mr. Allen--
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,2358.857,2373.888,"I think you... that that is the position that this Court better figure on, because that statute has been interpreted numerous times... not numerous times, but a number of times, as it applies to the express remedies, and the courts always hold that it is a statute of repose."
1990.90-333,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2375.06,2375.888,Have we held that?
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,2375.888,2377.32,"--No, you haven't."
1990.90-333,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2377.32,2381.483,Not yet.
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,2391.089,2391.529,Very close.
1990.90-333,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2391.529,2395.502,--Suppose 2 years from now Congress passes yet another statute that is even closer?
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,2405.347,2407.03,I read your dissent in Malley-Duff.
1990.90-333,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2452.448,2469.961,"Of course that problem of jumping from statute to statute is, I suppose, an argument for Mr. Olson's position of sticking with the limitations from the statute that this cause of action is derived from."
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,2472.262,2475.495,I agree with that.
1990.90-333,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2502.34,2507.095,"Well, really what Blue Chip said was the oak had grown so big it was too late to saw it down."
1990.90-333,1,23533,f_gordon_allen_iii,,2508.885,2509.926,Exactly.
1990.90-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2579.931,2581.343,"Very well, Mr. Allen."
1990.90-333,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2583.764,2584.555,I'll be very brief.
1990.90-333,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2584.555,2586.557,You'll have to be.
1990.90-333,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2589.809,2601.817,One of the points that respondents make is that there must be a discovery-based statute of limitations in the securities fraud area.
1990.90-333,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.745,2635.227,But your opponent says that those were not fraud actions.
1990.90-333,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2635.227,2646.056,"Well, the problem with what my opponent says with respect to those are not being fraud actions, is that Congress repeatedly characterized those actions as fraud actions."
1990.90-333,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2762.49,2763.281,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
