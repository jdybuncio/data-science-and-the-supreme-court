1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.397,"We'll hear argument now in Number 91-6646, Verl Hadley v. the United States."
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,12.65,13.24,Trebon.
1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,13.24,13.811,Trebon.
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,14.522,17.982,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,176.868,182.422,"Mr. Trebon, how does this bear on the questions presented here, which seem to deal mostly with Rule 403?"
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,182.422,183.48,--That's true.
1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,228.683,236.697,"Well, it's an issue like any other element of a crime in which the Government bears a burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, isn't it?"
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,236.697,253.87,"--Yes, Chief Justice, that's true, but the intent required in this case was merely the statute follows the model penal code which requires that when you touch someone that you do it with the desire to harass, humiliate, to arouse or satisfy the sexual desire of any person."
1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,261.615,264.877,"But it's still there, and the Government has to prove it."
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,264.877,269.371,"That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, it is there, and the Government does have to prove it."
1992.91-6646,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,273.003,285.92,"Well, as to count IX, I take it that there could have been a plausible defense that the actions did occur but that they were innocent."
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,285.92,301.441,"Theoretically, Justice Kennedy, that's true, but no such defense was put forward, number 1, and number 2, the predicate for establishing, if the Government needed a prior bad act to establish what was going on in count IX, was established by count VIII."
1992.91-6646,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,301.441,306.426,Did he deny that the count IX acts occurred at all?
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,306.426,307.185,Yes.
1992.91-6646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,328.419,349.854,"Do you have to... I thought you were arguing that just as a per se rule that if... there's a stipulation about intent, that if these acts occurred, they occurred intentionally, that that... then no prior conduct evidence should be admitted."
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,349.854,353.367,"--Justice White, we are not saying that there's a per se rule."
1992.91-6646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,356.178,356.819,"Well, why aren't you?"
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,359.191,386.74,"--Because we believe that Rule 403 is designed to give trial courts broad discretion, and we're saying that the offer to stipulate as to the issue of intent should have been a factor considered under Rule 403, and moreover, if it had been a factor considered under Rule 403, in this case it would have tipped the balance in favor of exclusion of all this massive amount of prior misconduct evidence to prove an issue of intent that was transparent from the nature of the acts alone."
1992.91-6646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.74,397.177,"Mr. Trebon, the Government contends that there were other purposes for introducing it that supported its relevance in the case and not just its relevance to the intent."
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,398.539,402.781,"Well, Justice Scalia, first of all it could have never been considered for any other purpose in this case."
1992.91-6646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,412.718,413.269,Wait a minute.
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,415.039,416.299,"--Intent, preparation, and planning."
1992.91-6646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,416.299,418.552,"Intent, preparation, and planning."
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,418.552,419.691,Right.
1992.91-6646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.691,422.213,"Well, that's beyond intent, isn't it?"
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,422.213,430.67,Although in this case they were also instructed... when the jury instruction was first drafted it was drafted to be used as an intent instruction.
1992.91-6646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.209,498.334,"Well, I mean, plan could cover such things as, you know, why he invited children to his home."
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,516.495,517.135,Justice Scalia--
1992.91-6646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.135,527.114,"--But I must say that if the instruction was you must first establish from other evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the acts occurred, then it would have been irrelevant to the planning, wouldn't it."
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,527.114,528.245,"--It would have, Your Honor."
1992.91-6646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.186,531.969,"Of course, maybe that instruction was wrong."
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,531.969,540.975,"Well, there's... one thing's for sure, though, I'm sure you'd agree, Justice Scalia, you certainly couldn't use the evidence now for some basis that the jury couldn't use it for."
1992.91-6646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,551.812,552.593,I don't--
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,552.593,553.214,--And no one is arguing--
1992.91-6646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,553.214,553.765,--Is that right?
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,563.749,577.439,"--In other words, we don't know how much calculus the jury added to the weight of this evidence at trial, and it would be impossible to redetermine that if we submit it to the jury for another purpose when we know they didn't consider it for that purpose."
1992.91-6646,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,588.156,590.617,Are the instructions in the appendix that you refer to?
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,590.617,592.467,"Yes, Your Honor, they are."
1992.91-6646,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,608.418,614.652,Is it correct that plan was neither an element of any offense charged nor an issue in the case as it was tried?
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,614.652,623.509,"Yes, Justice Souter, that is true, because plan does have to involve some chain of events, something that's in the mind of the actor."
1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,679.685,685.799,"This, too, doesn't really bear on the question presented, does it, the fact that one witness may have surprised you?"
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,685.799,709.635,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think it does to the extent when we weigh the amount of evidence necessary to establish intent in this case and we weigh the heavy amount of effect that the prior misconduct evidence had, we can see, I hope it crystallizes the notion, that a stipulation would have taken care of the matter or significantly changed--"
1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,709.635,720.203,"Yes, I understand that point, but I don't understand how that point is aided by your contention that you had no notice of what this witness was going to testify to, that you were surprised."
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,720.203,729.61,"--Well, actually, in Rule 403, unfai surprise was kept out of the rule itself but it's in the comment, and it says that's also a factor for the trial judge to consider."
1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,744.239,763.821,"Well, supposing you have a crime defined as consisting of four elements, do you think a defendant can come into court and say, I'll stipulate to three of these elements and therefore the Government should not be allowed to introduce any evidence on those three and we'll just try one element?"
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,763.821,766.793,--I think in the usual case that would not be allowed.
1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,766.793,767.985,Why not?
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,767.985,775.859,"Because the Government is allowed to put forth its full evidence, the moral force of its evidence on the elements at stake."
1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,783.524,788.689,"Well, I'm talking about elements of the crime to stipulate out of a case, and not acts."
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,788.689,790.878,"--Well, I think... then I would make another distinction."
1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,810.1,827.872,"You say anytime, then, that a defendant offers to stipulate to an element of a crime charged, and the Government wishes to use some sort of prior bad acts evidence, the stipulation is a factor regardless of anything else."
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,827.872,829.003,Sure.
1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.762,908.356,"But of course, the fact you don't raise a defense doesn't mean that the Government doesn't have to prove that element."
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,919.054,922.704,"That's true, Mr. Chief Justice, and that's how criminal cases are different than civil cases."
1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,939.805,942.238,"Well, you affirmatively offered to stipulate."
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,942.238,943.047,Yes.
1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,943.047,945.331,The Government did not join in your stipulation.
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,945.331,947.524,"We believe that's the error below, certainly one of them."
1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,955.868,958.5,You think the Government should have been required to stipulate?
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,960.25,963.623,I think the Government should have been required to stipulate in this case.
1992.91-6646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,973.411,974.092,Well--
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,992.013,993.603,"I'm sorry, let me try to clarify it."
1992.91-6646,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1013.876,1022.832,I take it another way of saying that is the Government can be required to stipulate as a precondition to the admission of the prior bad acts.
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,1022.832,1029.946,"Justice Kennedy, I would say that the Government could be required to stipulate instead of allowing the prior bad acts."
1992.91-6646,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1033.361,1034.799,Yes.
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,1035.29,1035.81,Yes.
1992.91-6646,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1035.81,1037.093,"Of course, you're not even arguing you're not even going that far here."
1992.91-6646,0,33187,john_trebon,,1056.377,1086.084,"Well, Justice Scalia, you're correct, although I suppose my position now would be that now that the Government's conceded in their brief that everyone, according to the Government, agrees that it should be a factor considered under Rule 403, I'd like to go on and convince you that in this case you can see by looking at the relevant factors it would have changed the equation, that if the stipulation would have been accepted, then the need for this evidence is obviously trivial and the prejudice from it is overwhelming."
1992.91-6646,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1465.828,1470.171,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-6646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1555.768,1557.899,"Mr. Bryson, before you leave the relevance--"
1992.91-6646,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1557.899,1558.55,--Certainly.
1992.91-6646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1558.55,1564.834,"--Part of your three steps, you argue three grounds of relevance in your brief as I read it."
1992.91-6646,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1581.835,1589.488,"Your Honor, the judge I think gave... the answer is, I think it is consistent, although the instruction I think was unduly narrow."
1992.91-6646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1618.199,1622.451,"No, but your first point is the question whether petitioner had physical contact."
1992.91-6646,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1622.451,1623.082,--Yes.
1992.91-6646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1623.082,1635.329,"You say it was relevant to that, and it seemed to me that's flatly inconsistent with the judge's instruction that you may not consider the evidence without first finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the facts occurred--"
1992.91-6646,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1635.329,1636.401,"Well, first of all--"
1992.91-6646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1636.401,1637.721,--And he did say that unambiguously.
1992.91-6646,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1637.721,1656.684,"--Well, Your Honor, I think first of all that there is... I don't think it's really inconsistent with the judge's notion that... the judge I think had a very broad notion of what preparation and plan was, and he understood that to mean that evidence going to whether there was a sequence of events leading to a particular--"
1992.91-6646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1656.684,1667.461,"Well, he says you can't consider it unless you first find that the other evidence in the case standing alone establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Hadley did the particular acts charged in the indictment--"
1992.91-6646,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1667.461,1668.222,"--Well, that's right."
1992.91-6646,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1668.222,1670.482,--Which would include that the... whether they had physical contact.
1992.91-6646,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1670.482,1682.25,"That's right, so that... but that doesn't mean that this evidence didn't in some respect bear on that question, even though they would have, under the instruction, already had to have decided that they were satisfied that there was physical contact."
1992.91-6646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1733.983,1738.908,"You say it would remove any doubts, but he says you can't even use it unless you don't have any doubts."
1992.91-6646,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1738.908,1740.127,"Well, except--"
1992.91-6646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1740.127,1742.55,He says you have to have been satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.
1992.91-6646,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1742.55,1771.61,"--Except that there are two questions that Amadee R.'s testimony bears on: 1) the question of whether the event occurred, but 2) and significantly for purposes of the instruction, the question of whether his testimony reflects intent on the part of the defendant, so if you believe that that event occurred as Amadee R. described it, then you conclude that there must have been intent on the part of the defendant, or at least you conclude that there's a very... a much more powerful case to be made for intent."
1992.91-6646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.61,1773.109,"Okay, but you're back--"
1992.91-6646,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1775.252,1776.312,"That's right, and that's--"
1992.91-6646,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1776.312,1780.875,"We're trying to find out if there's some other purpose, other than intent, for which it was properly--"
1992.91-6646,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1780.875,1781.424,"--Well, corroboration."
1992.91-6646,2,33187,john_trebon,,3300.219,3302.109,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-6646,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3462.434,3469.789,Do you deny that your client touched these students?
1992.91-6646,2,33187,john_trebon,,3469.789,3470.52,Yes.
1992.91-6646,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3470.52,3471.57,At all.
1992.91-6646,2,33187,john_trebon,,3471.57,3472.331,Yes.
1992.91-6646,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3559.637,3562.1,"Well, what if the instruction was in fact wrong?"
1992.91-6646,2,33187,john_trebon,,3567.003,3574.507,"Well, this was admitted for a limited purpose, as all 404(b) is."
1992.91-6646,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3596.422,3599.564,"Yes, but what if the limiting instruction was unduly restrictive?"
1992.91-6646,2,33187,john_trebon,,3603.057,3610.721,"Well, I think it makes... it gives the Government a major problem if they're trying to tell you now that that evidence should have been used for some other purpose, number 1."
1992.91-6646,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3649.887,3651.85,"Wait, those instructions were given at the end."
1992.91-6646,2,33187,john_trebon,,3657.083,3664.957,At my request the instructions were given to the jury simultaneously with the testimony of the prior bad act witnesses.
1992.91-6646,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3670.091,3671.803,"Thank you, Mr. Trebon."
