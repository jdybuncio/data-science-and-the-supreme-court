1956.445,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.949,"Number 445, Lake Tankers Corporation, Petitioner, versus Lillian M. Henn, Administratrix."
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,12.883,19.155,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please."
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,131.556,135.362,What was the second general -- what was the second proceeding in the state court?
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,135.362,136.362,There were two actions in the state court.
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,136.362,136.705,Yes.
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,138.434,144.581,"Yes, Your Honor, and the other one was on behalf of four of the passengers who combined in one action."
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,150.559,152.541,Did you said also the Blackstone?
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,152.541,153.603,Also the Blackstone.
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,153.696,158.287,Did they -- they brought suit against the barge and the tug as well as the Blackstone?
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,158.287,161.475,"If Your Honor please, the -- the action in the state court was in personam against the petitioner here."
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,161.475,163.549,"Yes, I understand that."
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,163.89,169.728,They claimed for the loss of the Blackstone which was the little yacht.
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,171.233,171.927,Yes.
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,171.927,173.808,The barge was number 38 and --
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,173.808,175.768,(Inaudible) down slow.
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,180.621,181.781,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,181.781,186.889,Against the tug -- against the owner of the tug and also the Blackstone owner?
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,186.889,187.637,Yes.
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,187.637,188.093,I see.
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,188.093,190.269,Yes.
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,197.192,200.113,And that loss -- for the loss of the vessel that was brought in the state court?
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,200.113,201.146,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,201.146,202.568,Under what?
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,203.452,206.383,Yes.
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,425.788,427.668,Why would it came to the District Court?
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,427.668,428.258,"I'm sorry, in the state court."
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,428.258,429.093,State court.
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,429.093,432.509,"I misstated, I misspoken myself, in the state court."
1956.445,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,582.321,587.889,There is no -- no change in the common ownership of the barge and the tug at any point along the line?
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,587.889,588.415,"No, Your Honor."
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,638.897,640.352,"You do not challenge with that, do you?"
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,640.352,641.806,"Yes, I do, sir."
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,642.328,643.053,You do challenge?
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,643.053,644.476,I do.
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,671.286,683.837,"Could you -- would you be good enough to state affirmatively what it is you do contend for in challenging that if the fund exceeds the claims, the basis for limitations doesn't exist?"
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,683.837,685.559,"Yes, if Your Honor please."
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,733.137,735.705,It's a bill in equity to -- it's a bill of interpleader as it were.
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,735.705,735.909,Yes.
1956.445,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,741.438,757.932,"Suppose the value -- suppose the value of the ship was intimately more than the aggregate of the claims, do you -- would you -- you'll still believe that the limitation of liability proceedings should require all claims to be brought in?"
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,757.932,762.871,"If Your Honor please, I think that it gets back to a matter of good faith, if I may answer your question that way."
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,893.285,900.589,"That's a very different thing from regarding it merely as a suit, as a proceeding to avoid multiplicity of suits."
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,900.589,903.815,I don't think it can be sustained solely on that ground.
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,905.712,908.615,"Yes I -- well, that mean -- that alone isn't sufficient."
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,911.591,920.155,"If Your Honor please, I -- my argument is based upon what I concede to be the law as developed by the cases over this period of 75 years or more."
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,920.429,928.773,Is it the general principle in equity if the Court is ceased of jurisdiction and if it turns out that -- there couldn't be a grant of injunction.
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,936.14,936.479,Well I --
1956.445,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,936.479,938.803,-- that your -- all right.
1956.445,0,23325,eugene_underwood,,941.269,948.235,"I was about to say a moment ago, I think, the grounds for Judge Hincks' dissent."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,2905.471,2907.987,Mr. Chief Justice and this Honorable Court.
1956.445,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2907.987,2911.177,Mr. Mason.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,2911.177,2937.748,"I think that it may clarify the picture, somewhat, if I should start from the beginning of this history of the opposing rights of a common law suitor as against this right of limitation granted by the 1851 statute."
1956.445,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,3342.681,3349.985,But they're still suing -- suing the state courts and not suing in -- in rem and that's likely to suing the owner.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3349.985,3359.837,"That suit in the state court, Your Honor, was being strained off course, you see, by the restraining order in the limitation proceeding, the one that puts it --"
1956.445,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,3359.837,3362.442,Was it proceeding solely in rem?
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3362.442,3365.212,"The limitation proceeding is solely in rem, Your Honor."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3383.441,3394.99,"The limitation proceedings just for the -- the matter of mechanic, was there a petition?One petition for limiting liability on the barge and one on the tug?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3394.99,3395.88,"No, sir."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3460.623,3475.797,"Well apart from posting, before you get to posting security, the security has posted for something in the limitation proceeding, was there a request for the limitation of these both against barge and tug?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3475.797,3476.775,No.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3476.775,3486.071,Suppose the -- as you stated that the limitation was merely for the -- for the -- for -- what was it called?
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3486.071,3486.472,"The tug, Eastern Cities."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3486.472,3488.168,"The tug, Eastern Cities."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3493.378,3493.989,"Oh yes, sir."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3493.989,3496.062,"It was the Court -- City and the Eastern, tug --"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3496.062,3496.379,That's right.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3496.379,3503.807,"And you hold it and -- and people get out of it whatever they got out it, would the barge also had to be delivered in that limitation proceeding?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3503.807,3504.596,No.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3504.596,3506.967,Well then there's no limitation proceeding against the barge at all.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3506.967,3507.187,Yes.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3507.187,3507.728,Is that it?
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3507.728,3507.966,Yes.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3515.568,3516.616,I saw that.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3516.616,3517.542,You see that?
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3528.508,3542.822,"I understand that but I do not see how restraining state action ipso facto or automatically operate as a limitation proceeding against -- against the barge, does it?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3553.782,3554.825,"Oh no, no, Your Honor."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3554.825,3558.231,"Well, then was there any limitation against the barge at all?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3558.231,3580.162,"The Court must have assumed that there was of this reason, because -- because Judge Ryan held that unless they posted a bond for the barge within 10 days, then the restraining order of which had been previously issued would have no effect as to the barge but only with respect to the petitioner and the tug."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3580.162,3605.735,"I -- I think I understand that, but I'm wondering what would have happened if after the petition of Lake Tankers Corporation had been filed, they then said and they had made an offer and we -- we had brought in and handed over to the -- whatever you call it, to the Court, it would be the clerk or any, it turned over to the clerk , the barge and the -- and the tug, would they, under that petition?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3608.57,3608.806,No.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3608.947,3616.995,Because I'm interested in the second aspect of Judge Hincks' opinion to which you duly come that this isn't two proceedings but one proceeding.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3616.995,3622.41,"It is one proceeding in which they, themselves, contended, Your Honor, that there were two funds."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3630.331,3637.176,"Is that the -- that's the whole sticking part whether by reducing the claim and making allocation, you make these two proceedings?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3637.176,3637.656,"Your Honor, I --"
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3637.656,3640.853,"Suppose there had been no funds, I'm -- I'm trying to forget about the funds as a basis."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3640.853,3642.019,"Yes, sir."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3642.019,3653.475,Suppose the -- the Lake Tankers Corporation had surrendered the -- the vessels themselves no -- no posting of bonds.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3664.359,3666.019,I think so for this reason.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3676.873,3677.838,"But they didn't do it, did they?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3677.838,3678.887,They didn't do that.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3717.618,3720.556,"Well, as a matter of fact, nobody wouldn't know what the amounts were on that."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3720.556,3721.274,True.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3927.478,3942.977,"But Judge -- Judge Augustus Hand in the Aquitania, according to Judge Addison Brown points out, indicate that it's so different if you got a single claim -- a single claimant, who wants to go into the state court has a right to go, is enjoined by a federal court to make --"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3942.977,3944.153,"That's right, Your Honor."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3944.153,3945.427,-- that there is a difference --
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3945.427,3945.57,"Oh, yes."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3945.57,3946.739,I'm not saying what the consequence --
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3946.739,3946.851,"Yes, yes."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3946.851,3950.808,"-- is of the difference, but there is a difference between many suits as in a single suit."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,3950.808,3952.097,"All true, true."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4004.02,4009.635,"Isn't -- you would agree, wouldn't you, that this is different from any of those other cases."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4023.814,4024.14,"Yes, sir."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4024.14,4028.586,-- whether you can use limitations for little piece purposes.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4028.586,4029.235,That's right.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4029.235,4038.243,"But this case is a different one, namely, or how that in other cases in which this situation arise only they've got two vessels?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4038.243,4040.747,"Now, it is a different case to that extent, Your Honor."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4040.747,4043.748,"Well, have there been other cases of two vessels?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4049.406,4049.614,You --
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4049.614,4057.352,-- and then allocations sought to be made by the claimant against the two vessels in order to bring about an inadequacy of the fund?
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4057.352,4058.366,No.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4062.631,4063.775,"Well that's what this is, isn't it?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4063.775,4066.689,-- I think you've picked that up from my friend's brief or from his argument.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4066.689,4069.182,"Well, I couldn't have picked it up from his brief because I haven't read it."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4069.182,4070.191,"Well, here is the difference --"
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4070.191,4071.78,Don't blame originality though --
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4071.78,4072.263,[Laughs]
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4072.263,4073.784,-- I thought of the word as a familiar one.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4073.784,4082.832,"Here is the difference, and Mr. Underwood and I have had this out in the lower courts and in the Circuit Court three times now."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4121.633,4135.689,"I didn't know innuendo was carried by my word of allocation but the reality of the situation is that the proctors in this case did what lawyers are entitled to do, they dealt with the (Inaudible) the minority come within certain jurisdiction."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4136.752,4137.189,That's right.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4137.189,4147.299,"This is held and didn't sit down and say, “I got an -- I now realize that there are $150,000 against the tug and $100,000 against the barge if I subverts that she didn't do that?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4147.299,4147.738,Oh no.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4147.738,4149.6,For lawyers that -- could her lawyers were there?
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4149.6,4150.189,Absolutely.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4150.189,4152.337,Come within decisions and the rules of law.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4152.337,4153.728,"That's true, Your Honor."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4166.474,4168.535,"Well, we are here and you are here."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4172.144,4173.167,He got the restraining order.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4173.167,4174.943,I say that he wasn't entitled to get it.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4174.943,4175.647,That's right.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4175.647,4177.596,And so that's the question of law so that --
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4177.596,4178.151,"It is, Your Honor."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4178.151,4180.39,-- if it's entitled to it then she must be restrained.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4182.152,4184.457,"That's true, I -- I go along with that."
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4184.457,4192.573,"Mr. Mason, one thing that puzzles me, how -- I gather the respondents claim is for damages, isn't it?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4192.573,4192.692,"Yes, sir."
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4192.692,4194.493,For the death of her husband?
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4199.155,4200.587,"Yes, sir."
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4200.587,4205.521,"Well she is worth -- entitled to her recovery only in the X dollars, that's the value of the claims, isn't it?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4205.521,4207.306,That's right.
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4207.306,4218.705,"I -- I don't quite understand how you divide that claim into X minus Y as against one vessel and make it Y as against the other vessel, how do you do that?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4218.705,4225.813,"Well, it sounds -- it sounds unusual, Your Honor, but you -- what you see and how -- what brought that about?"
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4226.416,4227.563,I'm -- I'm not --
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4227.563,4227.902,No.
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4227.902,4229.454,"I -- I know what brought that about, I've heard you say."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4229.454,4230.149,Yes.
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4230.149,4233.773,"I'm just interested how, as a matter of law, do you divide the claim in that?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4233.773,4253.058,"When the petitioner says there were two funds and I may have liability as a tug owner and I may have liability as a barge owner and her suit is pending in Ulster County against the petitioner charging frauds on the petitioner for frauds and -- of the person, owner tug and of the barge, the one against the barge being only with respect to inadequate light."
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4296.546,4299.928,"Well, actually, she's putting one price tag on --"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4299.928,4300.027,That's true.
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4300.027,4306.185,-- on her death -- on the amount of her damages as against one vessel and another price tag on the other?
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4306.185,4306.684,That's -- that's --
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4306.684,4312.632,"Because as I've always I understood it, she has a single claim for damages worth of X dollars."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4312.632,4321.13,"Well, I suppose that it might -- I might be criticized for the numbers I have picked, Your Honor."
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4321.515,4324.641,"Yes, but can you -- I'm not neglecting any occurrences at all."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4328.878,4328.95,I see --
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4328.95,4337.244,-- the proper answer to that but I don't -- I -- I don't understand if this is a matter of law or how you divide up a single claim worth X dollars in that way?
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4337.244,4337.613,"Well, Your Honor --"
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4337.613,4340.966,But if for example they were not the same owner here.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4340.966,4341.059,All right.
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4341.059,4342.667,"That these were two different vessels, isn't that enough?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4342.667,4343.366,Yes.
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4390.045,4390.728,These two proceedings.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4390.728,4395.197,"-- as if there were two separate funds, they having propounded this theory --"
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4395.197,4405.085,"Well, you see what's bothering me goes deeper than that, I -- it would seem to me that there's a single claim upon which you put a price of $250,000."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4405.085,4405.682,That's right.
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4405.682,4413.731,"Now, why that isn't what you're required to assert in both proceedings even if they were separate proceedings is what I have difficulty following."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4413.731,4417.954,"Well, Your Honor, you say why -- we aren't required to do that."
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4506.782,4511.779,"Well, I suppose actually in the state court suit you have a recovery of $100,000."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4511.779,4513.078,"Yes, sir."
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4513.078,4523.549,"In this instance, I suppose there's no problem whether you collect it out of the barge or out of the tug, the $100,000 is out of the same owner in any event."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4523.549,4523.884,"Yes, sir."
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4523.884,4530.598,"But suppose you had, at least, two different owners and you have collected the $100,000.00 and you've done just what you've done here."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4532.519,4533.616,Well --
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4533.616,4538.46,"Do you take it all out of one and all out of the tug, for example, and forget the barge?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4538.46,4540.403,"I -- I think in the state courts, you could do that, you could --"
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4540.403,4547.42,"No, no, under the circumstances you have described for us that you can't do anything except collect now either the tug or on the barge, isn't that what you've said with the --"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4547.42,4554.657,"I would file my claim in each proceeding in no doubt, the Southern District Admiralty Court having the two proceedings would control my --"
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4554.657,4555.825,And divide up the damages --
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4555.825,4556.131,"Yes, sir."
1956.445,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4556.131,4556.687,-- as among -- between --
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4556.687,4556.872,Yes sir.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4556.872,4560.672,But they would merely have -- they would merely have the money of judgment.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4560.672,4561.008,That's right.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4561.008,4561.851,All they would have --
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4561.851,4562.904,That's right.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4562.904,4566.021,What is your answer to Justice Brennan's question?
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4575.45,4604.749,"Well I -- I would assume, Your Honor, that the District Court would -- in -- in the handling of the fund say that if this fall around the part of both vessels and if there were two proceedings that those -- they should divide it evenly because even under your principles of admiralty law with respect to collision, where you have both to blame, the damages are divided."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4607.689,4615.161,Wouldn't you have -- wouldn't some of the issues of liability be determined in the state court or under your common lawsuit?
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4618.54,4618.816,Well --
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4618.816,4621.032,And would that be relitigated in the limitation proceeding?
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4621.032,4621.757,No.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4622.169,4625.324,"Well then, what would be res judicata?"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4625.324,4638.702,"The -- the question that we could not raise in the state court is seaworthiness or the privity or knowledge of the owner of the vessel, both of which are parental questions relating strictly to limitation, you see."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4711.338,4713.56,Were there are two vessels in Langnes against Green?
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4713.56,4714.049,Just one.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4714.049,4714.538,Just one.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4714.538,4715.342,"Yes, sir."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4715.342,4720.698,"Now, would -- I think I'll ask you this question but not as explicitly that I shall now."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4730.178,4731.789,"No.No, Your Honor."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4741.412,4746.03,"You couldn't say there were two funds, you could merely state the external facts of those, there were two vessels."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4746.03,4746.591,That's right.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4746.591,4749.005,"If you got two funds, then you might have two funds."
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4749.005,4749.491,That's right.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4749.491,4751.781,That you put in different banks into your --
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4751.781,4751.892,That's true.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4751.892,4754.905,If we have two vessels and that's merely the fact that there were two vessels here.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4754.905,4759.164,"That's right, Your Honor."
1956.445,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4759.164,4759.84,"Mr. Mason, does --"
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4759.84,4761.838,Yes.
1956.445,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4761.838,4783.397,-- does this finding of -- or -- or part of the order of Judge Weinfeld quoted in the opinion of the majority in this case answer to Mr. Justice Brennan's question as it appears on page 62 at the top there.
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4834.921,4835.368,"Yes, sir."
1956.445,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4835.368,4843.028,Now is it your -- is it your position that that -- that that does state the limits of your recovery --
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4843.028,4843.654,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.445,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4843.654,4845.239,-- and separates your recovery --
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4845.239,4845.992,"Yes, sir."
1956.445,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4845.992,4848.898,-- so that you can be ascertainable by --
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4848.898,4848.954,Yes.
1956.445,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4848.954,4849.969,-- by an appellate court even?
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4849.969,4850.526,"Yes, sir."
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4926.332,4927.717,Too many sacred rights and --
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4927.717,4928.27,That's right.
1956.445,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4928.27,4929.93,-- and this case permit --
1956.445,1,24403,frank_c_mason,,4929.93,4935.304,"But I think there is the distinction that I think the Court should recognize for this -- pardon me, Your Honor."
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,5770.993,5780.082,"May I address myself first to Mr. Justice Black's question, I'd like to answer that, I'm afraid a little differently than Mr. Mason did."
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5940.823,5959.248,"What is the limitation -- what is the amount of the claim that the admiralty court as it barred them to accept as enough against the -- for the debts of these people, what is the amount?"
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,5959.248,5960.617,I'm not quite sure that I understand Your Honors question.
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5960.617,5962.305,What I mean is this and I understand --
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,5962.305,5963.368,The aggregate of claims of --
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5963.368,5967.848,-- that they have reduced the amount or that they originally claim from something to something.
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,5967.848,5969.287,"$259,000."
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5969.287,5970.902,"$259,000."
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,5970.902,5972.057,"Yes, sir."
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5972.057,5975.863,Can they -- is it possible for them to get any more than that?
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,5975.863,5976.316,No.
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5976.316,5982.065,Either -- if they try the case before jury or if they try the case before admiralty court?
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,5982.065,5982.782,Not now.
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5982.782,5993.918,"And if that is the amount of damages that the -- these people have suffered, I suppose you would agree that they're entitled to recover that money if it should be found that that's the amount they --"
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,5993.918,6000.806,If it -- if it should be found that the tug and barge are both liable.
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6000.806,6001.454,Now --
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6001.454,6007.116,"But if Your Honor please, you see the value of each vessel is less than that so let us suppose that only the tug is liable --"
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6007.116,6008.745,Who owned -- who owned both vessels?
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6008.745,6009.95,"Same company, this petitioner."
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6009.95,6022.321,Same company and will that company -- does that company stand a little to a dime more unless the jury gives more by having the case tried at the state court --
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6022.321,6022.798,Yes.
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6022.798,6023.738,-- than in the federal court?
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6023.738,6025.035,Yes.
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6025.035,6029.102,"Can it lose any more than $259,000?"
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6029.102,6046.683,"No, but it can lose more than the value of the tug if the federal court should hold that only the tug is liable, it could lose more than the value of the tug if the jury brings in a verdict of $250,000 and the federal court holds that only the tug is liable, then we're entitled to limit our liability to $110,000."
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6050.89,6055.222,What point does the Court order provided but what does the courts order provided up there?
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6055.222,6064.281,"The courts order provides that if the recovery is for more -- in the state court is for more than $100,000, you got to take it back to the admiralty court --"
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6064.281,6064.641,And then what --
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6064.641,6066.288,You've got to take it back to the admiralty court anyway.
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6066.288,6072.052,What does it provide the admiralty courts cant do?
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6072.052,6086.486,"It provides that -- it can't the -- this respondent cannot recover more than -- I'm -- I'm glad to see, Your Honor, I'd much rather have you refer to the record than trust my memory at this state."
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6093.36,6102.965,Well is there any chance that she could get any -- that you could get out any less than that in the admiralty court unless the admiralty judges happen to give a less verdict?
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6102.965,6106.776,"Yes, the admiralty court might very well hold near these vessels at fault."
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6108.631,6114.272,"Well I'm not talking about the facts, I'm talking about aside from the desire to escape the jury verdict."
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6116.648,6117.701,If Your Honor please --
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6117.701,6125.345,"What law, you say $100,000 is the maximum that they can -- they can -- admiralty court will give in some circumstances."
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6125.345,6125.826,Oh no.
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6134.516,6140.243,"Well, they couldn't give anymore under the order here that they have fixed for these people to recover."
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6140.243,6140.377,They could give --
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6140.377,6145.153,And if its order -- if the Court of Appeals orders a sustain I'm talking about --
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6145.153,6151.358,"They could limit -- the admiralty court could limit our liability to $110,000."
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6151.358,6155.405,Well what has the Circuit Court of Appeals said it had to be limited to --
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6155.405,6160.108,The -- the Court of Appeals hasn't decided any question of limitation of liability.
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6160.108,6164.863,"What did you mean by saying the $100,000 is all they could get?"
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6164.863,6185.42,"In the -- in the stipulation that the Court of Appeals suggested that these people, this respondent be required to make, it says in effect, as I recall it, that she cannot recover more than $100,000 unless state court verdict is a special verdict and allocates the amount between tug and barge."
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6185.42,6188.18,Is that what the admiralty court would do?
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6188.18,6189.505,I don't know what the admiralty court would do because --
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6189.505,6192.417,"Well, if they held that both were liable, would they allocate it?"
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6192.417,6199.803,"Oh, if they held that both were liable, there'd be no need for an allocation because then the fund would exceed the claims."
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6206.145,6227.197,"I -- I can't cant get quite -- are you claiming that under the order of the Court of Appeals, it is possible under any circumstances for these petitioners to get a dollar more -- a dollar more, or at least as much as the fund which has been found to be any different."
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6227.197,6265.264,"I'm claiming, if I may answer your question this way, either one or two things, either it is possible or the whole state court proceeding must be entirely nugatory, because if the state court verdict is for more than $110,000, that being the value of the tug, either she can recover the excess or not but if the federal court in admiralty says that the barge is not liable and limits our liability to the tug, her -- the limit of her recovery would be her share of $110,000."
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6265.264,6272.627,"Suppose the state court held that there was no liability on the part of the judge just as you said if the admiralty held, what could be the result then?"
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6272.627,6280.24,"Well, if Your Honor please, that illustrates, I think, one of vices of trying to unscramble these eggs."
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6292.866,6296.982,"But it doesn't hurt the company that she's been compelled to reduce it, does it?"
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6296.982,6306.585,"No, if the jury should bring in a verdict, and I can't visualize this, but if a jury should bring in credit for the defendant, that would be res judicata."
1956.445,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6310.815,6311.659,You have five minutes.
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6311.945,6311.959,Thank you.
1956.445,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6311.959,6312.844,-- the red light to (Voice Overlap).
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6312.844,6313.537,"Thank you, sir."
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6540.688,6543.767,"No, it shouldn't be a dilemma to the petitioner, should it?"
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6543.767,6544.348,"Oh I agree, not."
1956.445,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6544.348,6545.141,Do you think that that is?
1956.445,2,23325,eugene_underwood,,6545.141,6546.195,I agree not.
