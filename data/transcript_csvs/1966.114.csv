1966.114,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,34.62,"Number 105, no, no. Number 114, Manuel Vaca, et al., petitioners, versus Nile Sipes, Administrator of the estate of Benjamin Owens, Jr., deceased."
1966.114,0,20827,david_e_feller,,36.476,41.182,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.114,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,147.366,150.23,How old was he at that time?
1966.114,0,20827,david_e_feller,,150.23,153.395,I'm not precisely sure.
1966.114,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,153.395,155.613,Never -- never mind.
1966.114,0,20827,david_e_feller,,155.613,163.041,"In any case, he went home, in fact went to the hospital, remained under treatment."
1966.114,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,332.214,337.336,"Mr. Feller, this doctor who made that examination was of his own choice?"
1966.114,0,20827,david_e_feller,,337.336,340.057,"Well, it was really chosen by his own doctor."
1966.114,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,340.057,340.292,Yes.
1966.114,0,20827,david_e_feller,,340.292,346.701,He went to Dr. Hesser and Dr. Hesser recommended Dr. Day to him.
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,1641.545,1649.277,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.114,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1959.294,1962.494,"Mr. Browne, would you mind defining a “lug”?"
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,1968.444,1985.623,"I suspect and by inference that it was to go to the individual because the officials termed it improper, you see and therefore, I think, the jury was entitled to say that it was in plain language a “lug.”"
1966.114,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1985.623,1989.231,"And the officials, you say, the officials, is that --"
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,1989.231,1990.103,Two.
1966.114,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1990.103,1990.767,Was the --
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,1990.767,1992.39,Two of the officials --
1966.114,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1992.39,1993.943,Was that in the record?
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,1993.943,1994.43,In the record.
1966.114,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1996.7,1997.443,"Yes, yes."
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,1997.443,1997.922,In the record --
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1997.922,2003.56,-- is “lug” then synonymous with a bribe or a pay off or something?
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2003.56,2004.706,"To me, it is."
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2096.685,2100.091,Is that sort of a tort concept?
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2103.886,2126.399,"Arbitrary is a court concept in the Gonzales case, Mr. Justice Brennan, and in other cases and this is the basis that the Missouri Supreme Court used in its opinion entirely in which we'll bring in just a moment to the question of discrimination then known, an important feature in this case as I see it."
1966.114,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2223.523,2257.054,Does this mean Mr. Browne that in all of the many thousands of cases under contracts that provide for arbitration and labor matters that the union is obliged to go through the entire process including arbitration or be subject to the jurisdiction of a court or to be sued for damages or its failure to do so?
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2257.054,2258.55,"I understand your question, I think."
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2480.267,2482.501,What -- would you excuse me.
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2482.501,2482.559,Yes.
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2482.559,2484.318,Why didn't you sue the employer?
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2491.025,2501.427,We had an action gone -- going but it to me is contingent upon the decision here.
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2507.569,2513.411,I know but if you say the breach of the duty is a failure to take the claim to arbitration.
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2517.417,2521.049,I think we'd have trouble with the case against the employer --
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2521.049,2523.269,You mean the employer didn't breach his contract.
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2523.269,2523.964,Please?
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2523.964,2526.247,You mean the employer did not breach his contract?
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2526.247,2535.041,"Well, no I think this that we didn't exhaust our remedies to the employer and that he has a defense there, you see."
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2535.247,2538.905,"You mean in the arbitration, the arbitration?"
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2538.905,2542.081,We didn't exhaust our remedies and that's what this suit is about because the union --
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2542.081,2542.875,I see.
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2542.875,2545.059,-- wouldn't help us to exhaust the remedy.
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2545.059,2548.882,"So the employer would say to you in his court suit, “You haven't taken it --"
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2548.882,2548.922,He would --
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2548.922,2550.903,-- to arbitration and --
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2550.903,2552.419,He has --
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2552.419,2553.517,He has said it?
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2553.517,2554.431,He has said it.
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2554.431,2554.56,Is that in --
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2554.56,2561.593,But we haven't exhausted our remedies against him and must I admit that he may have some merit there.
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2581.557,2594.579,"I know, but if you -- I gather you take it then that the breach of the duty of their representation can be -- can occur without there being any collusion?"
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2594.579,2598.608,The breach of the duty without any collusion between the employer and the --
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2598.608,2599.149,And the union.
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2599.149,2600.859,-- and the union -- oh I think so.
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2600.859,2607.331,"And you say it takes only arbitrary action, doesn't take any dishonesty or anything."
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2607.331,2617.226,"Well, I -- arbitrary action is sufficient and coupled with malice, there -- the legal definition of malice of course here, I think, is there is actual malice."
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2617.226,2620.744,"So you don't -- apparently, you don't think federal law covers this?"
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2620.744,2628.132,I think it may in its way but I don' think it's exclusive and here I get --
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2628.132,2639.504,"Well, what if federal -- what if the federal law was at least say in this Court some other courts that to breach that duty requires some degree of dishonesty or bad faith, not --"
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2639.504,2640.626,Some degree of what?
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2640.626,2649.65,"Some degree of dishonesty or bad faith and the state law was to the contrary, they didn't -- they only took arbitrary action which -- do you suppose a federal law would govern, as it --"
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2649.65,2650.66,I know they govern it.
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2655.665,2656.452,I understand.
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2656.452,2656.765,I'm talking about --
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2656.765,2663.017,"We -- so the federal -- we don't -- you do not resist the federal laws governing in this case, does it?"
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2663.017,2675.09,I agree entirely and wholeheartedly the federal law construing what the duties are -- must govern and you've said that a number of times it has been said all over.
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2678.155,2692.135,"I gather you're arguing, Mr. Browne, that we are to have a federal rule that the federal rule ought to be that there is liability for arbitrary malicious failure to carry out one's duty of representation."
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2692.135,2692.31,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.114,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2692.31,2703.583,"And I gather you'd argue secondly that if we're going to do that as we did in Lynn with libel state -- libel actions against Lynn, that's -- you're to allow a state forum for it."
1966.114,1,15627,allan_r_browne,,2703.583,2704.664,"Similar, yes, Your Honor."
1966.114,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3024.744,3026.198,Mr. Feller.
1966.114,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3026.198,3028.091,"Very briefly, if Your Honor may."
1966.114,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3058.643,3070.641,"Suppose the court just found that the union had maliciously, wantonly and arbitrarily refused to go to arbitration without reference to the merits?"
1966.114,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3070.641,3080.055,"Well, our view is that that is what it should do and if it so found, should order that the case be then taken to arbitration."
1966.114,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3081.297,3083.013,But no damages?
1966.114,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3083.013,3092.196,That the damages would be what the arbitrator would award under the contract as the remedy for the breach.
1966.114,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3092.317,3095.829,But that wouldn't penalize -- that wouldn't penalize a union.
1966.114,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3123.578,3131.851,"Well, I don't think that you can come to that question as I've said without necessarily involving the court and the jury in trying the merits of the grievance."
1966.114,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3132.611,3133.379,"Oh, yes you can."
1966.114,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3149.236,3178.028,"Well, in that case, Your Honor, it would seem to me -- let's take this case, this discharge case, we have suggested in the brief that the appropriate remedy is to direct that the case be taken to arbitration and the union should be responsible for any loss which has been suffered by the individual as a result of its delay in proceeding to arbitration which is precisely the only loss which he suffered if -- in the hypothetical which you've put."
1966.114,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3178.028,3180.264,So you mean only after arbitration?
1966.114,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3180.264,3182.0,And only after arbitration.
1966.114,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3182.245,3182.471,Well --
1966.114,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3182.471,3186.867,-- as essentially the union is in a quasi-governmental position here.
1966.114,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3222.063,3229.955,"Mr. Feller, I have two questions, forgive me for taking your time unrelated one or the other."
1966.114,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3248.28,3253.524,"They do not, Your Honor, and that would bring me exactly to the arbitrary and malicious thing."
1966.114,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3270.531,3270.664,And what then --
1966.114,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3270.664,3287.958,"In its opinion on page 216 of the record and that is the question as each the court says, the issue submitted to the jury was whether the union as plaintiff's agent arbitrarily -- no malicious notion, just arbitrarily."
1966.114,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3299.018,3309.954,"Now, look at 162 of the record, instruction number 5 and instruction number 6, I was wondering whether you were satisfied with those --"
1966.114,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3309.954,3310.234,Well --
1966.114,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3310.234,3313.698,-- adequately set out the standard of good faith.
1966.114,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3313.698,3319.536,I -- well the problem in instruction number 5 is it says that acted reasonably.
1966.114,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3323.028,3324.258,"Maliciously, arbitrarily --"
1966.114,2,20827,david_e_feller,,3324.258,3328.35,"Well, or wrongly, or wrongly."
