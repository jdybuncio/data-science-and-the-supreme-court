1989.88-2109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.07,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-2109, Kansas and Missouri v. UtiliCorp United, Inc.--"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,13.26,16.653,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,86.682,94.89,"Mr. Greenan, you say the 100 percent pass-on is required from the wellhead to the burner."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,104.905,105.496,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,116.933,118.616,And is that a Federal rule?
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,118.616,120.595,That is a state rule.
1989.88-2109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,127.581,132.433,"Well, if it were just a state rule, I suppose some states might have it and some states might not."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,132.433,132.663,No.
1989.88-2109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,156.13,165.066,"So what you are speaking then is... from wellhead to burner, is true of residential consumers in Kansas and Missouri?"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,165.066,172.228,"I believe that it is established in the brief of the amicus, the State of Illinois, Your Honor, that those are present in 40 states."
1989.88-2109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,172.228,173.681,40 states--
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,173.681,174.161,40 states.
1989.88-2109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,174.161,176.273,--by virtue of the rulings of public utility commissions?
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,176.273,176.954,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-2109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.293,224.236,"Well, I guess they could just turn the register down and be a little colder in the winter and a little hotter in the summer."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,224.236,224.376,--Certainly.
1989.88-2109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.376,226.277,And might affect the total usage.
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,226.277,227.309,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-2109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,231.383,234.354,So this isn't a fixed quantity contract.
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,234.354,236.296,It is not a fixed quantity contract.
1989.88-2109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,236.296,244.202,"And the language, at least in Illinois Brick, referred to a fixed quantity pass through."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,244.202,244.352,That is correct.
1989.88-2109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.273,253.548,So you propose that... that the Court find an additional exception in--
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,253.548,256.35,"--No, I think, Your Honor, it is the same exception."
1989.88-2109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.31,300.764,"--Do you think we could be assured that the residential consumers would have the same incentive to sue that the Court found was important in Illinois Brick for the... in this case, direct purchasers, the utilities?"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,300.764,301.806,I think yes.
1989.88-2109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,318.829,323.692,But there would be a general concern by the Court if we are to articulate a general rule.
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,330.968,332.348,"--I think there is, Your Honor."
1989.88-2109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,332.348,334.037,--would vigorously pursue?
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,334.037,336.441,Let's put them side by side with the utility.
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.785,413.267,"Yes, but that... but that return, as I understand it, unless these rate-making bodies operate quite differently from what I am familiar with, that rate is established now for next year."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,413.267,413.545,That is correct.
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.545,414.096,Isn't that right?
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,425.184,425.384,That is correct.
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.384,434.24,"I mean, the effect of regulatory lag is that if I sell more gas I get the... now, the state will get back at me the next time we have a rate making, right, and they will cut it back down."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,444.869,446.802,"In the short run, that is true, Justice--"
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.802,448.112,"Well, but life is in the short run."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,450.045,453.728,--That... that situation is unaffected by the facts of this case.
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.338,492.859,In the future.
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,492.859,493.49,--In order to get the rate of return.
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,493.49,494.201,In the future.
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,500.505,500.976,Exactly.
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.686,517.006,"Oh, I... I agree with that."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,517.006,517.236,Okay.
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.236,533.62,But it does not demonstrate... you answered Justice O'Connor by saying that the Illinois Brick theory was if you can be sure that the intermediate purchaser has not been harmed it's... it's okay to apply Illinois Brick.
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,537.883,544.025,I don't believe that Illinois Brick says that you can be sure that the intermediate purchaser not be harmed.
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.938,596.811,"But he does absorb some of the... of the overcharge, does he not, if he loses sales by reason of the overcharge?"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,602.954,604.306,He loses some of the profit.
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,698.384,711.814,"So you say that you can concede easily that the... both the utility and the consumer has been hurt, but at least you know for sure, because the law requires the pass-on, exactly how much the consumer has been hurt."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,711.814,712.335,That is correct.
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,712.335,720.162,"Now, you wouldn't... you wouldn't... would you be making the same argument if the law did not require the pass-on?"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,720.162,721.541,"No, Your Honor, I--"
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,721.541,727.776,"Because then you really would get into a real bog, wouldn't you?"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,727.776,728.136,--Yes.
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,753.494,771.626,"Your opposition suggests that if the utility recovers, makes the entire recovery, that it would have to pass on to the consumer the windfall."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,771.626,774.258,"UtiliCorp concedes that, Your Honor."
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,775.9,776.029,I know.
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,779.452,784.325,I think that is a question that is up to the various regulatory bodies.
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.325,790.099,"But if it is, then there would be the problem right there of separating out the two injuries."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,790.099,793.591,If... if... that would be a problem on the administrative level if--
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,793.591,798.003,"Well, it wouldn't be any problem at all if you know precisely how much was passed on."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,798.003,801.836,"--We... and we do know, of course, precisely how much is passed on."
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,812.886,821.593,"But if they would... but if... even assuming that they would do that, why then, then the assumption is that you can identify easily how much was passed on."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,821.593,822.674,--Certainly.
1989.88-2109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,827.259,831.292,I guess you can read it off the utility bills to the--
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,831.292,832.862,You can read it off the utility bills.
1989.88-2109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,833.392,834.434,--residential consumer.
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,834.434,834.624,--Right.
1989.88-2109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,886.129,891.983,"Well, we have no indication here that the states would have brought the lawsuit on their own."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,893.845,894.426,Three months later.
1989.88-2109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,894.426,899.179,"--after the utilities had filed the suit, and kind of piggybacked on their suit?"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,899.179,902.271,"I would say piggybacking is not correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-2109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,925.42,926.529,Voluntary dismissal?
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,926.529,927.59,--Voluntary dismissal.
1989.88-2109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,967.355,974.791,"As to the consumers in eastern Kansas that you are... were they served by a utility which would have had a claim, but the utility--"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,974.791,974.941,Yes.
1989.88-2109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,974.941,976.511,--simply didn't bring a lawsuit?
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,976.511,977.041,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,989.45,1009.215,"Well, if everybody else ends up winning these cases, I assume that the regulating authority could make that utility pay dearly for not... for not having brought a suit, and simply say you'll... you'll not be allowed to charge as much next time around, in order that the consumers whose money you have frittered away can be made whole."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1009.215,1009.866,But why?
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1010.735,1010.885,But why?
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1017.432,1023.018,"--But why, Your Honor, should I, the utility, bring this suit when you are going to make me disgorge, if that is the situation?"
1989.88-2109,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.537,1035.288,May I interrupt there?
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1041.352,1042.143,--It has never been decided.
1989.88-2109,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1042.143,1042.564,--So how can--
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1042.564,1050.731,The government says... the government says we don't concede that a regulator would make them give up the double and triple damages.
1989.88-2109,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.041,1082.554,"--Well, it seems to me it's an unresolved question, what happens to the two-thirds profit in treble damage litigation."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1082.554,1083.145,That is correct.
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1083.145,1085.358,"Mr. Greenan, what does the state do with the money?"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1093.245,1098.76,"Well, those two alternatives exist under 15 U.S.C. 15(d), I believe, Your Honor... or 15(a)."
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1098.76,1098.9,Either one.
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1098.9,1099.58,Either one.
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1106.024,1108.227,Which wouldn't necessarily be rate payers.
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1108.227,1109.988,--Would not necessarily be rate payers.
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1109.988,1115.611,"And anybody that has moved out of the state since these overcharges were made, they are just out of luck, I guess, if they have moved to New Jersey?"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1115.611,1117.842,"Probably, if they have moved to New Jersey."
1989.88-2109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1146.013,1153.109,"Do we know, does the record disclose what would happen to the recovery, if any, if the states were allowed to proceed?"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1153.109,1158.663,"All the record shows, Your Honor, is what the authority is under the parens patriae statutes."
1989.88-2109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1158.663,1161.134,"Which could be either, keep it or not."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1161.134,1161.284,Could be either.
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1170.422,1174.025,"What happens to the commercial purchasers, Mr. Greenan?"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1185.083,1199.862,"If we win this case, Your Honor, that belongs to the utilities, because the commercial purchasers are neither natural persons in the ordinary sense, and they are businesses which doesn't allow parens patriae recovery."
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1200.343,1203.946,"Could they bring suits on their own, not relying on the state's parens patriae?"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1203.946,1212.181,"--They could, Your Honor, they could, but I think they would be faced with Judge Posner's reading, Judge Posner's reasoning as to why he would only allow it to the residential consumers."
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1238.66,1241.951,What if I am an individual commercial purchaser that doesn't have that capacity?
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1242.992,1245.244,"--I see no reason to distinguish, Your Honor."
1989.88-2109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1245.244,1245.384,I don't either.
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1245.384,1246.746,I see no reason to distinguish.
1989.88-2109,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1252.67,1259.065,"But even in the residential consumer, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, there are some people who turn the thermostat down and have to buy an extra sweater."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1259.065,1259.475,That's right.
1989.88-2109,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1259.475,1261.228,And there is no way they can recover for that sweater.
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1261.228,1264.139,"There is no way that they can recover for that sweater, right."
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1289.747,1293.91,"But the problem isn't all that easy, because you don't know what the [inaudible] is."
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1294.87,1296.543,"Until we have a lawsuit, right."
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.365,1301.167,You don't know how much the price went up.
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1301.167,1302.919,"--No, but that is true in any case, Your Honor."
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1303.65,1312.967,"That may be, but who's going to... who's going to take on that job of proving the conspiracy and the result on competition?"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1312.967,1318.333,--In this particular instance it is the attorneys general acting parens patriae in the actions that they have brought.
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1353.039,1360.723,"And as you... you say that a group of consumers could bring the same suit you could, and they would not be barred by Illinois Brick?"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1360.723,1369.438,"As long as it's easy to demonstrate, Your Honor, it's easy to demonstrate that that overcharge did not rest with the first purchaser."
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1369.438,1373.973,"Well, what do you mean that it was required by law to pass it on?"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1373.973,1384.198,The Federal... the purchased-gas adjustment mechanisms which are in force on the Federal and state level require this pass-on.
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1385.661,1389.431,Because they have to... to set their rate they have to tell--

1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.211,1403.632,--Yes.
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1403.632,1407.985,--the purchased-gas adjustment mechanism goes into effect.
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1417.572,1420.176,And you have identified the statutory requirement in your--
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1420.176,1424.068,"We have, at tab 3, Your Honor, set forth the purchased-gas adjustment mechanism."
1989.88-2109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1424.068,1424.228,--Okay.
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1424.228,1440.05,"And more than that, it is immediate in this sense, that the local utility district reports to the pipeline each month, after it has received the gas and delivered it, what its volumes have been that it delivered to each of its class of customers."
1989.88-2109,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.799,1456.41,Does the mechanism also work for price decreases?
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1456.41,1456.961,Yes.
1989.88-2109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1470.092,1473.093,"That is just Federal, what you are referring to there?"
1989.88-2109,0,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,1473.093,1474.555,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1489.065,1490.936,"Very well, Mr. Greenan."
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1492.538,1495.787,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1551.856,1559.49,"Well, it does seem to be pretty much a windfall to the utilities, when 100 percent of it is passed on to the customers."
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1559.49,1564.405,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, if I may, it's not true that 100 percent is passed on to the customers."
1989.88-2109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1566.215,1566.746,"Well, what if it were?"
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1566.746,1580.706,"--If it were, then, I submit that this is the perfect case not to make an exception, because you would have a utility regulatory commission that can force those overcharges to be passed on to the people who actually paid them."
1989.88-2109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.706,1582.216,So you can identify them?
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1582.216,1584.259,They can be identified--
1989.88-2109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.259,1587.792,Which is completely different from the Illinois Brick type of case.
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1587.792,1591.585,"--It is different, but I must point out that there is no precise identification."
1989.88-2109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1593.798,1596.56,Why can't you read it off the utility bills?
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1597.569,1602.244,"Because the utility bills do not reflect all of the overcharge, Justice O'Connor."
1989.88-2109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1614.372,1624.029,"Well, it may be that 100 percent of the damages aren't passed on, but you know to the... you know the extent to which the consumer has been damaged."
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1624.029,1630.272,"We know that the consumers ultimately paid a majority... by the consumers, I mean all consumers."
1989.88-2109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.272,1642.271,"You know that the... that because the price to the utility went up, that the price to the consumer went up also, to some extent."
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1642.271,1643.693,"Yes, Justice White, we do know that."
1989.88-2109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1643.693,1645.473,And you know precisely how much.
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1645.473,1647.316,"Well, we--"
1989.88-2109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.316,1651.577,Once you find out what the... what the price would have been.
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1651.577,1659.854,--At the close of discovery in the summer of 1989 our experts were finally able to determine the amount of the overcharge.
1989.88-2109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1666.358,1667.137,But you made it.
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1667.137,1667.738,Yes.
1989.88-2109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.806,1711.21,"Well, I take it you know, you determined after five years that if it hadn't been for this conspiracy the price would have been lower."
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1711.21,1711.64,"Yes, sir."
1989.88-2109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1711.64,1717.645,And so let's assume that it would have been a dollar lower per whatever kind of a unit you are talking about.
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1727.642,1728.293,That is right.
1989.88-2109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1728.293,1731.954,But you do know how much of it was.
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1731.954,1734.986,"Well, it could be determined, Justice White."
1989.88-2109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.669,1739.29,"Well, I know, but wouldn't it be easy to do?"
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1739.29,1740.95,"Well, I submit it would not be easy."
1989.88-2109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1780.82,1793.599,"Well, how would it ever be determinable later if you say that... let's assume you recover from the pipeline X million dollars, and you say that you know that some of it was passed on."
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1804.227,1805.589,"Yes, Justice White, in fact--"
1989.88-2109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.589,1808.648,"Well, wouldn't you have to then determine how much it was?"
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1808.648,1808.909,--Yes.
1989.88-2109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1814.375,1826.145,"Well, then at the end of the year when the utility does make these final adjustments on the customers' bills, you can look at the bill and see how much the overcharge was."
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1826.145,1827.757,--If you were to look at each individual customer [inaudible]--
1989.88-2109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1827.757,1827.967,Yes.
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1830.69,1835.234,"--And then... but I guess my point is, Justice O'Connor, that there is a damage to UtiliCorp."
1989.88-2109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1836.336,1838.867,"Yes, but that is a separate question."
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1858.251,1866.688,"The plaintiffs in this case have never suggested that residential customers, and indeed industrial and commercial customers, were not damaged to some extent by defendant's action."
1989.88-2109,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1885.621,1895.337,Is there anything in the record to give us an idea of the percentage of these... of the total damages that were absorbed by the utility directly?
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1913.312,1916.725,"Justice Kennedy, there is nothing in the record from which that could be determined."
1989.88-2109,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.79,1977.279,Mr. Finch--
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,1977.279,1978.281,"Yes, Justice Scalia?"
1989.88-2109,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1978.281,1985.986,"--You say that it is likely to have been minimal, the amount of the overcharge that was passed on."
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2012.046,2014.487,"Justice Scalia, that is a substantial number."
1989.88-2109,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2045.848,2048.639,What is in it for you if you have to pass it on to the consumers?
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2048.639,2052.764,"Treble damages and protecting our market, Justice Scalia."
1989.88-2109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2106.983,2128.375,"Well, Mr. Finch, even if we agreed with the states that in this... under these circumstances the residential consumer should be entitled to recover the pass-through, the utility still would have suffered substantial damage, according to you, and still would have an incentive to be in this suit."
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2128.375,2130.178,"Yes, they would."
1989.88-2109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2223.972,2234.82,"Does the parens patriae amendment to the antitrust laws, Mr. Finch, bar a claim by individual consumers?"
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2234.82,2247.149,"It does not, as I read it, Justice Rehnquist, bar a claim by individual consumers, but the states, when they file their lawsuit, are supposed to have given individual consumers notice so they could opt out."
1989.88-2109,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2262.199,2264.821,You say they are supposed to give notice.
1989.88-2109,1,23952,floyd_r_finch_jr,,2265.102,2266.283,"Yes, sir."
1989.88-2109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.385,2434.137,"Thank you, Mr. Finch."

1989.88-2109,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3183.473,3186.227,"Well, what does... what does 4(c) authorize?"
1989.88-2109,3,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,3186.227,3201.295,"--I think if one looks at the legislative history with regard to the bills that were passed, that it was clearly the intent of Congress that 4(c) allow the attorneys general to proceed parens patriae on behalf of consumers, indirect as well as direct."
1989.88-2109,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3201.295,3208.36,"Well, they can... they can attempt to recover the damages that the indirect purchasers couldn't recover themselves."
1989.88-2109,3,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,3214.844,3239.282,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that the clear intent of 4(c) is demonstrated by the legislative history that is set forth, particularly in the brief of the amicus, the National Council of... or National League of State Legislatures, demonstrates that Congress intended that 4(c) provided a separate cause of action for the attorneys general to proceed on behalf of consumers--"

1989.88-2109,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3244.107,3250.04,"Well, you have to say both indirect and direct, but that isn't what it says."
1989.88-2109,3,42738,thomas_j_greenan,,3250.04,3253.252,"It does not say that in so many terms, no, Your Honor."
