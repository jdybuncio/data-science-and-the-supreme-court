2009.08-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.919,"We will hear argument first this term in Case 08-680, Maryland v. Shatzer."
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,7.027,9.698,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2009.08-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,52.242,53.556,Without regard to the time?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,56.867,62.786,"Your Honor, we do think one day should be enough, as long as it is not in the pretrial detention category."
2009.08-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,87.307,88.698,So what if it's repeatedly done?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,101.626,110.139,"There is parade of horribles of catch and release and Your Honor just went through one of them, and there are obviously a number of hypotheticals that one could posit."
2009.08-680,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,166.428,172.113,Is the rationale for the break in custody that there is a likelihood of non-coercion?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,175.252,184.389,"--Your Honor, it goes to -- yes, this Court has said, most recently again in Montejo, that the reason for Edwards is that we want to prevent badgering."
2009.08-680,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,184.389,184.763,All right.
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,218.638,226.383,"Well, the courts -- the lower courts have shown that there is a difference between police interrogational custody and correctional custody."
2009.08-680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,291.32,298.129,"But if the defendant goes home, he can contact a lawyer."
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,316.496,322.524,"Your Honor -- well, first of all, the defendant while they're in prison can contact a lawyer in some circumstances."
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,357.105,359.714,Do we know exactly what the Miranda warning in this case was?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,359.714,366.179,"--The Miranda warnings in this case the judge, the trial judge, found exactly comported with the Miranda warning--"
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,366.179,370.508,But what did it tell the person in prison he could do about a lawyer?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,370.508,372.645,--That he had the right to a lawyer and--
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,372.645,375.035,Did it tell him how he could get a lawyer?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,375.035,376.63,--It didn't--
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,376.63,384.219,"If you're in prison and they give you the Miranda warnings, what would that tell the average prisoner with respect to access to a lawyer?"
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,384.219,390.778,--It would tell them they have a right to counsel and if they couldn't get one one would be provided to them.
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,390.778,395.23,And would they have provided a lawyer to him right away if they had -- he had asked for it?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,395.23,400.432,"Well, had he asked for one, which he did the first time, what they did there--"
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,400.432,401.571,"When he is in prison, I mean."
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,401.571,402.008,--Yes.
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,411.004,411.846,"Well, I understand that."
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,411.846,412.08,Right.
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,412.08,415.267,"I'm just wondering if he thinks, well, I'd like a lawyer, what can he do?"
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,415.267,423.951,"He could -- during those two years and seven months in this case, he could have tried to get a lawyer through -- either his own lawyer in the case."
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,423.951,430.807,"Right on the spot, when he is in the room there and they give him the Miranda warnings and he says, that sounds like a good idea, what would happen?"
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,430.807,433.976,He would not be given a lawyer by the police at that time.
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,435.056,438.351,"So the Miranda warning is a little misleading, isn't it, in that context?"
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,438.351,443.035,"Well, I would argue that it is not, because he is given the right."
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,450.905,452.577,Do they also say it will be provided to you?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,452.577,455.794,"--Yes, but he can -- there's a number of--"
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,455.794,457.666,And it's not going to be provided to him.
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,457.666,466.833,"--Well, it would be, Your Honor, if, for example, the lawyer in his underlying case came, he could say, look, I need a lawyer, they're asking me questions about this other case; can you represent me on that case?"
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,466.833,468.939,What if he asks for a lawyer.
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,472.001,473.72,"In 2003, yes."
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,473.72,476.438,"And the State doesn't provide him with a lawyer, correct?"
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,476.438,477.077,That's correct.
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,477.077,477.981,All right.
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,483.886,491.474,"Well, what he does understand from the first time he is questioned -- and he understood the rights because he himself invoked that right to counsel."
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,510.188,511.841,"No, because we tell the police they have to stop."
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,511.841,512.153,Right.
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,512.153,516.415,"So presumably they shouldn't re-engage until the lawyer is present, correct?"
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,518.166,520.76,"Well, Edwards tells them to stop questioning."
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,543.918,545.9,"Well, this is a different part of your argument."
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,556.694,557.583,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,577.292,581.245,Catch and release then no longer -- catch and release is unimportant to you?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,602.081,603.329,"--Well, in this case--"
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,603.329,606.187,This is a very different situation then someone who is free to go home.
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,606.187,610.781,--I'm not sure -- the question sort of posits two different scenarios.
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,644.141,647.467,"Because he is not in custody, when he is in jail."
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,647.467,647.592,--He is not--
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,647.592,654.829,"When he can't leave, can't necessarily use a phone and can't confer with anyone he's no longer in custody."
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,654.829,662.233,"He is in custody in the sense that he is not free to leave the jail, but as in the Miranda cases, he can still be questioned."
2009.08-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,665.851,669.136,You mean he is not -- I assume you mean he is not free to leave the prison.
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,669.136,669.869,Right.
2009.08-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,669.869,675.856,"As I understand the terms, pehaps it's inaccurate, jail is where you are when they are still questioning you and figuring out what's going to happen to you."
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,683.443,684.293,That's exactly right.
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,684.293,687.078,Was he free to leave the interrogation room?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,687.078,687.711,I'm sorry your honor.
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,687.711,690.347,Was he free to leave the interrogation room?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,690.347,700.053,"No, and we are not -- we -- we accept that he was in police interrogational status both in 2003 and in 2006 when he was read his Miranda rights."
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.053,708.64,"I have to say that the breaking custody, I think, has many more problems than time, but you don't seem to place much emphasis on time."
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,718.5,733.198,"--The reason why I think break in custody is not as problematic, and this goes to the Justice's earlier question as well, is because literally the year after Edwards, 1982, was the first of the eight Federal circuits that found the break in custody rule."
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,735.788,736.708,--What's the smallest--
2009.08-680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,736.708,742.176,"In those cases, was there a considerable interval between--"
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,742.176,742.269,Not--
2009.08-680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,742.269,744.797,--It was just the break in custody?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,745.409,747.53,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,747.53,748.139,--was enough?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,748.139,748.716,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-680,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.066,774.39,Why do you say the rule is three days?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,775.872,786.448,"--Because right now, if you look at Edwards being the next day, Minnick and Roberson being three days, that that is the only cases from this Court which says when the Edwards presumption goes."
2009.08-680,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,797.455,806.046,"Yeah, but you -- you are not arguing for a seven-day limit no matter what, even if he is held in jail, are you?"
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,806.046,819.823,"If he is held in jail on his own case -- see, the most difficult scenario, in our view, is one that we don't think the Court needs to reach here, which is actually the Green case from the District of Columbia, where he is held on his own case in a pretrial detention--"
2009.08-680,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,819.823,820.26,Right.
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,820.26,831.3,"--scenario, because then he does have different incentives to cooperate or not cooperate with the police and then the question would be, well, does that -- is the break of custody there at conviction or at sentencing?"
2009.08-680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,847.404,848.917,Suppose it's the same officer.
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,856.962,863.459,"--Well, I actually think for -- in this case, with Detective Blankenship and Detective Hoover, the Court should assume it's one and the same."
2009.08-680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,880.842,895.915,"Well, you could limit it to the same police department, the same investigation, so you are not covering the waterfront of every interrogation about any crime, any place."
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,895.915,899.771,"--Except for right now, we live in a world of Roberson, where we do."
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,922.415,926.977,"--Counsel, the hypothetical you are positing is an investigation about unrelated crimes."
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,942.236,947.263,"It is, though he is not being held on -- on that crime."
2009.08-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,953.576,958.571,"So I thought Roberson told us it's not a different question, that it's the same question."
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,963.866,984.686,"That's exactly right, and that's what creates the problem that if defendant -- if we don't have a break in custody rule, a defendant who invokes anywhere at any time is forever immune from being questioned by the police, regardless of what would be a sort of a wholly irrational view and an absurd result, which I think is where we live right now."
2009.08-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,992.462,994.1,"Well, I wonder if you're right about that premise."
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,1012.031,1024.93,"--Yes, Your Honor, and I don't know sort of what the protocol of each of the prisons would be, but I would think that if a prisoner did not want to speak with the officers that came to see him about a crime, the prisoner would be able to say so and has."
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1029.302,1035.83,What is the shortest time period that any circuit court has found a break in custody in a similar situation?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,1035.83,1037.518,--A break in custody that--
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1037.518,1041.936,Between the invocation of counsel and a requestioning.
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,1045.668,1047.743,"--Actually, all -- eight Federal circuits."
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1054.442,1055.554,Which are days?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,1055.554,1056.552,--What's that?
2009.08-680,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1056.552,1057.523,Any are days?
2009.08-680,0,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,1057.523,1060.206,"Not that I am aware of, Your Honor."
2009.08-680,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1064.519,1065.314,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1072.09,1074.621,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1092.66,1114.337,"I know that you're going to go into the question of how we shape a rule, and I would like you, and perhaps on rebuttal your other counsel, to comment on the following: I don't see -- as Justice Kennedy had a problem, so do I have a problem with anything that just says break in custody, and taking time seems fairly arbitrary."
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1161.802,1165.284,"Justice Breyer, I think there is a few problems with that approach."
2009.08-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.131,1199.237,Quite a lot of what I read was about the problems of counsel.
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1202.076,1212.73,"--Counsel has something to do with it, but the Court has made clear going back to Miranda that when we're we are talking about the Fifth Amendment right to counsel, the only reason that counsel matters is to help to make sure that--"
2009.08-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1212.73,1216.98,If -- are we interested in counsel or not?
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1224.054,1224.975,--We are not--
2009.08-680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1224.975,1231.081,"If we are not interested in representation by counsel, then I would withdraw my question and you don't have to answer it."
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1231.081,1238.92,"--We have -- in the Fifth Amendment context, we are interested in counsel only as a derivative of his right not to be forced to incriminate himself."
2009.08-680,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1256.191,1271.89,"Well, couldn't we say that in -- in the situation where there is a change from pretrial status to post-conviction status, the Edwards rule is no longer an irrebuttable presumption, but it's simply a rebuttable presumption?"
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1285.336,1287.898,"That would certainly be open to the Court to say that, Justice Alito."
2009.08-680,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1290.272,1291.41,Would it be a good idea to say that?
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1291.41,1292.518,--I don't think it would be a good idea.
2009.08-680,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1292.518,1294.156,I thought we liked clear lines in this.
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1297.03,1299.823,"And, Justice Scalia, that's precisely why we think the break in custody exception--"
2009.08-680,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1299.823,1316.88,"But carrying -- carrying that analysis one step further, if you are just talking about people who were inmates pursuant to prior conviction, why wouldn't the better rule be that if the inmate is given the opportunity to say no, I don't want a visitor today, and then if he accepts the visitor, you would say he is no longer in custody?"
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1322.673,1326.686,"--Well, Justice Stevens, I suspect that's what the police would do, if you ruled against the State in this case."
2009.08-680,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1334.621,1341.462,"Well, that -- such a rule would accomplish the benefit when he really wants -- willing to talk, he would say: I would be glad to talk to the officer."
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1341.462,1342.07,"--Well, Justice Stevens--"
2009.08-680,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1342.07,1343.835,"If he doesn't want to, he should just say no."
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1343.835,1348.769,"--Justice Stevens, if he didn't want to talk to the officer, there was nothing to prevent him from invoking his Fifth Amendment right to counsel."
2009.08-680,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.769,1353.018,"But it is a little different when the man first comes, says, will you talk to the officer."
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1359.604,1368.585,"He is in custody, Justice Stevens, but the premise of Miranda is that a person who is given the Miranda warnings can choose to decide whether to talk or not to talk."
2009.08-680,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1368.585,1369.178,If the change--
2009.08-680,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1369.178,1372.302,You started to tell us why this case was important.
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1374.162,1374.333,Certainly.
2009.08-680,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1394.497,1402.994,"That's not true, because my hypothetical, if you told him you don't have to talk to the officer, and you could produce, they could question every -- everybody in jail all over the country."
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1402.994,1404.82,"Well, they can't approach him for questioning."
2009.08-680,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1404.82,1407.269,They can't force him to attend the questioning.
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1420.532,1437.618,"Justice Stevens, the problem in that situation, again, though, is that ultimately the only basis for applying this presumption at all is if it's appropriate to apply an irrebuttable presumption that, even though we gave him the Miranda warnings and even though he said, I am happy to talk to you, we should presume that when he said that, that wasn't the truth."
2009.08-680,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1437.618,1440.161,--I -- I thought that you couldn't approach him.
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1449.13,1460.561,"Well, under Rhode Island v. Ennis, you are entitled to -- to update him on the status of the interrogation, but you are not entitled to resume custodial interrogation unless there has been a break in custody or something has terminated Edwards."
2009.08-680,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1460.561,1487.692,"Well, if the incarceration is a continuation of custodial custody, to be redundant, if it is a continuation of the custody, then why wouldn't asking him whether he would like to see visitors who want to ask him about a particular crime, why wouldn't that be a violation of Edwards?"
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1487.692,1489.83,I think defendants may well argue that it was--
2009.08-680,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.83,1490.688,I'm sure they would.
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1490.688,1492.42,"--Justice Scalia, and--"
2009.08-680,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1492.42,1497.465,So the -- the -- the scheme that Justice Stevens proposes wouldn't work.
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1502.664,1504.524,--I think there would be a risk of that happening.
2009.08-680,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1515.411,1522.562,"You join counsel for the State in just not wanting to argue for a time rule, which seems to me the only thing that would work."
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1522.562,1528.28,We -- we -- think the break in custody approach is the more appropriate one that will lead to fewer line-drawing problems.
2009.08-680,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1529.169,1533.949,"That's become apparent, and I'm indicating that I think the time rule might have some benefits."
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1533.949,1538.886,"--Well, we certainly don't oppose the Court adopting a time rule in the event that it rejects our primary submission."
2009.08-680,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1551.849,1555.268,But you don't give us any -- any suggestions.
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1569.481,1575.242,"--Well, I think as a practical matter, though, there are so -- as you point out, Justice Kennedy, there are so many exceptions to that."
2009.08-680,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1580.69,1583.173,In this -- in this case it's two years and seven months.
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1594.713,1600.944,"--Well, I think that is another potential defect in adopting a pure passage of time approach, though I think this case is particularly easy."
2009.08-680,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1624.731,1627.777,Or to the police who have to decide whether they can interrogate or not.
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1627.777,1628.51,Absolutely.
2009.08-680,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1646.514,1652.388,"I don't want to interrupt that, but there were two aspects to Edwards."
2009.08-680,1,42810,toby_j_heytens,,1664.803,1666.881,The Court has mentioned respect in the choice.
2009.08-680,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1677.188,1677.971,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,1684.842,1688.746,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1704.601,1709.956,"This is an area where it is very difficult to draw lines, at least I find it difficult to draw lines."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,1758.812,1760.902,"Yes, it does, Justice Alito."
2009.08-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1765.98,1768.963,And you don't think that's a ridiculous application of the rule?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,1791.517,1797.905,"Yes, Justice Alito, because badgering in this context has become a term of art."
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.465,1802.885,It doesn't mean badgering.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,1802.885,1804.511,It means an attempt by--
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.511,1806.23,We ought to get another term for it then.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,1808.648,1815.211,--I think it means returning in an attempt to get a suspect to change his or her mind.
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1821.001,1824.034,There was no attempt in this hypothetical to get him to change his mind.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,1826.172,1829.658,"--Well, first of all, I didn't answer the question properly."
2009.08-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1842.854,1850.194,"So all right, they run the rap sheet and they find out, if they do, that the person was arrested ten years earlier in Maryland and then what?"
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,1868.904,1870.838,"--Well, the police officer should attempt to do so."
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1871.79,1876.629,"I'm sorry to interrupt you -- interrupt there, and I will let you get back to the answer."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,1892.827,1894.075,--Yes.
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1894.921,1895.311,Okay.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,1895.311,1902.104,"--if they have invoked the right, then the second approach means an attempt to persuade the person to change their mind about having counsel."
2009.08-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1905.384,1927.591,"Let me pose you my hypothetical again, the same joy riding questioning, and then 40 years later after the person has gotten a law degree and become an entrepreneur and made $20 million, he's taken into custody and questioned by the Federal authorities for stock fraud."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,1936.291,1936.743,--It should.
2009.08-680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1953.017,1959.092,"Just in case -- just in case we don't -- we want to put a time limit on it, which I know you don't want us to do."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2004.404,2018.754,"I -- I believe the Court could adopt a type of rebuttable presumption under these circumstances but it shows the difficulty that courts would have and police officers, too, in measuring degrees, degrees of coercion or degrees of custody."
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2028.534,2028.753,Can I ask something?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2035.576,2035.763,--Well--
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2035.763,2047.93,"He is arrested for joy riding; he is let go; and you are saying that for 20, 40 years he is now immunized from being reapproached by the police under the Edwards rule?"
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2047.93,2048.226,--Yes.
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2048.226,2054.146,So you are advocating that no break in custody ever stops the Edwards clock.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2054.146,2054.864,Right.
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2062.721,2062.923,"Well, but not--"
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2062.923,2065.703,--between the police to a State or county jail.
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2072.372,2074.341,--It was one day.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2075.184,2075.184,Yes.
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2075.184,2079.618,"--to remain silent in the evening, and at 9:00 the next morning they were back."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2079.618,2085.288,But a -- a release from custody does not signal that a person who has asked for counsel has changed.
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2085.288,2097.5,But you are now -- you are now accepting your adversary's point that somehow a -- a change from a locked room in a prison to a different locked room is a release from custody.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2097.5,2097.672,"No, I don't--"
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2097.672,2103.104,"If we don't -- if we don't accept that proposition, isn't there a clear break when someone is let to go home?"
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2106.356,2118.912,"--There is more of a break, Justice Sotomayor, but it doesn't say anything about that person's choice to proceed with counsel, and if counsel is not provided then the attorney is excluded from the adversary system of Federal justice."
2009.08-680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2118.912,2120.488,May I ask you about a different approach?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2170.124,2187.228,"I don't think anything's wrong and I don't think a new rule is needed to cover that situation, because it is conceivable that a person, even in a prison environment, if they have control, say if they were to telephone out or to be free to refuse visitors, might not be considered in custody."
2009.08-680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2192.115,2195.847,But the record doesn't tell us whether he was given an opportunity to say
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2197.816,2201.468,"--No, it does not, but I think the State has the burden to show."
2009.08-680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2202.658,2206.421,"No, it's a question who has the burden of showing he's in custody or is he free to leave."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2209.201,2214.071,"--Well, the record does show that he lived in a maximum security prison--"
2009.08-680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2214.071,2214.337,Correct.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2214.337,2216.805,--and does not show that he would be free to refuse.
2009.08-680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2216.805,2220.085,But you can still live in a maximum security prison and say I don't want any visitors.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2220.085,2223.146,We don't know that he could have refused under the--
2009.08-680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2223.146,2224.491,As far as the records show.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2224.491,2226.082,"--Right, we don't know that."
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2226.753,2230.052,"Do -- do we have to ask him, you know, what visitors?"
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2231.94,2232.143,--Well--
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2232.143,2233.27,Do you want to have any visitors today?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2233.27,2233.769,--This shows--
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2233.769,2234.689,"He says, I don't know."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2252.117,2252.663,"--Well, I think--"
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2252.663,2253.322,--for this rule to cut in?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2253.322,2259.018,--This discussion shows the problems with allowing such a determination in the first place.
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2274.796,2281.34,"So then I don't understand why your answer to Justice Alito's hypothetical was what it was, because that person obviously was not in custody."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2281.34,2297.3,"It -- all I'm saying is that if we were to adopt the language that this Court in Montejo utilized, if a person is in control, if a person is not in custody, they are in control and can shut the door or walk away."
2009.08-680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.438,2318.588,"Well, if you're -- if you are going to use the Edwards, which I think is a good idea, as counsel part, which I think is a good starting place, you and every other member of the bar deals with this problem every day of the week."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2342.987,2343.345,--Well--
2009.08-680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2343.345,2344.281,So why can't we here?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2344.281,2346.36,--We -- I think we should.
2009.08-680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2349.686,2351.698,"No, no, that's not what I mean."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2368.361,2374.046,"--Well, in this case there is no reason to think that this suspect changed his mind."
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2375.5,2378.449,"Excuse me, what is the ethical rule about counsel?"
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2388.541,2389.102,"--I think, though--"
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2389.102,2399.971,"But when there is an entirely different case, there is totally different litigation, you can't approach the fellow without going back to the counsel whom he hired for a different case?"
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2415.326,2431.054,--Well this Court could adopt a rule that the Edwards protection -- an alternative that was raised in United States v. Green -- that the Edwards protection extends to the same case for which the police initially questioned the suspect and for which he asked for counsel.
2009.08-680,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2433.99,2434.208,It would make a difference?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2457.106,2460.947,"--Well, I think from the suspect's point of view it is the same situation."
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.95,2495.933,What if -- what if we limited Edwards to the same crime?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2500.851,2501.132,I agree.
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2501.132,2506.19,--to know whether this person in fact invoked the right to counsel.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2506.19,2510.253,"It would be easier, yes; and it would apply to this case because it was the same crime."
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2510.253,2510.503,So that would--
2009.08-680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2510.503,2512.313,Would that require us to overrule Roberson?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2512.313,2516.014,"Well, it does present some tensions with Roberson."
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2546.949,2551.152,"Well, but the Miranda Rights do not require the police to provide counsel."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2555.181,2555.368,Yes.
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2555.368,2562.036,And the one thing this person knew from the prior Miranda situation -- was 2003?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2562.036,2562.504,Yes.
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2562.504,2564.395,"Is that, if he said,"
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2570.078,2574.574,"But that's not the same, Chief Justice Roberts, as having the counsel present during questioning."
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2574.574,2576.668,"Well, Miranda doesn't--"
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2576.668,2576.902,If your Miranda advice--
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2576.902,2577.635,--Go ahead.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2577.635,2588.285,"--says that you have the right to have a counsel present during questioning, and all that advice means, after time, is, We will stop questioning you, then the right has been diminished over time."
2009.08-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2588.285,2592.504,Why is there a greater risk of badgering when the questioning is about a different offense?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2592.504,2595.534,I think the risk is the same.
2009.08-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2596.33,2606.356,"I thought you just said we could -- you were suggesting an -- as an alternative, that -- that Edwards be limited to situations where the questioning is about the same offense."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2606.356,2618.444,"--Well, that's possible -- well, the rationale that was extended in the Greene case is that, if questioning is about a different time, the perception, from the suspect's point of view, that the police are badgering him, would be less."
2009.08-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2618.444,2619.645,"I mean, this isn't fanciful."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2653.805,2654.461,Yes.
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2679.292,2680.446,"--Well, you are being very unrealistic."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2690.383,2690.897,--Yes.
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2712.355,2717.075,"Well, you say, ""in captivity"", but you think the rule applies, whether they are in captivity or not."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2726.601,2734.88,"Well, a person is going to be in custody in each Edwards scenario at the time they are questioned, so the question is the intervening time period."
2009.08-680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.159,2738.686,"Well, you agreed that, if he is questioned and he is not in custody when he is being questioned."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2742.558,2751.867,"--Yes, because Edwards only applies to custodial interrogation, and, under these circumstances, Edwards strikes a balance in a familiar and predictable way."
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2756.254,2757.471,"Counsel, we--"
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2757.471,2758.423,--permit an exception.
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2758.423,2759.827,--We don't have a case.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2779.398,2780.474,"Yes, some form of jail."
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2803.155,2803.529,Well--
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2803.529,2811.57,"Well, I suppose, if they are in a pretrial detention center, they know they are still being looked at for the crime as to which they have invoked the Miranda warnings."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2811.57,2812.339,Yes.
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2812.339,2818.196,So you wouldn't call that -- and I don't understand the other side to argue that that is -- there is a break in custody there.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2818.196,2822.16,But a transfer within -- look.
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2829.527,2829.746,No.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2844.253,2850.889,"--But, from the suspect's point of view, the only thing that changed is the State agents who temporarily held him in a room for questioning."
2009.08-680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2853.026,2868.741,"--Yes, but -- but wouldn't it make sense to treat the -- the change from a pretrial detention to a general prison population as, by itself, a no longer custody, provided he is told that he doesn't have to talk to people who want to pay him a visit."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2881.094,2884.187,"--It's -- it's one possibility, but I don't think it's a workable rule."
2009.08-680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2888.543,2897.695,"They can, but, if you say, as a condition to -- to questioning, he just has to know that he doesn't have to see visitors he doesn't want to see, which doesn't seem, to me, a very hard rule to administer."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2897.695,2903.272,"It doesn't, Justice Stevens, but I think the problem is it's a hard rule for police officers to know."
2009.08-680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2908.658,2908.907,Well--
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2908.907,2912.046,Doesn't -- but doesn't the beginning of the Miranda warning tell him that he doesn't have to--
2009.08-680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2912.046,2914.874,"--They have the prisoner there, and he shows up, and then -- that's the end of it."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2914.874,2917.354,I still think it presents difficulties.
2009.08-680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2917.354,2918.492,I--
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2918.492,2920.368,--Could I have a clarification of the facts for a moment?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2927.474,2927.848,Correct.
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2927.848,2932.953,And he was just moved from one State prison to another.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2938.281,2938.889,That's correct.
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2938.889,2942.355,"We are just talking about a change in facility, not in status?"
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2942.355,2943.03,Exactly.
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2962.94,2964.348,What were the circumstances?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2965.783,2975.173,"Well, that was the case that is not entirely analogous, but it's close, where the question was whether a statement was tainted by an Edwards' violation."
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2977.778,2981.748,Was the prisoner in a prison the entire 24 hours?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,2984.731,2985.855,--I think it was a release home.
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2990.759,2998.255,--Do I misunderstand Miranda warnings?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3031.178,3037.534,"It isn't enough, Justice Scalia, because -- and I think this came out of Arizona versus Roberson."
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3051.795,3056.216,"He doesn't care whether he gets an attorney, so long as he doesn't have to talk to the investigators."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3069.616,3080.254,"But, if he has asked for an attorney in the past and, over two years and seven months, has never seen the right fulfilled, I think that the -- that the pressure to cooperate with interrogators has increased."
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3080.254,3082.843,That is a -- isn't that a Sixth Amendment question?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3085.935,3091.447,"Well, in this case, Chief Justice Roberts, the Sixth Amendment never attached because this suspect had never been charged."
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3091.447,3091.603,Right.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3096.021,3096.567,Yes.
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3096.567,3098.551,"--and that is addressed, if you stop questioning him."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3102.283,3102.97,But I think--
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3102.97,3106.784,"Talking stopped, as it did the very -- the first time he was approached."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3106.784,3115.716,"--It did, but for a prisoner in custody questioned about the same offense, the coercive pressures that were present in Miranda are present for him as well."
2009.08-680,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3122.229,3135.004,"Why wouldn't he think, I invoked my right to remain silent without a lawyer two years and seven months ago, I will do it again; they will have to stop questioning?"
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3147.405,3150.903,I think it's -- it's possible.
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3163.12,3163.79,So if he says -- I'm sorry--
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3163.79,3165.553,Go ahead.
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3165.553,3165.974,--Are you done answering?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3177.392,3180.465,I think it would come out the same way.
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3180.465,3186.762,"Well, but all your arguments about he hasn't been provided a lawyer, there is an ethical obligation to provide a lawyer."
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3187.979,3199.599,"Well, what's different is in this Court, I think may be clear in Michigan v. Mosley: Asking for help from an attorney is materially different than saying, I choose to remain silent."
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3207.921,3209.313,He doesn't ask for an attorney.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3222.914,3230.035,"Well, and they treated it as a clear invocation of the right to counsel by documenting it in two places and putting that in the case file."
2009.08-680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3230.035,3233.361,The right to counsel in the course of interrogation.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3233.361,3234.784,Yes.
2009.08-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3240.264,3252.995,I can think of -- I can think of at least one situation in which the Court has held that there is a time limit in which something has to be done in order to comply with a Constitutional requirement.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3259.413,3262.412,"Oh, anything over two years and seven months."
2009.08-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3264.081,3266.655,What would be--
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3266.655,3268.121,That still doesn't solve the problem.
2009.08-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3268.121,3275.804,--What would be a serious -- what would be a serious answer to that question?
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3275.804,3280.662,"We've argued that Edwards continues to the end, and the reason is--"
2009.08-680,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3280.662,3281.411,All or nothing.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3281.411,3292.968,"--It's all or nothing, Justice Alito, because -- because this Court has already said in Edwards, We will allow the police to come back if the suspect changes his or her mind or if an attorney is present."
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3298.697,3302.245,--Your adversary says that they -- he can't change his mind.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3321.22,3322.343,That's right.
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3322.343,3323.252,That's the point.
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3323.252,3324.64,That is the badgering.
2009.08-680,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3335.184,3337.309,"So there is no termination point, really?"
2009.08-680,2,18788,celia_davis,,3337.309,3346.134,"--It is not confined to time, Justice Sotomayor, but the termination point is, especially for a prisoner, it's easy for the prisoner to contact the police."
2009.08-680,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3364.075,3365.592,"Thank you, Ms. Davis."
2009.08-680,3,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,3367.917,3380.602,"In response to Justice Breyer's question, the ethics rules do not apply to the police, only to lawyers, and I think Justice Scalia hit it right, exactly right, where this -- he's actually -- in this case, he is not represented at all."
2009.08-680,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3383.726,3391.455,"My thought is, can you use the rule for lawyers, which has worked, to help shape a rule that would work here?"
2009.08-680,3,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,3391.455,3393.455,"Yes, and I will get to that in one second."
2009.08-680,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3465.327,3468.906,"But -- but there was no difference in those cases, as I understand it."
2009.08-680,3,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,3476.432,3477.84,--My understanding of this case--
2009.08-680,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3477.84,3478.199,And brought back.
2009.08-680,3,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,3478.199,3485.241,"--My understanding of this case, they were in the -- sort of the box, as we call it, and then they were put into a holding cell, a cell, and then brought back to the box."
2009.08-680,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3485.834,3493.833,"There is no difference between that and a holding cell, a maintenance room, and being put back into general prison to go sleep."
2009.08-680,3,20886,douglas_f_gansler,,3493.833,3497.548,"--The latter -- the latter scenario is very different, because that's where they live."
2009.08-680,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3520.49,3521.613,"Thank you, Counsel."
