1955.486,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.397,"Number 486, National Labor Relations Board versus Truitt Manufacturing Company."
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,22.235,26.112,May it please the Court.
1955.486,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,518.652,531.765,Is there any claim here that even though the company had not put its refusal to grant the increase on this particular ground that the union would have been entitled to such information?
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,531.765,532.633,"No, Your Honor."
1955.486,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,541.878,542.685,No question about that?
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,542.685,545.048,No question about that.
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,545.048,546.38,"May I ask this, Mr. Findling?"
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,574.282,578.26,"Your Honor, we're dealing here with the definition of the obligation to bargain --"
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,578.26,579.128,I understand that.
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,579.128,590.061,"-- and I -- I would think that in particular circumstances, the Board might well have power to require the submission of books --"
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,590.061,590.359,I --
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,590.359,593.131,-- even though an employer was acting in good faith because of --
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,593.131,611.151,"So now, what I want to know is, is it the Board's position to put a -- a claim is made, they're unable to pay that the -- that the mere failure to -- is there any request to a specific -- didn't they discuss their economic condition, the platform, showing of books?"
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,611.151,616.09,"The -- the company offered to show the wage rates its competitors were paying, some of them and --"
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,616.09,622.322,What I want to know is the mere failure to show its book as a matter of law applying with that faith.
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,622.322,624.022,"Well, Your Honor, that's not involved."
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,676.938,689.866,"Well, the reason I asked my question is because of the Jacobs case which reads very difficult to enable this case because the Jacobs case, there's a theory there, a number of circumstances."
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,727.243,728.207,"No, Your Honor."
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,728.207,731.136,"Now, what else is there in this case except that?"
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,731.136,735.986,"But, Your Honor, it wasn't the question simply of opening the books and records."
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,740.17,741.38,"Well, they gave some, didn't they?"
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,741.38,741.662,Yes.
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,749.524,749.871,And therefore (Voice Overlap) --
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,749.871,751.512,-- for its claim of inability to pay.
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,751.512,764.159,"Therefore, the cause of argument in my mind, has the Board's power to say really in order to make this negotiation, why so sensible and effective, you got to give me some more data."
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,774.503,778.235,"But Your Honor, the Board's order doesn't require the company to open its books?"
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,778.235,779.946,"But they gave some data here, didn't they?"
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,779.946,780.668,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,823.315,823.758,"Well, I repeat --"
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,823.758,823.946,-- with the --
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,823.946,824.486,-- my question.
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,842.054,842.683,"Well, Your Honor --"
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,842.683,852.198,Because stupidity and obtuseness and deep feeling on the subject of our assumption need not necessarily prove bad-faith.
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,852.198,871.732,"Well, Your Honor, if we are right in our position that it's the employer's responsibility, it's his duty, part of his duty that within the meaning of Section 8 (a) (5) of the Act when he says he is unable to pay to disclose the pertinent data on which he rest that conclusion."
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,882.332,882.729,I don't know (Voice Overlap) --
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,882.729,896.613,"Well, Your Honor, if I may, anymore than a company can defend its failure, for example, to discuss a pension plan because it in good faith things but it's not required to do it."
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,908.876,908.914,(Voice Overlap) --
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,908.914,909.782,-- and that's our position here.
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,909.782,918.226,"-- how you can say that, there's a -- you can say that a particular action or non-action proves one of good faith."
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,924.27,924.713,"Well, Your Honor --"
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,924.713,926.507,Do those words mean nothing?
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,926.507,945.417,"Of course it says good faith but there are certain things like recognition of a union, bargaining about wages, hours and conditions of employment, exchanging relevant information and so on that as a matter of -- of a definition of the duty to bargain."
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,964.822,965.336,All right.
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,965.336,977.235,"-- and so on, then if an employer doesn't in some -- if -- if an employer fails in some respect to discharge it, it doesn't matter whether he's done it in good faith or bad-faith --"
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,977.235,977.561,I --
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,977.561,978.696,-- anymore --
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,978.696,981.01,I reject your formulation.
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,989.379,992.025,"Well, Your Honor, we're trying to pro -- I was -- I was --"
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,992.025,1002.692,"Good faith or bad-faith, the state of mind and what you're arguing is that circumstances and conduct on the basis of which the Board may conclude there was one on good faith."
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,1002.692,1003.76,"Well, Your Honor, we're ready --"
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1003.76,1004.705,"Anyway, you ought to agree with that."
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,1005.067,1007.795,"Well, we're ready to concede."
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1017.887,1017.973,I'm not saying --
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,1017.973,1018.567,-- in the --
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1018.567,1018.832,-- you should concede.
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,1018.832,1019.426,-- to -- to submit the data.
1955.486,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1019.426,1028.498,I'm not saying the company was sincere (Inaudible) and people who gave a little bit to (Inaudible) I'm not taking about that.
1955.486,0,20852,david_p_findling,,1034.631,1049.961,"Well, I don't mean to expunge it out and the Board found that the failure to submit the data was a failure, it resulted in a failure on the part of the company to discharge its responsibility to bargain in good faith."
1955.486,1,39042,rd_douglas_jr,,1983.251,1987.388,May it please the Court.
