1974.73-1908,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.85,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1908, Cort against Ash."
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,51.866,56.183,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,306.958,314.006,"Mr. Rome, the Court of Appeals didn't in its opinion necessarily approve that form of relief, did it?"
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,314.006,314.958,I believe sir.
1974.73-1908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.898,356.556,"Well, didn't the respondent seek damages also?"
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,356.556,357.852,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.258,1021.921,"Does your argument here, your making a constitutional argument now or your making a statutory construction on you?"
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1021.921,1037.215,"It runs both ways Mr. Justice White for the reason that in our contention their ought not to be an implication of a private right of action when constitutional infringement occurs and in addition, there is the constitutional argument in on of itself."
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1037.215,1037.465,Yes.
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1044.409,1045.054,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1045.054,1051.858,"But, but -- now, how about --did do -- does involve here in Section 591 I gather --"
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1051.858,1054.312,610 and 591 both come into --
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.312,1059.562,You don't disagree -- you don't disagree that 591 standards are relevant to 610?
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1059.562,1059.769,Oh!
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1067.66,1072.739,"And so, you're saying that these expenditures are plainly covered by either Section?"
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1072.739,1084.914,"We say that, the Sections were never intended to cover this kind of issue oriented non-partisan advertising or communication because --"
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1084.914,1086.195,And if not?
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1093.403,1094.032,That's right sir.
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1094.922,1100.808,But you're using the constitutional arguments as a reason for giving in the construction this expenditure argument?
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1100.808,1101.204,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1111.583,1119.938,And then you wouldn't have to decide whether there was a private right of action either if your narrow construction there's term expenditures is right?
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1119.938,1134.42,It would then reach the conclusion Mr. Justice Rehnquist that the complaint does not state the cause of action on its face because it does not then come within the band of expenditure as use in 610 and 591.
1974.73-1908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1134.42,1136.927,But the criminal sanctions wouldn't be applicable on that?
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1136.927,1143.073,It would not be applicable because there would have been no wrongdoing committed by Bethlehem or the defendants.
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1143.073,1157.174,"Now, the courts of the Court of Appeals just to claim disagreed with you that as a matter of fact these particular expenditures were partisan?"
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1157.174,1171.817,"It held only Mr. Justice White that there was a disputed issue of fact as the result of which the grant of summary judgment was reversed and the case was remanded to the District Court for a trial with regard to that, although --"
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.817,1172.005,Oh!
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1172.43,1174.27,"The earlier situation, excuse me sir."
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.27,1174.682,"Yes, I --"
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1174.682,1182.25,The earlier situation was one in which the trial judge himself as a matter of law had concluded that there was not a partisanship --
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.25,1183.706,"I gather, yes."
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1183.706,1185.911,In the publications.
1974.73-1908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1258.457,1259.884,That was a dissenting opinion?
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1259.884,1260.259,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1342.802,1343.833,A moment Mr. Rome.
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1343.833,1345.183,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1345.183,1356.346,If we were to disagree with your view of the scope of expenditures but agree that there was no implied right of action.
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1358.239,1360.879,It is not then reached Your Honor.
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1362.87,1363.797,That ends this lawsuit.
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1363.797,1365.332,"Yes, it ends this lawsuit."
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1366.794,1370.468,And you say the constitutional idea to some criminal prosecutions here?
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1370.468,1386.178,"Except Your Honor, may I bring to your attention in that regard, the fact that the Amendment to the FECA of 1974 has created the Federal Election Commission which is intending to get under way."
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1421.383,1425.439,What is law as the -- there is administrative agency that --
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1425.439,1425.948,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.948,1427.783,Possibility for enforcing --
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1427.783,1428.134,There --
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.134,1429.051,This law?
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1429.051,1433.985,This law Your Honor -- the -- as amended by 1974 made up of --
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.985,1438.05,"Is that -- this have cease and desist power, they didn't have to go court or what?"
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1438.05,1444.909,It has the ability to bring civil action and there is also the continuing criminal remedy available.
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1454.474,1461.169,"Do you think that under the new law there would be an argument about there being obliged, don't they?"
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1461.169,1467.097,I would think Your Honor that there is bound to be because this case in itself repre --
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1467.097,1473.646,"There's nothing in the new statute that says, whatever this agency may do that it what may do is exclusive."
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1473.646,1473.663,It -- it --
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1473.663,1479.991,"Well, but if Congress has it oppose the -- I don't remember that this -- agency which has civil remedies available?"
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1479.991,1488.109,"But that comes within Title 3 of the Act, Section 610 comes within Title 2 of the Act, sir."
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1506.037,1513.773,"But if your â€“ it's certain if you, if you think you have strong argument under the old statute, it certainly has gone --"
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1513.773,1524.831,"Indeed, Your Honor and this is one reason why since the matter is here and certiorari has been granted that covers because we did indeed raise the constitutional question."
1974.73-1908,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1541.725,1555.528,"What would you think the law means when it says, the Commission has primary jurisdiction with respect to the civil enforcement of such provisions and such provisions includes 610, doesn't it?"
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1555.528,1556.059,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1556.242,1557.325,What does that mean?
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1557.325,1569.343,I think that there was an intent by Congress to create an administrative commission that would bring uniformity and a growing body of expertise to this problem.
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1598.8,1603.98,I think if you petition for a -- you've raised questions here besides the Constitution --
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1603.98,1605.702,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1605.702,1607.776,But you don't want to subside it?
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1607.776,1608.691,Oh!
1974.73-1908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1612.972,1615.376,You have counter-elect on to win as long as you live?
1974.73-1908,0,23065,edwin_p_rome,,1615.376,1620.781,I want desperately to win Your Honor. [Laughter]
1974.73-1908,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1622.924,1627.747,You may reserve the balance.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,1628.367,1633.628,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1928.426,1928.846,Mr. Berger.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,1928.846,1929.533,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1929.533,1935.747,You mentioned and emphasized the size of Bethlehem Steel.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,1941.21,1941.564,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1963.093,1969.002,"Would the statute apply to the small one-man corporation with assets of a $1,000.00?"
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,1969.002,1970.045,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1970.045,1973.878,Would it apply to a nonprofit corporation?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,1973.878,1975.506,I do not believe so.
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1975.506,1977.024,Why?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,1978.35,1992.488,I don't find any exception but I find that this Court has put a gloss upon the interpretation that Mr. Justice Frankfurter has said in the UAW case.
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2000.638,2005.464,Are you familiar with League of Women's Voters?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2005.464,2007.553,"To a certain extent, I am sir."
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2007.553,2021.099,"It may or may not be a corporation but it could be and if there large foundations in United States it might very well urge the public together to vote, would you considered that to come within the statute?"
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2021.099,2031.271,"I would say that, if the League of Women Voters assuming it were a corporation and it sent these messages out to its own stockholders."
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2036.99,2040.936,Suppose it ran an ad in the same publications?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2040.936,2047.734,"If it could be arguably urge that that would violate, that's not this case."
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2065.11,2076.427,To what extent is the content of the exhibits relevant to the case in its present posture in your view?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2076.427,2087.891,"Only Mr. Chief Justice to the extent that they constitute admissions already of record but in my view of the case, it's the averments of the complaint that count."
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2173.558,2179.709,Would it be relevant to go and perhaps this from your point of view.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2195.044,2203.316,"Your Honors, anybody can say what was in these materials."
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2230.361,2239.71,With the same -- the same might be said with reference to the lecture that I was suggesting by hypothetically that if the professor wants to make a particular speech.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2248.904,2250.233,That maybe.
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2263.964,2272.847,I take it your point is now that the content of this is really irrelevant in spite of what you said about its getting some support to your position?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2272.847,2275.297,"Well, I wouldn't call it entirely irrelevant."
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2397.385,2398.618,"We'll, it's rarely --"
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2398.618,2399.604,Do you --
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2399.604,2402.051,It's rarely known to decide constitutional questions from the --
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2402.051,2404.923,That's right and I would not ask Your Honors to decide it.
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2409.051,2410.339,Constitutionally?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2410.339,2412.758,Need not be decided on this issue.
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.434,2420.734,Assume we disagree with the other side on -- in private action --
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2420.734,2422.457,I think you should disagree with them or not --
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.457,2424.194,I know but --
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2424.194,2438.397,"And in that event, I think you should agree with me that the averments of the complaint and the record as it is showing off to go the fact finder to determine whether there's been a violation of Section 610."
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2448.07,2448.304,Oh!
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2457.226,2457.675,Right.
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.675,2460.171,That the 610 may prevent it.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2460.171,2461.248,I think that's correct.
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2461.248,2463.926,"Well, then they said that that's constitutional for --"
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2463.926,2465.962,I did know that they didn't pass on ---
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2465.962,2466.394,No.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2467.103,2469.412,The Third Circuit didn't reach that point.
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.699,2475.916,Because they'll be able -- they said it's not unconstitutional on its face?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2475.916,2479.468,"They didn't reach the constitutional point Your Honor with the due deference, sir."
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2479.468,2480.015,"Well, what about it?"
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2483.452,2484.646,They didn't get into that.
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.508,2499.847,Suppose you're right about all that?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2499.847,2500.744,Yes.
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.744,2504.592,Sometime the constitutional question has got to be decided?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2504.592,2506.508,"Well, I pretty know they didn't."
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2506.508,2510.581,If we were to agree with you that they were right as far as they went.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2514.169,2514.419,I think --
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.419,2515.873,Before you go trial?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2515.873,2516.257,I think --
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.257,2518.365,Because isn't there a facial claim?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2518.365,2521.257,"Well, then I'm prepared to argue that it is constitutional."
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2521.257,2521.891,I would think you would?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2521.891,2528.454,"And I would like very briefly with Your Honor's permission, first, to cover their private cause of action."
1974.73-1908,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2542.895,2543.973,The Safety Appliance Act?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2543.973,2544.891,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2607.142,2614.827,"But aren't the federal court's jurisdiction isn't to really create common law, the way the state courts says?"
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2614.827,2617.111,"No, quite aggrieve Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1974.73-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2620.881,2622.958,But you referred to it just like the common law.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2623.227,2623.508,No.
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2662.93,2672.061,Even if that means that you got to between 4 and 500 district judges who might be dealing separately and independently with the question?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2672.061,2680.381,I believe sir that the federal judicial system is capable of bringing uniformity in that kind of situation.
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2684.79,2687.071,"Well ultimately, we bring the uniformity here, don't we?"
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2687.071,2687.815,Exactly.
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2689.432,2694.444,I think that's quite a lot of expended effort before it happens.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2694.444,2699.575,"Your Honor Chief Justice, a lot less effort than if you let it just go to 50 states."
1974.73-1908,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2740.198,2762.857,"Suppose, it wouldn't be hard to either discern from legislative history or to infer from one's reasoning processes that the purpose of almost any federal criminal statute and of which there are hundreds if not thousands."
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2774.051,2778.265,"I -- Your Honor, I -- with all due deference I disagree."
1974.73-1908,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2778.728,2779.306,I hope you do.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2779.611,2787.749,"First, we -- we're deciding this case that I'm going on a basis of the cases that came before this Court."
1974.73-1908,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2794.658,2794.893,Yes.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2804.699,2805.709,"Well, let me -- let me explain why --"
1974.73-1908,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2805.709,2807.911,A civil -- being a civil cause of action.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2808.878,2812.894,Because in most instances the criminal penalty is adequate.
1974.73-1908,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2814.487,2815.659,But who's to judge that?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2815.659,2816.865,This Court.
1974.73-1908,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2816.865,2824.485,You mean if it's if one dollar -- one year penitentiary offense is not adequate but if it is 10 years it is and then there's no civil cause of action?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2824.485,2829.733,"Well, I mean that -- I mean what the specific right is that's violated."
1974.73-1908,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2830.235,2831.854,"Let the Congress to say what the penalty, if it's criminal penalty --"
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2831.854,2832.37,That's right.
1974.73-1908,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2834.305,2834.388,And having done so?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2834.388,2836.56,And this Court --
1974.73-1908,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2836.56,2840.762,"By definition, it's adequate because that's what Congress has said?"
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2840.762,2842.437,Only to that extent.
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2938.835,2953.527,"Let's assume for a moment right on that that a corporate officer is found guilty of violating statute on 11 counts and the district judge imposes an $110,000.00 maximum penalty available."
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2953.539,2954.789,The Government --
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2954.789,2966.659,Do you suggest that the stockhold -- a stockholder would not have a remedy to bring suit against him to make him reimburse the corporation for the fine imposed for his misconduct?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2966.659,2967.786,This is what we're doing in this case.
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2967.786,2968.848,Well --
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2968.848,2971.117,"We're saying right now, Your Honor --"
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2971.117,2972.073,Not quite.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2972.073,2972.592,"Well, but do that --"
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2972.592,2974.808,You went cir -- you went to short circuit that process?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2974.808,2976.777,"No, with due deference Chief Justice."
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2989.139,2993.048,At whose instance are you suggesting the criminal process proceed?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2993.048,2994.856,That's up to the Attorney General.
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2994.856,2998.162,"Well, but you wanted to go back to the district judge and --"
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,2998.162,3000.31,"No, not for the criminal process sir."
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3001.382,3002.867,The present process?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3002.867,3006.534,"Well, that's the district judge is the forum in which this will be tried."
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3006.534,3012.999,I'm addressing my question to you on the basis of saying your statement that there is no remedy for the stockholder.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3015.53,3024.221,"Only, if Your Honors will agree with the Third Circuit that there -- this is an appropriate case to say that the private cause of action exist."
1974.73-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3080.9,3086.522,But what about the statute that makes it a crime to rob a federally insured bank.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3093.899,3103.149,"I would have to reveal that it might very well, but I'd have to reveal the entire history of the Act and see what the underlying purpose was."
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3103.899,3104.372,Mr. Berger.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3104.372,3105.474,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3105.474,3113.693,The Third Circuit found that this right to be implied to register voters as well as to stockholders.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3113.693,3116.298,I don't think we have to go that far Mr. Justice Powell.
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3116.298,3118.419,"Well, I won't -- I would like to know your view of the statute."
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3118.419,3119.127,Well --
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3119.127,3126.428,"There are 75 to 90 million registered voters so the Third Circuit's opinion, it says that that many people could bring this suit?"
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3126.428,3139.184,"Well, Mr. Justice Powell, I say and my position is that we only have to sustain Mr. Ash's right because he is a stockholder and stockholders have not drawn out to federal courts yet."
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3139.184,3139.313,You would say that --
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3139.313,3142.912,"Sec -- second, excuse me sir."
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3143.597,3145.892,"You're defending here only the stockholders, right?"
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3145.892,3147.794,"At this point, I say Your Honors."
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.215,3184.199,If you had recovered any recovery from these people in the state courts?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3184.199,3188.032,I think that there is that possibility but I don't think that's --
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3188.032,3193.314,Can you go into your state courts and say these people have violated the federal statute in giving away this money?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3195.162,3199.252,I think that is an arguable position Mr. Justice White but I believe sir that that --
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3199.252,3199.688,"Well, is that --"
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3199.688,3201.19,That would not be adequate.
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3201.19,3203.678,You're an exp -- I didn't mention my question to you.
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3205.381,3205.573,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3205.573,3206.554,Pennsylvanian lawyer --
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3206.554,3206.587,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3206.587,3208.234,I just wondered if you would want --
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3208.234,3216.475,"I would have to say that under Delaware law sir, that the doctor of ultra vires would permit such a state suit."
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3216.98,3218.754,"Now, that's an ultra vires?"
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3218.754,3220.082,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3220.082,3223.618,Does that dependent at all on the application of federal statute?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3223.618,3225.259,It would -- it does.
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3225.259,3225.913,"It does, yes."
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3225.913,3226.485,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3226.485,3232.024,"And so, there is a remedy in the state courts under the state law to vindicate his right."
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3232.024,3234.474,Possible but it's inadequate in my submission that --
1974.73-1908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.474,3239.011,"Well, it's not only possible but you just said that its there."
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3239.339,3248.923,"Well, I said that I believe that the state law could remedy it to a certain degree but I also agree suggests that you're not going to get uniformity."
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3418.332,3420.174,That -- that's your answer to the constitutional argument?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3420.174,3420.637,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3420.637,3421.47,That's you ought to do?
1974.73-1908,1,20567,david_berger,,3421.47,3421.807,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3450.985,3452.395,"Thank you, Mr. Berger."
1974.73-1908,2,23065,edwin_p_rome,,3453.572,3472.861,"With Your Honors' permission, I would bring to your attention the fact that Judge Aldisert had earlier commented in the same way that Mr. Justice Stewart has suggested to imply a private right of action here he says, is to suggest that for every written volume of Title 18 United States Code."
1974.73-1908,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3623.649,3624.947,Thank you gentlemen.
