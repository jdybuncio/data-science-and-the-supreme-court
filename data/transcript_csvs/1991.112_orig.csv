1991.112_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.278,"We'll hear argument now in No. 112 Original, Wyoming against Oklahoma."
1991.112_orig,0,37178,neal_leader,,47.421,52.326,"Mr. Chief Justice, and maybe it please the Court:"
1991.112_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,212.88,218.964,You suggest that the taxpayer is going to invite the State to impose the tax just so it can run this end run?
1991.112_orig,0,37178,neal_leader,,218.964,219.945,"--I am not, but--"
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1188.189,1191.171,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.112_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1245.155,1248.738,"Are you going to go into the question of standing at all, Ms. Guthrie?"
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1248.738,1251.65,"Yes, I will address that now, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.112_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.65,1253.242,At your convenience.
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1260.055,1260.866,"Well, I don't know--"
1991.112_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1260.866,1262.268,Is there some explanation for that?
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1268.612,1269.301,"--No, we don't."
1991.112_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1290.555,1295.129,"How was the $500,000 a year proven, Ms. Guthrie?"
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1295.129,1304.444,There was an affidavit prepared by a person from our tax division who looked at the amount of coal that had not been sold in Oklahoma and estimated how much that would be.
1991.112_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1308.668,1323.086,"Well, the burden of proof would be on the State of Wyoming, I suppose, on that issue because it's the plaintiff, and I suppose the special master could make a finding that Wyoming lost a certain amount of money."
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1325.109,1325.439,Yes.
1991.112_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1334.866,1337.718,Did he make any finding as to dollar amount?
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1337.718,1339.769,I don't recall if he did or not.
1991.112_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1341.068,1357.69,"It seems to me that your affidavit, while it would perhaps support a finding of loss, doesn't rule out the possibility that if the coal production in Wyoming didn't sell in Oklahoma, it might have found a market for elsewhere."
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1362.082,1369.759,"The affidavit does say that the State of Wyoming lost $500,000 in tax revenues because of coal that had not been sold to Oklahoma utilities."
1991.112_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.759,1377.303,But that doesn't indicate that that same coal that would otherwise have been sold to Oklahoma might not have been sold elsewhere.
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1377.303,1381.607,That doesn't really affect the State of Wyoming sales.
1991.112_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1395.644,1402.798,"I am not saying that that is not a reasonable position, but it doesn't seem it is the only one."
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1425.564,1441.854,"We have a stipulation that provides that until about 1986 virtually 100 percent of all the coal burned in Oklahoma came from Wyoming, and since that time, after the statute has been passed, the amount of coal that has been sold to Oklahoma has been reduced."
1991.112_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1463.87,1484.222,"So even though... your theory is that even though Wyoming did not lose a penny, its severance tax revenues are as high as ever, if some of the severance taxes were imposed on coal sold in Utah as replacements for the sale that wasn't sold in Oklahoma, it can still bring this action?"
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1484.222,1492.097,"Our position is that because the act was passed, we can fairly trace an injury to the collection of severance taxes."
1991.112_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1518.634,1527.11,"Ms. Guthrie, let me be sure about one fact; didn't Oklahoma move to dismiss the original action?"
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1527.11,1531.173,"This Court has viewed the standing issue, this is the third time the Court has viewed the standing issue."
1991.112_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1542.31,1546.294,So one could almost argue that the standing issue already has been decided up here.
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1546.294,1559.062,"--I would argue that, but if I am getting questions from the Court, I wouldn't be so abrupt to make that kind of argument, but the standing issue... because then the motion to dismiss based on standing was denied."
1991.112_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1570.91,1573.101,"So he didn't think we had decided it, anyway."
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1573.101,1576.003,"Well, he probably thought you had decided, but he wanted to decide it again."
1991.112_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1576.003,1577.232,He just wanted to decide it again?
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1577.232,1578.063,Yes.
1991.112_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.164,1583.607,"Ms. Guthrie, I have a problem."
1991.112_orig,1,35905,mary_b_guthrie,,1647.31,1651.06,"No, the State couldn't in that instance, but that is certainly not the kind of--"
1991.112_orig,2,37178,neal_leader,,2151.459,2153.37,"Your Honor, I will waive rebuttal."
1991.112_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2153.37,2154.822,Very well.
