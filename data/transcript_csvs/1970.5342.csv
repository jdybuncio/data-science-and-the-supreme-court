1970.5342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,26.771,"We’ll hear arguments next in Number 5342, Wintfored Rewis and Williams against the United States."
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,26.771,29.431,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.5342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,29.431,31.426,Mr. Datz.
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,31.426,57.766,"The issue here is whether or not travel in Interstate Commerce is necessary for guilt, whether or not the travel in Interstate Commerce necessary for guilt under 18 United States Code 1952, known as Travel Act, is supplied by the fact that the gambling players or customers cross a state line."
1970.5342,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,60.279,60.95,Mr. Datz.
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,60.95,61.062,Yes sir.
1970.5342,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,61.062,75.731,"Your -- you stated the issue and as you understand it and submitted to the Court today, is it purely a question of a statutory construction or are there any constitutional questions?"
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,75.731,78.215,I believe it’s purely statutory construction.
1970.5342,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,78.215,83.269,You don’t question the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause --
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,83.269,83.615,Not in this --
1970.5342,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,83.615,95.987,-- to enact a statute that could’ve made the travel by the gamblers sufficient to make your clients guilty of a federal criminal offense?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,95.987,98.88,"This is not involved here, Your Honor."
1970.5342,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,103.181,108.784,"Well, in other words, if we disagree with you as to the statutory construction, it could be involved."
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,134.333,135.587,We don’t go that far --
1970.5342,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,135.587,138.775,"Because you rest your argument on the words of the statute, is that correct?"
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,138.775,139.1,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.5342,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,139.1,140.044,And my posit --
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,140.044,154.265,"Well, tangentially that in the recently passed act, Congress did declare that gambling was a matter of interstate commerce per se, that it affected Interstate Commerce and attempted to regulate it."
1970.5342,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,167.431,168.664,Now you assume it could have.
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,175.468,176.162,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.5342,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,176.162,177.537,It's purely a statutory argument?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,177.537,177.843,Yes Your Honor.
1970.5342,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,177.843,179.578,"Alright, thank you."
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,179.578,206.987,"The petitioner, James Rewis and Mary Williams were convicted in the Middle District of Florida of the crime involved in the violation of 18 United States Code 1952, known as the Travel Act, that is of traveling and causing travel in Interstate Commerce with and intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on and to facilitate the promotion and management, establishment and carrying on of a gambling activity."
1970.5342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,477.47,487.13,What would you say if the gambling establishment had been 15 feet inside the line from Georgia?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,487.13,494.853,"I would say the same thing that the -- it did not violate the statute, this particular Travel Act anyhow."
1970.5342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,514.586,519.543,Would that be different if they had a sign --
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,519.543,520.342,I don’t believe so.
1970.5342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,520.342,526.51,"-- the other way saying, “Come in and have fun just before you leave Florida.”"
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,526.51,540.248,"I don’t -- I don’t -- if the operators had traveled in Interstate Commerce to put that sign up and they would have had to that do either themselves or through some agent, then of course, they would be guilty because they are the operators."
1970.5342,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,568.637,570.308,"Mr. Datz, the --"
1970.5342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,570.308,572.202,What would have attracted to this place?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,572.202,573.013,"I’m sorry Your Honor, I didn’t hear it."
1970.5342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,573.013,585.034,"I guess you wouldn’t blame the Court of Appeals that they’re wrong in saying that beyond 15 miles from the boarder, on those good roads, they would’ve attracted the players?"
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,585.034,597.258,"I would tend to agree Your Honor that it might have had some attraction although and we might discuss this at this moment, the Government says that the predominant people involved were Georgia."
1970.5342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,622.147,624.009,And others came by down to gamble?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,624.009,624.772,Yes sir.
1970.5342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,692.072,695.509,Then any more people that come from 15 miles down in Florida?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,695.509,698.615,That’s all that the record shows Your Honor except for one --
1970.5342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,698.615,700.379,"How many were coming from the Florida, I don’t see --"
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,700.379,700.955,A lot.
1970.5342,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,723.545,725.75,"So, they were movies introduced to notice?"
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,725.75,727.207,"Yes, Your Honor, of the surveillance."
1970.5342,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,727.207,729.297,Of the activity going around --
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,729.297,730.117,Yes sir.
1970.5342,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,730.117,733.792,"-- the house and I suppose they are in the original record which is lodged in the Court, are they?"
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,733.792,734.789,Yes sir.
1970.5342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,768.62,776.845,What would be your position if the record showed that 60% of all the people who came there were from Georgia?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,776.845,780.649,"I would say, it would be no different, Your Honor that if a 100% came from Georgia."
1970.5342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,780.649,788.827,"Well then, why emphasize -- that’s the question, why emphasized the minimal number if the number is irrelevant?"
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,788.827,828.29,"Because simply that the Government takes the position that we can expound a new theory here and in spite of the language of the statute that says the travel must be to promote the game, that the defendants could be guilty if you apply a combination of the Mail Fraud Statute and the Mann Act and say that if the defendants reasonably expected out of state people to travel to their game for the specific purpose of participating in that gambling operation, then the Government says, “we can now, based on this case, hold them guilty of the offense.”"
1970.5342,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,838.14,841.507,"Mr. Datz, help me out on one respect."
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,852.219,853.39,I believe that’s correct.
1970.5342,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,853.39,859.937,"Suppose the Fifth Circuit were wrong as to this seller, and that the statute --"
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,859.937,861.347,Then --
1970.5342,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,861.347,862.436,Does your case collapse?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,862.436,865.547,"Yes, it would."
1970.5342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,865.547,878.004,"Would you mind telling me if you can as briefly as possible, what you understand to be the difference between your position and the Government position?"
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,881.952,898.173,"Our position, if it please the Court, is that travel required by the statute cannot be imputed under any circumstances by the simple travel of a customer to a gambling game."
1970.5342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,983.22,1000.972,Is the Government’s theory that anybody who travels along the highway which happens to cross a state line and wants to go to a gambling house subject to jurisdiction of the Federal Government to try for gambling?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1000.972,1010.986,"Not the person who traveled along the highway, but the man who runs the house would be subject to federal jurisdiction, the man who runs the gambling house would then be subject to federal jurisdiction."
1970.5342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1010.986,1014.704,Is that their only basis for the jurisdiction?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1014.704,1015.77,I submit that it is.
1970.5342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1028.958,1033.279,"Well, what -- what would that have to do with the guilt of the man that owned the gambling house?"
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1033.279,1035.358,"I submit that it would not, Your Honor."
1970.5342,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1037.368,1055.487,"You mean, the difference is that the operator of the establishment, in this circumstance where he had reason to expect people will come across state lines to visit his establishment for the purpose of gambling, he is himself both a traveler under (Inaudible)?"
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1055.487,1056.129,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.5342,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1056.129,1056.708,That’s the Government --
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1056.708,1060.165,That’s the Government’s theory as I understand it.
1970.5342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1079.595,1082.259,Isn't the Government’s theory a little broader than that?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1099.325,1099.416,That’s correct.
1970.5342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1099.416,1100.924,Doesn’t that broaden it a little bit?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1100.924,1109.175,"No, Your Honor because in this case there was no allegation of use of facilities in interstate commerce."
1970.5342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1128.389,1140.242,"You do not assert that, do you that the Government does have authority -- police authority to make gambling a crime, just if you are gambling the crime in the state."
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1140.242,1142.19,We do not assert that.
1970.5342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1170.331,1172.103,Is that legislation passed?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1172.103,1172.692,Yes sir.
1970.5342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1172.692,1173.621,In both houses?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1173.621,1174.658,Yes sir.
1970.5342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1194.84,1198.937,Your client is the only one?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1198.937,1209.852,"The -- my client is Rewis, was the man who would go by Mary Williams’ home and gather the money and to figure out who was entitled to what."
1970.5342,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1218.218,1220.271,It’s kind of a secret?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1220.271,1242.893,"Yes sir. [Attempt to Laughter] So, now the government attempts to bring an agency proposition in here under Section -- Title 18, Section 2 (b) which says that whoever willfully causes an act to be performed which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States is punishable as a principal."
1970.5342,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1276.539,1277.863,Excuse me Mr. Datz.
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1307.746,1310.298,Yes sir.
1970.5342,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1310.298,1313.106,I assume we (Inaudible)
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1313.106,1313.388,No.
1970.5342,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1313.388,1319.253,"(Inaudible) and indicted under the use of government facilities, you might not be here."
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1319.253,1320.313,"I don’t know, Your Honor."
1970.5342,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1330.25,1333.659,"And if that’s what your telling me is, you might still be here?"
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1333.659,1334.783,Yes sir.
1970.5342,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1334.783,1341.94,But to say that we’re not in fact indicted for use against facilities apparently from the Court of Appeals (Voice Overlap) --?
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1341.94,1348.256,I submit that that language was thrown in there.
1970.5342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1348.812,1354.523,"So, our question, is that the part of construction or (Inaudible)?"
1970.5342,0,15809,albert_j_datz,,1354.523,1354.559,Travel in interstate.
1970.5342,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1661.949,1665.072,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.5342,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1705.313,1716.687,"What the indictment charges in which the effects charged, sovereignty of the interstate commerce or use of any facility?"
1970.5342,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1716.687,1723.129,"We’ve -- we construe the indictment as charging, traveling in interstate commerce --"
1970.5342,2,15809,albert_j_datz,,3406.208,3408.486,No sir.
1970.5342,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3408.486,3410.962,The volume has nothing to do with the violation?
1970.5342,2,15809,albert_j_datz,,3410.962,3413.22,Not under this Act.
1970.5342,3,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3492.103,3494.816,"No, Your Honor."
1970.5342,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3494.816,3502.419,Do you think that the fact that they came repeatedly and were known as -- has probative force?
1970.5342,3,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3502.419,3505.072,I don’t believe that the record will bear that out.
1970.5342,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3520.655,3521.402,Thank you gentlemen.
