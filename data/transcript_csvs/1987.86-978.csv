1987.86-978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,67.708,"Mr. Kirwin, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.86-978,0,31276,john_l_kirwin,,67.708,71.576,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-978,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,477.321,481.507,"Who was the District Judge, MacLaughlin?"
1987.86-978,0,31276,john_l_kirwin,,481.507,483.792,It was Judge McLaughlin Justice Blackman.
1987.86-978,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,853.532,863.888,"Mr. Kirwin, is the only named Plaintiff in this action with standing to assert the notice issue, Kathryn Jenkins?"
1987.86-978,0,31276,john_l_kirwin,,863.888,866.673,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-978,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,869.791,877.295,"And a letter was given to Ms. Jenkins when, September?"
1987.86-978,0,31276,john_l_kirwin,,877.295,879.981,In September of 1981.
1987.86-978,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,879.981,881.131,Of 1981?
1987.86-978,0,31276,john_l_kirwin,,881.131,882.099,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-978,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,882.099,884.385,Which made reference to this lump-sum change?
1987.86-978,0,31276,john_l_kirwin,,884.385,887.752,"It did, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-978,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,891.871,897.775,"And it is your position that that did constitute written notice, if written notice was required?"
1987.86-978,0,31276,john_l_kirwin,,897.775,899.808,If written notice was required.
1987.86-978,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,901.493,915.367,"In your responses to interrogatories, in the proceedings below, did you acknowledge that written notice was required to recipients, as well as applicants?"
1987.86-978,0,31276,john_l_kirwin,,915.367,923.306,"--Your Honor, I am not certain if that statement would have been made in answer to interrogatories."
1987.86-978,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,923.306,926.675,"The respondents, I thought, said that was the case."
1987.86-978,0,31276,john_l_kirwin,,936.9,943.137,"Justice O'Connor, I think that what respondents were referring to, was the answers to interrogatories by the Secretary."
1987.86-978,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,943.137,943.554,I see.
1987.86-978,0,31276,john_l_kirwin,,943.554,944.354,I would--
1987.86-978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,944.354,949.041,"Well, you don't answer questions of law in interrogatories anyway, do you?"
1987.86-978,0,31276,john_l_kirwin,,949.041,956.544,"--Your Honor, I believe that a party can be asked to state its position concerning legal issues in interrogatories."
1987.86-978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,956.544,958.563,And was that what was done here?
1987.86-978,0,31276,john_l_kirwin,,958.563,966.133,"Interrogatories were served on the Secretary and the Secretary's responses, we believe, were quite confusing."
1987.86-978,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1072.402,1075.871,"Thank you, Mr. Kirwin, we will hear now, from you, Mr. Larkin."
1987.86-978,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1075.871,1092.566,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court?"
1987.86-978,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1360.608,1362.608,"Mr. Larkin, can I backup for a second?"
1987.86-978,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1394.246,1396.364,Let me address that now.
1987.86-978,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1396.364,1401.066,I think it is 206.10(a)(ii).
1987.86-978,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1401.066,1401.852,Right.
1987.86-978,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1413.058,1414.326,What were the pages again?
1987.86-978,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1414.326,1414.943,I am sorry.
1987.86-978,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1439.125,1440.977,"This is A-89, you say?"
1987.86-978,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1440.977,1442.26,"Yes, in the Joint Appendix."
1987.86-978,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.547,1451.433,"Which of those, just to help?"
1987.86-978,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1462.14,1464.508,"Yes, that is the one on the prior page."
1987.86-978,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1464.508,1465.392,"Okay, I am sorry."
1987.86-978,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1465.392,1479.268,"The one at 90 to 91 says, for the subsection I regulation which is at issue here, does not require a state to publicize the lump-sum rule or any other eligibility requirements in specifically developed pamphlets or bulletins."
1987.86-978,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1537.724,1538.407,I see.
1987.86-978,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1543.71,1544.444,Yes.
1987.86-978,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1544.444,1544.894,I see.
1987.86-978,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1544.894,1549.179,"Then the reasons, those I have explained."
1987.86-978,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1644.243,1646.676,"Thank you, Mr. Larkin."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,1649.295,1659.42,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1987.86-978,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1738.186,1747.876,"Of course, the particular plaintiff here, if she had contacted her caseworker, as she was supposed to, would have presumably been advised of the rule by her caseworker."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,1747.876,1759.767,"Ms. Jenkins, Your Honor, did tell the Welfare Department that she was expecting a lump-sum either from Social Security Disability Benefits, or Workers' Compensation Benefits."
1987.86-978,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.802,1768.972,I thought that the record was clear that she did not report the lump-sum payment to her caseworker as she was supposed to.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,1768.972,1771.491,"--No, Your Honor, I think that is not correct."
1987.86-978,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1809.748,1821.155,"I thought she... the family also received $16,000 in a workmens' compensation lump-sum benefit which was never reported?"
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,1821.155,1835.165,"--Your Honor, that is part of what the Commissioner is claiming and it is part of an attempt by the state to paint Ms. Jenkins as a cheat and that is simply not supported by the record."
1987.86-978,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1846.89,1850.575,So you say that is in dispute.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,1860.882,1861.882,"Yes, there was, Your Honor."
1987.86-978,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1861.882,1863.501,And Ms. Jenkins received that?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,1863.501,1865.601,"Ms. Jenkins presumably received that, but she--"
1987.86-978,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1865.601,1868.703,So she did get something other than what was in that pamphlet?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,1868.703,1871.421,"--She got something when she was a recipient, Your Honor, in 1981."
1987.86-978,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1871.421,1871.905,Right.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,1871.905,1876.809,She was not a recipient for some eight months in 1982.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1961.879,1965.181,"Ms. Davison, can I interrupt you right there, because there is one fact I am a little puzzled about."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,1970.319,1973.037,She had been off the rolls for eight months.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1973.037,1976.306,"Well, then was she a recipient in September of 1981?"
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,1976.306,1978.007,She was a recipient in September of 1981.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1978.007,1979.824,So she got the September letter?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,1979.824,1981.126,She got the September letter.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1981.126,1990.148,"So the fact then, I mean if that were adequate and I know you dispute that, but if that were adequate then she would be on notice of at least the contents of that letter."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,1990.148,1993.85,She was on notice in September of 1981.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1993.85,1994.667,Right.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,1994.667,2002.14,"But then she got a lump-sum that was treated not under the old lump-sum rule, it was not treated under the new lump-sum statute."
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2002.14,2003.423,When did she get that?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2003.423,2006.777,In September of 1981 she got the September letter.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2006.777,2007.16,Right.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2007.16,2025.321,"And in either December of 1981 or January of 1982 she got a lump-sum that was treated when she reapplied in November of 1982, eight months later, it was treated, that previous lump-sum was treated as income in the month received and a resource thereafter that did not affect her future eligibility for AFDC."
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2025.321,2030.642,That was because the program did not go into effect until February of 1982?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2030.642,2034.177,"Exactly, exactly and the state did nothing to tell--"
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2034.177,2040.931,But she did have notice that lump-sums were a matter of special interest to the agency.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2040.931,2044.967,--For years the program has required--
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2044.967,2048.536,"I understand what it was, but she did have a duty to report lump-sums."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2048.536,2049.204,--And she did.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.223,2054.175,She reported the second lump-sum--
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2054.175,2056.757,The first lump-sum is not at issue.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2080.992,2082.257,"--Well, I don't understand."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2094.65,2095.502,--She did not know anything about the new rule.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2098.37,2102.238,"Well, she had been told in September of 1981, though, she had gotten that letter."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2102.238,2107.392,She was told in September of 1981 that the law had changed.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2107.392,2108.575,Right.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2108.575,2113.213,That letter also said that this is based on current information and we may change our minds.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2113.213,2113.813,Well?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2113.813,2135.393,"But she was told in November of 1981 that there was some change but her experience after receiving that letter told her and would have told anyone that you could spend your lump-sum income on debts, report it, verify it, and you would be eligible--"
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2135.393,2142.047,"Now, is the only lump-sum that she received that is relevant, the one that she received between the receipt of the letter and the time she reapplied?"
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2142.047,2143.065,--No.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2149.319,2150.486,And was that lump-sum reported?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2150.486,2153.588,"It was reported, it was reported two days after she received it."
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2155.123,2155.84,But she already spent it.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2155.84,2165.496,"--she had eight days, she had 10 days to report it, or eight days to... excuse me, or she had until eight days into the following month to report it."
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2165.496,2170.216,"And the problem was that she had already spent it in those two days, that is right, I remember it now."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2170.216,2170.666,Exactly.
1987.86-978,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2235.758,2249.252,"Ms. Davison, your opponent says that the District Court in the Eighth Circuit required payments to be made to your clients which were contrary to the Congressional authorization."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2251.235,2257.608,"That is not correct, Your Honor, that is not what the Court required."
1987.86-978,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2300.185,2302.22,Even though it was clearly an overpayment under the Act of Congress?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2302.22,2303.187,That is right.
1987.86-978,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2304.27,2308.29,What authority did the Eighth Circuit cite for that proposition?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2309.09,2318.246,"The Eighth Circuit did not make clear, Judge Arnold did not make clear the basis for that order."
1987.86-978,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2342.928,2346.415,"There was a violation of the regulation, as you contend."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2346.415,2347.582,"--The regulation, that is right."
1987.86-978,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.723,2373.131,"Ms. Davison, the statute not only deprived her of eligibility but there is also an explicit provision in the statute requiring recoupment of overpayments, isn't there?"
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2379.285,2386.689,"There is, Your Honor, a statute which governs the relationship between the State and the Federal Government."
1987.86-978,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2397.513,2398.247,I see.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2398.247,2405.935,But that statute does not purport either in expressed or implicit terms to limit the traditional equitable powers of the Federal Court.
1987.86-978,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.179,2459.153,I have tried to think of an analog of some other case I could come up with where the Court has fashioned a remedy that specifically allows somebody to do something which a statute prohibits.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2477.049,2487.72,"Well, Your Honor, in Goldberg v. Kelly the Court said that there must be a right to a due process hearing before benefits are terminated."
1987.86-978,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2487.72,2490.689,That is a Constitutional problem.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2490.689,2491.791,"That is a Constitutional case, Your Honor."
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2524.345,2538.986,"May I go back for a moment to the... your claim depends on there having been a violation of law by the state administrator, at the time of the second application in November of 1982, by failure to explain the lump-sum requirement."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2542.99,2552.578,"No, because the Secretary's regulation says that the information must be provided in writing and orally as appropriate."
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2555.428,2563.784,"Well, what it says is in writing about coverage conditions of eligibility, scope of the program, and related services available."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2570.873,2582.347,"--If there is any ambiguity, Your Honor, it seems to me that it is about what information has to be provided but not whether it has to be in writing or whether it can be simply oral information."
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2582.347,2582.847,Right.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2582.847,2589.084,"So the question of whether or not it has to be in writing, I think, has to be answered in the affirmative."
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.761,2608.563,"But what if, at the time of the application, your client got a pamphlet was it that--"
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2608.563,2609.748,"That is right, two pamphlets."
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2609.748,2611.015,"--And they are in the record, I gather?"
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2611.015,2612.366,"They are in the record, in the Joint Appendix."
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2612.366,2614.432,And do they mention the lump-sum requirements?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2614.432,2615.068,Not a word.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2615.068,2615.851,No mention of lump-sum?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2615.851,2616.801,No mention.
1987.86-978,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2616.801,2623.674,"But, Ms. Jenkins had received the September 18, 1981 letter which did mention the new rule."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2623.674,2627.376,"That is right, but she got nothing at the time that she was an applicant."
1987.86-978,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2628.159,2640.35,Let's assume... so it would not make any difference in your position if the letter she got when she was a recipient was adequate notice?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2640.35,2642.469,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-978,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2642.469,2648.29,So you would say that letter is just irrelevant because she should have had another notice when she reapplied?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2648.29,2655.793,That letter is totally irrelevant to the claim the Plaintiff and her class as to whether the regulation was violated.
1987.86-978,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.594,2682.377,Because she got no notice then?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2682.377,2692.069,"Because she got no notice then, even though the Welfare Department knew that she was anticipating the receipt of a Social Security check or Workers' Compensation check."
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2692.069,2694.853,May I ask one other question?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2704.059,2705.092,She got both of those.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2705.092,2706.328,Okay.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2706.328,2716.6,And it is not true as Mr. Kirwin suggested that these pamphlets only explain eligibility which are applicable to everyone on the program.
1987.86-978,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2861.328,2865.796,Of course most people don't get explanations of changes in law.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2891.263,2900.453,"But we have here, a Federal Regulation which says that you do tell people about the eligibility conditions, you do tell them what their responsibilities are."
1987.86-978,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.511,2918.164,Do we have to agree with you that applicant and recipient are one and the same in order to agree with you about the regulation?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2922.901,2923.851,That is right.
1987.86-978,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.215,2975.536,"--That does not affect the one remaining named Plaintiff, anyway?"
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,2975.536,2976.336,--That is right.
1987.86-978,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3051.617,3066.594,"Excuse me, I gather that your point is that the requirement for oral consultation is not adequate because you are not required to contact your caseworker immediately upon receiving the lump-sum payment, is that it?"
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3066.594,3066.963,--That is right.
1987.86-978,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3066.963,3074.283,"So that between the time you receive it and the 8th of the next month, or 10 days, whichever is longer is that--"
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3074.283,3075.15,Whichever is shorter.
1987.86-978,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3075.15,3078.402,"--Whichever is shorter, you can blow the whole thing and then it is too late."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3078.402,3079.436,That is right.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3188.325,3203.668,"Let me just ask one other question about the specific violation of the regulation was that you treat the lump-sum as a condition of eligibility that should have been explained, is that right?"
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3219.511,3235.603,"I think it is both, because the lump-sum rule, unlike the vast majority of other rules, is not only a condition of eligibility but also in order to effectuate Congress' intent, imposes responsibilities on welfare recipients."
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3250.213,3255.601,"And here, she knew she had to report but she did not know that she had to report before she spent the money?"
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3255.601,3256.886,That is right.
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3268.074,3275.68,"But it seems to me that your case must depend on the assumption that she would have been told, because then the failure of her to report... I mean telling her the responsibility would not have done any good."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3275.68,3298.296,"What we think she should have been told under the Federal Regulation is, in one sentence as this Court indicated in Lukhard, the lump-sum rule requires that if you receive lump-sum income you will be rendered ineligible for the number of months that it would take you to use the lump-sum spending each month no more than your welfare grant."
1987.86-978,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3303.165,3307.735,"Well, the letter pretty much said that but that it is not in so many words, I realize."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3312.12,3330.482,"If they had given her this letter, that letter, in November of 1982, or given that letter to anybody who applied for AFDC benefits, any time between the implementation of the lump-sum statute, we wouldn't be here."
1987.86-978,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3344.492,3353.931,"Ms. Davison, suppose that I disagree with you that the Court can give, can prevent the requirement that she give the money back?"
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3363.101,3364.97,Absolutely.
1987.86-978,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3364.97,3368.005,"How can I do that though, because who would have had standing?"
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3382.196,3395.186,"No, but she was then, and she continues to be a recipient and as I understand standing, it is a threshold question."
1987.86-978,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3395.186,3406.061,"Well, the relief has to benefit the individual that is suing and I don't see how this relief, other than the monetary relief does her a bit of good."
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3406.061,3412.648,She is a representative of the class and the class is an ongoing class of people who apply.
1987.86-978,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3412.648,3417.083,"But that is the government who came up here, isn't it?"
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3417.083,3419.719,"The government petitioned for cert, yes."
1987.86-978,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3419.719,3425.456,And they object to more things than just getting the money back.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3425.456,3426.391,They object--
1987.86-978,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3426.391,3434.378,"And aren't they entitled to, even though there is only one party on the other side?"
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3434.378,3440.298,"--I am not sure I understand your question, Justice White."
1987.86-978,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3448.221,3451.506,But the government is entitled to object to that relief?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3451.506,3452.223,--Absolutely.
1987.86-978,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3452.223,3454.725,And I don't... do you want to defend it or not?
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3454.725,3456.494,To the relief?
1987.86-978,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3456.494,3457.294,Yes.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3457.294,3458.144,To the relief for the class?
1987.86-978,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3458.144,3458.696,Yes.
1987.86-978,2,34339,laurie_n_davison,,3458.696,3459.229,Absolutely.
1987.86-978,3,31276,john_l_kirwin,,3480.275,3485.263,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-978,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3485.263,3498.904,"Mr. Kirwin, may I ask you to tell us what written notice was given to applicants for welfare before 1985 about the lump-sum rule, in writing?"
1987.86-978,3,31276,john_l_kirwin,,3498.904,3505.825,"Before 1985, Your Honor, for the period from 1981 to 1985."
1987.86-978,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3505.825,3507.327,"Yes, in writing."
1987.86-978,3,31276,john_l_kirwin,,3507.327,3528.94,"Okay, applicants weren't given any written information concerning the lump-sum rule with this exception: that applicants filled out the application form, filled out the forms for redetermination of eligibility and there are some examples of those in the Joint Appendix."
1987.86-978,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3547.568,3555.757,But got no specific written notice about it until as a result of this lawsuit?
1987.86-978,3,31276,john_l_kirwin,,3558.257,3559.542,That is correct.
1987.86-978,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3561.661,3568.898,And do you agree that the regulation of the Secretary does require written notice to be given to applicants?
1987.86-978,3,31276,john_l_kirwin,,3568.898,3570.933,--Concerning the lump-sum statute?
1987.86-978,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3570.933,3572.183,Concerning the lump-sum rule?
1987.86-978,3,31276,john_l_kirwin,,3572.183,3574.469,"We very strongly disagree with that, Your Honor."
1987.86-978,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3608.808,3622.883,"So when the Secretary in response to the written interrogatories said that information, in writing, had to be given to applicants about the lump-sum rule and its operation that was wrong, is that right?"
1987.86-978,3,31276,john_l_kirwin,,3622.883,3627.437,"--Your Honor, I don't believe that is what the Secretary said."
1987.86-978,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3627.437,3629.806,"Well, that is on Page 89 of the Joint Appendix."
1987.86-978,3,31276,john_l_kirwin,,3629.806,3637.059,"Well, Mr. Larkin, I think has explained that and I was perhaps too glib before in saying that the answers were confusing."
1987.86-978,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3666.195,3667.111,"Yes, it has, Mr. Kirwin, thank you."
