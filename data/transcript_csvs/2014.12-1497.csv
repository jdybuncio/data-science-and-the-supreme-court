2014.12-1497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.903,"We'll hear argument next in Case 12-1497, Kellogg Brown & Root Services v. United States, Ex Rel. Benjamin Carter."
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,10.073,11.995,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.12-1497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,74.123,83.653,"Is it unusual that a criminal statute of limitations would be much longer than a civil statute of limitations, which is the effect of your argument?"
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,83.653,85.494,I don't think it is necessarily.
2014.12-1497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,113.871,125.072,"Didn't some states used to have no statute for -- for murder, and yet had a statute of limitations on wrongful death claims?"
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,130.397,145.184,"But I think it all kind of reflects the kind of differences between criminal law and civil law, because the minute a complaint is filed -- I mean, most of the investigation, especially for relators -- they don't have any legal status to conduct investigations."
2014.12-1497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,259.237,263.66,"Were you adopting the argument of the New England Foundation, the amici brief?"
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,263.66,271.093,"--That is -- yes, we made that argument, I think, in our brief as well, but they did a more full-throated version."
2014.12-1497,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,294.77,303.233,"Mr. Elwood, I take the point, and that seems like a fair understanding of why that term came out."
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,354.311,354.526,--Sure.
2014.12-1497,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,391.131,391.964,Contract settlement.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,391.964,393.396,I told you I was a terrible memory -- pardon me?
2014.12-1497,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,393.396,394.066,Contract settlement.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,394.066,395.071,"Oh, and the Contract Settlement Act."
2014.12-1497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,474.845,488.232,"And that goes for the government as -- I mean, suppose the government, not a relator, brings a False Claims case against a contractor."
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,495.995,496.6,That's right.
2014.12-1497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,599.758,600.398,And we--
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,600.398,601.318,--I'm sorry?
2014.12-1497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,601.318,603.631,--Assuming we agree with you on the first question--
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,603.631,604.688,"Yeah, I'm assuming you agree with me on the first question."
2014.12-1497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,604.688,607.004,--should we -- should we get to the second?
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,611.52,621.998,"Well, you should, because among other things it will take care of, on remand the Court won't have to address the equitable tolling argument that we think is waived and also meritless."
2014.12-1497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,657.574,667.775,"The only problem -- the problem you have with this argument -- and it's -- has substantial force to it -- but you give no significance of the word ""pending""."
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,670.726,681.256,"I don't -- I disagree, Justice Kennedy, because, I mean, you have to have some sort of word there, because otherwise it would be kind of confusing between the two -- between the two actions."
2014.12-1497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,681.256,682.301,"How about ""former""?"
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,682.301,683.705,"Well, there are a lot of ways--"
2014.12-1497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.705,686.671,"""Pending"" is a very strange word to pick."
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,686.671,690.111,"--For a first -- well, but the thing is -- well, let me begin by saying that under each--"
2014.12-1497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,690.111,691.593,"Or ""said action"" or ""that action""."
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,691.593,692.076,--Yeah.
2014.12-1497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,712.164,723.486,"Well, aren't you going to -- besides the problem that you're -- you're talking about, your not giving ""pending"" any meaning, you're also destroying the force of an original source."
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,749.605,749.704,--Right.
2014.12-1497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,820.201,832.351,"Well, the reality is you don't need the qui tam unless the government doesn't want to waste resources on something, but that doesn't mean that they didn't find that there might be something there."
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,832.351,849.938,"But once the -- I mean, once the government has -- once the original first-to-file bar -- once the original relator reports this information to the government, if the other actions that are barred are related, the government has the information it needs to investigate all of them."
2014.12-1497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,850.743,852.219,But it may not want to prosecute it.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,852.219,854.359,--It may decide there is--
2014.12-1497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,854.359,864.401,"You have to assume that what the intent is, is not to force the government to prosecute but to get recovery, for -- for the government."
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,864.401,873.556,"--I think it is -- the point of the first-to-file bar is to do two things -- and this is kind of widely accepted -- that first, it is to give incentives for people to come forward."
2014.12-1497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,908.598,912.252,Do you have any idea how collateral estoppel works in this area?
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,933.462,938.274,"--Well, at that point it would be already -- I mean, I guess it would depend on the scope and how related."
2014.12-1497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,940.848,941.385,--Exactly.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,941.385,942.57,Because they're the mutuality.
2014.12-1497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,960.781,966.715,The relator is treated as the government for preclusion purposes.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,966.715,967.292,Well--
2014.12-1497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,967.292,971.056,"And that was at least, at least sole judge after verdict."
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,971.056,973.4,--I don't -- I don't think that it's clear that that's the case.
2014.12-1497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,973.4,981.039,"Well, there is -- there is good authority, at least in the court of appeals, for that position."
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,981.039,982.957,"I disagree, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.12-1497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1005.135,1017.523,"But is it your -- your -- is it your position suit number 1 is filed, it's dismissed within weeks without prejudice, that no other relator can file?"
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1017.523,1024.352,"--It depends on what the basis of the dismissal was, because if it was dismissed on 9(b) grounds, routinely they can amend."
2014.12-1497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1030.517,1032.252,The question is whether somebody else could come in.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1048.602,1048.846,--No.
2014.12-1497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1061.508,1066.013,"What if it was a perfect a perfect complaint, but he sued in the wrong court, or there was no personal jurisdiction?"
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1066.013,1066.466,--Well--
2014.12-1497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1066.466,1068.8,Dismissed without juris -- dismissed without prejudice.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1068.8,1072.086,"--I mean, if it's -- if it's in the wrong jurisdiction, you can transfer it."
2014.12-1497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1074.541,1074.616,No.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1078.429,1091.832,"--Well, I'm going to resist -- I'm going to resist for a little while before we get to the -- to the meat of the issue just to say that it's not going to happen because personal jurisdiction has nationwide service of process, and so it's very hard to invoke a personal--"
2014.12-1497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1091.832,1094.41,It's dismissed for failure to prosecute.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1094.41,1095.674,"--Well, if it's--"
2014.12-1497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1095.674,1098.547,"For nonmerits ground, and so nobody else can come in?"
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1098.547,1104.479,"--Well, if it's dismissed for failure to prosecute -- well, first of all, let me resist the hypothetical a little bit more."
2014.12-1497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1157.473,1171.53,"I thought that first file rule was meant to protect the first filer in that -- well, one aspect of it is the first filer doesn't have to worry about a race to judgment."
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1190.116,1193.239,"The phrase ""race to judgment"" is not anything that I have found in the courts of appeals."
2014.12-1497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1205.016,1209.87,The first filer is a race to the courthouse.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1209.87,1210.313,--Yes.
2014.12-1497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1271.084,1275.424,Do we know in this case -- there were three suits.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1281.468,1284.093,The first one was just dismissed.
2014.12-1497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1288.6,1291.26,"The first Carter, the first Carter suit."
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1291.26,1293.026,"No, I'm sorry, the first Thorpe lawsuit--"
2014.12-1497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1293.026,1293.681,The first Thorpe.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1293.681,1301.286,--under the related lawsuits was just dropped for failure to prosecute when lawyer -- new lawyers didn't step in to take over for the old ones.
2014.12-1497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1301.286,1303.339,And you say that kills it for every -- anybody else.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1303.339,1303.551,Right.
2014.12-1497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1331.289,1332.82,Were any of them filed by original sources?
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1332.82,1333.803,--Pardon me?
2014.12-1497,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1333.803,1336.537,Were any of them filed by original sources?
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1336.537,1339.676,I think -- I think all of them were original sources.
2014.12-1497,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.445,1377.162,But it's -- it's not a pending action later.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1386.954,1394.406,"--But that's -- that's because I think that if you -- as I say, if you look at this from the point of view of when the action is filed, it makes complete sense and it is a pending action."
2014.12-1497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.47,1470.81,"Since you're getting into that event, to me, it makes perfect sense to apply it just to the pending action."
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1506.609,1507.732,--But there's -- there's nothing--
2014.12-1497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1507.732,1508.047,Or not--
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1508.047,1511.317,--in -- the first-to-file bar that says anything about an original source.
2014.12-1497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1514.2,1514.531,--I know.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1524.828,1524.83,I think that's the principal ones.
2014.12-1497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1524.83,1527.436,Everything's been disclosed by number 1--
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1527.436,1528.063,"Well, it may or may not have been--"
2014.12-1497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1528.063,1528.78,--What?
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1528.78,1530.06,--because it frequently -- it may or may not have been because the--
2014.12-1497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1530.06,1530.781,Let's take the mine run--
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1530.781,1531.436,--Sure.
2014.12-1497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1531.935,1532.746,--I don't want to interrupt.
2014.12-1497,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1534.856,1535.247,Okay.
2014.12-1497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1536.869,1538.46,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1555.111,1557.969,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.12-1497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1595.982,1598.812,But it's placed placed in the Criminal Code.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1600.715,1601.277,That's true.
2014.12-1497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1643.572,1647.897,Is there any civil offense in Title 18?
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1647.897,1650.584,"--Yes, I just I -- just listed one."
2014.12-1497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1650.645,1651.555,That's in 18--
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1651.555,1654.458,"--That's Title 18, Section 1034."
2014.12-1497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1654.458,1656.769,Is that about fraud?
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1656.769,1658.239,"That's about fraud, yes."
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1658.239,1659.674,"And what does the word ""offense""--"
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1659.674,1660.391,Insurance.
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1660.391,1662.953,"--What does the word ""offense"" mean in that provision?"
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1662.953,1664.595,"The word ""offense"" as this Court--"
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1664.595,1666.217,"In that provision, what -- what does the word--"
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1666.217,1669.559,"--The word ""offense"" means a transgression of law, which may be punishable--"
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.559,1670.67,"--It's a criminal offense, right?"
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1670.67,1673.198,"--I disagree, Your Honor."
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1674.174,1679.838,It wouldn't make any sense in Title 18 unless the offense they're referring to is one one of the criminal offenses of Title 18.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1679.838,1681.761,"--I don't agree, Justice Scalia, because--"
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1681.761,1683.212,"Read the provision again, would you?"
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1683.212,1683.992,--Certainly.
2014.12-1497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1699.581,1699.743,Yes.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1701.956,1711.917,"1033 is -- the way a number of provisions in the criminal code are written, the offenses or the conduct which is punishable are in--"
2014.12-1497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1711.917,1712.946,I think the point--
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1712.946,1713.788,--subsection (a).
2014.12-1497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1713.788,1715.18,"--I think -- I think the point these people are trying to make, perhaps--"
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1715.18,1715.204,Right.
2014.12-1497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1715.204,1723.624,--is that that provision you've read provides for a civil action by the attorney general--
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1723.624,1723.883,Right.
2014.12-1497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1723.883,1727.224,--against a person who has committed an offense.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1738.024,1738.689,And I--
2014.12-1497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1738.689,1740.128,"That's the point, I think."
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1740.128,1741.564,"--And I disagree, Justice Breyer."
2014.12-1497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1741.564,1746.431,"I know you disagree, but -- so let's turn to the other offense it cross-references--"
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1746.431,1746.667,If we read--
2014.12-1497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1746.667,1747.615,--and why don't you read that.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1747.615,1749.932,"--If we read the language carefully, which I have done--"
2014.12-1497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1749.932,1750.793,I've got the language of that.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1750.793,1758.775,"--If we read the language of a number of the statutes -- a number of the statutes in Title 18, they have punishments that are criminal."
2014.12-1497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1777.781,1784.215,"I -- I agree with -- the word ""offense"" appears and it provides for a civil action."
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1801.257,1802.97,--It is referring to--
2014.12-1497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1802.97,1803.868,To civil you say.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1804.632,1814.596,"--It is referring to conduct which can constitute a crime which is punishable by criminal punishment, but is also punishable by civil -- by civil remedies."
2014.12-1497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1814.596,1819.576,"--And the word ""offense"" refers to the civil behavior."
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1819.576,1821.258,"Yes, because they're saying--"
2014.12-1497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1821.258,1821.311,Okay.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1823.588,1830.96,"--Because it says it must have proved by a preponderance of the evidence, which means it's not proved by, you know, beyond a reasonable doubt."
2014.12-1497,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1838.904,1845.586,"Mr. Stone, don't take this for more than it's worth because I think there are plenty of arguments against you, but I'm actually not sure I understand this one."
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1850.347,1850.6,--Right.
2014.12-1497,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1850.6,1852.563,"--well, Congress had to put the thing someplace."
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1852.563,1853.171,Exactly.
2014.12-1497,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1853.171,1856.463,It could have put it in the criminal code or it could have put it with all the other civil--
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1856.463,1857.257,And in fact--
2014.12-1497,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1857.257,1859.202,"--Either way, there'd be kind of a mismatch."
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1865.981,1866.668,--Right.
2014.12-1497,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1915.745,1916.275,What is your -- what is your--

2014.12-1497,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1923.847,1937.358,"--What is your answer to the argument that this would be a big change if it previously applied only to crimes and then, according to you, it was changed so that it applied to civil claims as well."
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,1949.334,1953.004,"--There is much evidence, Justice Alito."

2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2019.241,2020.848,Where -- where did that appear?
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2020.848,2023.628,--That appeared in a Senate report when they passed--
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2023.628,2023.724,Okay.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2024.366,2026.252,--when they passed the Surplus Property Act.
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2090.51,2091.758,What Congress was that?
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2091.758,2093.318,--The 2008 Congress.
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2093.318,2094.803,And that's where does that appear?
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2094.803,2099.159,That appears in a Senate report as well.
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.159,2102.098,Two -- two Senate committees or just one Senate committee?
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2102.098,2103.346,One Senate committee report.
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.048,2105.203,And that's the Congress.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2105.203,2106.516,"--Cited in our red brief, yes."
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2143.729,2144.927,"I mean, all that's true except--"
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2144.927,2145.057,--or a civil remedy.
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.057,2160.16,"--except when you're dealing with an old statute that used to be clearly criminal, and it seems to me that at that point the burden -- when that statute is expanded -- the burden is on you to show that it's been changed from the criminal to the civil--"
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2160.16,2161.143,"Well, Judge, I would point out--"
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2161.143,2162.22,--to include the civil.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2166.5,2180.71,"--Justice Scalia, I would point out that nine of ten courts that considered this in the aftermath of the 1944 amendment held that it did apply civilly, and five of those were False Claims -- Civil False Claims Act cases."
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2193.411,2193.735,"Well, were they--"
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2193.735,2194.596,--they could have written it in--
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.596,2195.691,--Were they district courts?
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2197.396,2198.984,"--They were district courts, yes."
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.984,2200.36,And did Congress know about those?
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2200.36,2203.203,Congress is presumed to know about them.
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2203.203,2204.233,"Ah, ah."
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2204.233,2215.431,But I would also point out that the people in the courts that were operating at the time that this amendment was made understood it to change the law.
2014.12-1497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2224.536,2225.862,Changed the law to do what?
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2226.939,2227.972,--To allow civil defenses--
2014.12-1497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2227.972,2233.705,"--operating prospectively, not just to crimes that had already occurred?"
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2233.705,2234.766,--Right.
2014.12-1497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2234.766,2237.608,So that's one change that everybody agrees.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2237.608,2237.654,Right.
2014.12-1497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2264.078,2266.671,The government can pursue it in a criminal case.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2268.764,2269.809,"Right, and--"

2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2342.079,2342.384,--I'm sorry.
2014.12-1497,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2342.384,2351.708,"--Everyone agrees that from 1921 on, it was understood that this was a criminal statute and I think the point has been made before."
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2369.778,2373.697,"Justice Ginsburg, I -- I would point out a couple of things about that."

2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2403.966,2418.145,"But Judge -- Judge Ginsburg, that's not correct, because the language at the end of the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act holds that -- provides that the statute does apply retrospectively."
2014.12-1497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2503.2,2506.292,"Well, you can either reserve time or move on."
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2507.871,2509.966,"--I'd like to move on, if I may."
2014.12-1497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2509.966,2510.512,Go ahead.

2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2700.488,2701.047,But they didn't intervene.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2701.047,2701.842,--Then they are bound.
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2701.842,2702.842,Then they are bound.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2702.842,2702.91,Yes.
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2702.91,2703.609,Okay.
2014.12-1497,1,56042,david_s_stone,,2703.609,2704.832,And furthermore--
2014.12-1497,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2704.832,2706.72,We'll see what the government thinks of that.

2014.12-1497,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2854.079,2855.377,Not other than a criminal offense.
2014.12-1497,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2856.656,2862.092,Every use of the word 18 is in reference to a criminal offense.

2014.12-1497,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2877.304,2879.212,But the answer to my question was yes?

2014.12-1497,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2994.452,2995.186,It could.
2014.12-1497,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3031.233,3050.287,"--I guess part of the point I would make is if the initial version of the statute had referred to existing -- statutes of limitations on criminal offenses and Congress had then excised the word ""criminal"", we would say -- I think that would be viewed as very powerful evidence that Congress intended an expansion."

2014.12-1497,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3057.36,3078.433,"Well, the reason that has been postulated is that WSLA would not revive expired prosecutions, and that this was no longer necessary in 1944 because the statute was amended to make that point clear separately."
2014.12-1497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3092.678,3095.502,Counsel.
2014.12-1497,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3095.502,3096.206,Yes.
2014.12-1497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3096.206,3098.752,Is the Korean War covered by the WSLA?
2014.12-1497,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3098.752,3107.624,"I think the general understanding at that time was that only declared wars were covered; and so, likely, the Korean War would not have been covered."
2014.12-1497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3108.747,3112.776,"Is that your -- is that your position now, that only declared wars are covered?"
2014.12-1497,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3112.776,3119.604,"--Well, the statute was amended in 2008; and it now provides and the current version of the statute is at page 4A."
2014.12-1497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3130.02,3132.441,Was there such an authorization in the Korean War?
2014.12-1497,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3132.441,3134.961,Not -- not pursuant to--
2014.12-1497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3134.961,3135.334,"No, no."
2014.12-1497,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3137.374,3138.096,--Right.
2014.12-1497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3138.096,3139.281,"I don't think there was, right?"
2014.12-1497,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3139.281,3140.08,I don't -- I don't--
2014.12-1497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3140.08,3143.481,I'm trying to get at the question of the breadth of your position.
2014.12-1497,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3148.508,3162.971,--I think what we would say is at -- up under the current version of the -- the current wording of the statute implies that UMF pursuant to the War Powers Resolution.
2014.12-1497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3162.971,3171.359,"So if -- so if the current version were effect were in effect in 1950, the Korean War would not be covered, because there wasn't a declared war?"
2014.12-1497,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3175.262,3190.147,"That would be my understanding as well, that Congress seems to have acted to extend the statute beyond declared wars but not to anything that could be considered military operations if they have not been authorized in a particular manner."
2014.12-1497,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3190.147,3221.23,"Mr. Stewart, before your time runs out, what -- what is the Government's position on the -- on the point raised by counsel for Respondent; namely, if there is a dismissal of -- on the merits of a -- a civil action, is the government barred from later bringing a different action on the same claim?"
2014.12-1497,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3221.23,3222.883,"Yes, we would think we would be barred."
2014.12-1497,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3321.762,3335.816,"If the case is not the first case is not dismissed on the merits, dismissed without prejudice and then relator 2 files, your position is that that suit may be maintained?"
2014.12-1497,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3335.816,3340.301,--It would not be our position is it would not be barred by the first-to-file provision.
2014.12-1497,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3342.752,3350.887,"I'm curious to know, just because of background, would the first suit toll the statute of limitations as to the second relator?"
2014.12-1497,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3350.887,3353.871,--I -- probably -- we believe probably not.
2014.12-1497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3402.085,3403.286,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2014.12-1497,3,30165,john_p_elwood,,3406.238,3423.166,"Mr. Stewart said that the only language in the provision in the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act which limited it to criminal -- limited it to crimes, was the phrase ""now indictable"", and I disagree with that."
2014.12-1497,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3587.81,3591.48,Relator two is treated as the Government for this purpose.
2014.12-1497,3,30165,john_p_elwood,,3591.48,3598.521,"But in any event, no one has yet cited to me a case where this has already been determined, so it's all litigation risk to my client now."
