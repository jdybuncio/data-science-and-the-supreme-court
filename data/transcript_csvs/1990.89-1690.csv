1990.89-1690,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.372,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-1690, California v. Charles Steven Acevedo."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,10.778,12.933,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1690,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.584,178.569,Mr. Foster--
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,178.569,179.006,Your Honor.
1990.89-1690,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,179.006,190.595,"--Would, would those facts as you have described them give rise to probable cause sufficient to have arrested the individual?"
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,190.595,192.484,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.328,202.605,And could the sack then have been searched as a search incident to the arrest or an inventory search?
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,202.605,202.871,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.514,238.967,That's a little bit of a weak argument.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,247.103,259.38,"--I don't think you expect the world to be looking in, but I think as this Court held in Ross, Your Honor, that whatever subjective expectation of privacy you have does not survive when the officers have probable cause to believe there are drugs in the vehicle."
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,299.254,304.034,"But, Mr. Foster, was it any different than the voluntary intentional act in Arkansas against Sanders?"
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,304.034,307.127,"No, Your Honor, but the difference--"
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,307.127,308.782,So you basically want us to overrule Arkansas against Sanders?
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,308.782,312.655,"--I want you to extremely limit Arkansas v. Sanders, yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,322.089,328.179,Isn't it correct that in his separate opinion in that case that Chief Justice Burger made the very distinction that you're challenging here?
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,328.179,328.726,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,329.616,333.318,So you're basically challenging his analysis of the Fourth Amendment.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,333.318,337.191,"No, I thought I was supporting the Chief Justice's analysis--"
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,337.191,338.097,I'm talking about Chief Justice Burger.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,338.097,338.629,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,340.019,342.19,He's the source of the particular distinction that is at issue here.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,342.19,342.487,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,377.41,381.564,"Yeah, but you don't have any mobility anymore after the vehicle has been stopped and you have got the container."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,384.781,394.7,"--Because since Chadwick and Sanders this Court has decided Johns, Michigan v. Thomas, and Florida v. Meyers, and you have said you don't judge mobility later on."
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,417.315,423.437,"Well, you rely heavily on Ross, and I wonder if there's a single word in the Ross opinion that casts doubt on Arkansas against Sanders."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,423.437,426.89,"No, but I didn't think you needed to reach that issue to decide Ross, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,429.858,432.247,The reason you didn't have to reach it is because of this distinction.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,432.247,437.465,"--To resolve it in Ross, no, you did not, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,442.65,444.195,As did Arkansas against Sanders.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,444.195,445.461,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,522.553,522.943,"No, not forever."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,524.052,524.567,--Until you got a warrant.
1990.89-1690,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,550.98,553.089,If we accept your rationale--
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,553.089,553.743,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,553.743,562.692,--isn't the next logical step really to say that the warrant requirement is limited only to houses and structures?
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,562.692,567.316,"No, Your Honor, I don't think that's necessarily true."
1990.89-1690,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,587.496,590.573,Or any movable object that a person is carrying with him and that's--
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,590.573,591.635,"--No, no."
1990.89-1690,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,595.023,599.85,"--Well, but if it's subject to his control and there's a probable cause for the arrest."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,599.85,604.55,"--Well, certainly you to an extent have already done that with Schimmel, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,607.034,608.019,"Well, that's what I want to know."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,609.643,611.486,"--I think a number of things are left, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.735,656.187,So that we'll have no worries the next 65 years?
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,656.187,657.764,"--I would hope not, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,658.592,660.95,Mr. Foster--
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,660.95,661.2,Your Honor.
1990.89-1690,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,661.2,666.902,--You said in your example involving the porter carrying the closed container that you need a warrant for that.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,672.774,674.242,"To search the bag, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,680.863,695.108,"All right, then why, by a parity of reasoning, shouldn't you say that in this case that you could seize the bag from the trunk of the car without a warrant, but you should have to get the warrant in order to go into the bag?"
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,697.889,699.841,"Oh, I think there's a critical difference, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,706.386,719.52,"No, but once you... once you have taken the bag the vehicle is not leaving with the bag, so that the mobility argument is just as beside the point there as it is in the porter case once you have taken the bag from the porter."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,719.52,728.267,"But your... with all due respect, Your Honor, that's the analysis that was in Chadwick and Sanders, and I think that the more recent decisions of this Court say you look at the mobility at the moment you seize it."
1990.89-1690,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,737.919,739.263,How does it have it after you have seized it?
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,739.263,747.525,"It does not, Your Honor, but you look, after Johns, Thomas, Texas v. White, at mobility at the point of seizure."
1990.89-1690,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,747.525,748.977,If... but by--
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,748.977,764.799,"The Court, this Court has held that, given the fact that you have probable cause at the moment of seizure, since you can seize it it is of no Fourth Amendment consequence whether you search it immediately or search it later on."
1990.89-1690,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,779.574,783.589,--But by the same token there is just as much mobility in the case of the porter.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,783.589,784.369,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,784.369,789.444,"If you don't... if you don't seize the bag, the porter is going to take it away."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,789.444,792.975,"At a slow pace, not the same as a vehicle--"
1990.89-1690,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,792.975,797.38,You mean he's going to walk slow enough so that you can get the warrant before he gets to the train?
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,798.349,798.894,"--No, no, no."
1990.89-1690,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,798.894,801.72,"No, I mean that, that bag is going to disappear."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,813.497,824.057,"I think, though, that the answer, Your Honor, goes back to the original holding in Carroll, which is that the mobility of the car is such that it can be rapidly moved outside of the jurisdiction."
1990.89-1690,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,829.46,836.63,"But doesn't that simply throw you back on kind of a black letter precedent argument, cars are different from porters?"
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,848.889,855.84,"Well, I think that in a sense this Court made the first step of that analysis in Carroll by saying cars are different--"
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,855.84,857.323,0 [inaudible].
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,857.323,857.854,"--I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.854,859.135,And ever since.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,859.135,859.651,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,871.632,873.396,Is there really very much at stake in this case?
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,885.547,886.874,"--Well, I thought the question was--"
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,886.874,890.248,I'll ask you the question.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,890.248,890.873,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,890.873,894.263,"There was probable cause to arrest, wasn't there?"
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,894.263,895.684,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,895.684,907.038,"Well, if the officer had taken the course of arresting the person, they could have carried out a search incident to arrest, because it is a car, and searched everywhere in the car, including the bag."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,907.038,908.319,But the bag was in the--
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,908.319,910.241,Isn't that right or not?
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,910.241,918.363,"--I don't believe that the search incident cases that this Court has handled... Belton talked about the driver, you could search--"
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,918.363,920.597,What if it's a bag in the... in the back seat?
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,920.597,921.361,--Yes.
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,923.407,924.188,"But not in the, not in the trunk?"
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,924.188,924.827,--No.
1990.89-1690,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,927.639,930.217,How about an inventory search of the vehicle?
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,930.217,941.432,"Well, Your Honor, as we pointed out in argument 2 in the brief, yes, because once the bag went into the car, once the car began moving, it was very clear that Mr. Acevedo was transporting drugs."
1990.89-1690,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,947.194,956.503,"Well, so your answer basically to Justice White and to me is, on the facts of this case, the individual could have been arrested and the bag could have been searched--"
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,956.503,957.112,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,957.112,959.206,--under different doctrines.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,959.206,961.095,Under a number of different doctrines.
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,961.095,973.793,And... so a police officer really needn't be... law enforcement needn't be very much impeded by the ruling in this case because the officer could have just have handled it differently.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,973.793,982.445,"Well, he could have, Your Honor, but I think this case presents the issue that arose in Castlebury and arises again, and arises in the field every day."
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1023.757,1024.366,I don't think that's right.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1030.239,1037.423,"--But what if... but in a situation, Your Honor, where he has said it's in a bag in the trunk, and additionally, elsewhere."
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1038.048,1040.953,"Well, additionally elsewhere, if that's enough probable cause, you can search elsewhere."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1040.953,1041.563,--That's right.
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1053.526,1060.882,"And the worst that, even under... apart from the rationales that Justice O'Connor and Justice White developed, the rationale of Place also protects the officer."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1063.038,1065.788,"--Well, certainly--"
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1065.788,1067.457,Isn't that what Place indicates rather clearly?
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1067.457,1074.222,"--He certainly, they certainly would have acted properly in holding the bag in this case and getting the warrant."
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1088.949,1095.945,What about a person with a suitcase that you figure has drugs in it about to get on a subway?
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1098.757,1100.929,Hum.
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.929,1103.49,Under your view.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1103.49,1105.052,Given--
1990.89-1690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1105.052,1106.036,You can obviously detain it.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1107.098,1110.987,"--Given the mobility of the subway, I would think yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.142,1117.157,"Well, that's never going to get you out of the jurisdiction."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1119.298,1122.249,"--I believe so, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1146.738,1149.331,"Well, Mr. Foster--"
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1149.331,1149.628,Your Honor.
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1149.628,1157.313,"--It's easy, I suppose, to say that whenever there is probable cause, why do you have to wait for a warrant."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1162.388,1163.06,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1163.06,1172.384,"And, of course you're the petitioner but the respondent says there is no probable cause and that the court of appeals was dead wrong."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1172.384,1174.852,"I think the court of appeals was dead right, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.852,1182.27,"Well, I know, but here it is, and that's the reason why you go to magistrates, to find out whether--"
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1182.27,1182.411,"Well, but even if you go to magistrates, Your Honor--"
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.411,1183.348,--there is probable cause or not.
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1183.348,1190.815,"--Your Honor, I think that begs a question, with all due respect, because even if you go to magistrate and get a search warrant you have defendants challenging the validity of the search warrant."
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.578,1208.932,"I know, but challenging the... challenging the warrant is a different matter than the... just challenging the... at least you have the assurance... at least you have the assurance that the issue has been presented to a magistrate."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1208.932,1213.289,"Well, my experience with criminal defense attorneys, with all due respect, Your Honor, is that they'll challenge anything."
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.113,1228.408,"Well, on that basis, why, we should never even fool around with warrants."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1228.408,1230.782,"--Well, no, I think it works the other way, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1233.422,1236.686,"I know, but your... if you take your point of view you could just forget warrants."
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1236.686,1237.64,"No, not at all, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1237.64,1238.56,Well--
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1238.56,1239.294,But what we're saying is--
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1239.294,1241.841,"--What good does it ever do then, in your point of view?"
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1241.841,1249.931,"--Well, I think the question is, in a situation such as this where there is probable cause, where it is particularized--"
1990.89-1690,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1249.931,1250.54,How do you know there is?
1990.89-1690,0,39203,robert_foster,,1250.54,1252.884,--How do I know there is?
1990.89-1690,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1467.733,1469.591,"Very well, Mr. Foster."
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1471.388,1475.559,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.155,1600.226,"If the bag hadn't been put in the trunk, but he just entered the car with the bag, if there is probable cause, such as we are assuming, the... there could have been an arrest."
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1600.226,1601.163,Absolutely.
1990.89-1690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1601.163,1604.334,"And if the bag were found in the back seat, it could be searched?"
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1604.334,1605.973,Under Belton that's correct.
1990.89-1690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1605.973,1606.38,Under Belton.
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1606.38,1607.927,"Under Schimmel, under--"
1990.89-1690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.927,1616.158,So you're suggesting we should continue to recognize a rational difference between having the bag in the trunk and having a bag in the back seat?
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1616.158,1620.499,--I'm not sure that... I'm not sure there's a difference.
1990.89-1690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.499,1622.546,"And the difference, I suppose, is in the degree of the expectation of privacy, is that it?"
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1622.546,1624.451,"No, that's not what I would base it on."
1990.89-1690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1640.818,1642.693,If you make an arrest?
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1642.693,1643.256,No.
1990.89-1690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.037,1644.24,No?
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1644.599,1645.365,"Well, under Ross--"
1990.89-1690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.365,1649.238,"But if you just have probable cause to believe what, you can't search?"
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1649.238,1654.908,"--If you have... if your probable cause just exists in the package, in the container--"
1990.89-1690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1654.908,1655.377,Yes.
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1655.377,1672.212,"--then, by placing... just the mere fact of placing this container in the vehicle doesn't give you probable cause to search the whole vehicle, because what the AG would have you believe is that you placed this container with probable cause in the trunk, somehow this probable cause seeps throughout the whole car, and now you can search the whole car."
1990.89-1690,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1672.212,1687.035,"Well, on these facts there was undoubtedly probable cause to arrest the individual, to make a search incident to arrest, to impound the vehicle, and to make an inventory search."
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1687.035,1688.674,I disagree with the first part.
1990.89-1690,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1691.939,1692.877,"Well, let's assume there was."
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1692.877,1693.08,--All right.
1990.89-1690,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1693.08,1707.089,"Then what's more intrusive, to have the police arrest the individual and make the search that way, or to have the police open the bag without an arrest?"
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1707.089,1712.242,Certainly in answer to your question it is more intrusive to open the bag without the arrest.
1990.89-1690,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1712.82,1716.57,"That's more intrusive, to open the bag and not arrest the individual?"
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1718.552,1718.865,"--Yes, I believe it is."
1990.89-1690,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1718.865,1723.443,More intrusive than placing someone under arrest and conducting a search?
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1723.443,1723.566,I'm sorry.
1990.89-1690,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1744.449,1755.492,"Well, the point is that if you accept that there was probable cause to believe this individual emerged from the apartment carrying a bag of marijuana, then there was probable cause to have arrested him."
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1755.492,1757.084,--That's true.
1990.89-1690,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1759.083,1773.047,"Mr. Anderson, if I understand the principle you're arguing for, if a policeman just knows, or suspects generally, has probable cause to believe that there is marijuana somewhere in the car, he can open the bag?"
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1773.047,1775.374,That's correct.
1990.89-1690,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.608,1783.074,"But if he's more certain than that, he not only knows it's somewhere in the car, he suspects it's precisely in this bag, then he can't open the bag?"
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1785.76,1793.46,"--No, Your Honor, because you need to know... you need to know when the probable cause is determined and where the item that is sought to be searched is."
1990.89-1690,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1823.822,1824.338,But you can't search it?
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1824.338,1825.604,--But you cannot search it.
1990.89-1690,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.604,1841.301,"But if all you knew is, or the only information you have is that there is this car and somewhere in the car there is contraband, then you can open it, even though your reason for opening it is much less certain than the reasoning in the former case?"
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1853.328,1856.356,What you want to determine is what you're looking for.
1990.89-1690,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1862.277,1863.245,I'm looking for contraband.
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1863.245,1863.823,That's fine.
1990.89-1690,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1864.916,1867.947,And you're telling me that if I know it's in this package I can't open the package.
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1872.443,1874.13,"I think it does, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1915.597,1926.328,"Mr. Anderson, I don't think it's useful to refer to the automobile as a container, as if it were like a trunk or a bag."
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1931.108,1932.327,"Yes, I would agree."
1990.89-1690,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1949.46,1952.318,The Fourth Amendment isn't gone.
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1958.362,1964.016,But you have to have probable cause to search anyway.
1990.89-1690,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1965.422,1966.218,Because of the Fourth Amendment.
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1966.218,1966.984,Right.
1990.89-1690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1966.984,1986.866,"Under your position I take it that it wouldn't make any difference whether the bag, the unopened bag was in the trunk or in the back seat on the facts of this case, because... as long as the probable cause relates specifically to the bag?"
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,1986.866,1992.332,"The problem with that is the Belton case, of course."
1990.89-1690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1992.332,1995.268,"I know, but... there's no arrest."
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2019.025,2021.103,That's my understanding of Ross.
1990.89-1690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.103,2030.178,"But on your theory, I take it, it doesn't make any... if there's probable cause to believe it's in a paper bag, and you find the paper bag in the back seat, you can't open it."
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2030.178,2032.644,That's how I interpret Ross.
1990.89-1690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2032.644,2032.989,Yes.
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2063.866,2065.194,"That's correct, because he's got--"
1990.89-1690,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2065.194,2067.897,--That's the distinction that you want police officers to be--
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2067.897,2069.27,"--Absolutely, because--"
1990.89-1690,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2069.27,2070.364,"--to have to worry about, whether they said--"
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2070.364,2091.027,"--Because the informant in your example said, said Mr. Police Officer, this person has a brown paper bag with a Lucky Store symbol on the side of it that's wrapped up at the top, and he's placed this either in the trunk, in the back seat, or someplace in his vehicle, and I know it's there because I just saw it there 10 minutes ago."
1990.89-1690,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.007,2111.051,"--It would seem to me to make a lot of sense to say that if that's the information he has, he can't search the whole car."
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2125.981,2129.324,--He can... he needs a warrant for the bag.
1990.89-1690,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2134.853,2139.789,"In that example that Justice Scalia gave, suppose there were four Lucky Store bags?"
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2140.351,2141.742,All right.
1990.89-1690,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2144.771,2145.225,And they're all in the back seat.
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2145.225,2149.77,"--And they're all in the back seat, he can certainly take possession of all four of them and get a warrant."
1990.89-1690,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2153.409,2156.266,"Oh, and... but now there is no specific bag that he is focused on."
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2161.685,2164.919,"--If there is a specific bag, he cannot search it."
1990.89-1690,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2166.668,2167.184,All right.
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2170.98,2175.088,"Well, you have described them as all four being identical, all four being Lucky bags."
1990.89-1690,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2177.368,2178.476,He knows that only one of them has marijuana.
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2178.476,2181.224,--He has a basis to seize all four and get a search warrant.
1990.89-1690,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2184.38,2188.91,"Well, I think, I think under your rationale that he can search, and that's the problem."
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2202.435,2218.522,"--I understand the argument, and I don't agree with it, because this Court has held that if you look at the car and you've got probable cause to believe the car contains contraband, you can search it."
1990.89-1690,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2276.92,2280.794,We've crossed that line when we made the exception for automobiles.
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2307.064,2308.002,Well--
1990.89-1690,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2308.002,2312.922,"So... I mean, once we've made that decision that cars are different, that manipulation is inevitable."
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2312.922,2318.514,"--The problem is that... well, first of all, I don't agree with Carroll or Ross, but--"
1990.89-1690,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2318.514,2319.684,"Oh, well, there--"
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2320.169,2320.653,--But--
1990.89-1690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.653,2323.918,Or with Congress.
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2325.854,2330.727,--In this particular case what you have is the center of attention focused on a package.
1990.89-1690,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2445.463,2445.682,That's not what we're talking about.
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2452.664,2454.022,"--Without a warrant, no, you cannot."
1990.89-1690,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2567.46,2571.132,"You didn't cross-petition for certiorari in this case, did you, Mr. Anderson?"
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2571.132,2571.46,"--No, I didn't."
1990.89-1690,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2571.46,2575.753,And you didn't raise this point in your brief in opposition to certiorari?
1990.89-1690,1,23525,fred_w_anderson,,2575.753,2579.096,"No, I don't believe I did in opposition to certiorari."
1990.89-1690,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2783.327,2785.107,"Thank you, Mr. Anderson."
1990.89-1690,2,39203,robert_foster,,2787.715,2788.309,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2797.337,2798.618,I knew you would agree with me.
1990.89-1690,2,39203,robert_foster,,2799.757,2803.286,"--And I thought you were agreeing with me, Your Honor."
1990.89-1690,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2818.171,2819.765,"No, I don't think that's quite right, is it?"
1990.89-1690,2,39203,robert_foster,,2823.405,2823.637,--That's right.
1990.89-1690,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2825.121,2829.729,If it was generally focussed on the vehicle you would normally have to get... you'd get a warrant to search the entire vehicle.
1990.89-1690,2,39203,robert_foster,,2829.729,2843.161,"--But the signal you send to the officer is... in Ross, when they got the information that Ross had contraband in the vehicle, the signal you send to the officers is don't ask where, because if you ask where and you get an answer--"
1990.89-1690,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.161,2845.363,"Well, you're not... who is the officer going to be asking?"
1990.89-1690,2,39203,robert_foster,,2845.363,2849.938,"--The confidential or reliable informant in Ross, Your Honor, was the example I was using."
1990.89-1690,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2849.938,2855.844,You don't think the officer would want to know as precise as he could what he... where he... the contraband is?
1990.89-1690,2,39203,robert_foster,,2855.844,2863.684,"No, if you leave Chadwick and Sanders in effect, because then you're saying to the officers if you know too much you're going to have to go through the rigmarole of getting a warrant."
1990.89-1690,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2863.684,2865.886,You're going to have to get a warrant before you open private luggage.
1990.89-1690,2,39203,robert_foster,,2865.886,2866.089,"Yes, that's right."
1990.89-1690,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2866.87,2867.979,And we should not encourage that?
1990.89-1690,2,39203,robert_foster,,2867.979,2872.524,--I think you want to encourage officers to do their utmost to fully investigate--
1990.89-1690,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2872.524,2873.867,To be able to open luggage without getting warrants?
1990.89-1690,2,39203,robert_foster,,2873.867,2875.07,--If they have probable cause.
1990.89-1690,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2936.17,2937.373,I dissented in Ross.
1990.89-1690,2,39203,robert_foster,,2937.373,2937.811,--I beg your pardon.
1990.89-1690,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2937.811,2940.216,I dissented in Ross.
1990.89-1690,2,39203,robert_foster,,2940.216,2943.23,"Yes, Your Honor, you did, but the... the other members of the Court didn't."
1990.89-1690,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2943.23,2943.824,That's the rule.
1990.89-1690,2,39203,robert_foster,,2945.682,2947.384,"At any rate, Your Honor, this case--"
1990.89-1690,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.384,2948.384,"You would like it not to be, though?"
