1971.70-5082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,215.91,217.107,Is this a class action?
1971.70-5082,0,32159,jon_d_noland,,217.107,219.649,Yes it was brought as a class action Your Honor.
1971.70-5082,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,219.649,230.12,The class being parents whose spouses had not been absent for six months or more?
1971.70-5082,0,32159,jon_d_noland,,230.12,231.247,That is right.
1971.70-5082,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,471.307,483.737,"Could that not also mean that having heard 16 witnesses conceivably, it concluded that there was no problem for three-judge court?"
1971.70-5082,0,32159,jon_d_noland,,487.577,506.029,It is certainly conceivable Mr. Chief Justice that the three-judge panel could have heard witnesses and decided on the basis of the testimony induce that the complaint failed to raise substantial constitutional questions and dissolve itself and then left the final judgment for single district judge.

1971.70-5082,1,36466,mark_peden,,1547.133,1547.578,Yes sir.
1971.70-5082,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1549.424,1555.678,How would you identify which one of those three-judges then was a single Judge.
1971.70-5082,1,36466,mark_peden,,1557.396,1559.199,We would not be able to.
1971.70-5082,2,39354,robert_w_geddes,,2321.912,2326.018,"Mr. Justice Douglas, may it please the Court."
1971.70-5082,3,32159,jon_d_noland,,3347.842,3356.202,The fact is Mr. Justice Brennan that several other witnesses did testified that they received aid within the six month period.

1971.70-5082,3,32159,jon_d_noland,,3373.528,3375.207,That is correct.
