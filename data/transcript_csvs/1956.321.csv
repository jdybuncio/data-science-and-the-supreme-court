1956.321,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,457.042,460.203,I didn't get your last statement that was made.
1956.321,0,18102,beverly_tarpley,,460.203,481.049,"The -- her immediate superior there on the job, the witness Higginbotham, told her in response to her protest about the fact that she could not do this job while wearing the clothing she'd been requested to wear was, ""You have hired out to do a man's job and now those are the duties I see fit for you to do."""
1956.321,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,481.049,487.347,"Now, before that, what had been told to her in that regard by a higher superior, did you say?"
1956.321,0,18102,beverly_tarpley,,487.347,488.326,"Yes, sir."
1956.321,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,623.175,628.671,Mr. Look.

1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,744.382,747.575,How heavy do these bags get?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,747.575,755.928,"On this occasion, she stated the bags were -- some of them 50 to 75 pounds on this particular occasion."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,756.806,759.648,Do they get heavier than that on -- on occasions?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,759.648,761.335,"I -- I don't know, Your Honor."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,811.311,818.892,Had she been told before that she must do this herself but must not -- must not get any other help?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,818.892,819.015,"No, sir."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,819.015,822.296,She -- she must not use this Mexican?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,822.296,823.618,"No, sir."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,823.618,827.994,You mean that it wasn't as counsel stated that this -- it was?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,827.994,828.463,"No, sir."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,902.046,909.896,"Well, what was her purpose of talking to them if she wasn't complaining it was too heavy for her?"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,909.896,918.859,"She said she would have to climb up and down on those carts and she couldn't dress in skirts and hose and go -- she'd be exposed that way, you see, out around the station."
1956.321,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,933.986,939.689,You mean by that that she then was asking permission to wear man's clothing?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,939.689,944.457,"Yes, sir, to wear slacks or some other appropriate tights."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,946.605,958.738,Is there no -- is there no limit in this -- in that particular state as to the weight that women -- weight of packages women are permitted to handle in their employment?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,958.738,961.937,"Not that I know of, Your Honor."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,961.937,964.462,All states do.
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,964.462,965.906,I'm in the personal injury --
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,965.906,971.23,"(Voice Overlap) is pretty -- pretty heavy weight to have women in there, throwing around (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,971.23,973.068,"One or two sacks, I think."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,994.704,1001.876,Why couldn't she get -- why wouldn't they permit her to use the Mexican laborer if he was available?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1001.876,1007.814,There is no evidence that anyone told her she could not get help.
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1023.113,1031.929,"Well, I understood counsel to say that when -- when she took it up with her superior, her superior told her that, ""Now, you've got a man's job and --"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1031.929,1031.958,Yes.
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1031.958,1033.926,-- you've got to do it yourself.
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1037.441,1045.315,"I don't -- the record, Your Honor, I don't believe will reflect that he told her that he -- she could not have help."
1956.321,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1045.315,1050.858,There was testimony that Judge Cameron puts in the footnote on page 191?

1956.321,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1052.007,1061.252,"That she said, ""I have been instructed I was not to ask but I couldn't have anyone to work the mail with me, there wasn't any need to ask."""
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1061.252,1062.358,"Well, sir, that -- I don't --"

1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1068.871,1069.871,Of the record.
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1069.871,1071.941,Was it 191?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1071.941,1074.609,"191, Footnote 5."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1074.609,1080.699,"Oh, yes, yes."
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1080.699,1101.397,"Well, when pressed further she stated, Mr. Higginbotham, when asked about that -- Mr. Higginbotham in that same note, ""Told me, now, this is just oral but this is what he said, the best I can remember, I was to take this one car, this one truck and take it out and take what is on there and put it on the train and take this on the train and bring it and put it in the baggage room."""
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1105.759,1110.454,"Now -- now, is that -- that's referring to this particular night?"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1110.454,1111.456,"At no time, sir."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1111.456,1115.915,"No, no, no, I'm talking about the -- what you just read."
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1128.57,1129.102,"No, sir."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1132.024,1132.562,I -- I see.
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1132.562,1141.311,There was no conversation between her superior and -- and the petitioner on this day at all.
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1208.076,1218.823,"Do all of your women operator-agents or what did they call him here, agent-operators on this railroad wear men's clothing?"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1218.823,1228.376,"The agent -- if they have a train -- a passenger train that carries mail, they've got to work the train."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1232.09,1246.051,"Well, this woman was told according to Thomson's argument that -- that she must wear -- wear it because she had a man's job to do and -- and she had to wear men's clothing if that was necessary to do it."
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1246.051,1246.618,"Yes, sir."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1246.618,1259.911,"Now, my -- my question is, is that -- is that the normal instruction you give to your women agent-operators and are they suppose, all of them, to wear men's clothing when they -- if they handle any mail?"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1259.911,1262.553,They are not instructed to wear men's clothing.
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1277.751,1278.445,"Well, do you -- as --"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1278.445,1278.624,But they --
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1278.624,1283.177,-- you -- you say this is an unusually heavy load this -- in this particular day.
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1324.069,1339.858,"The -- the testimony -- the objection to the wearing of the women's clothes was that she would have to climb up on these carts, on the record page 36A, one of these regular little carts."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1342.334,1349.014,"And I suppose if it was -- it was packed higher with mail, she might have to get on top of the mail."
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1349.014,1350.933,I -- I suppose that she might.
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1350.933,1351.403,(Voice Overlap) haven't you?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1353.957,1357.174,That is true in your larger --
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1357.174,1357.242,Yes.
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1357.242,1357.742,-- stations.
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1473.057,1473.71,Did what?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1473.71,1485.467,"It may have weakened her and caused the injury or what happened, we don't know, except that she and other employees did it constantly."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1516.455,1520.676,She didn't complain of -- of the bad kidneys.
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1522.799,1523.39,"Yes, sir."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1523.41,1524.718,-- handling this mail.
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1524.718,1525.258,"Yes, sir."
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1567.261,1572.91,"Well, there was some evidence, was there not, that this was in the Christmas season?"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1572.91,1576.179,"This was -- happened on the 2nd day of December, Your Honor."
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1576.179,1584.318,"Well, I mean wasn't the -- wasn't the suggestion that the volume of mail was a little larger or perhaps much (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1584.318,1588.198,"There was some evidence that it was starting to get larger, yes, sir."
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1588.198,1601.378,And I suppose the railroad was charged with that knowledge with -- equally with the petitioner.
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1601.378,1603.861,She was the only one with the railroad that ever touched the mail on that.
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1603.861,1608.901,I know but the railroad simply doesn't deny that it would have knowledge to the Christmas season --
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1608.901,1609.175,"No, no, no."
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1609.175,1610.647,-- the volume of the mail was larger.
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1610.647,1611.631,No.
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1611.631,1620.091,Don't you think that's a fact too which bears upon whether or not there should have been some affirmative aid offered her by the railroad?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1620.091,1635.347,"No, sir, because we might know that the mail is picking up, but she has got a duty to perform as she sees fit."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1658.82,1663.565,"But if she had been told sometime before, I say if she had been told --"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1663.565,1663.783,Yes.
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1663.783,1669.111,-- sometime before that she had to do this work herself --
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1669.111,1669.346,"Yes, sir."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1669.346,1673.275,-- and that she was not to get anybody else to do it.
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1680.417,1682.439,"Sir -- yes, sir, if --"
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1682.439,1682.68,If (Voice Overlap) --
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1682.68,1684.673,But if the record would bear that out.
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1704.955,1716.031,"Well, wasn't -- wasn't there also a fact question whether she testified and she'd been instructed that she was not to ask if she couldn't have anyone to help her with it?"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1719.67,1720.557,"No, sir."
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1720.557,1721.398,"Well, that -- why not?"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1724.835,1731.603,She made that statement on further examination to ask her what she was referring to by that.
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1736.803,1738.66,Who is Slick Sligh --
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1738.66,1746.255,"Slick Sligh was a -- was a fellow employee, so with Jack Kittrell."
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1746.255,1759.121,And she was asked -- especially whether she asked them for assistance and she said she didn't because she had been told by her superior not to ask for any help and that that maybe she wasn't telling the truth but was is not for the jury to decide?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1759.121,1760.564,"I don't believe it was, Your Honor."
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1761.917,1764.871,"Ordinarily, I -- issues of credibility for the jury?"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1764.871,1775.169,"Issues of credibility are for the jury, but if she is -- if she later on explained to weigh that answer herself and you ask her, ""Who told you not to ask for help?"
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1784.882,1785.07,Well (Voice Overlap) --
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1785.07,1787.009,"Now, who told her not to ask for help?"
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1787.009,1787.048,I don't --
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,1787.048,1793.77,"She doesn't, in that statement, state who didn't ask her for help."

1956.321,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2153.257,2160.405,"The bottom of page 18, it indicates on direct examination that she says she was instructed to handle it alone."
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2160.405,2172.087,"If it would be read in context, Your Honor, it said -- well, I told him that the Mexican had been handling it and that the trains had been getting out and he instructed that you were to handle it personally."
1956.321,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2177.05,2191.19,"He said that you found that anyhow, didn't he, that regardless that he had hired -- that he had hired her to do a man's job, she will receive the same pay as a man and those were her duties and that she had to do them."
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2191.19,2191.692,"Yes, sir."
1956.321,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2201.781,2205.587,But then didn't she say what I said down at page 18?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2218.534,2220.597,She was talking to her superior.
1956.321,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2220.597,2221.291,Her superior?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2226.277,2232.241,He said that I was hired out to do a man's job and had to do it regardless.
1956.321,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2236.085,2237.589,What was she complaining about?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2237.589,2246.975,She was complaining because she couldn't wear her skirts and hose and trying to get up on a cart because she would be exposed and be unladylike.
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2246.975,2254.889,"Well, how do you -- how do you explain this -- this answer on the bottom of page 18 that Justice Douglas called your attention?"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2278.752,2283.539,"I certainly can't read that construction in there, Mr. Chief Justice."
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2287.639,2297.871,"Well, it's a test whether a judge, you or I or anyone else can read it but whether reasonably the jury can read it that way, that test?"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2297.871,2300.289,"That is -- that is one of the tests, Your Honor."
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2300.289,2301.507,"Well, that is the test, isn't it?"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2301.507,2301.928,"Yes, sir."
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2301.928,2303.529,The -- where the problem basically --
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2303.529,2303.915,Yes.
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2303.915,2307.034,-- here is whether there was a jury question or wasn't.
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2307.222,2307.901,"Yes, sir."
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2307.901,2318.084,"-- if that can be read as the Chief Justice suggests, doesn't that answer that there was a jury question?"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2318.084,2325.191,It does if you say that the jury can take any statement completely out of context.
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2325.191,2327.764,I -- I don't think it's a matter of taking it out of context.
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2330.722,2331.608,"Yes, sir."
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2331.608,2332.739,"And certainly we didn't, neither did --"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2332.739,2332.883,"Yes, sir."
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2332.883,2334.11,-- the Court of Appeals.
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2334.11,2334.582,"Yes, sir."
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2334.582,2346.529,"And the trial judge saw the witness -- witnesses and the trial judge felt that on what the jury saw and what the jury heard, the jury could decide whether to (Inaudible) and that's why he sent it to the jury, wasn't it?"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2346.529,2347.025,"Yes, sir."
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2347.025,2351.9,And that's not ordinarily the way we do these things in Negligence Act?
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2351.9,2354.52,That is ordinarily.
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2361.971,2362.597,"Yes, but I didn't --"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2362.597,2364.403,And say that presents the jury issue.
1956.321,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2364.403,2385.009,"I didn't think that the determination was based upon what we might do taking a printed record and say the thing mattered, it was rather what the trial judge ordinarily might properly feel that the jury could draw upon it, that they could draw the inference which the Chief Justice's question suggests."
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2387.955,2388.944,"No, sir."
1956.321,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2417.073,2430.348,"But we have -- happened to say wasn't it that he was an unreasonable man when he heard the evidence and saw the witnesses and decided to the contrary, do you, as I understand we'd have to say he's not a reasonable man."
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2430.348,2430.636,"No, sir."
1956.321,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2430.636,2433.152,And there's no reasonable man could find it.
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2433.152,2433.699,"No, sir."
1956.321,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2433.699,2436.344,The jury found it and he found it as 13 of them.
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2436.344,2442.597,I -- I don't believe that a jury verdict means that the trial judge would have found it the same way.
1956.321,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2442.597,2442.728,"Well, he (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.321,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2442.728,2445.509,"Well, he left it -- he sat and left it to them, didn't he?"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2445.509,2446.441,"Yes, sir, he sat and left it to --"
1956.321,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2446.441,2451.85,"(Voice Overlap) that sounds like he thought it was reasonable, doesn't it?"
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2451.85,2456.147,"It sounds like -- he thought that reasonable man could arrive at that answer, yes, sir."
1956.321,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2456.147,2472.353,"Well, at page 168, near the top, he instructed the jury on this point we're talking about that she asked her superiors for help to unload the heavy mails, which was refused her although assistants were then available."
1956.321,1,31371,j_b_look,,2481.117,2481.546,"No, sir."
1956.321,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2500.464,2505.079,"Ms. Tarpley, did you -- have something in rebuttal?"
1956.321,2,18102,beverly_tarpley,,2505.079,2507.307,May it please the Court.
1956.321,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2598.532,2601.599,Who was -- who was the District Judge here?
1956.321,2,18102,beverly_tarpley,,2601.599,2604.013,"The Honorable T. Whitfield Davidson, who is now --"
1956.321,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2604.013,2607.649,How long has he been a judge?
1956.321,2,18102,beverly_tarpley,,2607.649,2609.228,"Well, over 20 years."
1956.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2806.567,2815.112,You mean -- did I understand you to say that the counsel do not bring to the attention of the Fifth Circuit the decisions of this Court in this class of cases?
1956.321,2,18102,beverly_tarpley,,2815.112,2816.602,"No, sir, I'm sorry."
1956.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2825.473,2847.358,"How -- can you say, as your experience is trivial, Fifth Circuit cases enable one to say that there is a current -- that there's an attitude has occurred adjudication by that Court in this regard of the decisions of this Court?"
1956.321,2,18102,beverly_tarpley,,2847.358,2851.353,"If the Court please, I'm not prepared to present other cases."
1956.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2852.066,2853.123,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.321,2,18102,beverly_tarpley,,2853.123,2855.442,"-- which the Court is not interested in, I wouldn't imagine --[Laughter]"
1956.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2855.442,2862.277,"Well, I -- I asked you a very specific question and I don't mean that this -- you know my attitude toward these cases."
1956.321,2,18102,beverly_tarpley,,2862.277,2862.842,"Yes, sir, I do."
1956.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2862.842,2870.927,But this -- but you latterly raised a question in which I am deeply interested to -- just the relevance in my point of view.
1956.321,2,18102,beverly_tarpley,,2910.949,2911.559,"Yes, sir."
1956.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2913.118,2914.653,I don't mean to say you feel so but --
1956.321,2,18102,beverly_tarpley,,2914.653,2914.825,Well --
1956.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2914.825,2925.497,"-- suppose if -- if I made it my job to look at all the reported cases in the Fifth Circuit, I would find that they don't care what this Court has decided."
1956.321,2,18102,beverly_tarpley,,2925.497,2926.464,May I cite a specific --
1956.321,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2926.464,2926.84,That's a pretty rough question (Voice Overlap) --
1956.321,2,18102,beverly_tarpley,,2926.84,2928.311,-- example which is beyond the realm --
1956.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2928.311,2933.122,"Well, I just want to know what your impression is because that line should be -- very well, if you --"
1956.321,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2933.122,2935.631,I think that's -- I think that's a pretty rough to question to ask (Voice Overlap) --
1956.321,2,18102,beverly_tarpley,,2935.631,2935.674,Well --
1956.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2935.674,2940.532,I didn't mean to say -- I don't mean to say you -- you shouldn't prevail apart from that --
1956.321,2,18102,beverly_tarpley,,2940.532,2940.794,Well --
1956.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2940.794,2943.081,"-- but you did say something like that, didn't you?"
1956.321,2,18102,beverly_tarpley,,2943.081,2944.711,"Yes, sir."
1956.321,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2944.711,2946.217,I didn't initiate this remark.
1956.321,2,18102,beverly_tarpley,,2947.713,2968.336,"If I may say this, after the opinion of the Fifth Circuit and this case was handed down and prior to the term -- the petitioner's term for motion for rehearing had expired, this Court published it's opinion in the case of Schulz versus Pennsylvania Railroad which was a Jones Act case and similar of course on the liability angle, the Federal Employers' Liability Act."
