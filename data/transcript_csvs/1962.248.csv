1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,945.383,948.371,You have to rely upon the second entry.

1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,958.048,959.209,"Oh no, sir."

1962.248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1056.07,1061.563,-- of this condition dating back to this man's -- on his -- in his twenties if it hadn't been for this arrest after he got to this country.
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1061.563,1062.427,It probably never would have --
1962.248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1062.427,1063.24,Is that fair to say?
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1063.24,1064.87,It probably never would have come to light --
1962.248,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1064.87,1065.274,Yes.

1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1098.02,1110.088,That is -- that's precisely the point of the Court of Appeals and we submit that the Court has misapplied the vague -- the void for vagueness doctrine.

1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1218.742,1221.987,That's -- that is the step that has been taken.

1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1401.755,1419.643,"Where -- where deportability is based upon inadmissibility or excludability at the time of entry, the sole question in a deportation proceeding is whether or not at that time, he was excludable."
1962.248,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1429.451,1442.997,"What I'd -- I had thought you said at one time, it was -- the law didn't forbid this or didn't make this a disqualification at the time of entrance?"
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1442.997,1459.295,"No, I think that Mr. Justice White's question was whether or not Congress could deport an alien on the basis of past homosexual conduct as such."

1962.248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.709,1490.956,Does it?
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1490.956,1497.107,"This -- it was prior to the 1952 Act, four years prior to the entry in question here."
1962.248,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1497.107,1516.57,"You say that so far as the doctrine's vagueness is concerned, as related to disqualifications from entering that it could be written in ancient sensory or anything else, immaterial, whether the person knows it or not."
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1516.57,1523.031,I think that at least that question is not in this case.
1962.248,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1523.031,1529.994,[Inaudible]
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1529.994,1546.233,Because he -- he is contending that he has a right as a resident alien not to be deported on the ground of past excludability.
1962.248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.121,1607.755,What if -- what if -- what about [Inaudible]?
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1607.755,1609.961,"I think we would -- I think that the Government would, sir."
1962.248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1609.961,1613.935,Regardless of whatever [Inaudible]
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1613.935,1622.197,I think that it is a principal of constitutional law that an alien who has never reached our shores --
1962.248,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1622.197,1629.633,[Inaudible]
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1629.633,1630.546,It doesn't make any difference at what?
1962.248,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1630.546,1634.206,If it -- if it wasn't [Inaudible]?
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1634.206,1639.46,I think that would be true as long as the legislative history were clear as to what Congress intended.
1962.248,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1639.46,1639.899,"Oh, I was wondering --"
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1639.899,1641.167,But that is not this case though.
1962.248,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1641.167,1642.224,You go a step further.
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1668.575,1670.856,Making homosexuality?
1962.248,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1670.856,1672.573,Yes.
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1672.573,1674.32,Committed before entry?

1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1676.38,1678.271,"Oh, yes, yes, yes, sir."
1962.248,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1678.271,1680.028,Is there any constitutional barrier?
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1680.028,1681.354,"No -- none, sir."
1962.248,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1683.502,1688.97,I assume a fortiori as to that [Inaudible]
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1688.97,1690.149,"I think -- I think so, yes."

1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1738.602,1739.813,"Well, I want to rely on both."
1962.248,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1745.217,1752.374,"Well, I would suppose that what you're saying is that alien came in here and have been here 50 years."

1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1767.851,1769.29,That is not this case.
1962.248,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1769.29,1770.858,It hadn't been that long.

1962.248,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1778.687,1780.085,I didn't say it was this case --
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1780.085,1780.202,No.
1962.248,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1780.202,1788.762,"-- but the question I asked you, which you answered -- assume that you didn't need to go any further than to say, “Well Congress, anytime they sees it fit and that's the law and it would be fine retroactively.”"
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1788.762,1789.616,"Well, it's just --"
1962.248,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1789.616,1792.044,"50 years just as well as [Inaudible], I would think."
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1792.044,1795.091,"That's not just my suggestion, Mr. Justice Black."
1962.248,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1795.091,1798.768,But you're -- you're trying to -- you're trying to put a thought in another ground.
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1798.768,1799.092,No.
1962.248,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1806.26,1808.629,"Well, if that's what you're relying on, I agree with those --"

1962.248,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1810.674,1812.115,But that's enough if you're right.
1962.248,0,38107,philip_r_monahan,,1812.115,1820.493,We don't rely upon that wholly but we're -- that was one over the strings to our vote.
