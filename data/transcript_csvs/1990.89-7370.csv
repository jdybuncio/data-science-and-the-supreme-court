1990.89-7370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.937,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-7370, Moshe Gozlon-Peretz v. United States."
1990.89-7370,0,37925,peter_goldberger,,25.297,29.87,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-7370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,240.638,258.39,"And, of course, since he serves 10 years minimum, at the time that he is released all of the supervised-release provisions that Congress enacted in '84 and in '86 will be in effect."
1990.89-7370,0,37925,peter_goldberger,,258.39,260.971,In one sense--
1990.89-7370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,260.971,269.245,"At the time that it is necessary to implement this scheme, the statute will be fully effective by its own terms."
1990.89-7370,0,37925,peter_goldberger,,269.245,272.199,"--In one sense, Justice Kennedy, that's true, but in another it's not."
1990.89-7370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,336.226,353.947,"Well, it, it goes to the point of what Congress probably intended, and if you're saying that we can't know what supervised release means because it's an empty term without implementing provisions, there are couple answers."
1990.89-7370,0,37925,peter_goldberger,,371.852,380.019,"Well, not only are they not applicable, and of course when we look for congressional intent, the first thing to look at is the language that specifically addresses the question."
1990.89-7370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,390.838,397.252,"Wasn't this just a mistake, as indicated by a later amendment that sought to plug the hole?"
1990.89-7370,0,37925,peter_goldberger,,397.252,402.144,"--Well, there have been contentions in this case that several aspects of what are involved here have been mistakes."
1990.89-7370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,403.326,404.255,And it--
1990.89-7370,0,37925,peter_goldberger,,404.255,406.007,--it imposes intriguing problems of how--
1990.89-7370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,406.007,406.656,--You think it was all deliberate?
1990.89-7370,0,37925,peter_goldberger,,408.579,412.762,"--Oh, in the subjective sense, do I think that Congress intended to put me in this position?"
1990.89-7370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,412.762,412.923,--Right.
1990.89-7370,0,37925,peter_goldberger,,412.923,413.373,I... no.
1990.89-7370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.373,414.634,"And us, too."
1990.89-7370,0,37925,peter_goldberger,,414.634,415.595,And especially you.
1990.89-7370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,445.94,456.489,"Well, I thought one rule was that statutes normally take effect on the date of their enactment, and section 1002 doesn't contain the language you point to."
1990.89-7370,0,37925,peter_goldberger,,459.631,472.19,"If that... the require... the... excuse me, the axiom of construction that a statute is deemed to become effective immediately if it doesn't provide otherwise is not a rule."
1990.89-7370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,479.736,487.042,"Well, why don't we apply the axiom of construction then and say 1002 became effective immediately on enactment?"
1990.89-7370,0,37925,peter_goldberger,,487.042,490.754,--Because there is such a wealth of other reasons not to.
1990.89-7370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.85,579.767,"Mr. Goldberger, are you suggesting in response to Justice O'Connor's question that there are some things we call rules of statutory construction, other things we call axioms of statutory construction... that the two are different?"
1990.89-7370,0,37925,peter_goldberger,,579.767,581.149,"No, I don't think so."
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1529.346,1540.282,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-7370,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1558.207,1564.672,xxx axiom as suggested by your opposition?
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1564.672,1576.629,"Well, I don't want to get into a semantical battle, but what we mean by this perhaps is best explicated by what Chief Justice Rehnquist said in Albernez v. United States about the Blockberger Rule."
1990.89-7370,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1598.665,1603.437,Have we applied the rule of lenity to an effective date issue?
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1603.437,1604.379,"Never, Your Honor."
1990.89-7370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1650.904,1652.522,This isn't a little anomaly.
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1662.311,1664.843,That is correct.
1990.89-7370,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1754.896,1770.117,"Ms. Wax, if we go along with the Government's suggestion here, it does result in some anomalies and some problems in relation to other statues, does it not?"
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1770.117,1772.03,It does.
1990.89-7370,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1783.189,1792.075,And would those problems be avoided by the construction by the later effective date suggested by the petitioner?
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1792.075,1800.6,"Your Honor, that... it would avoid some of them, but it would create other problems and inconsistencies in its wake."
1990.89-7370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1852.166,1852.396,"Well, that's--"
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1852.396,1852.927,And if there is--
1990.89-7370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1852.927,1855.281,--that's just saying one statute was totally superfluous.
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1865.396,1866.748,--Right.
1990.89-7370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1866.748,1867.179,Isn't that right?
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1867.179,1874.635,It would be... because they abolish parole in '84 and the abolition of parole was going kick in in November of--
1990.89-7370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1874.635,1874.775,Right.
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1875.316,1877.416,--They did need to do it again.
1990.89-7370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1877.416,1877.697,But they didn't do anything inconsistent.
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1877.697,1882.452,"Well, we're only saying that it would be a surplusage."
1990.89-7370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1882.452,1882.702,Right.
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1882.702,1885.925,And we think that's an anomaly as much as the anomalies to which--
1990.89-7370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1885.925,1888.666,"Yeah, but it doesn't create any administrative anomalies or anything like that."
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1896.062,1898.273,"--Well, as a sign--"
1990.89-7370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1898.273,1902.177,Which might be wise legislation in some circumstances to make a hundred percent sure their meaning is clear.
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1902.177,1924.151,"--But if we're... if we're looking at these anomalies as a sign of what Congress intended to do, okay... I mean, basically petitioner's argument is that by leaving these anomalies... by creating these anomalies, by allowing supervised release to kick in, Congress was sending us a message that it wanted to delay supervised release."
1990.89-7370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1940.536,1941.087,"Well, they're not saying they wanted to delay it."
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1956.299,1980.776,"Well, the other reason why we think that the way to solve whatever anomalies there are is not to delay supervised release is that Congress clearly passed a provision that had mandatory monitoring in it, and we have to go a little bit into the history of this enactment in order to understand why that's important."
1990.89-7370,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2146.512,2149.503,"--It still... it still isn't a badly drafted statute, isn't it?"
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2151.634,2158.55,"--Well, there are a few oversights which result in some inconsistencies."
1990.89-7370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2227.824,2237.661,"Why couldn't I say that term has no meaning until the other statute takes effect, and since it doesn't have any meaning I'll assume it seems... it means the same thing as parole, special parole?"
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2237.661,2253.813,"--Well, Your Honor, once again while it's true that the definitional provision that gives meaning to supervised release or tells us what Congress meant by supervised released isn't in force, it still does exist."
1990.89-7370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2283.342,2293.129,"It seems to me you... you're presenting the case, as you ought to I suppose, you know, on the assumption it's our function to figure out what Congress intended."
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2333.727,2339.792,"Your Honor, we think not, because of what Congress did when it passed the statute."
1990.89-7370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2439.822,2445.757,"Ms. Wax, will you... I should know this, but what sentence did this man get?"
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2445.757,2447.229,Um--
1990.89-7370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2447.229,2450.521,"Assume you win, what... how long will he be in prison?"
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2450.521,2453.581,--He's going to be in prison for 15 years I believe.
1990.89-7370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2453.581,2455.765,15 years plus a 10... 4 or 5 years.
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2455.765,2469.055,"Well, petitioner's correct that the mandatory good-time provisions under section 4163 and 4164 will apply to him, so he'll have some time deducted from his mandatory term of imprisonment."
1990.89-7370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.055,2470.694,If it's good time.
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2471.325,2473.506,"If it's... right, if it's good time."
1990.89-7370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2473.506,2473.907,Yes.
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2473.907,2477.61,But he'll be in prison for at least 10 years is my understanding.
1990.89-7370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2477.61,2477.99,I see.
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2477.99,2478.371,Yeah.
1990.89-7370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2667.402,2668.905,We haven't found this boring.
1990.89-7370,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2672.707,2675.369,"Well, it's important to us, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-7370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2699.395,2703.897,"I can't help but enjoy the difference between an axiom, a rule, and a vital legislative principle."
1990.89-7370,2,37925,peter_goldberger,,2709.71,2713.564,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-7370,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.949,2744.986,"There is an anomaly created by your proposal which is that your client would get nothing, neither, neither special parole nor supervised release."
1990.89-7370,2,37925,peter_goldberger,,2744.986,2746.505,He hardly gets a nothing.
1990.89-7370,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2748.528,2749.218,To his sentence.
1990.89-7370,2,37925,peter_goldberger,,2749.448,2757.685,"--10 years in prison and 10 years of post-incarceration supervision, because and precisely because he's a pre-November 1, '87, offender."
1990.89-7370,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2868.133,2876.046,"Well, does the... does the legislative history show any... give any reason for the substitution of special release for--"
1990.89-7370,2,37925,peter_goldberger,,2876.046,2879.378,--There is... there's absolutely no legislative history explaining this precise change.
1990.89-7370,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.424,2888.915,"--Well, what if the--"
1990.89-7370,2,37925,peter_goldberger,,2888.915,2889.956,We don't know by whom or why.
1990.89-7370,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2889.956,2900.314,--What if the... what if the statute hadn't been... or the bill hadn't been amended in that way and it retained the special parole provision?
1990.89-7370,2,37925,peter_goldberger,,2900.314,2907.31,I don't think there would have been sufficient argument against the presumption axiom--
1990.89-7370,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2907.31,2909.881,Of immediate... of immediate effectiveness?
1990.89-7370,2,37925,peter_goldberger,,2909.881,2910.552,--That's right.
1990.89-7370,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.511,2923.409,It's just the... it's just... it's just this... this new term being included in the statute which seems to be tied to the statute that becomes effective in '87 that gives you this argument?
1990.89-7370,2,37925,peter_goldberger,,2923.409,2945.475,"This and all of those other contradictions where certain other provisions in the 845 series of drug statutes incorporate by reference and refer to sections of 841(b), the basic drug-sentencing law, and say, and this person shall receive twice the term of special parole as someone sentenced under 841(b) and here Congress said there is no special parole under 841(b)."
1990.89-7370,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2952.341,2953.64,Would all of those be eliminated?
1990.89-7370,2,37925,peter_goldberger,,2961.315,2966.769,"It absolutely would eliminate it, but we agree with the Government that that is the first impermissible answer to the problem."
1990.89-7370,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.769,2967.169,"--Yes, right."
1990.89-7370,2,37925,peter_goldberger,,2967.169,2972.413,And that's because it's the only one that's directly contrary to the language deliberately chosen by Congress.
1990.89-7370,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.413,2974.145,Deliberately chosen by Congress.
1990.89-7370,2,37925,peter_goldberger,,2974.145,2981.249,"Well, we know that Congress changed the words ""special parole term"" to the words ""term of supervised release""."
1990.89-7370,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3007.949,3009.401,"Thank you, Mr. Goldberger."
