2010.09-1298,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,13.241,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1298, General Dynamics v. United States, and the consolidated case, 09-1302, the Boeing Company v. United States."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,14.124,16.593,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,91.974,115.007,"Mr. Phillips, when the contractors -- when they failed to deliver the first aircraft at the time specified by the contract, their reason was that its costs would far outrun the contract price, and so it sought to reformulate the contract."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,131.968,135.92,"There was nothing specific with respect to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-1298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,158.951,166.455,"But you would expect them to say, if that was the impediment to going forward on this contract, to at least mention it."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,166.455,197.744,"--Well, I think you have to put it in context, Justice Ginsburg, because during this period of time, obviously, there were consistent efforts and requests being made to get access to both the B-2 and the A-117 stealth technologies, and there were discussions that went back and forth, and the district court -- and the Court of Federal Claims specifically held, eventually the information was forthcoming, but it was, candidly, too little and too late to effectively allow the contract to proceed as -- as planned."
2010.09-1298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,210.317,211.767,Mr. Phillips--
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,211.767,212.217,--disposition.
2010.09-1298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,212.217,220.657,--why wasn't the need to share that technology a part of this contract or a condition to the contract.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,240.82,243.272,"No, I think -- I think, Justice--"
2010.09-1298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,243.272,245.557,I'm going to pose a hypothetical.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,290.502,291.519,"--Well, you have to--"
2010.09-1298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,291.519,293.454,That's usually what happens with other privileges.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,293.454,293.888,--Right.
2010.09-1298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,346.803,347.086,Wait a minute.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,361.443,365.079,"Well, our claim -- we have separate -- we have a series of distinct claims."
2010.09-1298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,390.713,392.931,"Well, there's a factual dispute about that."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,399.501,412.159,"Well -- I mean, there may be a factual dispute, but I'd be -- and I would be happy to litigate that issue if we can get to that point where we are in fact allowed to litigate any aspects of our particular defense."
2010.09-1298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,441.226,464.025,"The two questions I would have is, first of all -- Justice Sotomayor, sorry; I didn't -- I did have her question, because what that suggests is in this case it's not unfair to hold your client in this case, and you just read the two Circuit Court opinions here and you think this is a defense coming out of long in the past that doesn't have much substance to it."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,466.294,467.144,--Can I just--
2010.09-1298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,467.144,468.06,"In other words, it's not unfair."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,496.146,497.396,"--Well, I don't--"
2010.09-1298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,497.396,507.704,"One, this isn't a case that calls for it; and, two, the threat to government contracting by changing from Reynolds to here is overwhelming."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,511.906,512.189,--Right.
2010.09-1298,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,591.572,595.607,"Well, the Petitioners as a formal matter were the moving party, isn't that right?"
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,595.607,602.26,"Well, ""moving party"" I think is, is not a self-defined concept, Justice Alito."
2010.09-1298,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,605.045,605.895,They were the plaintiffs.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,613.901,629.678,"Well, because the review scheme also says that the very -- in 1986 in the Assurance case, the Federal Circuit said, which was before this contract was entered into, the Federal Circuit said the filing, the mere filing of a complaint, immediately vacates the contracting officer's rule."
2010.09-1298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,655.745,658.68,Can you explain -- you've referred to it several times now.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,690.449,701.257,"Well, what had not happened is that the final -- there had not been a final sign-off by the contracting officer approving it, and thereby reducing it to a liquidated claim."
2010.09-1298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,753.856,765.414,"But you are here seeking to -- to emerge as a total winner, that is to get from this contract what you would have gotten if it had been successfully completed, including any profit?"
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,765.414,767.533,"No, no Justice Ginsburg, that's not true."
2010.09-1298,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,814.727,820.465,Why shouldn't we view this as if it were a dispute between two private contracting parties?
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,831.487,852.668,"Justice Alito, I think that is precisely how you ought to look at it, and -- and we would be very comfortable with that, because it's quite clear to me that, except in the hyper-technical way that -- that you articulate because of -- because of the way the Contracts Disputes Act plays out, that the government is unquestionably the moving party, the party seeking affirmative relief to be able to take 1.35 billion--"
2010.09-1298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,852.668,855.536,"I -- I -- I think it's questionable, Mr. Phillips, for this reason."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,882.17,885.955,"--Well, in that -- I mean, you can -- that's one way to articulate it."
2010.09-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.342,928.715,"Yes, but then you go on to say: Moreover, give us -- give us the payment for the additional money beyond the 1.35 that you've already given us--"
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,928.715,930.067,Well--
2010.09-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,930.067,932.117,--plus this additional money that we've expended.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,932.117,932.55,--Right.
2010.09-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,940.089,940.522,"Well, why shouldn't we?"
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,952.33,952.747,Right.
2010.09-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.747,961.253,"--why don't we just -- you know, I -- I think the usual course taken by courts would be to leave the parties where they are."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,984.618,990.355,"Well, I mean, to be sure, we would be much more comfortable in the world you just articulated, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,990.355,992.057,"Yes, you would be 1.35 billion--"
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,993.174,994.926,With interest.
2010.09-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.742,996.909,With interest.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,997.878,998.544,"That's starting to add up, Your Honor."
2010.09-1298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1035.448,1047.822,"You mentioned the 1.3 -- that you get to keep the 1.35 million, but there was also another figure, 1.2 million that you would get on top of that."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1047.822,1048.358,Right.
2010.09-1298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1049.074,1051.143,So that certainly wouldn't be leaving you where you were.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1051.143,1051.893,"--Well, no."
2010.09-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1087.633,1088.716,But the government didn't do that.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1102.291,1104.976,"--Well, it seems to me the -- I mean, the question is was the default--"
2010.09-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1104.976,1106.009,It seems to me you call the game off.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1106.009,1111.312,"--Well, and the question is, if you call the game off, what -- what flows from that."
2010.09-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1151.42,1159.709,"But the fallacy is we're not -- assuming we agree with you on the rest, we're not saying that it's not a default termination."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1161.311,1162.295,Right.
2010.09-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1162.911,1166.447,"We're saying we don't know, we don't know what the state secrets thing is."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1170.834,1172.953,"--Well, I -- I -- the problem--"
2010.09-1298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1172.953,1178.69,So why force the government to -- to -- to go to a termination for convenience?
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1178.69,1179.423,--Right.
2010.09-1298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1234.072,1246.629,"Mr. Phillips, give us a way, a reasoned way, to reach the result Justice Scalia is suggesting, because you are being greedy."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1248.998,1249.564,"--No, I -- I said--"
2010.09-1298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1249.564,1251.48,--A termination for--
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1251.48,1251.964,--I could be characterized that way.
2010.09-1298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1251.964,1267.942,--convenience carries its own automatic consequences that appear unfair in light of the fact that the litigation of the default termination has been invoked because there is a risk to the United States.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1271.56,1273.179,"Now, are you--"
2010.09-1298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1273.179,1277.147,--to not -- to not impose that unfairness on the government?
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1299.061,1302.865,"--Right, but -- well, I don't know whether you want me to answer the second part first--"
2010.09-1298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1302.865,1303.965,It goes back to my original question is--
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1303.965,1304.582,--or go back to the original question.
2010.09-1298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1304.582,1305.651,--you could have contracted around it.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1305.651,1307.117,"Sure, and so could the government."
2010.09-1298,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1319.974,1341.074,"Mr. Phillips, could I ask you whether that principle makes any sense in this contracting situation, because both parties have argued it as though the question of who is the moving party is determinative of this case, but in a contract situation the question of who's the moving party is very often arbitrary or fortuitous."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1363.487,1363.853,--Right.
2010.09-1298,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1363.853,1370.407,"--what the payment schedule has been like, so whether somebody is demanding their money back or simply refusing to pay it at all."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1379.33,1396.005,"Well, I -- I think that actually the Court in Reynolds, to the extent it would have envisioned any of these circumstances decades ago, used the language ""moving party"" rather than ""plaintiff"" or ""defendant"" precisely for that reason, because I think what the Court had in mind is the party who was seeking affirmative relief."
2010.09-1298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1396.005,1397.207,It was thinking of a tort.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1401.826,1402.945,"Oh, no."
2010.09-1298,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1409.265,1412.717,But it can't possibly be the case that the question is what the payment schedule is.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1432.279,1447.89,"Well, because in the one situation I have $1.35 billion in my pocket for services that were unquestionably rendered and which, in our judgment, you know, satisfied our portion of the obligation under this contract."
2010.09-1298,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1447.89,1449.223,Both parties have a claim here.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1461.281,1464.15,"I don't disagree with that, Justice Kagan."
2010.09-1298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1471.054,1479.242,"That's exactly my problem, because when I looked at Reynolds, Reynolds doesn't hold anything in your favor."
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1504.893,1505.576,"Right, but--"
2010.09-1298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1505.576,1513.249,And Exhibit A that it is not unconscionable here consists of the two opinions of the Federal Circuit.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1517.701,1527.639,"--Well, I mean, the very fact that the Court says and limits its ruling to where the government is not the moving party, I mean if the government really -- if the Court--"
2010.09-1298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1527.639,1528.258,It didn't limit it.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1549.569,1549.836,--Well--
2010.09-1298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1549.836,1551.254,--which I think you do want me to read something.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1551.254,1551.688,--I think -- right.
2010.09-1298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1559.544,1560.044,Okay.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1560.044,1563.746,--an impressive prima facie showing of a defense.
2010.09-1298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1577.22,1587.544,"Just before we get there, that showing was based on the court's in camera review of quite a bit of already confidential information, correct?"
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1587.544,1590.663,--And the nonprivileged information that it had available to it.
2010.09-1298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1590.663,1591.346,And the nonprivileged information.
2010.09-1298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1599.669,1609.441,"Well, it recognized that it terminated the discovery early; and actually, it did -- it terminated discovery very early, and -- and there are whole programs that we know nothing about."
2010.09-1298,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1616.464,1617.747,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1627.402,1630.354,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1667.479,1674.133,"Do we have -- we've gotten to this point in the dispute because you say they're at fault, they say you're at fault."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1686.275,1687.993,"Well, for several reasons."
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1696.03,1699.967,"Well, only because you altered the legal status quo."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1706.621,1708.321,"--I disagree, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1724.332,1728.534,Isn't that -- isn't that the affirmative step with the contracting officer saying there's a default?
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1728.534,1735.038,"--Well, it's certainly an affirmative step under the terms of the contract but it is not an affirmative step of the Federal court."
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1736.407,1738.157,It's an affirmative step of the Federal Government.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1742.478,1747.198,"--Undoubtedly the case, and those are the terms under the contract to which they agreed."
2010.09-1298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1763.391,1782.621,"Am I correct to interpret what you just said to mean that you think this case should be decided under the basic principle of Reynolds, that the party that seeks the affirmative relief -- seeks affirmative relief from the court is the -- is the party that bears the burden involving the invocation of the state-secrets privilege?"
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1788.857,1789.174,Absolutely.
2010.09-1298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1828.749,1835.135,"Could I -- could I -- I'm interrupting Justice Alito, because you answered his question very quickly."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1841.122,1842.205,"--Oh, no."
2010.09-1298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1842.655,1844.824,So is that what your answer to him--
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1844.824,1845.341,"--No, we--"
2010.09-1298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1845.341,1851.228,--which is that he asked you whether we apply Reynolds; you didn't say which part of Reynolds.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1858.917,1860.701,"--Oh, absolutely not, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.873,1873.307,Let's talk about moving party.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1909.664,1910.048,--Justice--
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1910.048,1914.551,That seems to me the moving party in the -- in the context of a contract.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1914.551,1917.003,"--Justice Scalia, I think it's important to add to your definition"
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1924.823,1929.227,Reynolds was talking about that because that was the fact situation in Reynolds.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1952.241,1962.531,"--I don't think, Justice, that's what either Reynolds is getting at or what this Court's subsequent decisions about a state of uncertainty in the law and what the role of the Federal courts is getting at."
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1995.919,2000.554,--It wasn't the undoubted right of the government before the lawsuit was filed.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2010.262,2013.38,"--Justice Scalia, let me read to you the contract to which they agreed."
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2042.916,2044.332,I'm sorry.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2045.116,2047.284,--Joint Appendix page 342.
2010.09-1298,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2059.609,2070.547,"I have this -- this question about due process: The components of the due process analysis, it seems to me, are what is reasonable, what's necessary in the case, what's unconscionable."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2086.859,2089.211,I guess I would say two things.
2010.09-1298,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2090.211,2094.079,"Assuming that we're -- we apply Reynolds, which--"
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2094.079,2094.713,--Right.
2010.09-1298,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2149.432,2160.14,"--That -- that just restates the question of what -- what do you do if you apply the Reynolds principle to this case, and they would say, well, you could have put it in your contract, too, and I think that's almost a wash."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2160.14,2180.035,"Well, I don't think it comes out as a wash, Justice Kennedy, because I think the contract is undoubtedly clear that in order to challenge the -- the decision of the contracting officer about a default termination, they have to come into Federal court and invoke affirmatively, seek affirmative judicial relief from the Federal court, to change the world."
2010.09-1298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2181.054,2189.307,Am I -- am I right that this contract did specify certain information that the government agreed to give the Petitioner?
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2189.307,2190.575,That is correct.
2010.09-1298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2193.277,2199.448,Mr. Phillips said the reason they couldn't specify this information is they didn't know what it was.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2199.448,2200.481,Yes.
2010.09-1298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2200.481,2203.4,They -- they didn't know what -- it was secret information.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2205.502,2215.441,"I have to say, it is a very odd thing to bid on a highly -- a multi-billion-dollar contract on the assumption that they are going to get some technology that they haven't even specified."
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.89,2248.948,"No, but they -- they claim that you knew that it was impossible to do what they contracted with you to do at the weight of plane which they promised to come across with."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2256.768,2258.636,"Justice Scalia, let me say two things."
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.088,2267.992,"I don't know whether that's true or not, and we're never going to know it's true, because you came in and blew the whistle and said: State-secrets privilege."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2267.992,2268.425,--Two things.
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2293.56,2296.012,Are you saying it was not impossible to do it at that weight?
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2296.012,2303.498,"--I'm saying -- well, at the initial weight, we thought it was impossible and warned them as such, and that's -- those are the citations in the government's brief."
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2304.867,2307.986,At the weight contracted for?
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2307.986,2315.306,"--And then we -- at the weight contracted for, we had warned them that it wasn't, and then later we relaxed that weight specification."
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2332.435,2333.535,Are you ever the--
2010.09-1298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2333.535,2334.304,"General, what would happen--"
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2334.304,2336.837,--Are you ever the moving party in the Court of Claims?
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2336.837,2338.005,Sure.
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2341.29,2344.659,"Well, on a counterclaim, but that obviously means somebody else is the moving party."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2345.775,2346.444,That's correct.
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2349.479,2352.931,"If somebody wants to get money -- if somebody wants to get money from the Federal Government, they have to go to the Court of Claims, right?"
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2352.931,2353.431,--That's correct.
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2353.431,2356.3,"So this is a pretty convenient rule for you, right?"
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2356.3,2361.121,"Well, it's a convenient rule, Mr. Chief Justice, that they agreed to when they signed the contract."
2010.09-1298,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2380.599,2383.633,But you have the burden of -- you had the burden of proof on the issue of default.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2384.95,2390.787,"--We had the burden of proof on default, but not on superior knowledge, the precise question here."
2010.09-1298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2408.216,2420.557,"Do you agree there is -- do you agree that there is nothing between -- I think Justice Scalia was asking Mr. Phillips, why can't we just say, let's -- all bets are off, everybody go home with what they have."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2435.566,2438.701,--I do agree that that is -- that's the way the contract is written.
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2456.579,2457.596,I don't care how the contract's written.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2472.386,2477.873,"Justice Scalia, I am saying leave the parties where they are under the terms of the contract."
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.956,2479.589,You're--
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2479.589,2492.966,"--Well, that -- Justice Scalia, I don't think that the Federal court should be in the business of micromanaging under the Due Process Clause in a contractual situation with parties that can protect themselves ex ante very easily."
2010.09-1298,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2493.766,2497.935,We can -- we can do it as a member -- as a matter of the law of contracts.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2534.274,2547.85,"--So even if you followed that reasoning -- and I don't think you should, for a reason I'll explain in a moment -- but they would still lose, because they still bear the burden of proof and persuasion on superior knowledge, the defense, the excuse, that's at issue in this case."
2010.09-1298,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2564.745,2577.969,"So just to make sure I understand your argument, suppose that state secrets had prevented you from being able to prove your default claim, that you were unable to make that showing because of state secrets."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2579.737,2582.856,Unable to make the showing in--
2010.09-1298,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2582.856,2583.439,That--
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2583.439,2584.689,--in Federal court?
2010.09-1298,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2584.689,2594.664,"--That's right, that the secrets that you wanted to protect were actually the -- the key to your proving that there was a default."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2594.664,2610.591,"Well, in that circumstance, again, the -- I think the case would be dismissed, because they would be coming in and seeking affirmative judicial relief to void the contracting officer's decision and to get whatever damages they want and--"
2010.09-1298,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2610.591,2615.16,"Let me make sure I understand, because that really does sound like a tails you win, heads you win, whatever."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2625.016,2639.11,"--I think -- I think that that would be -- the general proposition is if the Federal court can't know one way or another who's right and who's wrong, it shouldn't grant affirmative relief to a party, and that's--"
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2639.11,2643.062,"--To a moving party, and you are never the moving party."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2643.962,2646.58,"--Well, again, Justice Scalia, that's the contract they signed."
2010.09-1298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2649.413,2650.182,"--Counsel, you can't--"
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2650.182,2650.898,--we didn't have the ability--
2010.09-1298,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2650.898,2651.814,Did the contract--
2010.09-1298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2651.814,2652.381,"--Counsel, you can't--"
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2652.381,2653.048,Justice Kennedy--
2010.09-1298,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2653.048,2656.802,"--Did the contract contain the term ""moving party""?"
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2656.802,2665.372,"--The contract didn't say ""moving party"", but it did say who had to come into Federal court in order to challenge the decision of the contracting officer."
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2669.11,2670.626,--Now Justice Sotomayor.
2010.09-1298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2670.626,2671.426,--That's what I don't understand.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2702.914,2708.985,"Justice Sotomayor, this is a very important question, and I think that that's the impression left by their briefs and it's wrong."
2010.09-1298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2736.101,2736.687,--I'm sorry.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2740.372,2741.855,"--Well, I think it is."
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2796.323,2797.59,It's granting nobody relief.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2800.708,2802.125,"--Justice Scalia, we have no--"
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2802.125,2805.827,"We don't know what the answer is, so go away; we leave you where you are."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2806.177,2809.731,"--Justice -- Justice Scalia, we have no problem with a go-away rule."
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2829.291,2834.595,That assumes that the contracting officer's termination for default was valid.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2843.951,2854.843,"Justice Scalia, that seems to me -- that is affirmatively using the power of the Court to set aside the contracting officer's decision, which is what I think is forbidden by Reynolds."
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2878.189,2881.826,How would you write -- you keep saying these are sophisticated parties.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2886.111,2887.478,"Oh, I think it would be very simple."
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2896.686,2899.002,Do you think your client would ever agree to something like that?
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2899.002,2900.621,--Do I think the government would?
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2900.621,2901.104,Yes.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2901.104,2917.833,"Well, I think if they don't, Mr. Chief Justice, that underscores the problem with their argument, because they are saying: Read the contract precisely this way, to eliminate terminations for default and convert them all into terminations for convenience when the state-secrets privilege is being invoked."
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2925.736,2927.605,So how do they write the contract?
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2935.294,2936.961,"--Well -- well, I think there are other ways."
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2948.269,2952.071,This wouldn't be a problem in an alternative dispute resolution because that's not a court?
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2952.071,2960.326,"--Well, it might depend on -- you might have it within the military, you know, the equivalent of that -- in the Tenet v. Doe, you might have panels like the helms panel."
2010.09-1298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3006.704,3007.906,So it isn't -- isn't a big practical problem.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3068.678,3069.112,Sure.
2010.09-1298,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3141.239,3150.928,"Well, in the whole law of contracts you could say, oh, the contracting parties could have put this down, anticipatory breach, we don't need to have rules on that, the parties could have negotiated."
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3152.795,3164.735,"Well, I do think that with respect to this and this -- you know, a thousands and thousands of page contract, I think this specific set of issues could have been worked out in advance, and I do think was worked out in advance."
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3204.812,3206.597,Why is that unliquidated?
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3210.215,3212.667,Because the contract specified two payment streams.
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3235.931,3236.533,What's the other?
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3239.568,3240.668,--The 1.2--
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3240.668,3241.451,--that he's also asking for?
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3241.451,3243.687,--The 1.25 billion that he's seeking on top of--
2010.09-1298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3243.687,3244.503,Right.
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3244.503,3255.177,"--keeping the 1.35 billion, as I understand it is costs, is extra costs incurred under the contract above and beyond the $4.8 billion that was in the initial contract."
2010.09-1298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3255.177,3266.468,"General, do you have the citation to that footnote you referred to in the 602 -- 605b?"
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3267.634,3281.942,"It's page 32, and I would also refer the Court to the court of appeals appendix page 19567, which is the page of the contract itself that incorporates the provision."
2010.09-1298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3310.377,3318.9,--So your view is that -- that the complaint did not stay their obligation to pay you; that provision required them to pay you--
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3318.9,3320.317,--That's correct.
2010.09-1298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3320.317,3322.869,--the unliquidated sums?
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3322.869,3323.352,That's right.
2010.09-1298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3351.086,3361.477,"If you're right about that, the government's absolute right, could you withhold it from other contracts of these contractors?"
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3361.477,3362.46,That's absolutely right.
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3381.473,3386.359,So you get the extra money without having to go to court because then they would have to go to court and challenge your offset?
2010.09-1298,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3386.359,3389.794,"And again, Mr. Chief Justice, that's the contract to which they signed."
2010.09-1298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3393.448,3394.114,"Thank you, General."
2010.09-1298,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3396.65,3401.268,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1298,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3482.803,3483.437,But you say--
2010.09-1298,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3483.437,3486.672,--but we're not going to go the extra mile and say it's a termination for convenience.
