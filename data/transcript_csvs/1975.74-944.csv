1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,204.223,205.496,"No, I do not sir."

1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,212.196,215.441,On -- from the language of the decree itself which I will come to.
1975.74-944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,291.509,300.315,"But right there, Mr. Pickering, do you say that the Associated Press dispatch tells the reader the same thing that the Time Magazine --"
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,300.315,301.127,"No, it does not."
1975.74-944,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,428.172,430.961,Did Time have asked for the Court record?
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,430.961,432.759,"Time did not have at that point, Your Honor."

1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,434.359,436.35,"Subsequently, subsequently."
1975.74-944,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,436.35,444.312,"I do not understand why the -- your -- the Time contacts down, they did not go, look for what they asked for?"
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,444.312,446.933,The -- it was a Saturday.
1975.74-944,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,474.709,477.975,What was the source of Mr. Duncan’s quote of the judge?
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,477.975,478.513,What?
1975.74-944,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,478.513,484.6,What was the source of Mr. Duncan’s quote of the judge?
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,484.6,487.562,The divorce decree itself as report --
1975.74-944,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,487.562,490.983,"I am looking at the bottom of page 5, Judge James (Voice Overlap)"
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,490.983,491.872,Not commented.
1975.74-944,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,491.872,493.816,And you have an -- in the quotes.
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,493.816,494.934,Right.
1975.74-944,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,494.934,496.703,Where did Mr. Duncan get that quote?
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,496.703,516.325,"That came from, I believe the Associated Press dispatch and it is an exact quote from the language of the divorce decree itself which is plaintiff’s exhibit 2 and appears in the record at page 523."
1975.74-944,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,516.325,518.119,But you have told us already that Mr. (Voice Overlap)
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,518.119,518.616,Time did not have.
1975.74-944,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,518.616,520.58,(Voice Overlap) have not seen the divorce decree itself.
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,520.58,521.561,That is correct.
1975.74-944,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,521.561,527.017,So my Brother Brennan’s question is where did Mr. Duncan get this quote?
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,527.017,532.819,"That quote, as far as I know, as far as the record shows, came from the Associated Press dispatch."
1975.74-944,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,532.819,540.244,"In other words, he did not do anything in Florida for the Time that Time could not have done just reading that AP ticker in New York, is that right?"
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,540.244,541.115,That is correct.
1975.74-944,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,571.367,578.396,What time -- when did Time Magazine first see the decree?
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,578.396,579.444,The record does not establish --
1975.74-944,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,579.444,582.076,"After the lawsuit was filed, did it not?"
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,582.076,582.58,What?
1975.74-944,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,582.58,586.175,After lawsuit was filed?
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,586.175,587.741,"I think that is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-944,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,592.881,593.431,But what --
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,593.431,598.38,It was sometime after the article -- long after the article perhaps that they got a copy --
1975.74-944,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,598.38,620.482,"(Voice Overlap) cautious, editor ask a normal cautious reporter or stringer that I want the inside information on a Court decree, would not both of them assume that somebody would go to the guess what, Court, did you see it?"
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,621.968,622.28,No.
1975.74-944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,679.709,699.896,"You started out earlier, now you are at the point where you -- you are going to explain Time Magazine article was accurate, an accurate reflection of the Court decree and you say in your brief that the judge actually found adultery?"
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,699.896,709.566,"What I say is that that is a reasonable, that is an accurate, fairly and accurately reports what the divorce decree says."
1975.74-944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.511,713.673,"If you are right, well it does not make much difference so, where you got the --"
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,713.673,714.078,Exactly.
1975.74-944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,714.078,716.744,"But if it is accurate, and I suppose."
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,721.604,727.485,"In the first place, the article does not say Mr. Justice that she was found guilty of adultery."
1975.74-944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,737.432,739.447,(Voice Overlap) How does an ordinary reader read that?
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,739.447,739.94,What?
1975.74-944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,739.94,741.955,"Does an ordinary reader read it in any other way, that is what (Voice Overlap)"
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,741.955,745.553,"No, I say it is a matter of semantics but I wanted to be absolutely precise."
1975.74-944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,745.553,748.894,(Voice Overlap) That is what your stringer reported to you.
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,748.894,751.847,The stringer said the technical grounds for divorce.
1975.74-944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.847,753.349,Were adultery?
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,753.349,754.279,That is correct.
1975.74-944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,754.841,757.662,What you had -- that was what reported to you?
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,757.662,759.128,Let us look at the final judgment.
1975.74-944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,759.128,759.598,So let me ask you this --
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,759.598,760.541,The -- page 526.
1975.74-944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,760.541,762.554,You say your stringer was correct too then?
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,762.554,763.252,Yes.
1975.74-944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,763.252,765.917,Alright.
1975.74-944,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,765.917,773.82,"Mr. Pickering, before you go on, what is the relationship or was the relationship between the stringer and Time?"

1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,784.245,785.653,Paid on a piece-work basis.
1975.74-944,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,797.293,801.881,Does the record show what his employment background -- what he did for a regular living?
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,801.881,803.07,Yes.
1975.74-944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,832.598,846.894,"Does the record show whether he read the Miami Herald of December 16 which -- in which the article itself said this, “The judge added that he discounted much of the testimony in the case as unreliable.”"
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,846.894,847.347,No.
1975.74-944,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,920.071,921.693,What does that mean?
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,921.693,926.114,That again -- that illustrates the difficulty Your Honor of --
1975.74-944,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,926.114,928.024,But does that mean that she is guilty of adultery?
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,930.565,933.516,"Not clear, not clear."
1975.74-944,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,950.793,956.762,(Voice Overlap) they go on and define I gather domestication from Chestnut v. Chestnut? (Voice Overlap)
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,956.762,959.965,They refer that the parties were not domesticated --
1975.74-944,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,959.965,969.872,"When the bride and groom are both devoid of a yen for domestication, the marital bark puts out to sea with its jib pointed to the rocks.[Laughter]"
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,969.872,972.607,But the -- the final -- you get to the adjudication --
1975.74-944,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,972.607,978.659,"I just want to know Mr. Pickering, are you suggesting that, that there is anything in that which imports a finding of that -- that the previous ground is on (Inaudible)?"
1975.74-944,0,32340,john_h_pickering,,978.659,979.002,No.
1975.74-944,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1009.837,1021.515,"But typically, in a pleading, you may seek a formal relief and urge ten different reasons for and the fact that the Court grants your prayer does not mean that it is affirming all ten grounds that you sought."
1975.74-944,1,22056,edna_l_caruso,,2307.569,2310.734,Thank you.
1975.74-944,2,32340,john_h_pickering,,3808.973,3809.373,"Yes, just a few --"
1975.74-944,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3809.373,3813.909,Before you get started let me just ask you one question that you could handle briefly.
1975.74-944,2,32340,john_h_pickering,,3858.856,3866.991,"No, Your Honor because I think it was made very clear in the testimony that that absence of a check mark signified absolutely nothing."
1975.74-944,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3870.048,3871.51,That was her testimony?
1975.74-944,2,32340,john_h_pickering,,3871.51,3872.492,That was her testimony.
1975.74-944,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3872.492,3894.42,"But having already testified that her regular habit was to put a check over every word that she had checked and then the document was put before the jury and did not have a check over adultery, do you think that would permit the jury to accept the documentary evidence rather than her explanation?"
1975.74-944,2,32340,john_h_pickering,,3894.42,3895.512,That is possible.
1975.74-944,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3946.802,3948.328,There were several other words over with (Voice Overlap) no check mark?
1975.74-944,2,32340,john_h_pickering,,3948.328,3955.076,"There were several other words Your Honor, there were not a check mark over (Voice Overlap) and if you will look at plaintiff’s exhibit --"
1975.74-944,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3955.076,3957.574,Were there any keywords in these definitions?
1975.74-944,2,32340,john_h_pickering,,3957.574,3960.437,"Some other words, yes."
1975.74-944,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3960.437,3963.384,Was there only one keyword in this litigation and that the word that (Voice Overlap).
1975.74-944,2,32340,john_h_pickering,,3963.384,3973.278,"There is only one keyword as far as her suit is concerned, but in making an accurate statement to the general public, Mr. Chief Justice, there were a number of keywords."
1975.74-944,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3997.822,4000.011,But there you are talking about a malice standard.
1975.74-944,2,32340,john_h_pickering,,4003.304,4004.223,That is correct.
1975.74-944,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4109.004,4110.082,Thank you Mr. Pickering.
