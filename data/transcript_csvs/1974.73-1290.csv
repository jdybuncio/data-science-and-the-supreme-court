1974.73-1290,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,40.03,We'll hear arguments next in United States against ITT Continental Baking company.
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,43.341,46.912,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1974.73-1290,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,217.924,231.79,"Mr. Friedman, do you think that, that provision indicates that the court felt the holding of the other acquisitions was not improper, when it so specifically spelled out Armour?"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,231.79,234.437,I am sorry Mr. Chief Justice this is in the Commission complaint.
1974.73-1290,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,234.437,236.24,Alright.
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,236.24,257.386,"I don't think that there was let me say, there was, at the time that they entered into the consent order, there was also an appendix that the parties signed which they said would provide a basis upon which the Commission could determine whether it was in the public interest to enter this order."
1974.73-1290,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,843.709,850.341,How many dollars would have been involved here if the government -- if the District Court and the Court of Appeals had watched your claim completely?
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,850.341,865.546,"Well, if the court gave us the $1,000 a day for which we asked it would have come to better than $1 million, but of course we don't know what penalty would have been -- the penalty would have been if the court had give $200 a day --"
1974.73-1290,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,865.546,866.859,"But you asked for a 1,000?"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,866.859,867.658,"We ask for a 1,000 --"
1974.73-1290,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,867.658,871.592,"And did you ask for a 1,000 for each one of these acquisitions?"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,871.592,873.602,"Yes we asked, there were three counts each count --"
1974.73-1290,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,873.602,876.439,"So that's a $6,000 a day for the --"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,876.439,878.718,"$3,000 a day there."
1974.73-1290,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,878.718,879.526,"Yeah, I beg your pardon."
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,879.526,887.228,"$3,000 a day for a period from 1965 to 1966 up to the filing of the complaint in 1970."
1974.73-1290,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,889.358,890.345,Well over a million dollar.
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,890.345,896.311,"Well over a million dollars, but we do think Mr. Justice, that that's what Congress intended in the penalty provision."
1974.73-1290,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,896.311,900.852,"And as you point out, of course to the Court, the $1,000 is a maximum."
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,900.852,911.899,"Well, the $1,000 is the maximum, that's all we ask, but $5,000 is the maximum and not infrequently the courts when they do access penalties give less than the government asks for."
1974.73-1290,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,911.899,913.591,Thousand would have been a maximum in this case.
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,913.591,914.502,"In this case, yes."
1974.73-1290,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,915.945,931.899,"Mr. Friedman, has the Federal Trade Commission imposing daily penalties for comparable infringements as uses of orders consent decrees of this kind over the past years?"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,931.899,938.528,"Well, fortunately Mr. Justice, this is a relatively infringement of commerce, the violations."
1974.73-1290,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,965.265,968.087,"In this case, it was Eighth Circuit --"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,968.087,974.172,"I don't know which came first but they were relatively simultaneous, I don't know exactly when the Eighth Circuit case --"
1974.73-1290,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,974.172,976.135,"So far as you know, these are the only two cases?"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,976.135,982.992,"As far as I know, these are the only cases involving daily penalties with respect to these acquisition type orders."
1974.73-1290,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,986.874,1005.081,"Is there any regulation under Commission or any other means by which authority might be notified that the Commission took this interpretation of the statue, that is that daily penalties were appropriate when an acquisition was made?"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1005.081,1016.923,"The Commission's position, the Commission does not give ordinarily give notice to parties of this fact and I think the theory of it is Mr. Justice is that the parties are subject to the order."
1974.73-1290,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1055.998,1067.415,I understand that but it does seem to me as evidence by the fact that we are here today that it's arguable whether the statute means what the Commission says it means.
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1072.364,1073.954,"No, there is no regulation."
1974.73-1290,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1113.618,1116.647,"That would indicate that the Tenth Circuit case came first, if it's --"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1116.647,1120.166,"Oh yes, the Court of Appeals decision in the Tenth Circuit came first."
1974.73-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.526,1139.276,"Well, it wouldn't make it meaningless, wouldn't make the acquisition order meaningless because I take it that divestiture is an appropriate remedy for a violation of an acquisition order?"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1139.276,1149.947,"I would think so Mr. Justice and since this case, the Federal Trade Commission Act has been amended specifically to provide for equitable remedies in penalty suits."
1974.73-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1161.02,1161.878,Define penalty?
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1161.878,1166.423,"Define penalty, yes and of course, divestiture isn't a penalty, divestiture is merely from needs --"
1974.73-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1166.423,1168.35,But it hurts.
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1168.35,1173.255,"It hurts, yes but I don't think that the fact that someone is subject --"
1974.73-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1173.255,1181.326,"Well, one of the theory of that divestiture for violation of an order; is it because continuing it, and to hold it violates the order?"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1181.326,1187.448,"It seems to me, it must be Mr. Justice, it must be because what you are trying to do is undo the violation."
1974.73-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1193.269,1196.998,Because holding is continuous to violate the order?
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1196.998,1198.184,"I would think so, I would think so."
1974.73-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.382,1218.059,"But suppose if all of it's taken and changing a couple of words in your consent decree, is then to make it clear --"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1218.059,1218.266,Well --
1974.73-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.266,1219.302,-- now on --
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1219.302,1223.163,"Well, there's a problem with that Mr. Justice from now on --"
1974.73-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1223.163,1224.559,That they won't consent.
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1224.559,1227.459,"They won't consent, and there are 67 of them."
1974.73-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.007,1233.345,But since now that they know what your position is they shouldn't consent anyway.
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1233.345,1242.912,"[Attempt to Laughter] And some of -- by the way, some of these orders are not consent orders, there are numbers we have set up in our Appendix, 10 or 12 of them that were orders ended in trial and litigation."
1974.73-1290,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1242.912,1256.253,But your view of the matter Mr. Friedman is that it's something like a Contempt Order of $1000 a day and you give the contemptnor the opportunity to terminate it whenever he wants to.
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1256.253,1258.914,"Yes, I think the Second Circuit --"
1974.73-1290,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1258.914,1263.431,"But everybody understands that in a contempt order, without any ambiguity, isn't that not so?"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1263.431,1269.51,"Yes, the Commission's position, the Commission is not included in these orders, the words or retention."
1974.73-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1275.928,1280.062,"Well, I think the issue here is whether it's continuing violation."
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1280.062,1280.933,Yes.
1974.73-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1280.933,1286.984,Because if it is a continuing violation of a statute is perfectly clear that each day is a separate violation?
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1286.984,1290.415,"Yes, that's the question, that's the question in this case."
1974.73-1290,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1353.358,1365.072,"But the judge on the other hand could accept to his theory and still fairly, flatly defended on to this, I think may give $5 a day."
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1365.072,1388.112,"That might be an abusive discretion, I don't know Mr. Justice, but certainly, the judge has considerable discretion and all we are saying, all we are saying is that the judge should exercise that discretion, should not attempt to limit, not attempt to limit the penalties to the single $5000 and view just the acquisition as the offense."
1974.73-1290,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1510.962,1514.481,"Yes, whether the continued holding violated the consent order?"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1514.481,1514.873,That's right.
1974.73-1290,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1514.873,1516.498,"The courts below held no, it didn't."
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1516.498,1517.005,That's right.
1974.73-1290,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1517.005,1524.832,"But Mr. Friedman, supposing I commit the offense of robbery and take $100 from you."
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1530.603,1534.17,"No, Mr. Justice, but I think that's a different situation, I think."
1974.73-1290,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1534.17,1545.131,"Well, and the court could require me to make restitution just as you in answer to Justice White said that divestiture can be regarded, even though robbery is a one time offense?"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1545.131,1548.963,"Yes, but the restitution it seems to me, that's a different thing."
1974.73-1290,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1569.996,1572.484,It dealt with it in terms of acquisitions?
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1572.484,1586.905,"It dealt with it in terms of acquisition, but we think, inherent in the ban on acquisition is a further ban upon retaining any assets acquired in violation of that prohibition, that's what we think it is."
1974.73-1290,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1627.659,1643.768,"Did I understand you correctly, in answer in response to Mr. Justice White, that this consent decree could have been made so clear and unambiguous that there wouldn't be any question to litigate?"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1643.768,1644.559,Well I --
1974.73-1290,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1644.559,1646.786,Except the amount?
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1646.786,1648.431,"Well, it could have been."
1974.73-1290,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1665.415,1676.716,"But did you not give some intimation or it was that from other some other source, I got the intimation that if it was made that clear, you wouldn't get consent decrees and --"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1676.716,1678.812,"No, I did not say, I did not --"
1974.73-1290,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1678.812,1679.523,You did not intimate that?
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1679.523,1685.956,"I think, perhaps Mr. Justice White suggested that defendants might not consent, but we think that this is what this order means."
1974.73-1290,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1723.8,1732.609,Do we have an issue here about the construction of the document according to the authorship?
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1732.609,1734.765,"I don't think so, Mr. Justice."
1974.73-1290,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1734.765,1752.946,"The only consent decrees I ever had to deal with, except for the Government, were drafted and all of them had to do with, both for government and otherwise were drafted by the government much like a union contracts submitted?"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1752.946,1761.286,"I don't know how this was drafted but I suspect as is true in most of these judgments, there was a great deal of give and take."
1974.73-1290,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1762.228,1765.283,But on this part of the decree?
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1765.283,1767.589,"No, I don't think there was any dispute."
1974.73-1290,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1781.082,1784.21,But in any event your point is there is no ambiguity to resolve?
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1784.21,1788.373,"That's right, we think fairly read the word acquisition includes retention."
1974.73-1290,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1904.458,1909.689,"Mr. Friedman, isn't that precisely what the government did in the Audi case the last session?"
1974.73-1290,0,23500,friedman,,1909.689,1927.098,"As I recollect Mr. Justice in the Audi case, it was contended that the question presented was broad enough to cover the various points that the government made, that was my recollection."
1974.73-1290,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1927.098,1931.134,That was the contention.
1974.73-1290,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1931.134,1936.338,As I am sure your opposition is contending here.
1974.73-1290,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1936.338,1937.529,Mr. Schafer.
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,1937.529,1941.664,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1290,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2060.313,2069.636,Just how do you separate the purpose and objective of the consent decree from the underlying statutes on which it would --
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2069.636,2087.936,"Well Mr. Chief Justice, what Armour teaches, what Atlantic Refining teaches and what Hughes teaches, is that you look at the document and as written, it's a contract composed between two opposing parties designed to do nothing but to eliminate the litigation."
1974.73-1290,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2097.106,2114.176,"Even when you construe contracts, even if the lawyer, the draftsman haven't been careful enough to put in all the necessary desirable preambles, it doesn't stop the court from looking at the totality to interpret the language of the contract, does it?"
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2114.176,2125.111,"If there is ambiguity Mr. Chief Justice in a contract, that's true of course under Standard Contract Law, it is permissible for the court to look at the background of the negotiations."
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2142.443,2153.71,"Are you suggesting that fair reading the consent decree by defendant would be that you can make an acquisition, violate the order and at the maximum it will cost you $5000."
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2153.71,2155.709,"On this decree, that's the fair reading --"
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.709,2157.56,Sole price for violating the decree.
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2157.56,2161.404,"No, not the sole price, because as you pointed out, divestiture is a very real price."
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2161.404,2166.284,"As far as the fine is concerned, it's $5000 price, that's all for violation?"
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2166.284,2167.757,"That would be true, that would be true."
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2178.215,2189.892,"I take it, you would probably also argue that if both of you had known this is what the decree was supposed to mean, the government would have written it that way in the first place, they would have --"
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2189.892,2196.609,"Unless they're trying to play tricks on us, I would assume that they would write it that way, yes."
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2224.837,2227.334,(Inaudible)
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2227.334,2232.78,"It was denied, the government did not make assuring warning divestiture in the judgment of this Court."
1974.73-1290,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2232.78,2237.553,"Could the government do that again in this very case, and now make a better shot and go back?"
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.553,2239.626,Can they bring an independent action?
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2239.626,2243.882,"Oh, surely they can charge these with the Section 7 violations, no question about that, yes."
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2243.882,2247.455,And theoretically they can make a difference?
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2247.455,2254.432,That's quite right and they are arguing and been sustained in the courts below that they don't even have to bring Section 7 in order to ask for divestiture.
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2254.432,2263.618,"Why can't they try that over again, I guess they tried out the -- that doesn't your matter, it's important to do."
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2263.618,2277.267,"Well, I don't know if you really would say Mr. Justice White that they really tried it out, they claim they were denied but they never made -- in the District Court's judgment they never made a showing on divestiture, they had it in their complaint."
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.267,2282.565,They got a Section 7 (Inaudible)
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2282.565,2287.628,"I haven't thought it through, but I think that you would have different issues, I think you would have different issues."
1974.73-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2330.879,2336.051,"But the bakeries acquired, agreed not to bake anything more of their own, didn't they?"
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2336.051,2357.883,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that comes out of a stipulation we agreed, the lawyers brought up stipulation to resolve this dispute and we agreed to stipulate that it was the understanding of both sides that those former producers would stop selling and what that simply meant was that we knew when we took on the obligations to supply them that they were no longer going to supply themselves."
1974.73-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2359.129,2362.098,It was a better deal for them to get it from you then to keep making the --
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2362.098,2367.706,The economics of this industry are that the small producer is increasingly non competitive.
1974.73-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2392.369,2397.706,Where does Continental make the bread that it supplies to Missoula and Durango and Cheyenne?
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2397.706,2405.778,"The Missoula bread came out at Spokane bakery, Spokane, Washington, the bread for Durango and Cheyenne came out of it's Denver bakery."
1974.73-1290,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2429.318,2439.251,"Mr. John H. Schafer, did the agreements with Continental prohibit these three smaller companies from producing bread in the future?"
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2439.251,2440.415,"No, it did not Mr. Justice Powell."
1974.73-1290,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2440.415,2441.579,"They were free to do that, isn't it?"
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2441.579,2443.421,"They were free to do that, yes."
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2456.54,2462.995,You did stipulate that the understanding was that the companies would not continue to produce?
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2462.995,2465.943,"Yeah, we knew they were no longer going to be producing, they told us that."
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2465.943,2469.656,And that was the understanding -- the fact it may not have been explicit?
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2469.656,2473.669,It was not an understanding in a contract bargained for sense Mr. Justice White.
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2480.243,2486.945,"You had – if you would have thought they were -- if you had it -- unless you had thought, they were not going to make bread, you thought (Inaudible)"
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2486.945,2491.385,They would have never had no interest whatever in buying Continental bread if they are going to bake their own bread.
1974.73-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2491.385,2495.915,Would a resumption of production on their part been actionable so far as Continental was concerned?
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2495.915,2498.649,"Not at all, not at all."
1974.73-1290,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2498.649,2498.975,Mr. Schafer --
1974.73-1290,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2498.975,2504.141,Did Continental agree to supply all their requirements?
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2504.141,2506.035,It did agree to supply all their requirements.
1974.73-1290,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2521.84,2530.916,"Mr. Schafer, you have mentioned the economics of the bread business. One of these companies had sales of $300,000 a year."
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2538.017,2541.468,"Well, today it would be a substantial loss."
1974.73-1290,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2545.251,2546.106,I understand.
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2546.106,2551.012,And it would depend upon the economies of scale that he could achieve in his producing plan.
1974.73-1290,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2591.454,2598.671,Mr. Schafer do you think the Eighth Circuit's Beatrice Food case is at all distinguishable from your case?
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2598.671,2604.453,"I think that the underlying issue of violation is much – is clear, relatively clear there Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1974.73-1290,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2619.27,2620.043,-- that issue.
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2620.043,2622.191,It's a clear conflict Mr. Justice Stewart on that issue.
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2721.903,2734.404,"If you don't sell it to the junk man and don't scrap it, and you continue to hold it and operate, I suppose that you might be entitled and maybe forced to divest?"
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2734.404,2736.26,"That's true, that's true."
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2736.26,2743.271,"On the theory that you are -- at the time of the divestiture, you are still injuring competition."
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2743.271,2745.452,"In the penalty action, you mean we are not in Section 7 case."
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2745.452,2746.901,I mean Section 7.
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2746.901,2762.363,"Yes, I think that's right, you are still injuring because the act that you committed back in 1917, if you will, the act that you committed at the time of suit can be said to be causing an adverse impact on competition."
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.363,2775.665,"Divestiture is normally not ordered if at the time of the order, there's the -- nobody is being hurt?"
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2775.665,2777.827,"Well, I suppose there is no violation."
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2777.827,2786.469,"Well, my question is what's the theory on which a divestiture is ordered?"
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2786.469,2804.72,"As I understand the theory which comes of course out of this Court's decisions that divestiture is almost mandatory, where a violation of Section 7 is found, divestiture is virtually mandatory, because that's the only hope you have of reconstituting the industry before the illegal act occurred."
1974.73-1290,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2804.72,2814.254,"And the divestiture is the antonym of acquisition, that's the way you unring the bell of acquisition is by divestiture?"
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2814.254,2819.006,"That's the good word, yes, that's my understanding of the concept."
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2819.006,2829.961,"But you don't order divestiture at the time the remedy question comes up, there is no longer an injury to competition?"
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2829.961,2834.835,"That may be, I am having hard time understanding how that could then be a violation Mr. Justice White, if there is no --"
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.835,2836.972,Well it was at the time?
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,2836.972,2838.911,"Well, at the time of suit."
1974.73-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3177.414,3181.593,"But it says our Strunk opinion is wrong too, doesn't it?"
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,3181.593,3186.552,It says the Strunk opinion and others can be read in a number of ways.
1974.73-1290,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3283.984,3285.891,How about our control of our own docket.
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,3303.49,3306.055,"No, I am not Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3354.24,3357.193,[Inaudible]
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,3357.193,3360.972,"Well, they are important -- the question is Mr. Justice White, whether or not a --"
1974.73-1290,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3360.972,3363.478,[Inaudible] you decide it on your own --
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,3363.478,3365.138,Oh yes!
1974.73-1290,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3478.948,3488.387,Mr. Schafer is there any difference between you and Mr. Friedman as to the maximum amount of the possible penalty on the Government's theory?
1974.73-1290,1,32923,john_h_schafer,,3488.387,3492.565,"In their complaint they asked for thousand dollars a day, Mr. Justice Powell."
1974.73-1290,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3530.739,3532.027,Thank you Mr. Schafer.
