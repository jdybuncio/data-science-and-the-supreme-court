1984.84-9,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,We will hear arguments next in Massachusettse Mutual Life v. Russell.
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,12.308,14.943,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,179.549,189.689,"Are you suggestion, Mr. Nolan, that under 409 the duties imposed run only for the plan, not for beneficiaries?"
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,189.689,192.791,"--I am suggesting that, yes, Justice Brennan."
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,207.235,212.705,"Now, it talks about duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchapter."
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,213.622,230.481,"Some of them are defined explicitly, Justice Brennan, and others are to be inferred from the law of trusts to which Congress committed the entire statute of ERISA for its administration."
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,248.693,255.799,"Well, didn't trust law generally provide for recognizing that a beneficiary should be made whole?"
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,270.891,271.874,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,271.874,276.545,The beneficiaries under the old law were always entitled to be made whole.
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,276.545,286.801,"Well, I think in the context of ERISA, Justice Brennan, to be made whole means to get the benefits to which they are entitled under the statute."
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,286.801,287.503,And that's all.
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,287.503,288.17,And that's all.
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,289.42,292.888,And anything else has to be for the benefit of the plan only.
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,292.888,296.609,"--Well, under Section 409, it is our position that it does, Your Honor."
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,322.557,335.234,"Well, and I can't... there's nothing else in ERISA you suggest that could be read as providing for something more to beneficiaries than what the plan provides for them in the way of benefits?"
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,335.234,368.705,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor, but the provision of ERISA that provides for individual rights for participants and beneficiaries is in 502, specifically 502(a)(1)(B), and that section which provides that participants and beneficiaries have the right to enforce their benefits under the plan, to determine what they are, to clarify their rights under the plan, has its comparable provision referring to equitable remedies in Section 502(a)(3)."
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,384.132,387.5,But only to the extend of the benefits that the plan provides.
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,387.5,388.868,But only to the extent of the benefits of the plan.
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,388.868,393.67,"And there is no remedy for beneficiaries, for something more anywhere else?"
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,393.67,399.241,"Other than the equitable remedies provided there, I think that's right."
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,450.692,462.667,"Well, where state law previously may have provided beneficiaries with a remedy for more than just the benefits under the plan, was that too preempted?"
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,462.667,472.772,"--To the extent that it was a state law which related to an employee benefit plan, yes, it was preempted."
1984.84-9,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,517.918,533.846,"Mr. Nolan, if the plaintiff below has been someone suing on behalf of the plan, would compensatory damages be available under 409?"
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,533.846,536.898,"--I believe they would not, Justice O'Connor."
1984.84-9,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,536.898,551.84,"Well, certainly the language speaking of other equitable or remedial relief as the Court may deem appropriate as applied to a suit by the plan might result in a difference, might it not?"
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,551.84,556.192,"I think that it probably would, Justice O'Connor."
1984.84-9,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,623.587,633.443,Or there might be consequential damages beyond mere reimbursement of the amounts due.
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,633.443,648.219,"Damages, if there were damages to the plan, I think that that might be available under the equitable part of the section."
1984.84-9,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,648.219,652.773,"Why would it be available under the equitable part of the section, Mr. Nolan?"
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,658.01,661.295,"That's generally true, that's generally true, Justice--"
1984.84-9,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,661.295,666.014,"Well, then, my question remains why would damages be available under a section providing for equitable relief?"
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,666.014,685.476,"--Well, I think in part this is terminology, but to the extent that it involves the restoration of the plan, it would be involved, in our view, under Section 409, and the courts in dealing with Section 409 have used, as this Court undoubtedly recognizes--"
1984.84-9,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,685.476,686.342,Sure.
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,686.342,689.51,--a wide variety of equitable remedies to do justice.
1984.84-9,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,689.51,693.997,But is damages one of the wide variety of equitable remedies that they have used?
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,693.997,695.616,It is usually not.
1984.84-9,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,702.52,706.139,"And it could be other remedial relief, in any event."
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,706.139,721.232,"I believe that the key language, Justice O'Connor, is such other equitable or remedial relief, which ties that clause very specifically to the two preceding clauses."
1984.84-9,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,737.793,742.578,"Well, isn't the law of trusts historically a creature of equity?"
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,742.578,747.482,"The law of trusts is very definitely a creature of equity, Justice White."
1984.84-9,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,747.482,755.072,And suits against trustees raise equitable questions.
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,755.072,757.022,That's correct.
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,778.187,796.982,"Well, at the same time, Mr. Nolan, is there mention in the discussions in the legislative history of preemption of state remedies, that Congress intended to preempt any that gave more than just... beneficiaries more than just the benefits of the plan?"
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,796.982,798.732,There is no--
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,798.732,800.701,Did Congress say that explicitly?
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,800.701,811.424,"--There is nothing that I know of in the legislative history, Your Honor, that would suggest that Congress intended to give the beneficiaries anything more than their benefits under the plan."
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,812.708,827.934,"No, what... no, my question was whether in saying this Congress also said, and to the extent beneficiaries had any right to anything else under state law no longer, get only what ERISA provides."
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,827.934,828.636,--That is correct.
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,829.736,831.905,Did Congress say that expressly?
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,831.905,847.832,"--Congress said it in the statute in the preemption part of ERISA, that any law relating to employee benefit plans would be preempted, and that, of course, differentiates ERISA from a number of other federal statutes which intend expressly to leave state law standing."
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,931.085,939.024,Were there any states that allowed a beneficiary to recover punitive damages before ERISA was enacted?
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,939.024,966.842,"Punitive damages as we know, Justice Brennan, are found in many states, not all, but many, and of course, there was a variety of state pension and welfare laws, and there were actions under those laws, and there were a variety of results."
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,972.312,974.114,And the variety of results in some instances--
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,974.114,975.164,"--The variety of results, exactly."
1984.84-9,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,975.164,976.299,--included punitive damages.
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,976.299,999.665,"Including punitive damages in amounts that were arbitrary, inconsistent, unreliable, and including as Congress said a uniform source of law for evaluating fiduciary conduct which they sought to establish in ERISA which that kind of system would not provide for."
1984.84-9,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.617,1025.88,"Well, are you saying that it was a regular feature of trust law in one or more states or a lot of states that would award punitive damages in connection with suits against trustees who have stolen from the fund or who engaged in some kind of conduct?"
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,1026.565,1027.965,--No.
1984.84-9,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1027.965,1032.469,"--As well as just surcharging them, would they award punitive damages as part of trust law?"
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,1032.469,1040.539,"No, I don't think that it was ever any more than a rare and occasional anomaly of trust law."
1984.84-9,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1053.132,1060.202,"So you would say even if there was no preemption, there is no basis for awarding punitive damages against a trustee."
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,1060.202,1067.623,"There are cases like that, Justice White, but... and we have reviewed that fairly carefully, but they are rare--"
1984.84-9,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1067.623,1068.225,All right.
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,1068.225,1074.379,"--And they are anomalous, and actions by a beneficiary against a trustee are ill-favored and rarely--"
1984.84-9,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1074.379,1077.764,But you can't say that in this case because California law provides such a remedy.
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,1077.764,1078.648,--That is correct.
1984.84-9,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.648,1079.214,Yes.
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,1083.652,1086.52,"The Ninth Circuit held there was preemption, yes, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.84-9,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1086.52,1094.542,And I don't believe the Respondent have cross-petitioned or assigned anything in their brief that would challenge that holding.
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,1094.542,1099.911,I think there is quite clearly preemption in this case.
1984.84-9,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1100.696,1103.831,"Well, does your opponent question that, do you know?"
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,1103.831,1107.017,--I don't believe that our opponent does.
1984.84-9,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1295.274,1299.075,"Very well, Mr. Nolan."
1984.84-9,0,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,1299.542,1300.442,Thank you.
1984.84-9,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1300.442,1305.962,Mr. Baker?
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1305.962,1311.133,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1492.332,1496.236,Then you do agree that all state law was preempted by ERISA.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1496.236,1501.64,"Every court including yourself in Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, seems to be taking that position."
1984.84-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1506.057,1512.595,Have there been many states that allowed punitive damages in suits by beneficiaries against fiduciaries?
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1512.595,1524.986,"--In the restatement of torts, a breach of fiduciary duty is a tort, and it cites many cases from differing jurisdictions in California all the way, and since 1908 they have allowed--"
1984.84-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1524.986,1525.921,Punitive damages?
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1525.921,1532.075,"--punitive damages, compensatory damages, the full range of whatever you can get under a tort against the fiduciary."
1984.84-9,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1532.075,1540.015,"Well, a fiduciary who faces the possibility of punitive damages hasn't much incentive, has he, to accept the job?"
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1540.015,1554.338,I believe you are referring to the... all the amicus briefs on behalf of the Taft-Hartley plans where you have half of the fiduciaries from the employers and half from the employees.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1674.451,1683.29,"May I ask on the facts of this case, I notice one of the petitioners is a person named Cecilia Steavenson."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1684.507,1686.425,That is the supervisor.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.377,1691.313,Nothing to do with the ERISA.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1691.313,1691.913,--Nothing to do with ERISA.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.913,1696.031,"Then in the ERISA claim, who is the fiduciary, the corporation?"
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1696.031,1701.185,"In the particular plan, we did not name the fiduciaries because we sued the plan."
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1707.255,1708.524,But you didn't sue them?
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1708.524,1714.178,We have an amendment before the Court to amend the complaint to sue them at this particular point.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1714.178,1717.296,So your suit really is not against Massachusetts Mutual then.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1717.296,1736.008,"Massachusetts Mutual, because they exhibit or they have control over the employees and are acting in a discretionary manner in setting up the policies of ERISA, could conceivably be a fiduciary, and we contend that they are a fiduciary under the definition of fiduciary."
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1736.008,1751.2,"Well, say they get five or six people, whether employees or outside people, to administer the plan and this same sort of thing happened, they were slow in making payments and for whatever the reason might be, your cause of action would be against the individual trustees, wouldn't it?"
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1751.2,1764.008,"That is correct, unless there can be proven that the company itself is exerting such influence over these people and they have not allocated their duties pursuant to 405(c)(1) and (c)(2)."
1984.84-9,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1790.808,1824.28,"Well, despite the language in the legislative history, Congress nevertheless enacted a very specific series of remedies and didn't incorporate expressly any provision for a beneficiary to obtain punitive or extracontractual compensatory relief, and our normal presumption, is it not, in those circumstances, would be not to read into the act additional remedies."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1824.28,1833.504,"Looking at the language of Section 409, you have an equitable or remedial relief in there, and the opposite--"
1984.84-9,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1833.504,1840.258,"Well, but looking at 409, it does appear to be addressed to relief for the plan itself, not a beneficiary."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1840.258,1844.543,"--No federal court has ever taken that position, even the cases--"
1984.84-9,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1844.543,1851.633,"Well, reading the language of it, at least, that's what one would normally think it meant."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1851.633,1868.927,"--With regards to an earlier Senate version that Petitioners contend cast aspersions upon the intent of Congress since that earlier version was not adopted, and the earlier version had the words"
1984.84-9,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1909.986,1912.671,"Well, the earlier version, of course, wasn't adopted."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1912.671,1914.539,--That is correct.
1984.84-9,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1942.207,1948.444,"But that might mean Congress didn't provide for any, and that gets down to the question I asked you."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1956.199,1962.02,The definition of remedial is quite... it is a very nebulous definition.
1984.84-9,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1971.976,1981.082,"Well, again, that makes the assumption that 409 is addressed to remedies of the beneficiary as opposed to the plan."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1981.082,1981.815,--That is correct.
1984.84-9,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1981.815,1986.136,"Now, assuming we think it applies only to the plan, then where are we?"
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,1986.136,1999.126,"At that particular point, a tribal right of action argument would indicate that the statute was specifically provided, the benefit of that statute was for participants."
1984.84-9,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2017.155,2028.046,"Well, that brings you to Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, to Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, to cases where we have not implied additional remedies."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2028.046,2048.626,"--Absent specific legislative intent, and the legislative intent here by both the House and the Senate was to provide the full rage of legal and equitable remedies, and if you do not read remedial to mean legal, then there have been no legal remedies afforded to the participants."
1984.84-9,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2048.626,2070.14,"Supposing Congress in either a Senate report or a House report says we intend to provide the full range of legal and equitable remedies, and then in the statute itself you just have a very specific section that says the plan shall have a right to recover from Defendants type A, B, and C, nothing else."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2081.43,2092.819,"If in fact... no, there is a presumption you do not want to create a private right of action, and I--"
1984.84-9,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2092.819,2101.492,"There is also a presumption that what Congress had to say was said primarily in the statute, not in the legislative history, isn't there?"
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2101.492,2102.194,--Also correct.
1984.84-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2104.194,2111.616,"Well, why... Congress did provide for a participant or a beneficiary to have a... to be able to sue."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2111.616,2112.766,--That is correct.
1984.84-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2112.766,2118.103,But it rather carefully said what he could sue for.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2118.103,2120.971,"Under Section 409 or under Section 502, or both?"
1984.84-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.971,2121.655,502.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2121.655,2136.581,"Section 502 says against the plan you can only sue for equitable relief or benefits, and the purpose of that was because you don't want to... you do not want to jeopardize the assets of the plan which would then jeopardize all beneficiaries."
1984.84-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.581,2143.152,"No, I know, but Congress did provide for a civil action by participants or beneficiaries."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2143.152,2143.671,Correct.
1984.84-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.671,2147.039,And said what they could sue for.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2155.745,2163.815,"Except that under 502 they specifically say for appropriate relief, the participants or beneficiaries may sue for appropriate relief under Section 409."
1984.84-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.815,2175.975,"To enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this title or the terms of the plan, or to obtain other appropriate equitable relief, to redress such violations, or to enforce any provision."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2175.975,2176.792,That's a--
1984.84-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.792,2180.527,Do you think punitive damages falls within those words?
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2180.527,2181.26,"--No, not at all."
1984.84-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2190.466,2197.305,"Well, I know, but that section doesn't say anything about a participant or a beneficiary suing."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2197.305,2220.337,"I believe that if it is read in conjunction with a participant or beneficiary going to 502(a) says a participant or beneficiary may sue for appropriate relief under Section 409, you then get referred over to Section 409, and it says that the participant may receive other equitable or remedial relief--"
1984.84-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2220.337,2221.321,All right.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2221.321,2222.287,--as the Court deems appropriate.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2231.293,2234.662,May I just ask one other question to be sure I am right?
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2234.662,2235.181,Certainly.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2235.181,2239.715,"As I understand your position, you do not claim you have any rights at all against the plan."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2239.715,2240.548,Most certainly.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2240.548,2247.088,"So that always, in all of this class of cases, there will always be individual liability of the individual trustees."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2247.088,2260.396,Of the individual trustees unless an employer puts himself in a conflict situation and is actually administering a self-funded plan so that an employer becomes a fiduciary.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2263.764,2285.696,"Well, presumably you could... I suppose that you might now, if the employer is kind of a third party who breached the... compelled the trustees to violate their trust, maybe you have a claim against him, but that is not... the theory of your case is wrongdoing by the trustees themselves, and you... and it is quite clear, you do not seek to impose liability against a plan for that sort of thing."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2285.696,2286.263,Not at all.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2293.517,2304.991,"In anything other than 409, is there anything else in the statute that implies that a beneficiary under this statute has a right of action against anybody not payable out of the plan?"
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2309.145,2309.812,409.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2309.812,2312.681,409 is your entire statutory basis for your position.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2312.681,2313.031,That's it.
1984.84-9,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2313.031,2333.61,"Well, how about 502(a)(3), which gives a... the authority for a civil action to be brought by a beneficiary to obtain ""other appropriate equitable relief""?"
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2333.61,2335.296,Okay.
1984.84-9,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2351.989,2360.595,"Well, do you read 502(a)(3) as giving a cause of action to a beneficiary against a trustee?"
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2360.595,2363.779,502(a)--
1984.84-9,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2363.779,2364.529,(a)(3)--
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2364.529,2367.498,--(a)(3) does not give any right against a fiduciary.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2407.225,2408.025,"--Well, that doesn't follow."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2417.498,2420.033,I am not certainly what my opponent--
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.033,2429.841,"If you say... I mean, but if you read 409 as just providing a remedy for the plan, conceivably a trustee could act in a way that would justify a damage remedy against him which would come within the word remedial."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2429.841,2430.374,--That is correct.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2430.374,2430.791,Yes.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2430.791,2431.858,That is correct.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2440.48,2442.581,Right.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2442.581,2444.181,--against fiduciaries receive other equitable or remedial relief.
1984.84-9,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2522.684,2540.395,"Do you think there is any difference at all for purposes of your argument in reading the statute to give you relief and punitive damages as opposed to compensatory, noncontractual damages?"
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2543.614,2557.041,"Once you expand beyond equitable into legal, the facts of the case will control and the standard of review will determine whether compensatory or punitive damages should be allowed against the fiduciary."
1984.84-9,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2574.402,2585.358,"Has this Court been more reluctant to find punitive damages authorization than compensatory, in your view?"
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2585.358,2586.293,"--Traditionally, yes."
1984.84-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2673.565,2684.605,"Well, there is no suggestion that you can't get compensatory damages against a defaulting trustee, is there?"
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2684.605,2690.258,Respondent's position is that compensatory... you can't get anything--
1984.84-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2690.258,2690.874,You can't get anything.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2690.874,2691.86,--All you get are just your benefits.
1984.84-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2691.86,2694.645,And that would be you would get them from the plan or not?
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2694.645,2721.213,"Only from the plan, that if in fact your welfare or your disability payments are chopped off for two years and you lose your house and they turn around and give you your two years worth of back disability payments, you cannot receive compensation for an erroneous act by a fiduciary that cost you your house or that might have been a spiteful action."
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2725.832,2729.3,May I ask this about the legislative history?
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2745.495,2748.363,They really spend very little time on the remedies.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2753.601,2754.284,"Well, was it an issue at all?"
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2754.984,2756.969,--It was not discussed one way or the other.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2767.675,2780.751,"--On the question of timing, as I understand the regulations, they do say to you that if they don't act within three or four months, I forget what it is, you treat the application as though it had been denied, is that right, so that you may then go into court and get your action against the plan."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2780.751,2785.053,"--With regards to exhaustion of administrative remedies, that is correct."
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2785.053,2789.524,"So that if you waited two years, it would be at the beneficiary's option if he had a right to sue."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2790.724,2791.09,That is correct.
1984.84-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2850.93,2861.72,So I guess your argument really boils down to it that punitive damages is a form of remedy.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2861.72,2867.524,Is a remedy to redress or prevent violations of the act.
1984.84-9,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2871.428,2873.861,"Well, is that a remedy to a plaintiff?"
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2878.748,2880.3,It is more of a deterrence to others.
1984.84-9,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2907.017,2913.588,"Well, all of the wanton disregard and other phrases like that you have to get from the state law."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2915.457,2917.123,You cannot get that from ERISA.
1984.84-9,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2930.882,2935.434,"Well, I imagine every state's punitive damage rule is different."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2939.488,2940.922,"Well, yes, I believe it is."
1984.84-9,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2940.922,2941.655,I didn't think so.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2941.655,2950.88,"However, it is the Court's ability at this particular point to set the uniform standard for punitive damages under ERISA."
1984.84-9,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2969.758,2974.209,And you want us to adopt the Ninth Circuit's rule.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2974.209,2978.363,I do not feel that a mere reckless standard would be appropriate in this situation.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2997.175,2999.027,"May I ask, going back to your compensatory damages for a minute--"
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,2999.027,2999.51,Surely.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2999.51,3001.646,--The willful and wanton business goes to punitive damages.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,3001.646,3002.279,That is correct.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3002.279,3018.321,"But if we put that to one side for a minute, I guess we also have to fashion the standard of reliability for prompt payment, too, because on the basic liability, your position is they were too slow in paying, and I suppose that could be just because they were negligent or had sloppy administration or anything."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,3018.321,3021.623,Our particular case does not just deal with slow payment.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3022.142,3022.675,"Well, I understand."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,3032.498,3035.367,"--Under certain circumstances, if the--"
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3035.367,3036.819,"Well, I have given you the circumstances."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,3036.819,3040.937,"--You see, the four month period is still--"
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3040.937,3044.473,"It took four months to process your claim, and in the meantime you couldn't pay off your mortgage."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,3044.473,3047.358,--That is still within the 26--
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3047.358,3048.627,"Well, say eight months, say eight months."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,3048.627,3049.093,"--Eight months, yes."
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3049.093,3061.184,We have to decide what period of time... basically we need a national rule to determine how slow a payment becomes... creates a compensatory damage liability.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,3061.184,3068.521,"There is a standard that has been set forth already in the regulations, and that is Regulation 2560.503."
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3068.521,3070.04,"That's the 120 days, they treat the claim as denied."
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,3070.04,3072.123,It goes on just denied.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3078.646,3084.216,But do you say that every claim that takes more than 120 days to process gives rise to a damage liability?
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,3084.216,3088.668,That's a very difficult question.
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3088.668,3090.47,But we have to answer it for the whole country.
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,3090.47,3095.005,"I think it sets up a presumption, yes, that--"
1984.84-9,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3095.005,3096.773,"Well, is there a defense to it, and if so, what?"
1984.84-9,1,17468,brad_n_baker,,3096.773,3098.107,--Reasonable cause.
1984.84-9,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3098.107,0.0,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Nolan?"
1984.84-9,2,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,3104.713,3109.015,"I have four very brief points, Your Honor."
1984.84-9,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3195.437,3196.806,Marshall and Elsely.
1984.84-9,2,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,3196.806,3200.008,"And... Elsely, is it?"
1984.84-9,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3310.177,3318.683,Is there... is the claim in this case that the beneficiary should get punitive damages?
1984.84-9,2,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,3318.683,3326.605,"The claim in this case is that the participant, I believe, should get punitive damages, yes."
1984.84-9,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3326.605,3331.157,And not... rather than the plan.
1984.84-9,2,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,3331.157,3333.693,"Rather than the plan, clearly."
1984.84-9,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3333.693,3345.333,What if the beneficiary sues under (3)(a)(2) for appropriate relief under Section 409?
1984.84-9,2,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,3351.137,3351.82,That is correct.
1984.84-9,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3351.82,3367.949,"And part of his cause of action is I am suing on behalf of the plan to get relief against this fiduciary, and I want the fiduciary to pay punitive damages to the plan."
1984.84-9,2,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,3367.949,3374.603,"Well, there are two aspects to that which make it good as a hypothetical but not very good as a case."
1984.84-9,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3383.041,3383.475,Yes.
1984.84-9,2,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,3383.475,3392.131,The other is that 502(a)(3) is by its terms expressly limited to equitable relief.
1984.84-9,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3392.131,3392.664,I understand that.
1984.84-9,2,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,3392.664,3395.266,It is in our view by the individual as to--
1984.84-9,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3395.266,3396.368,I know that.
1984.84-9,2,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,3405.974,3408.509,--I believe that--
1984.84-9,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3408.509,3409.926,That's just what it says.
1984.84-9,2,32158,john_e_nolan_jr,,3424.25,3424.769,--That's correct.
1984.84-9,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3424.769,0.0,Okay.
1984.84-9,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3426.352,3429.85,"Thank you, gentlemen."
