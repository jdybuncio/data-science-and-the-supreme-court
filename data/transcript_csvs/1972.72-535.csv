1972.72-535,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.518,"We'll arguments next in 72-535 and 562, excuse me, United States and ICC against Students, and Abredeen and Rockfish Railroad against Students."
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,50.122,53.027,May it please the Court.
1972.72-535,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,418.135,420.771,We will resume right after lunch.
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,428.845,437.935,The first issue in the case to which I will turn is the familiar question of standing.
1972.72-535,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,661.147,663.542,Did the district take testimony on this --?
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,663.542,664.721,"No, Mr. Justice."
1972.72-535,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,713.63,717.274,Who in your view would have standing?
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,717.274,722.401,The shippers whose rates were increased would have standing.
1972.72-535,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,828.484,833.092,Would the United States have standing Mr. Solicitor General?
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,833.092,834.561,"Yes, I think so, Mr. Justice."
1972.72-535,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,841.62,850.676,Would the United States have standing if it was alleged that it's moving to enforce the environmental protection?
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,850.676,865.302,"Well, I think there are many situations under which the United States would have standing to enforce matters relating to environmental protection, particularly in view of the statute which Congress has enacted stating the policy of the United States."
1972.72-535,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,865.302,870.078,"For a person who is in business of recycling as some companies are, would they have standing?"
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,870.078,873.015,"A person who had business interest would have standing, yes."
1972.72-535,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,873.015,875.795,It comes down to the dollar business?
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,875.795,877.071,"I am sorry, Mr. Justice."
1972.72-535,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,877.071,879.357,It comes down to the dollar --
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,879.357,884.472,"No, I don't think it would be limited to a dollar amount as in Sierra Club against Morton."
1972.72-535,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1450.087,1455.216,Is it the Commission's preferred position on the applicability of the --
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1455.216,1457.972,"As to suspension orders, yes, Mr. Justice."
1972.72-535,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.972,1459.417,But not as --?
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1459.417,1461.571,Not as to the --.
1972.72-535,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1461.571,1462.71,Not as to their final action?
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1462.71,1464.281,Not as to their final action.
1972.72-535,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1464.281,1469.725,They think that -- they think you are enforcing the investigation and the decision?
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1469.725,1479.15,"Then may will develop the materials which, as a part of their final action, will include an appropriate environmental protection statement."
1972.72-535,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1489.997,1494.333,And I suppose you take the same position whether they do suspend the rates --
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1494.333,1501.081,"Whether they do or do not, they must do one or the other within 30 days."
1972.72-535,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1613.799,1620.458,"Does it define that last phrase, environmental arts?"
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1620.458,1623.753,"No, Mr. Justice – Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.72-535,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1623.753,1624.217,There is no set of definitions in the Act?
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1624.217,1628.785,The environmental fine arts is not defined.
1972.72-535,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1628.785,1633.056,"What would that apply to, the buildings and highways, I suppose --?"
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1633.056,1637.925,"It applies to anything to which it applies, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.72-535,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1640.919,1647.66,I suppose that would mean an attack on a proposed building because someone thought the design of the building was bad?
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1647.66,1653.729,"That argument, no doubt, will be made under this statute that at some point."
1972.72-535,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1653.729,1660.286,"Well here literally speaking, the determination of the Commission was to do nothing, wasn't it, was to not suspend?"
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1660.286,1662.014,"Oh no, Mr. Justice."
1972.72-535,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1799.031,1813.625,Do you concede Mr. Solicitor General that the Commission was obligated under NEPA to do even as much as it did in the statement that you just quoted saying that in its field it would have no substantial adverse effect --
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1813.625,1816.256,"Yes, Mr. Justice I think that they were required --"
1972.72-535,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1816.256,1817.03,To do that much?
1972.72-535,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1817.03,1820.138,"-- to hold, well, perhaps not."
1972.72-535,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1863.971,1865.005,Mr. Cox.
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,1865.005,1867.928,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-535,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2039.348,2041.629,How long is the suspension gone now?
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2041.629,2054.532,"Well, if you take it from the time that the Commission itself could have suspended the rates I think that time expired in, I think, on 5th of September."
1972.72-535,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2313.782,2319.713,I think that you are arguing that affect if need that are involved here shouldn't make any difference in the applicability of railroads?
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2319.713,2320.285,That's right.
1972.72-535,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2323.257,2335.483,"I gather accept for NEPA, the fact situation here is the same as in Arrow in the sense that there had been --"
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2335.483,2353.229,"There is one like it is, I think very similar -- there is one just difference Mr. Justice Brennan, this injunction or this was interposed at the very suspension stage of the proceeding before to Commission."
1972.72-535,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2369.105,2372.639,"Well in that sense the situations are comparable, aren't they?"
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2372.639,2373.883,"I think, they are , yes."
1972.72-535,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.883,2380.046,Because it is an imposition of the court before the act -- the Commission is even before to take final action?
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2380.046,2380.582,That's right.
1972.72-535,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2388.476,2404.344,Any possible argument that then there is that the deeper in such factors which the Commission should consider separately and apart from just and reasonable or would it be as part of that concept?
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2404.344,2426.78,"Well, I would say that if you give those terms their broadest meaning Mr. Justice White that NEPA would require them determining, at least I would be fair to say that NEPA would require the Commission in considering and determining just and reasonableness as to take into account environmental factors, as it did sometimes before the passing to NEPA."
1972.72-535,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.78,2432.373,"Now, the Commission's only charter is to determine justness and reasonableness?"
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2432.373,2433.506,Yes.
1972.72-535,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.042,2460.258,As in the case of anti trust practice?
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2460.258,2468.227,"Yes, as in the case of anti trust practice, which I think was more often done by the courts and by Congress, but it's there just the same."
1972.72-535,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2501.918,2512.944,Is there any indication Mr. Cox in the legislative history of NEPA that would suggest that they intended to modify the Arrow doctrine?
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2512.944,2516.578,"I think my time has expired, but -- no, I have a little more time."
1972.72-535,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2516.578,2517.748,You still have five minutes.
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2517.748,2532.919,"No, there is absolutely no indication, either in the words of the statute or in its legislative history that it intended, statute was intended to amend the Interstate Commerce Act, to change the regulatory plan or --"
1972.72-535,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2532.919,2535.434,I expected -- the Congress even addressed the question of the interstate commerce?
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2535.434,2551.964,"No, our appellees, the appellees, one of them here says, oddly enough in support of its argument that Congress did not specifically deal with this matter or to use the appellee's words even paused to consider it."
1972.72-535,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2554.303,2560.342,Perhaps that was because no one thought that freight rates could affect the environment from the time they were thinking about this subject?
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2560.342,2563.418,That is perhaps a reasonable speculation.
1972.72-535,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2605.387,2612.22,Mr. Cox is there any indication or what the position of environmental protection agency is?
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2633.124,2633.269,Oh!
1972.72-535,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2643.725,2646.494,They haven't filed -- they filed a separate --
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2646.494,2650.694,They may have not filed anything in this Court and --
1972.72-535,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.694,2653.785,"Well, that maybe one thing, but what about the procedure?"
1972.72-535,1,26750,hugh_b_cox,,2666.105,2674.577,"Well, the dean has or I beg pardon your pardon, the Solicitor General has stated the argument on that point and we hardly concur on it."
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,2828.515,2831.847,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-535,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3088.108,3101.932,"Mr Meyers what if the Commission had simply declined to suspend the rates, in affect done nothing, what would be your position then as to the requirement of environmental impact statement?"
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3101.932,3107.486,It's Scrap's position Your Honor that it does not matter what action the Commission takes.
1972.72-535,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3591.034,3604.772,"(Inaudible) if the Commission cannot its job get done with respect to the environmental impact, that it must suspend the rates until it does?"
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3604.772,3607.546,That is not a necessary conclusion of our argument.
1972.72-535,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3612.631,3613.647,It was the same argument?
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3613.647,3614.448,Yeah.
1972.72-535,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3614.448,3615.008,Isn't it?
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3615.008,3619.278,We do not make it -- we do not take that position in necessarily every case.
1972.72-535,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3619.278,3621.263,Why you do not take the position in this case?
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3621.263,3622.448,"In this case, we do."
1972.72-535,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3632.123,3643.373,"Yeah, but the argument on the other side is that you are taking the position that they should come up with something in 30 days which is an impossibility?"
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3643.373,3646.809,"I would like to make two specific responses to that, Your Honor."
1972.72-535,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3668.934,3677.939,Do you know whether the Commission's practice almost invariably is to suspend the rates if they start a investigation?
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3677.939,3681.046,"No, it is my understanding, it is not there in variable practices."
1972.72-535,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3681.046,3688.083,"So even if they have -- even if they must have a proceeding to investigate the reasonableness of the rates, they do not necessarily suspend it?"
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3688.083,3689.278,"Right, that is correct."
1972.72-535,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3690.571,3696.082,So that maybe why you do not make the argument (Inaudible)?
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3696.082,3708.543,"In addition, the Commission in neither of the suspension orders involved in this case, did the Commission rely upon this impossibility argument."
1972.72-535,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3745.995,3752.771,What triggers the need for the ICC to get this impact statement?
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3752.771,3762.006,"Triggered the need when the railroads proposed increases on the recyclable commodities, which could have a significant environmental effect."
1972.72-535,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3762.006,3764.816,Is it limited to recycling?
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3764.816,3767.353,"No, the increases went to all rates."
1972.72-535,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3767.921,3772.135,"Well, the case that was just before, should they have gotten an impact statement?"
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3772.135,3778.986,I cannot see how inspection charges for grains could even remotely have an environmental impact --
1972.72-535,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3778.986,3783.49,"You said the ICC should have had this done long before this, is that correct?"
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3783.49,3784.731,That is correct Your Honor.
1972.72-535,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3784.731,3785.972,Why?
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3785.972,3794.255,NEPA went into effect in 1970 placed up on a Commission in Section 101 (B) (6) a specific duty to encourage recycling.
1972.72-535,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3794.255,3795.422,On the Commission?
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3795.422,3798.413,On all federal agencies.
1972.72-535,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3798.413,3800.251,Including the courts?
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3800.251,3804.997,I would not go that far Your Honor but [Laughter] not presented in this case.
1972.72-535,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3809.792,3836.35,"What you are suggesting in response to Justice Marshall's question that this is a blanket requirement over the whole spectrum of government or most of it at least and that without any specific direction or order or request, they should all be getting up environmental impact statements on every subject that might come before them so that they will be prepared to respond in let us say 30-day time limits."
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3838.26,3846.05,"No Your Honor, our position is that it is the words of Section 102 (2) (c)."
1972.72-535,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3875.735,3878.402,"Weren't foreseen by Congress, were it?"
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3878.402,3879.336,Excuse me Your Honor?
1972.72-535,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3879.336,3883.304,Were they foreseen by Congress?
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3889.687,3917.208,"Nothing in it specifically dealing with the Interstate Commerce Act, but Congress I believe did make it clear that no agency of the Federal government can and I am quoting from portion of the legislative history now, the major changes in the senate can under its statutory authorizations shall utilize an excessively narrow construction of its existing statutory authorizations."
1972.72-535,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3917.208,3925.105,"Is that a restriction against this Court that we shouldn't use a narrow construction, you would not go that far, while you are at it?"
1972.72-535,2,38165,peter_h_meyers,,3925.105,3936.218,"I would not go that far, Your Honor."
1972.72-535,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4031.774,4043.559,Thank you Mr. Meyers.
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4044.628,4047.449,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4267.27,4274.793,What did the agency understand (Inaudible) either suspend it or didn't suspend it right?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4274.793,4280.714,I don't believe that the agency has said either way on that question.
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4280.714,4294.881,"They have never, unless they disagreed that it was satisfy the Act of a – did an adequate job during the process has considering whether the rate is just and reasonable?"
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4294.881,4297.333,That was we submit the issue before the District Court.
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4301.229,4302.907,So and that's one of the issues here.
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4309.892,4327.32,Your Honor we don't have a case statement in this record from the agency with respect to the general question of whether the Commission is obliged with respect to rate increase proposals to submit an impact statement in a 30-day period.
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4335.395,4338.398,But that isn't an issue here?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4338.398,4345.281,The issue here is not whether the Commission is obliged to file an impact statement in a every rate proceeding in a 30-day period.
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4345.409,4357.78,"Well, this the – it is whether the content of an impact statement submitted by the Commission that satisfies the Act?"
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4357.78,4367.325,"The issue Your Honor, I am afraid I don't understand you, the District Court held that the Commission had not complied with NEPA in this case to the fullest extent possible."
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4413.386,4419.14,So you are just here because the Commission could suspend for seven months and do its job?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4419.14,4441.215,"That's one thing the Commission could do Your Honor and other thing that Commission to do was, as it has in the most recent general rate increase proceedings, tell the railroads that they don't have special permission to file a rate within a short period of time, that they have to give the public 75 days notice or 90 days notice or whatever period of time is appropriate."
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4445.948,4450.296,You say the Environmental Protection Act gives them that power?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4450.296,4458.389,"Gives the Commission, not the power, not really with the power, but the duty to comply with the Act to the fullest extent possible."
1972.72-535,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4458.389,4464.73,But doesn't that wipe out the 30-day -- doesn't that wipe out the 30-day rate-making process?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4464.73,4467.054,No Your Honor it doesn't.
1972.72-535,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4467.054,4470.888,In all cases where an environmental impact is asserted?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4470.888,4490.73,"In case where an environmental impact is asserted, it may well be that one doesn't exist and in those circumstances a Commission finding of no significant environmental impact, if it's based on a record and if its adequately explained or at least if the District Court can figure out what the Commission did would suffice or in review."
1972.72-535,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4561.676,4563.204,Let's see if I have understand you.
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4575.299,4576.133,That's correct Your Honor.
1972.72-535,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4576.133,4593.174,"If within the 30 day period it's not possible to comply with the procedure for an impact statement, then the duty of the Commission is to use the option open to it of suspend it for seven months."
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4594.152,4600.788,Our argument is that's one possibility that the Commission could employ to comply with the requirements of the Act.
1972.72-535,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4601.4,4612.017,"In other words if the Commission can't say, we can't do within the 30 days and therefore it's impossible, because they could suspend and do it within the suspended period, is that right?"
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4612.017,4614.939,"Even if they didn't suspend Your Honor, they could do something."
1972.72-535,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4614.939,4616.062,But what else besides suspending?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4616.062,4618.172,For example they could --
1972.72-535,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4618.172,4622.485,Let's take the assumption that it's really not possible within 30-day time period?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4622.485,4634.728,"And let's take the assumption that 30 days is what their limit too which I think is not the case, but within the 30-day period they could submit an outline of a draft environmental impact statement."
1972.72-535,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4660.364,4668.473,What I might say about your argument Mr. Dienelt is what's the significance of 30-day limitation?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4672.928,4694.024,"There maybe circumstances where for example the railroads propose a change in one rate, and it will go into the effect in 30 days and in that period if environmental impact may exist and it's alleged, we submit the Commission should consider whether there is a significant environmental impact from say that one rate and whether --"
1972.72-535,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4694.024,4708.112,"Well, now let's take the situation where -- it can't be done within 30 days, then in face of the requirement that something be done within 30 days, what is open to the Commission?"
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4708.112,4727.08,"Among the things that would be open to the Commission would be to file a draft impact statement, to file an outline of draft impact statement to indicate how it's going to go about complying with NEPA, to indicate the process it's going to follow, to make a decision in good faith that there is no significant environmental impact."
1972.72-535,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4727.08,4730.866,But all of this had -- one or the other of those things must be done within 30 days?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4730.866,4734.158,That's within in the time period that the Commission has.
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4734.158,4734.911,What other --
1972.72-535,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4734.911,4736.729,Within 30 days?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4736.729,4740.598,"It is not, Your Honor in a general rating increase proceedings as a practical matter."
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4740.598,4743.62,"What – you said they work them into 30 days, why aren't they?"
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4743.62,4770.106,"Because the railroads when they come in with a request raise general rates, as I understand it as now as a practical matter you have to come in with what's called a master terrier instead of coming in as I understand it, with an indication of what the rate on Scrap on between Buick and Omaha is and for every other rate in the country they come in with general guides."
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4782.684,4787.315,(Voice Overlap) either your ask for we'll suspend for seven months?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4787.315,4788.398,That's one of the --
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4788.398,4790.637,But other options that Commission has?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4790.637,4799.802,"You'd have to ask for a special permission in order to be able to publish a rate that doesn't comply with all of the other requirements of the Act, which you can do."
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4818.017,4824.563,"But the Commission said even if the (Inaudible) filed, it doesn't comply with the general regulations."
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4831.324,4832.896,That's the Commission's authority in terms of --
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4832.896,4833.002,Oh!
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4834.645,4837.302,"Yes, that is part of the leverage under the suspension --"
1972.72-535,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4837.302,4850.261,"Well, but do you – area you saying that in circumstances where no other way of doing it, is available to Commission, the Commission must suspend them for seven months?"
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4850.261,4851.587,No.
1972.72-535,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4878.448,4888.028,"Well, didn't the Commission -- didn't the Commission say that the impact was so tenuous that there is nothing to it and it did not need, isn't that the effect --"
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,4888.028,4899.365,"No Your Honor, it said and all it said was that there will be no -- it appears that there will be no significant effect on the environmental policy, on the human environment, under the National Environment Policy Act."
1972.72-535,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5105.363,5109.753,How was that membership figure established in the record in this case?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5109.753,5115.422,We alleged the membership of each of the organizations in our complaint Your Honor and the --
1972.72-535,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5115.422,5117.48,Beyond the allegation?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5117.48,5131.55,"That was as I was going to address Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question, there was no proof put on with respect to the, no testimony taken I should say, with respect to our membership."
1972.72-535,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5142.868,5147.109,What if in another way how could anyone challenge?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5147.109,5158.389,I suppose and I was going to suggest that this in response to the claim of the railroads that our allegations were not sufficiently precise that they take discovery if they want.
1972.72-535,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5160.035,5163.914,You mean they should explore to see if your allegation is correct?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5163.914,5169.815,If they wish to challenge such a basic thing as the veracity of our membership.
1972.72-535,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5169.815,5178.85,"Well, isn't that form bar over the phrase that you use, isn't that form of a boilerplate allegation than the complaint for a standing?"
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5178.85,5186.94,"Well, it's accepted boilerplate and it is also something that we can prove if we are out to it."
1972.72-535,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5192.028,5198.279,It wouldn't be unusual I suppose to have a preliminary injunction heard on the affidavits without oral testimony?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5198.279,5221.486,"No, Your Honor I don't believe so and certainly there was evidence in the record with regard to the effect of freight rates on recycling which is the other part of the allegation of injury, but the proof was that, each of these allegations are provable, the environmental groups alleged in injury in fact, which we submit a sufficient Sierra Club."
1972.72-535,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5221.486,5226.108,"Well, what's the size of your membership got to do with the question?"
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5230.524,5232.522,"Nothing, one point person is --"
1972.72-535,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5232.522,5234.906,"If anything, if Sierra holds anything, it holds that?"
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5234.906,5238.125,"That's correct Your Honor, I agree."
1972.72-535,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5243.517,5247.261,"One law student or a hundred million, doesn't have anything to do with the problem of standing?"
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5247.261,5248.698,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1972.72-535,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5248.698,5261.175,"Insofar as the procedural posture of the case and it is your position that you are entitled to have your allegations taken as true but by the same time token I suppose you are bound by it you can't go beyond that, if there wasn't an oral testimony in the court?"
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5261.175,5285.307,"Well, that's correct Your Honor and there was evidence in the record regarding effects of recycling which it seems to me is the essence of the claim of lack of standing usually a question on the merits, do we have some sort of standing to litigate this issue on the merits because we have alleged a sufficient effect as a result of the rate increases and we submit there was impact on that."
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5285.307,5303.339,If any citizen in case of higher prices challenge the consequence of a price board's increase -- order authorizing an increase in meat prices.
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5303.339,5307.8,"I would submit he had standing, he might not prevail on the merits Your Honor but he is -- and in fact --"
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5307.8,5310.49,He does have a --
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5310.49,5329.175,"He satisfies the injury in fact half of the standing test, I am not, I can't respond to the zone of interest question there, because I don't know what the statute is but I don't know what the statute is here and it's need and it creates a right to submit on any citizen to seek to obtain from the government an impact statement."
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5329.175,5332.238,The Sierra or the membership is irrelevant for almost any citizen?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5332.238,5333.189,Any citizen Your Honor that's correct.
1972.72-535,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5333.189,5344.71,"And if it isn't right about any citizen, if that isn't correct about any citizen, it isn't correct about your claims?"
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5344.71,5345.725,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1972.72-535,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5361.309,5363.144,He gets that right from NEPA?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5363.144,5363.751,Pardon.
1972.72-535,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5363.751,5365.749,You get that right from NEPA?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5365.749,5369.44,We get that right from NEPA and also from from the --
1972.72-535,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5369.44,5372.252,"Well, where do you get it in NEPA?"
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5372.252,5377.135,"Well, the review here is under the new state procedure."
1972.72-535,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5377.135,5384.673,Where do you get the right to sue in a Federal court or any other court in NEPA?
1972.72-535,3,29884,john_f_dienelt,,5384.673,5389.531,There is no specific statement in NEPA providing a citizen suit provision.
1972.72-535,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5502.724,5503.382,Thank you gentleman.
