2010.09-987,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.606,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-987, Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn and the related case, Garriott v. Winn."
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,12.308,15.093,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-987,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,58.353,81.616,"Mr. Katyal, their point is that this tax money does belong to the State that private individuals are using, because it is money that, even by the new amendment, says either you pay it to the State or you use it for this purpose, but it's the State's money and it's giving you by its largesse the right to redirect it."
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,83.001,83.568,Right.
2010.09-987,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,83.568,89.722,"So it would be the taxpayers' tax dollars being spent on religion, if they could sustain their claim."
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,89.722,91.657,There are two problems with that.
2010.09-987,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,161.884,164.669,Then is it constitutional if we get a new system?
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,190.653,193.105,"Well, let me say two things about that."
2010.09-987,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,199.175,207.948,"The difference is, of course, that in the one case it's a deduction and in this case you are paying it 100 percent with money that would otherwise go into the coffer."
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,215.852,219.054,I don't think that any taxpayer could challenge that.
2010.09-987,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,238.948,262.397,"If you go back into history, it could have been the case that the -- as long as they were fair to every religion, the first Congress could have funded prayers throughout the nation in churches for anyone to go and pray and that would not have violated the Establishment Clause, or if it had, nobody could have challenged it."
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,262.397,263.916,"--No, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-987,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,293.452,300.422,"Counsel, does anyone have standing, in your view, to challenge this scheme?"
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,300.422,303.141,"--The way this scheme is set up, our answer is no."
2010.09-987,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,310.212,330.125,"And if we leave out the fine points that you were discussing, isn't the underlying premise of Flast v. Cohen that the Establishment Clause will be unenforceable unless we recognize taxpayer standing?"
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,330.125,333.743,"I don't see that, Justice Ginsburg, in Flast."
2010.09-987,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,344.701,346.653,Flast is gone; is that right?
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,356.192,356.925,Justice Breyer--
2010.09-987,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,356.925,358.127,"If they had, they could have -- what?"
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,358.127,364.948,"--Justice Breyer, I don't think Flast is gone at all when there is direct government outlays to spend on religion like Flast."
2010.09-987,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,364.948,370.535,"No, but there needn't be, because all you have to do to get around it is to create what we have here."
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,370.535,379.708,"Well, I do think that that can get around it, that can get around it in some circumstances, and again, those who are underincluded in a government program may have standing, not as a taxpayer."
2010.09-987,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,389.647,404.941,"But there is a plaintiff -- we have a Bill of Rights and most provisions have plaintiffs who are hurting, whose speech is being suppressed, but this one doesn't have."
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,416.833,432.676,"--I don't see that in Flast, Justice Ginsburg, but be that as it may, I think this Court in Valley Forge was very clear to say that if, at the end of the day, you can't find a plaintiff with standing, that is not an excuse to relax the -- our general requirements of Article III standing."
2010.09-987,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,446.102,456.974,"So if you are right, General Katyal, the Court was without authority to decide Walz, Nyquist, Hunt, Mueller, Hibbs, this -- this very case, just a few years ago?"
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,469.416,470.651,Right.
2010.09-987,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,516.846,521.666,I just want to make sure I heard your answer to the -- you said your answer is yes.
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,533.208,536.426,They could have gone out -- the results may have been the same.
2010.09-987,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,548.384,550.253,But you would have said there would have been no standing in those cases.
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,550.253,551.386,--No taxpayer -- no taxpayer standing.
2010.09-987,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,559.191,568.131,But it wasn't -- it wasn't -- I don't remember whether the government participated in the Winn case when it came up under the Tax Injunction Act.
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,568.131,571.083,"We did, and in the first footnote--"
2010.09-987,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,571.083,576.42,And there wasn't a word from the government about lack of standing.
2010.09-987,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,576.42,583.574,"--The first footnote in the brief, Justice Ginsburg, acknowledged the fact that standing hadn't been pushed or pressed below."
2010.09-987,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,656.022,656.939,"Thank you, General."
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,669.497,672.882,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-987,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,699.865,705.519,"Ms. Bickett, could you explain something to me just -- I have been puzzling and puzzling over this scheme."
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,729.984,732.92,"Yes, Justice Kagan."
2010.09-987,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,764.539,770.443,Does the record show the extent to which there are donations by people who do not have students?
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,770.443,773.109,Could you--
2010.09-987,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,773.109,778.947,Does the record show the extent to which there are these additional donations that you just referred to?
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,778.947,784.917,"--Your Honor, of course it was at a motion to dismiss phase."
2010.09-987,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,810.734,815.722,You haven't -- I don't think you answered his question.
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,830.648,838.337,"Well, what the record shows is that there have been -- there is a large amount of contributions."
2010.09-987,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.119,870.457,"Well, I suppose if some of the contributions are considerable, like a million dollars, that couldn't be just a parent, right?"
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,870.457,872.992,Right.
2010.09-987,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,872.992,876.261,Are there contributions of that size?
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,876.261,882.782,"Again, the record doesn't show what the size of the contributions are."
2010.09-987,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,888.068,892.988,"You only get -- if you give a million dollars, you still only get a $500 tax credit, right?"
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,892.988,895.09,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-987,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,941.821,947.04,"Something that worried me in Zelman is this, and I might get your answer."
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,954.713,956.013,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-987,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,956.013,963.318,Let's take 30 or 40 percent of that and spend it through this program on religious schools.
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,997.825,1000.158,Under the tax credit program--
2010.09-987,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1000.158,1000.693,Yes.
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1000.693,1007.263,--the schools have to be qualified private schools in order to participate in the tax credit.
2010.09-987,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1007.263,1008.963,And that must be a set of regulations and rules.
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1008.963,1030.379,"Primarily what it is, is that private schools in Arizona satisfy the compulsory education law as long as they meet the requirements that the public schools have in terms of providing qualitatively the subject matter that the public schools--"
2010.09-987,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1030.379,1032.546,And those standards have nothing to do with this program.
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1042.686,1044.42,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-987,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1044.42,1046.822,And when do they teach the religion part of their program?
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1046.822,1049.34,Excuse me?
2010.09-987,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1049.34,1063.934,"I mean, when does a private school -- normally the schools -- I'm not an expert, but what you have to do to be a school is a very complex thing, and you have all kinds of requirements that eat up quite a lot of the day."
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1090.167,1101.892,"Justice Breyer, the record doesn't reflect that and I am not aware of any problem with private schools in Arizona and certainly not that have participated in this tax credit program."
2010.09-987,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1101.892,1108.713,Suppose that an STO -- this is a hypothetical case -- discriminated on the basis of race.
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1123.388,1132.178,If it was -- if it was a private institution--
2010.09-987,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1132.178,1133.863,It's an STO.
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1133.863,1137.398,--And so that is a private organization.
2010.09-987,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1137.398,1137.965,All right.
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1149.206,1154.008,As long as there was not a Federal law that applied to the organization--
2010.09-987,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1154.008,1156.544,"The hypothetical is no Federal statute, no State statute."
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1159.246,1168.767,"--Unless the discrimination could be attributed to the State, the State's direction, then--"
2010.09-987,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1168.767,1172.405,Don't you think a strong argument can be made that it can be attributed to the State.
2010.09-987,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1181.611,1185.396,Limits the funding.
2010.09-987,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.396,1190.783,I assume that there is a tax deduction for contributions to churches?
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1190.783,1192.083,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-987,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1192.083,1196.287,"And many churches discriminate on the basis of religion, don't they."
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1196.287,1197.704,"Yes, they do."
2010.09-987,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1197.704,1199.973,"Does that pose a constitutional problem, do you think?"
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1199.973,1201.425,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-987,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1201.425,1204.792,What about -- what about the answer to my question?
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1204.792,1210.011,"Well, Your Honor, because STOs are 501--"
2010.09-987,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1210.011,1213.232,You are saying the STO -- you are saying the STOs are sufficiently private so they can do this?
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1213.232,1215.498,--Because they are--
2010.09-987,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1215.498,1218.7,"There was a case in this Court, the name of it was Bob Jones."
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1237.578,1238.678,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-987,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1270.383,1274.703,Could I try Justice Kennedy's question in a slightly different way.
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1323.451,1330.354,"Your Honor, the State is not making those decisions."
2010.09-987,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1358.791,1373.7,"But the plaintiffs contend, the plaintiffs contend and this is a motion to dismiss, so we have to accept their contentions as settled, that there are STOs that make these distinctions that clearly would be impermissible if the State administered the program."
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1387.46,1404.755,"--Your Honor, if I might correct you, there was one school tuition organization that preexisted the tax credit, and certainly the private schools that participated in these for the most part did exist before this school tuition organization."
2010.09-987,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1415.443,1428.037,"You said there was an STO before this program, but it didn't get the benefit of money from taxpayers."
2010.09-987,1,37716,paula_s_bickett,,1437.726,1447.165,"--Before this scheme was created, they would have gotten a tax deduction, a federal tax deduction and a State tax deduction instead of a tax credit."
2010.09-987,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1573.764,1574.597,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1580.685,1584.655,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1622.495,1625.697,"But there is a discrimination, I get it."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1643.492,1647.027,I didn't say it favored or disfavored religion.
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1647.027,1649.146,Then what's your problem under the Establishment Clause?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1649.146,1661.12,The problem is that government benefits in a government benefit program cannot constitutionally be given to the beneficiaries of the program on the basis of their religion.
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1663.822,1684.652,"You can't have a government program that gives out money indiscriminantly to certain organizations that say provide hospital services, and it would be unconstitutional if that included organizations that were religious organizations, as well as organizations that were not."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1686.202,1687.854,--Let me try to clarify.
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1687.854,1690.556,So you must positively disfavor religion?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1690.556,1691.556,"No, you must not."
2010.09-987,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1699.009,1707.749,How does this take the beneficiaries' religion into account when the program works perfectly in exactly the same way if it's a nonreligious school?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1709.934,1713.886,--Because the STOs are giving out government funds.
2010.09-987,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1719.992,1720.725,"No, no."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1733.75,1739.47,--The STO -- most money is given out by STOs that do care whether it goes to a religious school.
2010.09-987,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1739.47,1746.909,"The State money going to the STO, the State doesn't care whether it goes to a religious STO or a secular STO."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1746.909,1748.092,That doesn't matter.
2010.09-987,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1752.278,1767.204,"I thought we've held that when you have the decision is made by a private entity whether to use the money to go to a religious school or a nonreligious school, that that doesn't violate the Constitution because the decision is not made by the State, it is made by the private recipient."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1767.204,1776.494,"I believe the Court held the opposite in Bowen, where the decision to use the money for religious purposes was made by the grantee, not made by the government."
2010.09-987,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1817.304,1821.505,"I'm sorry, could we get -- just to get back to Bowen for a moment."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1821.505,1822.038,Yes.
2010.09-987,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1822.038,1827.592,The entities that were distributing the funds could be private or religious?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1827.592,1829.194,"Same as here, yeah."
2010.09-987,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1829.194,1832.813,The entities in Bowen were not identified.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1838.217,1841.752,I don't understand.
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1856.429,1859.131,Do we know that the schools here do that?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1866.701,1870.705,"Well, I think we do know that and the complaint alleges that, but that's not the point."
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1890.15,1897.756,"That's a great leap to say that it's government funds, that any money the government doesn't take from me because it gives me a deduction is government money."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1899.958,1901.458,This is money that the government takes from people.
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.458,1905.778,This money has never been in the government's coffers.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1908.061,1910.896,But it's money that's raised by the State's income tax.
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1919.752,1920.269,Well--
2010.09-987,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1920.269,1922.371,"I'll -- I'll give you credit, Mr. Bender."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1941.549,1942.516,But it does take it.
2010.09-987,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1942.516,1944.801,Let me ask you.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1964.614,1965.831,"The money -- no, it's not."
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1981.041,1982.843,Would you say the same thing about a tax deduction?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1982.843,1986.628,Would I say what about the tax deduction?
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1986.628,1988.247,That it's the government's money?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1988.247,1991.949,"No, I wouldn't because a tax deduction--"
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1991.949,1998.269,Because they are kind enough to give me a tax deduction -- because they are kind enough to give the taxpayer a deduction for certain contributions?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,1998.269,2006.125,"--Because when a taxpayer makes a charitable deduction, that charitable deduction is made from the taxpayer's money."
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2034.442,2036.994,Why isn't this true of a tax deduction also?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2051.82,2054.605,It doesn't turn on whether it's valuable or not.
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2079.138,2080.423,I completely don't understand that.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2098.884,2106.49,--The difference is -- that -- to me the broad difference is that the tax deduction is given for charitable contributions.
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2187.792,2188.459,Can I ask you--
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2188.459,2189.311,Whose money is it?
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2189.311,2191.661,--what difference does it say on their web sites?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2198.667,2199.184,No.
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2199.184,2203.302,--except to the extent that it deigns to allow private people to keep some of it.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2203.302,2203.936,I do not.
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2203.936,2205.088,It doesn't take it by taxes.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2205.088,2205.588,No.
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2205.588,2206.688,That's what your whole argument is based on.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2206.688,2208.373,"No, it isn't, Justice Alito."
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.565,2228.783,--They don't owe it to the government if they have made this contribution.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2229.933,2231.266,It's not a contribution.
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2231.266,2236.27,They don't owe the tax to the extent that they have given money to one of these institutions.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2246.359,2247.811,I -- I disagree with that.
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2248.277,2249.311,You owe the tax?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2249.311,2254.297,--If you look at the Arizona income tax form it says: Here's your income.
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.675,2275.461,That's the problem; they have to revise their form.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2275.461,2276.127,--No.
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2277.261,2278.663,So that it's a deduction before the line.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2280.829,2283.698,This is a government spending program.
2010.09-987,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2289.285,2292.654,If you assume that it is a -- I see your argument there.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2326.394,2333.714,The difference is that in Zelman the money went to the parents without any religious discrimination.
2010.09-987,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2367.268,2371.438,"But who here says to the parent who is going to the school, what is your religion?"
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2371.438,2373.255,The STO who gives them the scholarship.
2010.09-987,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2373.255,2378.14,"In other words, the STO gives the scholarship only to Catholics to go to Catholic schools--"
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2378.14,2378.457,Yes.
2010.09-987,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2378.457,2379.909,--only to Jews to go to Jewish schools?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2379.909,2380.925,"Exactly, exactly."
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2381.842,2392.467,But the government money you claim is at issue here is -- is the money that the contributor to the STO has failed to give to the government when it's the government's money.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2407.726,2408.309,--True.
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2408.309,2411.428,There's -- there is no religious discrimination in that choice.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2411.428,2414.146,"Let me -- let me put it to you this way, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2431.292,2433.294,"Perhaps not, but you have--"
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2433.294,2434.243,What's the difference?
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2434.243,2438.197,--You have an intervening parent or contributor.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2447.303,2447.803,No.
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2448.553,2449.619,And that was the same thing in Zelman.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2449.619,2452.871,"It's not a parent, by the way, in answer to Justice Kennedy's question before."
2010.09-987,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2466.948,2490.063,"Suppose they change one rule and the rule that the STOs had was this, they said: We will give you tuition if you otherwise qualify for your child to go to the school that you wish to go to, and if you are Jewish or you are Protestant and you want to go to St. Joseph's Catholic school, that's absolutely fine, they won't kick you out, and vice versa."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2492.415,2492.948,--Yes.
2010.09-987,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2493.798,2495.117,The answer is yes?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2495.117,2495.784,--Yes.
2010.09-987,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2495.784,2507.758,So the only thing you are challenging is the rule that they will not -- the STOs will not give the scholarship to a Protestant to go to a Catholic school.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2510.674,2527.885,We allege that the STOs that give out the majority of the funds -- I think now it's about 70 percent of the funds -- that the STOs that give out a majority of the funds only give the funds to parents who will send their child to a religious school--
2010.09-987,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2527.885,2528.302,Ah.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2529.004,2530.187,--designated by the STO.
2010.09-987,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2530.187,2531.789,--That's different.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2543.095,2544.981,That depends on the STO you go to.
2010.09-987,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2546.031,2550.101,--Your -- your complaint is only with the STOs that wouldn't let you send the child.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2550.101,2550.851,--Exactly.
2010.09-987,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2550.851,2552.953,We know that they exist because?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2552.953,2555.405,We allege they exist and no one doubts that.
2010.09-987,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2555.405,2556.239,I'm sorry.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2568.796,2569.748,Yes.
2010.09-987,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2569.748,2575.652,I thought another part of your complaint was that the STOs were giving just to the religious schools.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2575.652,2578.687,STOs don't give scholarships to religious schools.
2010.09-987,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2583.306,2584.508,But to attend that school?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2584.508,2585.508,"To attend that school, yes."
2010.09-987,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2585.508,2599.433,"So the essence of your complaint is that some of the STOs are requiring that the recipient, the recipient child, be of a particular religion?"
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2599.433,2610.206,"That, and some of the STOs are also requiring that in order to get the scholarship the parent agree to send the child to a particular religious school."
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2610.206,2612.741,"Oh, but that doesn't -- that doesn't get you there."
2010.09-987,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2616.46,2618.562,"But you are saying -- you are saying both, is that right, Mr. Bender?"
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2620.514,2621.314,"Both of them, yes."
2010.09-987,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2621.314,2627.418,Could I ask you: Is there -- do you understand the beneficiaries of this program?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2637.207,2640.492,The beneficiaries of this program are the parents and children.
2010.09-987,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2652.735,2660.556,"So I would assume, then, if the beneficiaries of the program are the parents, then it's the parents who have to be treated equally without regard to religion."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2660.556,2661.072,That's right.
2010.09-987,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2684.82,2696.276,"Mr. Bender, can I go back to your point -- you were making a distinction between a taxpayer who makes a charitable donation."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2723.893,2724.593,--Exactly.
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2743.438,2759.432,"So if Arizona had a statute that gave an income tax deduction only to individuals who make charitable contributions to educational institutions, there would be a problem there, because they -- it wasn't a general tax exception for charitable contributions?"
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2759.432,2760.566,"No, Justice Alito."
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2793.587,2807.663,"I thought your answer to Justice Ginsberg was the difference between this and the Federal tax deduction for charitable contributions was that the Federal tax deduction is available for a broad range of charities, whereas this is available only for a very narrow range."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2807.663,2809.615,--I may have misunderstood her question.
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.256,2853.308,The same thing is true of charitable deductions.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2896.571,2901.891,There is nothing unconstitutional about the taxpayers sending the money to an STO.
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.497,2913.199,But churches discriminate on the basis of religion.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2920.62,2932.41,"If the government said to you: You can pay your taxes -- don't pay your taxes to us, pay them to a church, and the church gave its benefits only to people of a certain religion, I believe that would be unconstitutional."
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2932.41,2933.294,So it's how the government puts it?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2945.235,2948.187,"No, it's the difference between charity and paying your taxes."
2010.09-987,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2973.901,2975.503,Excuse me.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2987.828,2993.714,--Contributions to STOs are deductible from one's income tax?
2010.09-987,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2993.714,2994.298,Right.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,2994.298,2996.583,"No, we would not have a problem with that."
2010.09-987,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2996.583,3002.404,So the only difference is that Arizona set up this system where you get a tax credit instead of a tax deduction?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3002.404,3003.27,Of course.
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3003.27,3008.058,And that would be true if even if the -- if the top marginal rate was 90 percent?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3008.058,3018.33,"Yes, it would be true only if the top marginal rate were 90 percent, which is never going to happen in Arizona, believe me."
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3018.33,3020.282,But the Federal rate has been that high--
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3020.282,3021.332,It's going in the other direction.
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3021.332,3021.999,--at times.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3021.999,3022.632,I understand.
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3022.632,3024.818,That's what the Establishment Clause terms on the--
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3024.818,3026.353,"Yes, because that's still charity."
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3062.026,3079.237,"--If this is government money, then why would it be constitutional, in your view, for this scheme to exist if -- for the -- if the STOs did not discriminate at all on the basis of religion?"
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3079.237,3082.939,--Because it's perfectly okay to use government money for non-religiously discriminatory purposes.
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3102.936,3114.993,"You have STOs that say: We will only give scholarships for religion affiliated schools, but we will not discriminate on the basis of the student's religion."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3114.993,3115.593,Right.
2010.09-987,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3115.593,3120.647,And if this is the government's money you think that would not be an Establishment Clause violation?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3120.647,3121.247,"No, no, no."
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3135.907,3139.775,"I thought you said the opposite earlier, I thought you said the opposite earlier."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3139.775,3140.425,I hope I didn't.
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3140.425,3142.894,I'm sure you did.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3142.894,3145.179,Thank you for correcting me.
2010.09-987,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3145.179,3146.246,What is the problem with that?
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3173.313,3175.646,I don't get your hypothetical.
2010.09-987,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3175.646,3192.291,"What they do is they have government money, just like you claim this is, and they say we are going to give it to umbrella organizations like the Association Of Catholics, Jewish or secular hospitals and we expect them to distribute it."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3208.133,3210.485,It depends on who the beneficiaries of the government--
2010.09-987,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3210.485,3224.412,"The beneficiaries of the government, Catholic hospital -- government CAT scan program will be Catholic hospitals, because they're the ones who belong to the Catholic Hospital Association."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3235.451,3236.903,--I'm not clear on your program.
2010.09-987,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3244.89,3255.847,"The government says -- that's the different -- the government says -- it does give the money away on a religiously neutral basis, it gives it to hospital associations."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3263.934,3267.988,"But the hospitals are the beneficiaries, Justice Breyer, that's the difference."
2010.09-987,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3294.121,3297.239,"I'm sorry, I don't understand the answer to Justice Breyer's question."
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3311.732,3317.552,"Well, if the hospitals are the beneficiary of the program, then the hospitals have to get the money on a religiously neutral basis."
2010.09-987,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3317.552,3317.952,Well--
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3317.952,3323.29,The analogy would be the patients are the beneficiaries of the program.
2010.09-987,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3338.834,3341.869,That's the other issue.
2010.09-987,2,37685,paul_bender,,3369.269,3375.757,If I go to get a scholarship from an organization and they say where are you going to send your child with this scholarship?
2010.09-987,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3394.921,3395.671,"--Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-987,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3398.456,3404.026,Thank you.
2010.09-987,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3434.459,3441.379,"Flast, I looked at again briefly, and it seemed to use that wonderfully precise word nexus."
2010.09-987,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3475.786,3476.786,"--Justice Breyer, two things."
2010.09-987,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3488.194,3492.396,Was that in that instance in Flast -- does Flast rule out?
2010.09-987,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3492.396,3496.364,And that's the general description Flast says about how taxpayer standing will go forward.
2010.09-987,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3513.909,3518.046,"General Katyal, Flast could not have meant that it is your particular dollar."
2010.09-987,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3537.425,3541.329,I disagree -- first is I don't think that is what Flast is.
2010.09-987,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3558.921,3572.531,"Flast talk about a nexus the way Justice Breyer said and here is a taxpayer challenging a provision of the tax code, an active pursuant to the tax and spending power that grants a tax benefit."
2010.09-987,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3576.749,3581.553,"Again, I think that doesn't deal with the direct injury on the taxpayer, which is the language of Flast."
2010.09-987,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3663.939,3664.889,"Thank you, General."
