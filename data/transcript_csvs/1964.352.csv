1964.352,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,41.557,"Number 352, General Motors Corporation, Petitioner, versus District of Columbia."
1964.352,0,20550,donald_k_barnes,,46.005,49.073,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1506.817,1510.966,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1964.352,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1632.274,1633.248,What did you say?
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1633.248,1637.389,It has not been proved on this record sir.
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1651.351,1655.362,Well what if -- what if that had been -- what if the record was clear in that regard?
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1656.428,1656.48,No sir.
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.48,1658.162,-- position at all.
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1658.162,1663.138,It wouldn't change my position because of this Mr. Justice White.
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.061,1690.736,And on -- on either -- on due process or any other ground.
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1690.736,1698.712,I should think not sir because the Congress is enacting a taxing statute for the District of Columbia.
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1698.712,1703.239,"Well, don't you just don't have to get to this position?"
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1718.42,1721.575,"If we use this regulation, that is true sir."
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1725.156,1732.847,"And in that case of course, it would be clear that at least some activities outside the District contributed to that income."
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1747.134,1774.441,"Well, I don't know sir whether the extreme that you mentioned would be supportable or not but if it were not supportable and I would suggest sir that we would be probably required to adopt some other method of determining the amount of income in the case of a corporation to which you refer which would be subject to taxes income derived from District sources."
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.441,1778.411,Would that -- is that really different from what you're doing here?
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1778.411,1802.498,"Well, I think the Court of Appeals has in its decisions and in its statements on this matter why it clearly indicated that if in the particular circumstances, the district's regulatory approach is not an adequate approach then another method for determining the amount of incomes of it to be taxed is to be used or devised if you will sir."
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.498,1812.473,The question is whether -- whether the district's -- what is the -- what the -- does the statute require this method or does it authorize it?
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1814.141,1814.282,Well --
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1814.282,1830.041,"You would say that -- you would say that in the example, the single corporation example is that the District could if it wanted to tax 100% of these sales as far as the Constitution is concerned."
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1830.893,1859.759,"I would say this sir, in response to your inquiry, unless the statute which calls such a result of this presupposes that the regulation policy statute and therefore is valid of itself unless the statute accomplishing such an action were to be held invalid then the effect to which you allude would not of course be invalid under the constitutional premise."
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1870.411,1870.823,But really --
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1870.823,1871.387,I don't know the answer --
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1871.387,1874.253,I will ask you this again.
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1894.684,1895.194,That sir --
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1895.194,1896.944,You don't deny that do you?
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1896.944,1900.099,But it depends on how you mean that sir.
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.335,1929.15,You're taking all the sales the -- the -- you're -- you're claiming the credit for the net income from all of these sales within the District.
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1929.15,1930.851,No sir.
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1930.851,1931.289,What are you --
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1931.289,1931.755,Not exactly.
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1931.755,1932.71,-- (Voice Overlap) the credit for?
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1932.71,1940.449,Since our tax or our apportionment has been determined upon General Motors' total net income --
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1940.449,1941.133,Yes.
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1941.133,1953.302,-- and I must say that net income exclude or has had excluded from it certain sales to the United States where the statute does not permit us to tax the income from the sale.
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.324,1999.494,"You are asserting that there's net income earned in the District of Columbia, aren't you?"
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,1999.494,2000.184,Oh yes!
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2001.833,2007.29,And you're -- and you're saying it was -- it was derived from sales in the District.
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,2007.29,2009.095,"No sir, not entirely."
1964.352,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2009.095,2010.203,And where are you saying this derived?
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,2010.203,2019.325,We say that it was derived from the totality of the activities of General Motors in the District of Columbia.
1964.352,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2056.34,2093.869,I thought that (Inaudible)
1964.352,1,28301,henry_e_wixon,,2093.869,2127.371,"I -- in response to Mr. Justice White's question, suggest the possibility, I don't attempt to answer it unequivocally because I'm not certain of the answer that we would have to devise under such circumstance a different formula and a different approach because carried to its extreme, the number of these apportionment formulas could be demonstrated in some respect in order to be illogical and inapplicable."
1964.352,2,20550,donald_k_barnes,,3349.96,3352.558,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.352,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3400.149,3401.685,What did you say about the Commerce Clause?
1964.352,2,20550,donald_k_barnes,,3401.685,3414.981,"I said that the Commerce Clause binds the District Commissioners though not the Congress that is the freedom that the Congress has to deal with interstate commerce, this Court has held it cannot be delegated to the local legislative body within the District."
1964.352,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3415.024,3417.823,But the Congress does have full power to regulate.
1964.352,2,20550,donald_k_barnes,,3417.823,3418.593,Yes.
1964.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3547.572,3558.098,"Now, Mr. Barnes the Tax Court seemed -- it seems to me found that -- that some of this income that was taxed here was earned elsewhere."
1964.352,2,20550,donald_k_barnes,,3558.098,3559.448,That is correct.
1964.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3559.448,3564.247,If it -- do you read the Court of Apples as disturbing that finding?
1964.352,2,20550,donald_k_barnes,,3564.247,3566.589,The Court of Appeals said it was irrelevant.
1964.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3566.589,3569.028,But they didn't disturb it though.
1964.352,2,20550,donald_k_barnes,,3569.028,3569.198,No.
1964.352,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3581.714,3588.361,I don't care -- I don't (Voice Overlap) the same questions as to whether there is double taxation or not.
1964.352,2,20550,donald_k_barnes,,3594.086,3601.525,They did not and the -- and the finding was never challenged any -- at any point.
