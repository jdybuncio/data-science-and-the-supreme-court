1983.82-729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.326,We will hear arguments next in Donald T. Regan against Time Magazine.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,47.212,48.729,Thank you.
1983.82-729,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,407.893,411.719,"Mr. Schulder, may I ask--"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,411.719,412.046,Certainly.
1983.82-729,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,412.046,416.046,"--are these the three illustrations that are involved in this case, Page 37?"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,416.046,421.981,"The illustrations begin on Page 13 of the Joint Appendix, Your Honor."
1983.82-729,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,421.981,424.793,But the ones actually at issue here are the--
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,424.793,430.743,"No, the ones actually at issue here are 13 through--"
1983.82-729,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,430.743,431.632,--Thank you.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,431.632,432.444,--23.
1983.82-729,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,432.444,433.333,Thank you.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,433.333,450.907,The problem with Time's exaggerated portrayal of its First Amendment interest in this case is that Time's editors and publishers in fact may use pictures of currency symbolically.
1983.82-729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,504.042,510.586,"Mr. Schulder, I guess there is more involved here than simply the size and color limitation, though."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,539.009,540.448,"Well, we would--"
1983.82-729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,540.448,551.96,"I would be very interested in hearing you focus on that and tell us exactly, how you would suggest the Court narrow the statute precisely."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,551.96,552.553,--Certainly.
1983.82-729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,578.371,582.368,"Well, I suppose there is an overbreadth challenge that we have to deal with?"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,582.368,582.914,That's correct.
1983.82-729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,582.914,585.023,"So we need to talk about it, do we not?"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,585.023,585.632,Certainly.
1983.82-729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,699.119,708.147,"Well, For example, you agree, don't you, that it is very difficult to support the requirement that it be determined whether something is newsworthy."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,708.147,709.41,--That's correct.
1983.82-729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,709.41,710.144,Okay.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,717.361,718.048,Okay.
1983.82-729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,726.967,733.666,"You are telling me why we should do something, or background, but why don't you tell us what it is you think we should do specifically?"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,734.15,734.914,--We suggest--
1983.82-729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,734.914,735.822,--How should it be interpreted?
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,736.618,756.657,"--We suggest that the Court construe the statute narrowly, so that the statute would permit the printing of illustrations of obligations or securities of the United States in publications so long as those illustrations comply with the three conditions set out in the statute."
1983.82-729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,756.657,758.217,Any kind of publication for any purpose.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,758.217,759.028,That's correct.
1983.82-729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,778.303,790.204,At one point you suggested that we might strike down that section altogether and leave only 474 in place.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,790.204,792.034,"Well, we didn't suggest that, Your Honor."
1983.82-729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,825.519,836.153,Aren't we always in a sensitive area when you have a statute authorizing some government official to decide what is or what is not newsworthy?
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,836.153,845.293,"That's correct, Your Honor, and that is why we have proposed this narrowing construction of the statute, which we feel is fully consistent with Congress's intent--"
1983.82-729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,845.293,846.838,"Well, how do you narrow that construction?"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,846.838,847.54,--Excuse me?
1983.82-729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,847.54,851.711,"How do you narrow the phrase in the exception,"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,857.928,871.985,"Well, the way we have suggested that it be construed is that these various purposes and forums be looked at as illustrative."
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.74,910.61,"Mr. Schulder, even if we didn't agree, even if we said that we couldn't agree with you based on the legislative history, and certainly not the language of the statute, that that is what Congress intended."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,926.945,929.288,"--I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.288,930.646,We have done it before.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,943.969,944.593,That's correct.
1983.82-729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,944.593,949.312,May I inquire?
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,960.258,966.353,"Well, also the requirement that the illustration be included in a publication of some sort."
1983.82-729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.353,966.806,I see.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,971.317,971.895,That's correct.
1983.82-729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.895,975.065,"And it could be for any kind of story, not just about the item."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,975.065,975.615,That's correct.
1983.82-729,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1016.427,1026.999,"Mr. Schulder, what did the illustrations in the appendix failed to comply with other than color?"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1026.999,1033.075,"Certain illustrations failed to comply with the size provisions of the statute, Your Honor."
1983.82-729,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1056.284,1063.062,"Mr. Schulder, may I ask, does this... do either of these statutes reach one of these things on a television screen?"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1063.062,1077.806,"No, the statute does not... 504, Subsection 2, specifically excludes any prohibition on motion picture films, microfilms, or slides that are used for--"
1983.82-729,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1077.806,1083.568,So what Time did here could be done on a television screen or in a motion picture?
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1083.568,1084.586,--That's correct.
1983.82-729,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1084.586,1085.725,But not in a journal or magazine.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1086.88,1108.011,"And the reason for that is that the Treasury Department advised Congress that motion pictures or TV use could not be used for counterfeiting purposes, but there is a restriction in the statute that all of the materials that are used to prepare motion pictures or these other uses be destroyed after their use."
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.043,1112.777,What is the purpose of the size limitation?
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1119.149,1120.743,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.743,1132.316,"Well, it would seem to me that something in color, if it were large enough or small enough, no one would ever mistake it for the real thing."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1132.316,1136.095,"Well, the problem--"
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1136.095,1138.766,"I mean, it doesn't make any difference how large or small it is."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1141.328,1141.968,--That's correct.
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.32,1160.209,"Sure, but--"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1160.209,1172.001,"--Now, even in the case of a color reproduction that is overblown or blown up, the main problem there is in the process of producing it."
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1179.391,1190.104,--So the United States submits that it is dangerous to the currency to publish an oversized or undersized--
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1190.104,1194.183,--Color illustration.
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.183,1195.805,--photograph if it is in color.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1195.805,1196.663,That's correct.
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1196.663,1201.911,"Even if anybody would know automatically, just at a glance, that that is not the real thing."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1201.911,1211.691,"That's correct, because the process that is used to create that photograph is identical to the process that is used by a vast majority of counterfeiters."
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.691,1218.484,"I know, but if it is the process, if it is the process, what do you care about the results of the process being circulated?"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1233.26,1251.829,"Well, but by limiting the use of... by restricting or prohibiting the making of color photographs, the statute narrows the universe of publishers who are going to have materials that are capable of printing currency in color."
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1261.043,1262.108,I see.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1262.108,1263.044,Now--
1983.82-729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1263.044,1264.682,"I must confess, I don't really follow that."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1281.161,1283.002,--I'm not sure I understand.
1983.82-729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.002,1292.014,"Well, as I understand it, you are suggesting that in order to have the expertise, in order to take pictures of money, you have to actually take pictures of money."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1293.359,1293.843,"Oh, no."
1983.82-729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.825,1296.311,--your general ability as a photo offsetter.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1296.311,1296.67,No.
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1305.369,1305.946,"Well, it really isn't."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1314.006,1318.269,"--Well, there may be another statute that prohibits--"
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1318.269,1319.267,"Well, I know, but--"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1319.267,1320.628,--publication of foreign currency.
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1320.628,1338.075,"--but I can't believe, like Justice Stevens, that your just prohibiting photographing, publishing photographs of currency in color would make any dent in the process, because there would be hundreds of other things that they would be using the same process--"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1338.075,1340.025,It is not a question of making a dent in the process.
1983.82-729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1359.486,1365.359,--Then wouldn't you have to get rid of all photo offset people?
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1365.359,1371.935,"No, you would just have to... no, the problem is not with the photo offset--"
1983.82-729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1371.935,1373.966,Isn't that the only way you could be sure?
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1373.966,1376.793,--The photo offset process is not the problem.
1983.82-729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1377.745,1378.653,What is the problem?
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1378.653,1393.646,"--The problem is the potential use of that process to create color negatives of currency, which is precisely the same method that counterfeiters use to produce counterfeit currency."
1983.82-729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1393.646,1401.734,"Yes, but, Mr. Schulder, if I may, they argue their best case is the particular things in the record, so we perhaps don't even need hypothetical examples."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1420.199,1430.724,"No, the plate of that particular photograph would not necessarily be of use to a counterfeiter, although--"
1983.82-729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.724,1435.302,"Is there any government interest, legitimate government interest in preventing this particular picture?"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1435.302,1450.638,"--I would submit that there is, there is, that actually the final product here on Page 19 of the Joint Appendix does pose a possible counterfeiting problem, and I would also refer the Court--"
1983.82-729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1450.638,1451.449,"Well, what is the problem?"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1451.449,1456.012,"--Well, I would like to refer the Court to the preceding page also, Page 17."
1983.82-729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.884,1459.432,I see it on 17.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1460.774,1461.273,--Okay.
1983.82-729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1493.369,1493.869,I see.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1495.916,1497.51,"Well, it would seem to me that someone--"
1983.82-729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1497.51,1499.491,How would this hurt or help that?
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1499.491,1509.537,--This would prevent someone from being able to cut out the number ten--
1983.82-729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1509.537,1516.142,"Well, instead of cutting out this, why not cut a dollar bill, which is rather available?"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1516.142,1519.733,"--No, the problem isn't cutting a dollar bill."
1983.82-729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1521.5,1524.436,They are pretty available now.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1524.436,1526.48,But no one is going to--
1983.82-729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1526.48,1527.216,I even have one.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1527.871,1531.994,--No one is going to destroy a ten dollar bill in order to pass counterfeit.
1983.82-729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1532.634,1533.962,I thought you said they did.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1537.523,1540.225,"--Well, they cut an illustration of a bill."
1983.82-729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1540.225,1542.974,"All this does is, it saves the counterfeiter ten bucks?"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1542.974,1545.194,That's correct.
1983.82-729,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1545.194,1546.738,It hasn't run them out of business.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1555.453,1555.921,Certainly.
1983.82-729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1555.921,1556.564,--onto a one dollar bill.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1556.564,1557.329,Certainly.
1983.82-729,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.329,1558.171,I understand.
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1558.171,1576.272,"And I think the example is even more graphically illustrated in the one on Page 17, where the size is almost identical to the size of real currency, and you are dealing here with a thousand dollar bill, which are rarer... they are not really in circulation, general circulation."
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1576.272,1586.256,"If these had been oversized, or sufficiently oversized or sufficiently undersized, it still would violate the law if it were in color."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1586.256,1587.598,If it were in color.
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.145,1593.392,That is still not at all... I'm not sure I understand your color--
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1593.392,1605.417,"--Well, the problem is... the problem that Congress was trying to get at was to eliminate the possibility that there would be multiple plates and negatives of currency."
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1611.789,1614.273,"--We just couldn't rely on them to destroy them, I take it."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1615.255,1615.739,--That's correct.
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1615.739,1616.301,Is that the worry?
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1616.301,1616.893,That's correct.
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.893,1622.407,"So it isn't the process, it is the fact that there are plates and negatives that they would be using."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1622.407,1623.488,That's right.
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1623.488,1630.405,"Because if they are taking a picture of an actual bill, what would they do?"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1641.433,1648.538,"Well, the plate could be different sizes."
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1649.068,1654.254,"Well, I know, but if it were sufficiently large, no counterfeiter could use it."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1654.254,1657.612,--That may be.
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.612,1661.485,"Well, still, then, I don't understand the--"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1661.485,1662.034,Well--
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1662.034,1667.781,"--First you say it is the process, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense."
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1669.544,1675.511,"--Well, by the process, I mean the materials that are used in the process of producing the final product."
1983.82-729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1675.511,1680.182,"Are you using plate in the sense that the plate is the process, part of the process?"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1680.182,1680.962,That's correct.
1983.82-729,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1680.962,1692.583,"Well, do you think at some point in reproducing a color photograph there is some plate that is exactly the same... a negative that is exactly the same size as a--"
1983.82-729,0,23151,elliott_schulder,,1692.583,1696.331,Yes.
1983.82-729,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1797.055,1801.055,Very well.
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,1803.598,1824.542,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the central issue in this case is the right of Time or anyone to make or publish pictures that pose no substantial risk to any legitimate government concern."
1983.82-729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.136,1864.54,But you have heard this before?
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,1864.54,1867.726,I have heard that that happens?
1983.82-729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1867.726,1869.118,Earlier in this case?
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,1869.118,1872.46,"No, earlier in this case I have never heard it before."
1983.82-729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1876.442,1878.255,How was it just a picture case to begin with--
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,1878.255,1901.901,"We brought this case because the statute as written and indeed as interpreted by the government prevents us from printing this picture of George Washington, and our basic thesis was that there is no danger in this picture to the currency and there is no danger in the plate that was used to make this picture."
1983.82-729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.114,1914.411,--Is there a distortion there except the size?
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,1914.411,1916.693,--There is a distortion there in the--
1983.82-729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1916.693,1917.956,"No, on the George Washington."
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,1917.956,1929.701,"--Yes, there is distortions in the overlays, just as in the Lockheed cover, which was a thousand dollar bill, you have overlays."
1983.82-729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1929.701,1939.976,"Yes, sir, I was wondering which... when you cut off the thousand dollar figure and paste it on a one dollar bill, what do you do with Washington's picture?"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,1939.976,1942.632,"Well, you probably--"
1983.82-729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1942.632,1943.724,"I mean, he was talking about that."
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,1943.724,1955.626,"--I don't know, and I submit that when you pass a thousand dollar bill, while perhaps people don't look very closely when they get handed a one dollar bill, although--"
1983.82-729,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1955.626,1958.921,You can starve to death when a thousand dollar bill is going to give you cash.
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,1960.922,1963.34,--I do not think that that is a significant danger.
1983.82-729,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1981.537,1983.924,Wasn't Wagner a woman?
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,1983.924,1984.973,--Excuse me?
1983.82-729,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1984.973,1987.051,Wasn't Wagner a woman?
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,1987.051,1988.939,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-729,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1996.594,1998.029,It happens to be an Eight Circuit case.
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2008.369,2009.243,That's a good question.
1983.82-729,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2009.243,2013.069,"I think it is Mr. Cleveland, isn't it?"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2013.069,2014.492,Grover Cleveland.
1983.82-729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2015.662,2028.753,"But I suppose perhaps the suggestion is that so few people, including some present here, are familiar with thousand dollar bills that a person could be deceived."
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2030.797,2041.59,"Well, if that is part of the government's claim, the one thing I would know is that if I was handed a thousand dollar bill with Washington, Jackson, Hamilton, Franklin, or Grant on it, I would be very suspicious."
1983.82-729,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2070.625,2079.575,"Well, what if it were narrowed, as the government is arguing, so that all that is left is a color and size limitation?"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2079.575,2098.238,"--And I believe the government is now also still claiming that there would be a publication limitation, which we might be covered in in terms of an exemption, but it raises several problems for both Gail Wagner and people who might want to tear out the cover of Time Magazine and place it on their wall."
1983.82-729,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2166.195,2170.18,"Well, but you can put on a thousand other covers in color without putting this one on."
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2170.18,2171.912,Excuse me?
1983.82-729,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2171.912,2178.973,"I say, you can... if you want a colored cover, you can pick a thousand other subjects to do with money without printing a picture of George Washington--"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2178.973,2195.074,"That is true, but I did not think that unless the government can demonstrate in the first instance that there is a substantial interest as being furthered of theirs that they have the right to tell me, go write and illustrate some other story, or put your story about the economy, but don't use this symbol."
1983.82-729,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2195.074,2201.494,--They say that the interest that is being furthered is the danger of helping counterfeiters.
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2201.494,2203.214,But there is no danger.
1983.82-729,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2203.214,2207.632,"Well, if the Congress has said that, why should you or I try to second guess that?"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2207.632,2218.021,"Because Congress, when they are passing laws that restrict speech, are supposed to make an effort to draw lines that are reasonable."
1983.82-729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2257.691,2263.189,"May I ask you, would you have any objection if the statute merely had the size limit in it?"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2263.189,2264.734,Only had the size limit?
1983.82-729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.734,2267.279,"It would be perfectly all right, I gather, under your argument."
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2267.279,2268.983,I have got a couple of problems.
1983.82-729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2276.26,2278.774,Assuming that the size applies to parts as well.
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2278.774,2279.476,--Okay.
1983.82-729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2311.48,2319.572,"But you could still come in and say, but we really can't make quite as dramatic a symbol unless we have an exact size dollar bill on the cover--"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2319.572,2337.502,"But if the government were to demonstrate that there was a serious danger for bills that were one and a quarter the time... times the size of the actual thing, and Congress then passed the line there, our case would be very weak, I submit."
1983.82-729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.838,2374.567,"--Well, what if we held it unconstitutional, Congress had a committee meeting, and they studied it at great length, say, we have thought about this, and we think the statute we used to have was absolutely necessary, and they wrote a lot of findings saying that it is kind of remote, but we think there is a danger that people might copy it if we don't, so they re-enacted precisely the same statute after lots of hearings and lots of legislative history."
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2375.752,2392.402,"I don't think so, because I don't think that there would be any legislative history that could show that you need to prevent these kinds of pictures or these kinds of plates, even, to control what you are trying to stop, the impact on counterfeiting."
1983.82-729,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2392.402,2405.739,"Do you think the fact that there is a specific provision in the Constitution permitting Congress to enact legislation in this area gives it more significance, the power of Congress?"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2405.739,2406.784,Not--
1983.82-729,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2406.784,2410.254,We are not dealing with the necessary and proper clause.
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2412.957,2423.607,--I do not think that that has bearing on whether or not they are passing statutes that in fact further the interest against counterfeiting.
1983.82-729,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2432.01,2444.052,"I suppose trademark laws impact on the First Amendment rights of your client, don't they?"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2444.052,2445.05,Yes.
1983.82-729,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2445.05,2451.285,Are they unconstitutional because you can't print something that has a trademark?
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2451.285,2455.048,"No, those are not unconstitutional."
1983.82-729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2476.726,2481.287,Could the Treasury... Could the Secretary of the Treasury copyright all of his currency symbols?
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2481.287,2483.113,--I don't believe so.
1983.82-729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2483.113,2484.083,Why not?
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2484.083,2488.299,Let me amend that.
1983.82-729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2494.079,2494.609,The whole thing.
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2494.609,2495.487,The whole thing?
1983.82-729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2518.864,2521.41,Let me pursue one of the other hypotheticals given.
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2563.049,2568.188,"Yes, I think, as I said before, that would be a different case, if those findings were made."
1983.82-729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2583.261,2588.447,"But you do agree that this is a balancing process, from what you responded."
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2588.447,2602.129,"That there is some element of balancing in that once the government demonstrates that this is advancing in some way their interest, then maybe our First Amendment rights to some extent have to give way, but there has been no such demonstration."
1983.82-729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2602.129,2617.561,"Frequently we either modify or strike down a statute because we conclude or other courts conclude that there are less intrusive, less difficult means of accomplishing the same objective."
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2630.444,2639.55,"Yes, once you are convinced that the government has demonstrated that this is a danger."
1983.82-729,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2669.775,2675.897,"Mr. Gold, how would the government go about demonstrating what you said it must demonstrate?"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2681.033,2688.453,"Well, to demonstrate a need to do what they want to do, I don't believe they could."
1983.82-729,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2688.453,2694.747,Do you agree as a starter that the government does have a compelling interest to protect its own currency?
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2694.747,2696.248,To protect against counterfeiting?
1983.82-729,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2696.95,2697.418,Yes.
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2697.418,2697.84,It does.
1983.82-729,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2723.268,2727.608,Have you put your hand to a draft of a statute that you think would meet your views?
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2727.608,2733.013,"As a matter of fact, I did attempt the first--"
1983.82-729,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2733.013,2735.653,Is it in your brief anywhere?
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2736.573,2737.4,"--No, it is not."
1983.82-729,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2784.791,2791.24,"When you say, when you use the term ""exact likeness"", that is exactly what counterfeiters do."
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2799.656,2813.729,"Well, but the government, if I understand them, does not want, or one of their big pitches to you has been, we need... we can't catch people when they are in the act of the counterfeiting."
1983.82-729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2824.601,2830.412,"Mr. Gold, you and your friend have both focused on currency."
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2836.969,2842.245,Anything that comes within the definition of an obligation.
1983.82-729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2842.245,2842.947,Any obligation of the government.
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2842.947,2843.341,Yes.
1983.82-729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2843.341,2865.548,"Now, there are a great many, probably many millions of people in this country who have never seen a government bond, but if they were confronted by something that looked the way they thought a government bond probably looks, there being as many gullible people in this country as we constantly read about, frequently in Time Magazine--"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2876.186,2876.623,Right.
1983.82-729,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2926.478,2933.427,"Mr. Gold, you never have told me how Congress could demonstrate what you think is necessary."
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2933.427,2945.297,"I would think if there were... if the government came in, for instance, as I said, and presented a problem of plates existing--"
1983.82-729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2945.297,2945.905,Tell me where.
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2946.747,2947.811,--Into Congress.
1983.82-729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.811,2949.512,"Oh, into Congress?"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2951.403,2951.934,Well--
1983.82-729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2951.934,2954.121,--we put it of record in this lawsuit?
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2954.121,2954.574,--No--
1983.82-729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2954.574,2956.403,"You want it by testimony, witnesses?"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,2956.403,2962.229,"--Justice White, the record in this lawsuit, certainly in the district court, there is no evidence from the government."
1983.82-729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3021.205,3024.468,You don't think Paragraph 6 furthers their interest at all?
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,3024.468,3042.352,"It furthers their interest in the sense if you are going to accept that, if it in any way furthers it, it does, because certainly they are closing a tiny loophole that may exist, but I don't believe in the First Amendment context--"
1983.82-729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3042.352,3052.658,"Well, I suppose if the people at Time Magazine, if this was the law and if Time Magazine obeyed it, they wouldn't have to worry about plates at Time Magazine."
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,3052.658,3054.612,--They wouldn't have to worry about plates at Time Magazine--
1983.82-729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3054.612,3056.394,Or any other publisher.
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,3056.394,3062.828,"--But... Well, they would still have to check them if they wanted to make sure that no one was creating the plates."
1983.82-729,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3062.828,3064.543,"Well, I know, but that is their point."
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,3073.353,3095.83,"Your Honor, clearly, if ease of enforcement were the only test here, and I think this Court has stated in the Village Schaumburg case that ease of enforcement is not enough to get them over the hurdle before they put our burden on demonstrating why we must have the ability to print these pictures and express ourselves in that way."
1983.82-729,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3204.052,3214.125,"Mr. Gold, may I ask if there is anything at all in the legislative history to indicate that any publisher, Time or anyone else, has ever asked Congress to make certain exceptions such as you are asking us to make?"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,3227.494,3229.056,I think there are two answers to that.
1983.82-729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3362.502,3368.187,Let me ask you one hypothetical that may seem very far-fetched to you.
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,3416.576,3431.004,"I would submit, and I understand the teachings of cases like Grayned that we can't expect mathematical certainty, but that case, I don't believe that that person would be asserting a First Amendment right to go 31 miles an hour."
1983.82-729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3441.876,3451.231,"The First Amendment has been thought to cover the right to travel, so it wouldn't take a genius lawyer to bring this in."
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,3451.231,3476.94,"--Well, that is true, and in that showing the burden, if there had been a showing that that furthered the government's purpose, in fact, and there had been some showing, right or wrong, and the infringement on the First Amendment right was the ability to... whether you could go that extra mile, then I would say that is a different case and that probably would be affirmed."
1983.82-729,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3479.424,3486.623,"Mr. Gold, was the substance of 474 enacted way back in 1864?"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,3486.623,3487.485,"Yes, it was."
1983.82-729,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3487.485,3499.121,"And you are taking the position that it has been for all those years a substantial infringement of free speech, for 119 years?"
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,3499.121,3503.493,"It sat there as one, yes."
1983.82-729,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3511.255,3515.658,But free speech in the United States has suffered as a result of this for all of those years?
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,3515.658,3526.889,"--I submit it has suffered when people have tried to do these things and been told they couldn't or suffered the consequences, Gail Wagner."
1983.82-729,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3554.221,3557.984,"Mr. Gold, I owe you an apology."
1983.82-729,1,41352,stuart_m_gold,,3566.653,3569.432,Thank you.
1983.82-729,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3577.259,3581.662,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Schulder?"
1983.82-729,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3581.662,3583.771,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-729,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3585.768,3587.456,Two minutes you have.
1983.82-729,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3587.456,3602.06,"First of all, Time tells us that Congress was in effect foolish to think that the statutory restrictions in this case would be affected, but we submit that that is really not something that this Court should quickly second guess."
1983.82-729,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3668.64,3673.577,I take it your position is that Congress could prohibit the manufacture of wooden nickels.
1983.82-729,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3673.577,3677.309,"Well, we don't have to go that far in this case."
1983.82-729,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3677.309,3678.108,"Well, I don't know why not."
1983.82-729,2,23151,elliott_schulder,,3679.84,3682.386,It conceivably could.
1983.82-729,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3725.288,3726.271,"Thank you, gentlemen."
