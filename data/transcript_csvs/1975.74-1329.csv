1975.74-1329,0,43387,telford_taylor,,31.172,34.33,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1975.74-1329,1,32070,james_a_major,,1455.213,1460.413,-- and members of the Court.
1975.74-1329,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1473.171,1476.897,Will things change if it is a democratic or a republic intent?
1975.74-1329,1,32070,james_a_major,,1476.897,1477.799,"Yes, indeed."
1975.74-1329,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1481.757,1486.696,"Mr. Ordell’s town councilman, what is the town’s position?"
1975.74-1329,1,32070,james_a_major,,1486.696,1487.979,I beg your pardon?
1975.74-1329,2,43387,telford_taylor,,2579.43,2592.544,"If the question, Your Honor, is whether it can be done by a postcard, that is to say by mail, that is one matter to which the New Jersey Court did advert, but in a somewhat ambivalent way."
1975.74-1329,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2687.2,2712.968,"New Jersey practice, if you are that familiar with it, could not the Courts, as most Courts could, have a narrowing construction of this ordinance say that you need not specify a party or a candidate, but merely are required to say that you will be soliciting support in connection with that election?"
1975.74-1329,2,43387,telford_taylor,,2712.968,2722.173,"Well, I must confess that I do not know in detail the New Jersey decisions on the scope of an Appellate Court’s interpretative power there."
1975.74-1329,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2722.173,2723.412,"(Inaudible) I mean, the State Courts --"
1975.74-1329,2,43387,telford_taylor,,2723.412,2728.19,That is why I say I do not know the scope of New Jersey law on the --
1975.74-1329,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2728.19,2730.068,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1329,2,43387,telford_taylor,,2730.068,2732.642,"I should hope so, Mr. Justice Brennan, yes."
1975.74-1329,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2732.642,2742.744,Do you suppose a state could say to solicitors “please knock before you enter the house”?
1975.74-1329,2,43387,telford_taylor,,2742.744,2743.475,"Yes, I should think so."
1975.74-1329,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2745.856,2749.782,"Well, so that is another criminal law like this one is."
1975.74-1329,2,43387,telford_taylor,,2764.717,2779.817,"Well, this Court said in Bird against Alexandria that failing some explicit withdrawal of the invitation on the part of the householder that the front pass or the door knocker relieve the entry of the character of trespass."
1975.74-1329,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2779.817,2780.983,Up to the door?
1975.74-1329,2,43387,telford_taylor,,2780.983,2784.527,Up to the door.
1975.74-1329,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2784.527,2804.419,"I do not know that any times are indicated here, but would you think it would be fatal to such a provision if it said “during daylight hours only” or “not after 9 p.m.”?"
1975.74-1329,2,43387,telford_taylor,,2804.419,2805.699,"The latter, certainly."
1975.74-1329,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2845.426,2855.957,"In other words, the limitations of daylight hours might be unreasonable with limitation to canvassing up to 9 p.m., would be reasonable?"
1975.74-1329,2,43387,telford_taylor,,2855.957,2860.992,"Well, certainly the impingement of First Amendment values would be much than a 9 p.m. case."
1975.74-1329,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2872.36,2876.266,"Mr. Taylor, the basic ordinance to which this is an exception --"
1975.74-1329,2,43387,telford_taylor,,2876.266,2876.682,Yes.
1975.74-1329,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2876.682,2883.017,"-- number 573 is, of course described in more detail --"
1975.74-1329,2,43387,telford_taylor,,2883.017,2883.256,Yes.
1975.74-1329,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2883.256,2894.913,"Among other things, it has a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. restriction, but it is my understanding, you tell me if I am mistaken in that understanding, that none of the provisions of 573 carry over it into this ordinance."
1975.74-1329,2,43387,telford_taylor,,2897.011,2899.877,Only the penalty provision that is carried over by way of --
1975.74-1329,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2899.877,2901.948,You mean that was remedy?
1975.74-1329,2,43387,telford_taylor,,2901.948,2903.401,"That was remedy, yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1329,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2903.401,2907.225,So none of the substantive provision carry over into the ordinance now before us?
1975.74-1329,2,43387,telford_taylor,,2907.225,2909.128,"That is my understanding, that is my understanding."
1975.74-1329,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2909.51,2910.045,Thank you gentlemen.
