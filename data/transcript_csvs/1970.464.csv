1970.464,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.715,"We’ll hear arguments next in 464, Gainesville Utilities against Florida Power Corporation."
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,41.938,43.787,"Well, procedurally they’re completely separated?"
1970.464,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,43.787,44.799,"Yes, I realize that."
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,44.799,48.865,But in terms of the subject matter they are the same.
1970.464,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,48.865,55.912,"Further -- my question is, specifically in the next hour are we going to concern ourselves with 464?"
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,55.912,58.137,Yes.
1970.464,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,58.137,61.864,"Very well, you may proceed whenever you’re ready Mr. Spiegel."
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,61.864,66.22,And Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,140.324,148.404,"Mr. Spiegel, was the City ever a customer, a direct customer of any of these five utilities?"
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,148.404,149.593,"No, Your Honor."
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,149.593,153.193,It’s all been a municipal operated situation?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,153.193,164.729,"Yes, during World War II, there was an emergency interconnection with Florida Power Corporation which was severed shortly after the war."
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,213.238,226.952,"Mr. Spiegel, would you say that broadly all the significant conditions for Gainesville are the same they are between and among the other members of the grid?"
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,226.952,228.165,"Yes, sir."
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,446.062,452.745,How about the new -- wouldn’t Gainesville have to pay for any power that it actually used?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,452.745,453.927,"Oh, yes, yes."
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,459.215,466.391,But what -- and there’s no question about the adequacy of that rate as a rate for payment for that power?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,466.391,470.81,"No question, it’s -- no there is none and I don’t think a serious question on that."
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,470.81,483.173,"So, you really do pay? You do -- under the Federal Power Commission order you would do more than just bring your generating capacity, make your generating capacity available to the system?"
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,483.173,484.072,That’s right.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,484.072,491.808,And you would be paying for power or if the flow in your direction was greater than the flow in the other direction?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,491.808,494.199,That is correct and vice versa.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,510.2,520.654,"Is there any way of -- what is the arrangement, what is the practical situation?"
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,532.656,533.261,Right.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,533.261,541.794,-- and your system was using all the power that you then have.
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,541.794,542.293,Right.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,542.293,546.972,And then let’s say there was a need for power in the larger system.
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,546.972,547.578,Right.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,552.848,558.999,"What would be the -- you just wouldn’t give it to them because there’s a way of what would you do, cut the switch or what?"
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,558.999,561.151,"Well, the switch can be opened."
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.648,562.389,Is that what you would do?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,562.389,563.548,It doesn’t --
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,563.548,564.529,Is that what you would do?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,564.529,567.7,If I understand your example.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,572.175,572.734,Yes.
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,572.734,577.526,"That even though it has a 100 megawatts of capacity the only 50 megawatts is then operated, --"
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,577.526,578.32,Yes.
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,578.32,582.072,The other 50 Megawatts is been down on forced outage.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,582.072,583.162,Yes.
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,583.162,590.358,"And the power company will ask us for power for an emergency on their situation, we could not supply it."
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.358,594.468,"Well, I will set in that -- and I take it that would be true the other way too?"
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,594.468,595.617,"Now, be true to the other way."
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.617,603.293,"If you need or suddenly needed power, would you apparently think you need some connections to take care of emergencies?"
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,605.85,606.894,Right.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.894,608.565,-- and you suddenly needed power --
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,608.565,609.472,Right.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,609.472,613.571,-- and the larger system has then overloaded itself.
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,613.571,616.151,"Right, like Consolidated Edison New York."
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,616.151,617.08,Yes.
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,620.306,620.85,That’s right.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,621.2,630.438,They have no obligation constantly to be to -- to be on stand by status to furnish you emergency power?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,630.438,632.61,That is my understanding.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.14,639.268,Of which?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,639.268,646.458,That the seller and seller system -- the helping system doesn’t help the other system --
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,646.458,647.465,"Unless, it’s in position to do so?"
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,647.465,648.736,Was in position to do it.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,650.234,657.066,"Now, isn’t that quite a difference between the litigants in this case on that issue?"
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,657.066,667.781,"There is and the court, I think this is one of the basic errors the court made where it, I think it tried to understand the electrical arrangements but misunderstood them."
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,667.781,689.793,Wouldn’t concede or would you concede that if Florida Power render an obligation to maintain a capacity which under any circumstances -- so that in under any circumstance does it could furnish you emergency needs for power that it maybe you should do something more than pay for power?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,689.793,690.528,"Oh, yes."
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,711.195,711.397,So you’re saying --
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,711.397,716.25,I doubt they would be willing to sell that service for the $3.08 per kilowatt.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.572,721.82,"Yes and you wouldn’t to expect to buy it for that, would you?"
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,721.82,727.411,It’s an animal that I don’t understand in terms of electrical situation.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,727.411,728.921,"So, you’re saying that --"
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,728.921,739.852,"If they’re obligating themselves on a firm basis to have the generation and have the transmission, then it’s an obligation that runs in the order of $20.00 to $30.00 a kilowatt here."
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,739.852,742.585,Yes and they might be cheaper for you to build your own.
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,742.585,744.028,It would be cheaper for us to.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,744.028,744.964,How about that?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,744.964,759.599,The thing that needs to be emphasize is that the switch and the control where the operations is in the hands first of all of the dispatches of the system and they under an operating committee of the two parties.
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,788.239,788.925,What you’re saying --
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,788.925,800.865,"And they further provide in the body of the contracts that if at any time the operations of the other party, the power its drawing jeopardize your service, you have a right to open the switch."
1970.464,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,807.317,814.042,"Are you saying even though the right is only for emergency power, it’s only when the power is to take you to the other system?"
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,814.042,815.469,That’s right.
1970.464,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,847.678,856.03,But isn’t this based on an assumption and practical experience that the same disaster is not going to strike all the members of the pool at the same time and then the same degree?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,856.03,857.103,That’s right.
1970.464,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,892.248,896.891,Is the sole -- does the sole question here relate to compensation?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,896.891,899.57,The whole question relates to compensation.
1970.464,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,899.57,902.161,For the power that they get?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,902.161,910.367,"Not for the power that is given, but for the fact that the power is available."
1970.464,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,910.83,913.346,But there’s a power to get it.
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,913.346,914.479,I’m sorry sir?
1970.464,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,914.479,918.134,"There’s a power to get or can’t get compensation for it, isn’t it?"
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,918.134,921.084,They get the compensation when the power flows.
1970.464,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,921.084,921.727,That’s right.
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,924.672,934.632,"No, the issue here is where the Florida Power Corporation should be compensated when the power is not flowing because under that theory --"
1970.464,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,934.632,939.6,"That still gets back I suppose in the question where the compensation is too much and too little, doesn’t it?"
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,939.6,940.953,Yes.
1970.464,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,940.953,941.493,I thought it is.
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,941.493,942.595,"Over all, over all yes."
1970.464,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,942.595,944.925,And that’s what the Commission has passed on?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,944.925,946.058,That’s what the Commission has passed on.
1970.464,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,946.058,947.786,That’s what the court set aside?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,947.786,949.549,That’s what the court set aside.
1970.464,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,994.485,1003.085,"Now, I suppose there are great many agreements -- pool agreements and multilateral and bilateral throughout the industry and the country."
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,1003.705,1004.423,"Yes, there are."
1970.464,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1004.423,1017.106,Does this record show or you happened to know whether there are other arrangements of this kind imposed by Commission order?
1970.464,0,26164,george_spiegel,,1017.106,1020.111,There’s been very little on the way of Commission orders.
1970.464,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1240.698,1246.255,Very well Mr. Spiegel.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1246.613,1250.937,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1285.922,1294.094,How does the Commission order differ significantly in your view if it does with the arrangements you have with the other members of the pool?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1294.094,1304.086,"Your Honor, these arrangements with other members of the pool are based on mutuality or reciprocity of service benefits."
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1337.65,1342.554,Do you say that Florida Power doesn’t have any benefit out of this?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1342.554,1345.827,We can’t see where we would get anything out of this interconnection.
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1369.012,1371.27,"Well, what’s the million and a half for which?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1371.644,1379.257,That is the cost of Gainesville estimated the cost of the interconnection to our system would be a million and a half dollars.
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1394.159,1400.968,"Well, I have an impression and I want you to correct it if it’s wrong that Gainesville was to pay that."
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1400.968,1407.309,They are to pay that and they say that will be a burden but they will pay it because they are ordered to.
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1418.552,1423.138,"Well, if -- can it be made a condition of the interconnection order?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1424.252,1427.635,"Well that they pay for it, yes."
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1429.903,1431.133,"Well, then they don’t get the interconnection isn’t that simply?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1431.133,1431.981,That’s right.
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1435.546,1439.068,But I’m not sure I follow what it is you complain about in that situation.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1439.068,1464.049,"We complain that where our system is going to be required to subsidize and support their system and give them substantial financial benefits that their own witness estimate it would be worth $520,000.00 a year to their system And we pay the whole cost of standby service for both systems."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1525.136,1532.441,"Mr. Emory, but you don’t have to build or maintain the cost of disconnection any more capacity than (Voice Overlap)?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1532.441,1537.293,"No, we don’t, but in not for this one customer and this is why we’re --"
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1537.293,1544.997,But this one customer has not been figured any obligation in view of the --
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1544.997,1547.035,"Not this one customer, that’s right."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1569.812,1576.621,But when you run out of capacity when you have necessary that nobody in connection?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1576.621,1578.303,"Oh, it isn’t that’s simple, Your Honor."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.37,1590.86,"So, did they make the connection?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1590.86,1593.851,"Well, if the Federal Power Commission orders us to, we do."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.851,1597.463,But you’re not suggesting it’s an order you’re making connection.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1600.76,1607.744,"No, the statute does restrict them against ordering us to do anything that would require any addition to our system."
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1630.123,1633.966,"When you speak of customers, are you speaking of large or the individual householder?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1633.966,1637.36,"Retail customers and wholesale customers, everybody."
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1637.36,1643.205,"Well, is that an average cost by a numbers or are you talking now but the householder?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1643.205,1652.209,"Well, I’m not talking -- I haven’t broken this down for how much power any one person should use."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1690.695,1693.986,They just want to pay this power.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1693.986,1701.132,"Well, that’s right but that’s -- we pay for the power if we buy it from them, but what’s going to happen is and you got to understand."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1713.494,1717.895,"But only as long as you got the some power, it’s fair?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1717.895,1725.638,"No, we cannot operate our system in a way that I wouldn’t protect them except for opening the switch which the Federal Power Commission says you can do."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1730.918,1741.269,Let’s just assume that one of your big generators goes down and that your reserve capacity that you’re maintaining to guard against failure which is why you maintain it.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1741.269,1741.828,That’s right.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1741.828,1751.076,Let’s assume you have a failure and you have to use your generating -- your reserve generating capacity to satisfy your normal load.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1765.581,1776.631,It’s conceivable in some great crisis if we have enough loss of generation we might have to cut off everybody -- a lot of people and that to cut off some of our own customers.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.631,1777.615,They can get their own.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1777.615,1779.942,"Oh, we can cut off -- we can cut them off."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1797.311,1799.589,That’s true whether you have negative gains or whatever?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1799.589,1801.145,That’s right.
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1801.836,1807.485,So how does the connection with the Gainesville add to your burden being aside whether it confers any benefit on them?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1807.485,1809.421,It does not add to our burden.
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1824.397,1830.007,"How many people are there in the pool with you now, the bilateral and multilateral contract pool?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1830.007,1837.839,"Well, the only ones that I know are Florida Power and Light, Tampa Electric, Orlando and Jacksonville."
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1837.839,1843.773,"And now, refresh my recollection on your standby arrangements with them."
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1843.773,1851.026,We do not have any similar standby arrangement with them because we have what we envisage mutuality of service arrangements.
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.858,1868.139,"Well, are you telling us the probability is much greater that it will be a one-way street with Gainesville than it is with the others?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1868.139,1873.673,"We’d say would be a complete one-way street here whereas with the others it’s a mutual street, it’s a two-way street."
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1873.673,1875.4,What about Justice White’s question to you?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1882.467,1891.671,"Well, we have those things happened and so far as I know, we’ve never -- we’ve been able to take care of all them that I know about."
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1891.671,1899.875,"But if you didn’t need them as Justice White’s suggested, you could under this order, call on Gainesville for its reserve power, could you not?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1899.875,1906.814,"Your Honor, Gainesville couldn’t supply enough to see."
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1954.152,1962.422,"Mr. Emory, what if any -- is the relation between Florida Power and the Florida Power and Light?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1962.422,1966.451,"None, whatsoever except, they have a number of interconnection agreements."
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1966.451,1969.684,"No, interlocking directorates or anything of this kind?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1969.684,1971.856,"No, not there is --"
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1971.856,1973.523,"But you have an interconnection with them, that’s all?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,1973.523,1974.567,Have several.
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1974.567,1977.043,Alright.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1977.043,1982.331,"When is the power -- Florida Power Company operate, what its area?"
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1982.331,1991.686,Its area is from St. Petersburg roughly north up to Pensacola up to west coast of Florida and through central Florida.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1991.686,1993.528,Down to Miami or does it go to --
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1993.528,1996.166,"No, that’s Florida Power and Light Miami, it’s only on the --"
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1996.166,1997.353,That’s Florida Power and Light?
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1997.353,1999.927,"Yes, and Florida Power is --"
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1999.927,2002.26,"You said your system, what is your system?"
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2002.26,2009.759,The system is from St. Petersburg north up to west coast of Florida.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2009.759,2011.118,Who generates the power?
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2011.118,2012.465,We generate the power.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2012.465,2013.362,Florida Power?
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2013.362,2014.264,Florida Power.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2014.264,2015.349,Where?
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2015.349,2016.212,The generate it.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2018.307,2018.722,Where?
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2018.722,2020.427,The largest one is Crystal River.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2024.544,2025.657,They’re all in Florida?
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2025.657,2032.233,All in Florida and they’re interconnected with Gulf and --
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2032.233,2032.48,"Now, in the long --"
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2032.48,2034.611,And on the Georgia line.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2034.611,2042.536,"The sum total of this is, you admit that the Gainesville Power Company wants to buy power from your company?"
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2042.536,2043.209,"No, Your Honor."
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2044.462,2045.795,They don’t.
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2046.757,2049.496,They want us to give them free standby is what they want.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2049.496,2053.719,Free standby whether they get power from you?
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2053.719,2063.766,"They might get -- we don’t know, they insist they do not want any firm purchase of power, but here’s what free standby does to them."
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2081.884,2085.533,I’ve understood your protection but do they get power from you?
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2085.533,2087.713,It depends under if they have any outage.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2088.237,2092.25,"Well, do they get power from you at any time under any circumstances?"
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2092.25,2099.016,Anytime they have a loss of generation or didn’t generation generate enough power for their needs they get power.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2099.016,2105.435,"And the problem here that the Power Commission had to consider was how much they have pay for it, wouldn’t it?"
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2105.435,2106.482,That’s right.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2106.482,2107.458,And that’s the issue?
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2107.458,2108.243,That’s right.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2108.243,2109.174,That’s the only issue.
1970.464,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2109.174,2110.231,That’s the only issue.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.231,2115.3,And they didn’t say that maybe the Commission didn’t hold to pay if they were getting that power for nothing.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2115.3,2116.706,"Yes, they just said that --"
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2116.706,2117.312,Now wait a minute.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2136.135,2141.243,"No, we are asking for no higher charge for power."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.301,2182.086,Did you say as to your other customers to share on that free trial standby?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2185.605,2186.322,That’s right.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.322,2189.226,"Well, now why isn’t included in the rate of Gainesville?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2189.226,2192.449,"Because there’s no provision for it, that’s what we’re complaining."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.449,2203.843,"If you charge the Gainesville for the power they purchased, that they actually get them the same rate as others are paying, would there still be free trial evidence, why is it (Inaudible)?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2203.843,2212.159,"Well, because the other people not only pay for the power that they get based on complicated, etcetera."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.159,2213.218,"Well, they pay you a rate."
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2213.218,2214.416,"You’re right, they pay a rate."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.416,2216.451,And that includes the provision for this?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2216.451,2217.022,That’s right.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2217.022,2220.255,"Alright, now the rate would be charge to Gainesville as exactly the same?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2220.255,2224.819,"No, it isn’t it does not include any provisions for standby, that’s our whole point."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.749,2241.708,At your cost which includes --
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2241.708,2242.595,Plus 10%.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2242.595,2245.183,A normal rate making calculation?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2245.183,2245.41,Yes.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2245.41,2247.433,That cost it?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2247.865,2258.14,That will compensate us for when they’re taking power across the interconnection but it will not compensate us for maintaining this large transmission system.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2258.14,2261.174,"Now, I thought you would you maintain it?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2261.174,2267.418,"That’s right, but we -- if they want to use it why shouldn’t they pay for it?"
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2267.418,2275.143,Why shouldn’t they pay for anything more than the power they actually use when they’re going to maintain the standby capacity anyway?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2275.143,2278.504,"Well, Your Honor it’s the same -- it’s this situation."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.986,2290.763,All I should pay is what the other passengers are paying.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2290.763,2292.153,That’s all we’re asking them.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2295.2,2304.138,"No, I don’t -- all I like to pay is for my ride, I don’t like to pay the airline when the airplane is empty than sitting an overload."
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2304.138,2305.477,No.
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2305.477,2323.226,Are you analogizing this Mr. Emory to an option that the standby agreement -- the standby order that is here is an option which must be fulfilled on demand and then you say that option is in of itself worth something?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2323.226,2324.206,That’s right.
1970.464,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2330.124,2331.923,"Well, an option I was assuming it’s a firm obligation."
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2331.923,2343.375,"And it’s a firm obligation and once you make that connection and close the switch in order the switch kept closed, we’re going to be standing there with the standby."
1970.464,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2343.375,2348.898,"Mr. Emory, in light of this, is there any of the cost who would be in exact same position in Gainesville?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2348.898,2358.602,We have one that I know of since the case -- it’s not in the record who is paying the standby.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2359.049,2360.242,May I ask you a question.
1970.464,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2360.242,2376.073,"My whole point, what it seems to worry me at least a little bit is assuming in the next five years, Gainesville never needs to close the switch and they would still be paying like insurance, wouldn’t it?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2376.073,2379.95,"Well, it’s like insurance make sense Your Honor, that’s right, but the switch is closed."
1970.464,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2420.157,2435.383,"Well, as of now starting (Inaudible) but if they pay for the connection, you don’t put out anything in dollars and cents."
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2440.528,2442.56,"No, I don’t agree with that."
1970.464,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2449.893,2451.22,Would that increase that?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2451.22,2455.229,"No, we would be paying that anyway."
1970.464,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2455.229,2456.371,So you wouldn’t any increase?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2456.371,2460.029,"We won’t increase, but we say we should --"
1970.464,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2460.029,2460.718,What Gainesville --
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2460.718,2461.738,-- subsidize them.
1970.464,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2461.738,2468.238,What you ask in Gainesville is to join the others to subsidize.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2468.238,2478.617,"We are asking that we not be required to subsidize them because if we provide them with free standby, and we think that that’s exactly what we’re doing."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.412,2564.968,(Inaudible)?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2564.968,2565.687,That’s right.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.687,2569.627,How much of the customers?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2569.627,2573.267,"Well, presumably they contribute all of it."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2581.755,2582.584,Charge to Gainesville?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2582.584,2583.958,That’s all we’re talking about.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.958,2584.524,What’s that mean?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2586.18,2587.057,The maintenance.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.057,2588.551,"Well, suppose the customer doesn’t pay --"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2588.551,2598.873,"If you could fine a $154,000.00 in our rate structure, our customers would be entitled to $154,000.00 rate reduction theoretically."
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2599.802,2611.601,I understood you to say whenever this company gets into power from you the Commission is required to pay cost plus 10%.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2611.601,2612.692,That’s right.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2612.692,2614.421,And that’s what you’re complaining now?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2614.421,2615.627,"No, wait actually we propose --"
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2615.627,2619.276,"Well, that if is the cost you’re complaining about it?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2622.38,2624.495,"No, we’re not complaining about that Your Honor, in fact --"
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2624.495,2627.252,"Well, aren’t you complaining about the price they pay you?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2627.252,2631.847,"No, actually that price was recommended by us to the Commission."
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2635.751,2638.554,"They’re just your proposal, the cost plus 10%?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2638.554,2643.497,"No, we complain that they are not paying anything for the free standby when they are not taking power."
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2643.497,2645.192,"Well, let’s forget get those words a minute."
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2645.192,2646.399,Yes.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2646.399,2652.366,"When you sell power, has the Commission given you rate of cost plus 10%?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2652.366,2654.021,In this interchange arrangement.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2654.021,2656.477,"In this rate, and that’s what you get from them?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2656.477,2657.03,Yes.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2657.03,2659.824,And if every particle of power they use?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2659.824,2660.36,That’s right.
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2660.36,2665.956,And in five years as you say cost plus 10% of public utility is not enough?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2665.956,2681.754,"It’s not -- it is not compensatory if we’ve got to maintain the firehouse, the fire station 24 hours a day, 365 days out of the year to protect their system and our system."
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2683.585,2689.32,"Well, if you get less than 10% profit, can’t you complain to them that you’re not getting price they fit?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2689.32,2698.272,"Well, Your Honor we’re -- our cost is not limited to the cost of the power that we deliver to them."
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2702.639,2706.088,Do you mean the power company has taken a lead in the Commission?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2712.147,2715.411,"Well, we’re not complaining about the charge for the power to --"
1970.464,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2715.411,2717.086,But that’s what you get.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2717.086,2722.578,We’re complaining that there was no provision in here to provide for standby.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2732.228,2742.58,"Why does the company if in a particular year Gainesville didn’t take whatever these units power hour, you wouldn’t be getting anything cost plus 10% at all?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2742.58,2742.829,That’s right.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2742.829,2751.911,"What you want in that view on the Government side as long there is $154,000.00 from Gainesville to help to pay for substantial?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2751.911,2754.673,That’s right and that’s as simple as that.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.969,2865.155,"Now, Mr. Emory, going back though the Florida Power and Light where you have an interconnect, you are performing standby service for them and they for you."
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2865.155,2865.919,That’s right.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.919,2870.916,And so what each one pays to the other is the mutuality of service so to speak?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2870.916,2871.368,That is correct.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2871.368,2873.553,There isn’t a dime that flows across.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2873.553,2874.332,"No, me too."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2874.332,2880.429,"Well, then so far as Gainesville is concerned, isn’t the same thing on them what’s lesser degree?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2880.429,2887.347,"No, because in Gainesville’s case, there’s nothing really that can flow across."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2895.217,2901.802,"I’ll repeat my question, isn’t the difference one between 10 megawatts or whatever it is ends a much larger thing?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2901.802,2904.829,In hundreds.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2904.829,2911.86,"But again, isn’t a matter just to degree between Gainesville on one hand that Florida P and L on the other?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2911.86,2917.351,If it is a matter of degree except to the degree is so small that it becomes meaningless.
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.351,2922.282,"Unless Gainesville could provide 200 to 300, you wouldn’t be here?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2922.282,2923.072,"Oh, no."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2923.072,2925.853,"Alright, explain to us."
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2925.853,2926.337,"Well, I --"
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.337,2929.049,"It’s 15, 75, 100?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2929.049,2944.102,"Your Honor, it’s hard to know because all these agreements are pretty complicated, they’re all negotiated, they all involved a lot of factors and there’s certain going to be enough --"
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.102,2953.038,"Let me put this way, when the agreements under a couple of hundred, would anyone could provide or something less?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2953.038,2961.005,"Of instantaneous, yes with Orlando but we’re buying a hundred megawatts from them regularly, I think."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2961.005,2963.842,A hundred is as much as they can provide?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2963.842,2967.737,"Well, that is a firm purchase on their fit."
1970.464,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2980.225,2982.848,(Voice Overlap)
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2982.848,2984.485,No.
1970.464,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2984.883,2996.505,We’re having forth the price that Gainesville paid this money and catching on the line for the -- that brought the cost to the consumer of Florida Power.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,2998.065,3005.845,"Well, I say, it would save our customers $154,000.00 a year which would go in to our earnings."
1970.464,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3005.845,3008.527,"Well, did it actually mean that the rates would be dropped?"
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,3008.527,3010.37,"Well, if you could find a hundred and --"
1970.464,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3010.37,3013.258,It wouldn’t last to try a power drop in rate.
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,3013.258,3016.028,"Well, this probably wouldn’t affect federal power rates."
1970.464,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3022.498,3026.227,When did the light -- electricity rates dropped in Florida Light?
1970.464,1,39173,richard_w_emory,,3026.227,3029.391,They’ve been dropping regularly every year.
1970.464,2,26164,george_spiegel,,3160.116,3166.704,It’s hard for me to believe that we’re talking about the same case.
1970.464,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.653,3241.196,"(Voice Overlap) higher than you for the backup or perhaps more from that, it would be by you up next?"
1970.464,2,26164,george_spiegel,,3241.196,3242.091,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.464,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3275.61,3278.668,"Well, aren’t you asking for standby charge?"
1970.464,2,26164,george_spiegel,,3278.668,3279.772,"Well, that’s the point."
1970.464,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.513,3299.549,"Perhaps, you can come out pretty well."
1970.464,2,26164,george_spiegel,,3299.549,3305.075,"Well, if that will make it bilateral because both is going to charge for everything we do for each other."
1970.464,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3333.387,3337.406,"Incidentally, I gather you brought this all out before the Commission?"
1970.464,2,26164,george_spiegel,,3337.406,3338.9,We fought it up before the Commission.
1970.464,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3338.9,3339.799,What issue?
1970.464,2,26164,george_spiegel,,3339.799,3342.529,This very issue the Commission to study that very carefully --
1970.464,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3342.529,3345.832,Anything said here that wasn’t said before the Commission?
1970.464,2,26164,george_spiegel,,3345.832,3347.704,"I don’t think so, Your Honor."
1970.464,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3347.704,3357.17,"Mr. Spiegel, you know whether Gainesville has any standby arrangements with private industrial customers who maintain their own generating clients?"
1970.464,2,26164,george_spiegel,,3357.17,3358.602,We do not.
1970.464,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3358.602,3362.0,"That’s a common practice though in the industries, is it not?"
1970.464,2,26164,george_spiegel,,3362.0,3364.864,There is a form of service of that type.
1970.464,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3364.864,3370.282,Do the power companies charged for that standby service just a standby?
1970.464,2,26164,george_spiegel,,3370.282,3374.228,I believe that there are rates that have such charges.
1970.464,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3407.879,3418.506,"But that’s all was in the context for the parties who are reaching this by agreement because the parties themselves see a mutuality of benefit, isn’t that true?"
1970.464,2,26164,george_spiegel,,3418.506,3424.438,"Yes, all the parties are concerned that we might make a complaint to the Federal Power Commission."
1970.464,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3428.725,3434.155,"And this is you said and I think it was you who said, “This is the first interconnection of this kind?”"
1970.464,2,26164,george_spiegel,,3434.155,3442.598,"This is the first interconnection, full interconnection decision by the Federal Power Commission between two generating utilities."
1970.464,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3443.111,3445.821,Is the Gainesville Company privately owned?
1970.464,2,26164,george_spiegel,,3445.821,3449.074,"No, it’s a municipally own operation."
1970.464,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3451.574,3452.196,Was it always?
1970.464,2,26164,george_spiegel,,3452.196,3453.507,Always.
1970.464,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3470.034,3471.901,"Thank you Mr. Spiegel, Mr. Emory."
1970.464,3,25381,gordon_gooch,,3496.649,3500.649,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.464,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3634.612,3638.19,Do you mean the transmission line or whatever facilities go with that?
1970.464,3,25381,gordon_gooch,,3638.19,3640.725,"Yes, sir."
1970.464,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3688.278,3692.231,"That Mr. Gooch, that it maintain what kind of a reserve capacity?"
1970.464,3,25381,gordon_gooch,,3692.231,3694.01,The installed reserve capacity.
1970.464,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3701.709,3702.344,Installed?
1970.464,3,25381,gordon_gooch,,3702.344,3704.139,"Yes, sir."
1970.464,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3704.139,3710.095,That will involve their taking any other investments --
1970.464,3,25381,gordon_gooch,,3710.095,3710.367,"Yes, sir."
1970.464,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3710.367,3711.64,Capital investment.
1970.464,3,25381,gordon_gooch,,3711.64,3713.16,Yes sir.
1970.464,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3713.16,3718.432,Does the record show whether they would’ve done that absent this interconnection?
1970.464,3,25381,gordon_gooch,,3718.432,3731.547,"Sir, the record that it is closed in 1965 had projections all the way through 1979 and in the projections that showed by the staff witnesses the projected additional generation that would be required."
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,4673.804,4677.539,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this Honorable Court.
1970.464,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4991.802,4999.389,"Well, do you deny what Mr. Gooch says about the firmness of the requirements you have?"
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,4999.389,5007.815,"Absolutely, we think we can -- it will be just as firm as it can be and the Gainesville witnesses admitted that."
1970.464,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5007.815,5017.378,You mean you deny to state or you deny what the Commission found that you were not being bound to supply them power?
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5017.378,5021.272,I deny the statement and I deny what the Commission found.
1970.464,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5036.278,5042.526,"I have been taking and drawing a contract, if there are some ask firmly bound to do something, they’d put it in there."
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5042.526,5046.134,"Well, you don’t have to put the word firm in."
1970.464,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5046.134,5046.605,It’s filled.
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5046.605,5050.773,"No, you just sign the contract, “I hereby agree to buy a horse.”"
1970.464,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5062.558,5064.121,And you have to do it whether you want to do it?
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5064.121,5065.316,Whether you want to do it and not.
1970.464,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5078.145,5079.75,A horse of course is a little different.
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5079.75,5085.072,"Well, that’s what we’re talking about, whether they use the word or don’t use the word that’s all into."
1970.464,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5085.072,5094.96,"What he was talking about was, the Commission found that there was no duty -- firm duty on your part to sell."
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5106.766,5107.057,"Your Honor, --"
1970.464,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5107.057,5111.956,"What I understood him to argue, he maybe wrong -- I maybe wrong in understanding him or he maybe wrong."
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5111.956,5114.085,I don’t think and I’m trying to recollect.
1970.464,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5119.992,5122.197,"I was talking about requirement, would you require --"
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5122.197,5130.727,There is no firm obligation to supply what in the industry has called firm power -- firm service.
1970.464,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5153.423,5154.781,Then you’d be entitled to pay for?
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5154.781,5167.058,Then we would be entitled to say that they didn’t have any jurisdiction because they don’t have jurisdiction to do anything that would definitely positively require us to enlarge our facilities.
1970.464,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5183.676,5199.913,"Imagine if you had a -- they admitted the demand and you didn’t supply and it would cost a lot of money, you could then find more reason to say that the word “firm” would’ve been pretty good in the contract."
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5199.913,5204.633,"Well, Your Honor we can envisage, we sincerely honestly cannot envisage."
1970.464,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5224.002,5225.794,Are supplied by themselves?
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5225.794,5232.125,But they’re planning to eliminate the supply for themselves.
1970.464,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5464.472,5470.719,"Tallahassee said the, I understood you say that the interconnection was too small to provide any standby (Voice Overlap)."
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5470.719,5471.672,"That’s what I told you, Your Honor."
1970.464,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5471.672,5475.78,What’s the point of having the interconnection?
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5475.78,5482.304,This is something that I didn’t know a thing about until I got this brief on Monday and I really don’t know much about it.
1970.464,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5512.3,5513.795,Is it also municipally-owned?
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5513.795,5515.63,That’s municipally-owned.
1970.464,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5671.282,5680.31,You don’t take the position I understand that it’s impossible that Gainesville would ever be called upon to give you some help?
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5680.31,5687.165,They might be called upon to give us help over time and that’s important and I’m glad you asked that question.
1970.464,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5705.916,5707.814,"You mean 12 hours notice, 6 hours (Voice Overlap)?"
1970.464,4,39173,richard_w_emory,,5707.814,5713.13,"Well, actually they would take two hours notice on most of their equipment."
1970.464,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5869.782,5871.351,Thank you Mr. Emory.
1970.464,5,25381,gordon_gooch,,5875.911,5880.319,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.464,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5948.736,5950.024,When there was nothing?
