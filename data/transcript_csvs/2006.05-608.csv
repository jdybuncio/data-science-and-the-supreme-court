2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.646,"We'll hear argument first this morning in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech."
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,7.897,11.069,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,94.385,95.163,"Mr. Kester, would it--"
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,95.163,95.433,--Yes?
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,95.433,105.74,--would it... would your position be different if the contract contained a specific... the license... a specific provision specifying that the licensee may not sue?
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,105.74,110.313,"No, it would not, Your Honor, because--"
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,110.313,114.196,You... do you think such a provision would be enforceable?
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,114.196,116.067,--I doubt it would be enforceable.
2006.05-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,130.155,132.589,"Excuse me, I don't... I don't understand what you just said."
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,145.735,147.656,Under 12-- under 12(b)(6)--
2006.05-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,147.656,147.927,--Okay.
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,147.927,148.117,--perhaps.
2006.05-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,148.117,149.038,"So, then it is enforceable."
2006.05-608,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,149.038,150.3,"No, but--"
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,150.3,150.548,No.
2006.05-608,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,150.548,152.361,"--your point is, it's not jurisdictional."
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,152.361,154.561,"It's not jurisdictional, exactly, Justice Souter."
2006.05-608,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,160.456,171.044,"Well, but as a matter of policy, we, at some point, either in this case or some later case, may have to address the question of whether or not such a provision is enforceable."
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,177.346,177.767,And so--
2006.05-608,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,177.767,188.455,"--but it... on the other hand, it may be that there are reasons not to enforce this, so that we don't have courts flooded with lawsuits, et cetera, et cetera."
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,188.455,197.431,"--And those reasons, I would suggest, Justice Kennedy, were taken care of in Lear, for the most part, in 1969."
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,215.433,218.165,"Well, let's look at what might be a matter of jurisdictional law."
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,228.289,236.086,"--It has... it has happened, on various occasions, that patentees have brought suit to establish the validity of--"
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,236.086,237.206,Against licensees?
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,237.206,239.797,--Against licensees and others.
2006.05-608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,241.309,247.844,Against licensees who are not claiming that the patent is invalid?
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,249.834,254.096,--The controversy could arise in any number of ways.
2006.05-608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,254.096,263.623,"I mean, I can see, if the... if licensee says the patent is invalid, that the patentee says paying its royalties... how does it--"
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,263.623,266.714,The patentee could be paying his royalties.
2006.05-608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,285.979,293.243,"--If it... if the... if the... if the licensee came into court and said, ""I'm not contesting this patent"", that would be the end of it, wouldn't it?"
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,293.243,295.424,"--If the licensee said,"
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,299.006,300.999,"Oh, but the patentee would just say,"
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,322.911,325.984,"That... I agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,353.234,367.543,"I'm trying to see how far you want... are willing to push your argument that just because there's been an agreement, or perhaps even a settlement, that that somehow or another doesn't moot the controversy, the underlying legal dispute."
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,378.289,382.863,--A settlement does not deprive a Federal Court of subject-matter jurisdiction.
2006.05-608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,386.694,388.717,"Why aren't you... you said,"
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,423.24,439.279,"But not the same underlying question, Justice Ginsburg, with respect, because then you are in a situation like the business forms case in the Seventh Circuit, which came out shortly after the Lear."
2006.05-608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,463.877,464.147,But what--
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,464.147,464.568,--motion.
2006.05-608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,464.568,465.139,--good would it do?
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,489.863,490.194,They--
2006.05-608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,490.194,492.397,--you have no... you have not stated a claim.
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,492.397,501.944,"--That would be effectively overruling Lear, which is what, I think, is what many of the parties in this case actually seek to do."
2006.05-608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,529.282,529.493,But then--
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,529.493,529.813,--license.
2006.05-608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,529.813,540.77,"--the Federal Circuit distinguished Lear, and said what... in Lear, the licensee had stopped paying royalties."
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,541.742,545.023,That... those were the facts of Lear.
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,570.219,582.297,"So, there's no way, I... under your view, that a patent holder can protect itself from suit through any license arrangement or any agreement of any kind."
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,582.297,594.465,"I suspect there are many ways, Mr. Chief Justice, but not by throwing them out on a jurisdictional basis at the very first moment of the lawsuit."
2006.05-608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,594.465,595.056,How about--
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,595.056,600.208,"There may be ways this could be arranged at the second level, through--"
2006.05-608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,600.208,621.033,"--Well, what are those ways... I mean, the ones that have been mentioned as possibilities in the Government brief... one, you rejected, and the other that was mentioned was: if you sue... if the licensee sues, then the royalty fees will be upped."
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,625.584,632.51,--That is a question that would arise under Lear against Adkins.
2006.05-608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,650.011,658.186,"So, you have rejected both of the Government's suggestions on what the patent holder might do to protect itself."
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,664.37,668.363,I don't think that I have rejected both the Government's suggestions.
2006.05-608,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,672.797,698.183,"With respect to... whether we are talking about a jurisdictional defense or whether we are talking about an affirmative defense, assuming jurisdiction, is there any... is there any reason for us to accept your position, other than the reason that you have mentioned a number of times, and that is the adoption and encouragement of a public policy that allows patent challenges freely?"
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,712.172,713.644,"Not quite, Justice Souter."
2006.05-608,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,723.71,725.742,"Well, Altvater is difficult for you, isn't it?"
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,729.234,730.965,--That... but that... but was--
2006.05-608,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,730.965,733.696,Which raises an entirely different policy issue?
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,733.696,738.661,"--Well, I would say what it... what it raises is simply an extra fact, but it wasn't a necessary fact."
2006.05-608,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,771.32,772.492,But that is... that is a good reason.
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,779.508,781.838,--Right.
2006.05-608,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,781.838,790.334,"In other words, the nub of your position, as I understand it, is the public policy that favors relative--"
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,790.334,790.565,It--
2006.05-608,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,790.565,791.236,--freedom to challenge--
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,791.236,795.119,"--It's more... it's more than public policy, it's Article III."
2006.05-608,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,800.683,801.594,--No--
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,801.594,802.275,--in Aetna.
2006.05-608,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,802.275,803.194,"--No, I realize that."
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,823.897,829.802,What we are presenting in this case is a dispute about money.
2006.05-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,844.454,854.962,"You... well, you can have such a dispute on a theoretical question between, I don't know, the ACLU and the National Rifle Association, but that doesn't create a case or controversy."
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,865.608,865.878,The--
2006.05-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.878,867.24,"Is it anything other than,"
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,871.472,874.674,"--It is the... it is that,"
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,889.785,890.466,"Well, if you don't--"
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,890.466,890.706,And if--
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,890.706,891.007,--think--
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,891.007,891.187,--And if--
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,891.187,891.796,--if you don't think--
2006.05-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,891.796,897.301,Is it... is it unlawful to agree to pay somebody money who does not have a patent?
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,897.301,898.07,--It is--
2006.05-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.07,906.705,"I mean, you're speaking as though somehow that... such a contract is contrary to public policy, and void."
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,906.705,908.627,"--No, we're saying that that isn't what we agreed to."
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,912.381,915.671,"--Well, then why are you paying it, if you... if you don't think you owe it?"
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,915.671,918.094,--Because the--
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,918.094,920.005,Because of the threat of treble damages--
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,920.005,920.275,--The threat--
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,920.275,920.816,--and injunction.
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,920.816,921.796,--of this--
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,921.796,931.482,"If we're trying to figure out where the public policy is here, why don't we give some weight to those congressional enactments that obviously fortify the strength of the patent?"
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,937.867,938.097,--But--
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,938.097,949.414,"--and to respond that there's got to be a public policy to counterbalance that, Congress can always do that, if it wants; but it didn't... it thinks that you need these provisions to protect the patent holders."
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,949.414,955.928,"--But, Mr. Chief Justice, Congress can also amend the Declaratory Judgment Act, if it wants."
2006.05-608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,978.215,981.735,"Mr. Kester, may I ask you this question?"
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,985.298,986.76,Absolutely.
2006.05-608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.76,992.804,"Were there... before Gen-Probe was decided, were there any cases, like this case, that were decided?"
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,992.804,996.444,"There were many, Your Honor, and they were decided--"
2006.05-608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,996.444,1002.009,Where the... where the licensee brought suit challenging validity while the license was still in full--
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1002.009,1002.439,--We--
2006.05-608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1002.439,1002.709,--force?
2006.05-608,0,31320,john_g_kester,,1002.709,1014.917,"--We had suits in the Third Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Second Circuit, and even in the Federal Circuit, in its early days, where it quoted those cases which said,"
2006.05-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1042.886,1043.855,"Thank you, Mr. Kester."
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1046.549,1060.457,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1072.115,1073.695,How do you ever end these things?
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1086.194,1088.227,: In that situation.
2006.05-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1090.248,1091.548,"Can they settle that, by the way?"
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1097.091,1101.373,--May I... if I can answer the first question first.
2006.05-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1101.373,1101.974,Either one.
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1101.974,1108.86,"If there were to be a settlement, in the second case, the... it would not be an Article III case or controversy problem with the second case."
2006.05-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1111.791,1112.643,Okay.
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1112.643,1124.278,"The... in that case, the patent holder might have a valid 12(b)(6) defense, and the suit, laying aside enforceability issues that you raised, may be easily resolved, on that ground."
2006.05-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1156.171,1157.763,"Well, I think you overread Pope."
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1177.018,1177.218,--Well--
2006.05-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1177.218,1178.717,--other words you're maybe entitled to damages.
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1181.679,1198.129,"--Well, there certainly would be a question, though, the way that Lear read Pope, and under Lear, about whether a bare agreement not to challenge licenses, especially ones like in Pope, where they agreed not to challenge the license, even beyond the term, would be enforceable."
2006.05-608,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1219.573,1230.49,"Now, is... if... I guess there are three possible positions on the question of whether a licensee can attack a contract, a patent where he has a license and wants to keep the contract."
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1243.039,1243.79,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-608,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1243.79,1244.06,All right.
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1259.02,1270.2,"The Government's view is that there's a spectrum along the spectrum, and it would have... you would have to consider each case on its terms."
2006.05-608,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1273.723,1273.97,All right.
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1292.743,1299.888,"--It's certainly not foreclosed by this Court's precedent, and it's an open question where the policies... how they would weigh out."
2006.05-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1316.299,1317.681,"Well, you don't think that matters, though, do you?"
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1327.655,1341.385,"--If the parties have a concrete dispute about the validity of the patent, and it would affect their rights and obligations in the way that it would here... in other words, that money will no longer be due to the Respondents if the patent's invalid--"
2006.05-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1341.385,1341.586,Is--

2006.05-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1341.776,1342.685,--that always the case?
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1365.95,1370.815,--It might depend on whether there was consideration beyond the patent itself.

2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1409.491,1411.153,--Where does it appear in the licensing agreement?
2006.05-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1411.153,1425.662,"--Yes, I took them as just asserting a general proposition of law... that, where they've agreed to pay royalties because of a patent, if the patent is invalid, they don't have to pay royalties... not because there's some special provision in this contract."
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1425.662,1431.305,"The parties actually have a concrete dispute about the meaning of the licensing agreement in that regard, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.236,1467.028,"So, there's really not much at issue in this case."
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1473.784,1474.645,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.645,1477.166,"Gee, there's less here than meets the eye."
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1477.166,1479.189,"That's what the Government believes, Your Honor."
2006.05-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1514.414,1517.877,"Well, but that... it's been pointed out that was pursuant to an injunction."
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1517.877,1521.831,"--Yes, it was pursuant to injunction, but that was not important to the Court's reasoning."

2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1561.965,1562.236,--themselves.

2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1571.392,1572.573,"Yes, I do."
2006.05-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.31,1588.692,And what would their... what would their concrete injury be?

2006.05-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1596.139,1599.812,You have a licensee who's paying the license fees.

2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1636.367,1642.962,"--Well, I think, technically, Justice Scalia, they probably have a claim for patent infringement, to which the defense, as Justice Ginsburg--"
2006.05-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1642.962,1643.6,I--
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1643.6,1643.891,--points out--

2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1644.181,1645.052,--would be an easy defense.

2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1645.363,1647.624,"So, there's not an Article III lack of case or controversy, which is--"
2006.05-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1647.624,1647.864,--I find it--
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1647.864,1648.275,--what's the question before--
2006.05-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.275,1648.655,--very difficult--
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1648.655,1649.146,--the Court.
2006.05-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1649.146,1653.668,--to see how there would be a proper declaratory judgment action brought by the patentee here.
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1659.602,1659.812,"Well, you need--"

2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1660.673,1661.314,--You... may I answer that question?
2006.05-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1668.11,1668.49,--That's fine.
2006.05-608,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1668.49,1673.072,"--much narrower than the counterclaim; and, nevertheless, the Court allowed that counterclaim to proceed."
2006.05-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1673.072,1674.064,"Thank you, Counsel."
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1679.988,1682.809,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-608,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1837.851,1841.064,Was that a case about Article III case or controversy?
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1841.064,1842.836,"--It is, in the following sense, Your Honor."
2006.05-608,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1852.621,1853.202,Shouldn't we send that back?
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1906.79,1907.238,--Well--
2006.05-608,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1907.238,1914.284,"So, isn't the right thing for us to do, to decide the issue in front of us and then send it back?"
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1928.302,1937.369,"--Well, first of all, with respect to this issue, whether there would be jurisdiction over a real live contract dispute, they never argued it, Your Honor."
2006.05-608,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1943.883,1944.144,But the question--
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1944.144,1945.115,--a precedent a hundred--
2006.05-608,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1945.115,1956.092,"--The question that is presented to us... whatever they suggested at this oral argument that wasn't in III, the question it presented to us is, Was the Federal Circuit right when they said,"
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1964.207,1971.281,"--Your Honor, that is the right... that is the right starting point for a test, depending on the cause of action they're seeking to adjudicate."
2006.05-608,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.923,2034.774,And why--
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2034.774,2034.842,--an enforcement action.
2006.05-608,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.842,2035.693,--doesn't that work here?
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2035.693,2038.124,"It doesn't work here, for several reasons."
2006.05-608,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2063.112,2063.382,What is the--
2006.05-608,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2063.382,2067.152,Why should we accept the characterization that it's a compromise?
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2092.521,2098.475,"I think the answer, Your Honor, is, they weren't settling, for all time, in the sense that they could never get out of the deal."
2006.05-608,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2112.716,2133.299,"But had they gotten to the point, prior to the execution of the contract, in which one party was saying, ""You may not do this"", and the other party was saying, ""Oh, yes I can"", so that there... there was a focus controversy that would have been the subject matter of a conventional lawsuit, then and there, had there not been this license agreement?"
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2133.299,2136.342,"--Not exactly, but what they did was they headed it off at the pass."
2006.05-608,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2138.102,2143.685,"But the question is, How far ahead of the pass can they get and still call it a settlement?"
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2145.418,2145.979,--It's a compromise.
2006.05-608,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2165.033,2165.203,But--
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2165.203,2165.414,--under their--
2006.05-608,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2165.414,2165.564,--But you--
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2165.564,2166.005,--agreement.
2006.05-608,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2166.005,2166.275,--Right.
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2180.744,2181.075,Well--
2006.05-608,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2181.075,2182.056,--And they... they had settled.
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2187.522,2189.552,--I don't know if it's exactly the status.
2006.05-608,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2200.379,2201.04,In any event--
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2201.04,2201.891,--the standpoint of coercion--
2006.05-608,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2201.891,2204.792,--it's equivalent to a settlement after a formal demand has been made.
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2204.792,2206.975,"--It is equivalent to that, in the following sense."
2006.05-608,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2222.146,2224.417,Suppose they didn't have all the information.

2006.05-608,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2242.248,2244.629,"Well, but then... so then, the argument that you've made is just not--"
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2244.629,2245.53,"--No, I--"
2006.05-608,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2245.53,2247.05,"--relevant for us, the fact that they knew everything--"
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2247.05,2247.881,--They did.
2006.05-608,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2247.881,2252.123,"--And it also means that this isn't really a settlement, in any respect."
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2252.123,2254.227,It's a compromise of claims that could be brought.
2006.05-608,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2254.227,2255.976,"Ms. Mahoney, can I ask this question?"
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2288.009,2292.624,"I don't think so, but that would certainly be a closer case if there--"
2006.05-608,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2292.624,2293.022,But would it--
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2293.022,2293.282,--But I--
2006.05-608,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2293.282,2298.896,--not be precisely the same issue as a jurisdictional matter as to whether there's a case or controversy?
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2298.896,2306.292,"--No, I don't think so, because the real issue, in terms of Steffel, is whether you can say that the party is being coerced."
2006.05-608,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.713,2317.167,"He's not being coerced, but he's bargaining a little better royalty rate than he'll... otherwise would have to pay."
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2317.167,2328.675,"--Well, in terms of whether they're... if the parties expressly agreed that that was part of their deal, then you at least wouldn't say that there was an issue of coercion."
2006.05-608,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2330.508,2331.897,"No, I'm really asking--"
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2331.897,2332.168,--a standard proviso--
2006.05-608,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2332.168,2335.49,--whether the parties could agree to create a case or controversy.
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2335.49,2336.521,"--I think probably not, Your Honor."

2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2337.473,2338.452,--that that's one of the--
2006.05-608,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2338.452,2338.853,--Well--
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2338.853,2339.644,--one of the problems--
2006.05-608,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2339.644,2342.425,--Will you assume Justice Stevens' hypothetical?
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2349.672,2350.31,--Uh-huh.

2006.05-608,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2356.223,2357.525,--The hypothetical is--
2006.05-608,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2357.525,2357.786,--Continue on.
2006.05-608,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2357.786,2363.169,"--that they write into the contract... the party who's the licensee says,"
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2393.49,2393.961,Uh-huh.
2006.05-608,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2393.961,2396.613,"And now, let us also assume a state of the law."
2006.05-608,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2425.38,2431.845,"I don't think so, because I think what they're really asking for is advice about a business deal under those circumstances."
