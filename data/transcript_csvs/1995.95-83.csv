1995.95-83,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.367,"We'll hear argument next in No. 95-83, Alan Meghrig v. KFC Western, Inc.--"
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,28.69,32.393,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-83,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,157.517,161.271,Was the cleanup done pursuant to an order of the municipality?
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,161.271,167.655,"It was done pursuant to... it was done under the supervision of the County of Los Angeles, Department of Health Services."
1995.95-83,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,172.97,175.712,Had a building permit been conditioned on the cleanup?
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,175.712,176.782,--I believe it had.
1995.95-83,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.375,188.581,"So, the respondent was under really a legal duty to clean up the property, at least if the building permit were going to be granted."
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,188.581,195.928,"--I'm not sure if that is an allegation of the complaint, but I believe that that would have been the state of facts at the time that the cleanup was done."
1995.95-83,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.261,243.308,"Well, Mr. Zaimes, there are two potential questions that I guess we might resolve, and I'm not sure if we have to resolve them both or not."
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,252.855,253.416,--Yes.
1995.95-83,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,253.416,261.079,And that may possibly be decisive for our purposes of this case.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,277.853,279.876,I am going to address both of those issues.
1995.95-83,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.876,282.446,And do we need to decide both in your view?
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,282.446,293.152,"I believe you do need to decide both, and the primary reason that you need to decide both is that part of the way that this case has come to this Court is that there is a conflict in the circuits."
1995.95-83,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,306.455,309.945,That's the question on which there is a split of authority.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,309.945,312.128,That is the question on which there is a split of authority.
1995.95-83,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,315.671,320.033,Doesn't the Ninth Circuit create the split?
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,320.033,322.133,"I'm sorry, Justice Breyer?"
1995.95-83,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,322.133,328.648,Doesn't the Ninth Circuit create the split on the question of when the endangerment had to take place?
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,328.648,333.761,My recollection of... the Ninth Circuit says the endangerment can be in the past or in the present.
1995.95-83,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,333.761,334.071,Right.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,334.071,339.897,"Now, I'm not sure that the Eighth Circuit reached the issue of whether it has to be past or present directly."
1995.95-83,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,351.585,352.705,I'm sorry.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,379.384,383.306,"--Well, that resolves the situation, Justice Ginsburg, for my client I agree."
1995.95-83,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,388.441,391.373,We can decide this controversy only.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,405.583,406.725,--That would resolve this case fully.
1995.95-83,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.236,415.043,"Or alternatively, we could attack it from the other direction and could determine that there's no cause of action for money damages."
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,415.043,415.534,--That is true.
1995.95-83,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,415.534,419.147,"And, therefore, it doesn't matter whether or not this thing was prior or not."
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,419.147,421.357,You could resolve it that way also.
1995.95-83,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,426.991,429.942,The second way is... the second point is the one on which there is the conflict.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,429.942,432.526,"--The second point is the one on which there is the clear conflict, yes."
1995.95-83,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,467.288,486.98,"What if we had a case where there is an imminent and substantial endangerment alleged and the plaintiff says, I want an injunction and I want an order that the defendant will pay the costs of future cleanup?"
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,490.293,501.693,"--This is before... this is an order that the defendant would clean it up now or the order would say, plaintiff, you may clean it up and we are going to order defendant to pay that?"
1995.95-83,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,501.693,503.633,Either way.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,503.633,504.912,Either way?
1995.95-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,535.976,542.0,"What if the court makes exactly such an order and says, defendant, stop what you're doing now, clean up?"
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,578.903,581.704,I'm not... I don't believe that it could under this statute.
1995.95-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,591.542,596.904,"But you would still win the case if that were the rule here, wouldn't you, if we accept your position on--"
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,596.904,597.124,--I--
1995.95-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,597.124,600.166,--You'd still win the case if that were the rule here.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,600.166,603.49,"--Justice Souter, I believe that I would win on the RCRA claim."
1995.95-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,609.867,611.419,But we're not adjudicating them.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,611.419,611.649,I understand that.
1995.95-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,611.649,617.082,"We're talking about RCRA, and under the RCRA claim, you would win, would you not, on my assumption?"
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,617.082,622.105,"The way this statute is framed, I believe that I would win in that sort of situation because--"
1995.95-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,622.105,626.519,"So, you want a broader rule than the rule that it would take you to win the case."
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,626.519,633.091,"--Well, I'm seeking in some... and we touched on this in the context of the imminent and substantial endangerment."
1995.95-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,637.214,641.498,"But I assume you're here arguing your client's case, not bringing interesting issues to us."
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,641.498,642.189,--That's right.
1995.95-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,642.189,646.333,"And your client would win on the position that I have suggested, wouldn't it?"
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,646.333,646.884,It would.
1995.95-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,646.884,648.647,And that would end this lawsuit.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,648.647,649.365,It would.
1995.95-83,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,649.365,652.099,"But you're trying to take the high ground, as I understand it."
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,659.724,662.726,"Well, I'm taking fundamentally the position that I win on either one."
1995.95-83,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,668.201,672.674,"--You not only want to win, you want to win on the basis of a correct principle, which is what you're arguing."
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,672.674,674.056,"--Absolutely correct, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-83,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,674.056,681.81,"Then to go to the correct principle, how could you in fact interpret this statute to say that a plaintiff could never get monetary damages?"
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,729.202,735.237,"With all those assumptions, the argument is that that is the way this statute is structured."
1995.95-83,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,735.237,744.902,"The word in the statute is ""necessary"", and how would you say that that kind of normal equitable relief, which is the principle you want to argue for, never could be necessary?"
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,744.902,748.725,"Well, with all due respect, Justice Breyer, the wording of the statute is"
1995.95-83,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,752.95,768.687,"And it may be... why isn't it necessary in the circumstance, given the history of equity, et cetera, to make at least the monetary restitution necessary to clear up the absolute immediate emergency action that the plaintiff took in order to save the lives of his livestock?"
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,768.687,771.99,--Fundamentally because our argument is that that is not what Congress intended.
1995.95-83,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,773.012,773.432,Why not?
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,773.432,773.803,--Why?
1995.95-83,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,788.813,790.083,I agree with that.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,796.017,799.12,--I'm arguing for the proposition never under this statute.
1995.95-83,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.12,806.834,"Mr. Zaimes, your second... I mean, we may be unfair to you in severing the two points as though they don't overlap."
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,821.445,822.046,That is true.
1995.95-83,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.046,833.443,"And in the hypothetical that Justice Breyer just posed to you, what you were doing is reimbursing the plaintiff for that past damage that he's incurred for putting up the barrier."
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,864.336,869.251,"That is part of the argument and that is what the statute provides, and that's fundamentally--"
1995.95-83,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,869.251,880.087,But suppose that the court ordered the previous owner to clean up under this statute with proper notice and the owner is contumacious.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,911.817,913.359,"--Well, perhaps as a matter of contempt."
1995.95-83,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,937.635,946.36,"Well, aren't there cases holding that courts retain equitable authority not specifically taken away by Congress?"
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,946.36,947.422,--There are those cases.
1995.95-83,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,949.095,953.726,"Right, and you recognized the validity of that notion."
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,953.726,961.233,"The court does retain equitable power, and the limits on that equitable power are circumscribed by the particular statute at issue."
1995.95-83,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,974.1,983.205,"But in my hypothetical case, you cannot get the power of the court to order that limited measure of damages from the phrase"
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,985.028,989.719,"--Well, again, since the phrase is actually"
1995.95-83,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1004.752,1030.148,"I thought your argument was that given your position on the first point as to whether the statute is directed only to the prevention of future harm, extant threats, that the phrase ""as may be necessary"" must reasonably be read to mean as may be necessary to achieve the purpose of this statute, which is not to reimburse for past expenses but to prevent future harms."
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,1030.148,1032.089,It can be read that way.
1995.95-83,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1032.089,1032.609,"Now, if you--"
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,1033.43,1037.182,"Well, my reading is that the statute has a limited--"
1995.95-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1037.182,1039.875,But Justice Scalia just set out a position.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,1044.7,1058.008,"--The way I read the statute... and I was taking Justice Scalia's comments in the context of Justice Kennedy's question, but fundamentally the way I read the statute is the statute says that you can address an imminent harm."
1995.95-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1063.261,1070.565,And that is what circumscribes the court's power as a court of equity to make orders and provide remedies.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,1071.626,1071.897,"--Yes, that is true."
1995.95-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1071.897,1072.067,All right.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,1122.337,1123.809,I'm about to.
1995.95-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1123.809,1124.079,Good.
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,1124.079,1130.995,I think the court does because you're starting from a point where the court exercises its jurisdiction initially consistent with the statute.
1995.95-83,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1140.449,1143.862,"And once you say that, then aren't you back into a line drawing problem."
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,1169.123,1188.213,Not necessarily because where I... the way I get to the ability to award damages in the hypothetical posed first by Justice Souter and then by Justice Kennedy is the jurisdiction is invoked initially pursuant to the statute to remedy a future harm or an imminent endangerment.
1995.95-83,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1200.101,1208.429,"Do you have an answer to the, I think, main criticism of your reading which is that it encourages delay on the part of the person on the spot?"
1995.95-83,0,33739,john_p_zaimes,,1218.844,1221.064,I have three very brief answers to that.
1995.95-83,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1302.184,1304.017,"Yes, you may, Mr. Zaimes."
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1306.298,1321.659,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-83,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1408.733,1410.466,"What again is your reference there, Mr. Minear?"
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1410.466,1413.088,That is at appendix page 3 of the red brief.
1995.95-83,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1413.088,1414.22,And what section?
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1414.22,1417.161,It is 7002(b)(2)(B).
1995.95-83,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1417.161,1418.1,Thank you.
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1418.1,1431.049,"This... the construction that we urge here is not only consistent with the statutory terms, but it is also consistent with the overall design of the statute which is structured to abate existing hazards."
1995.95-83,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1479.661,1481.523,"Well, we didn't take this case to get rid of the case."
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1502.839,1505.3,"Well, I think there are two answers to that."
1995.95-83,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1538.714,1541.055,"The opinion doesn't read that way, Mr. Minear."
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1551.871,1552.692,--Your Honor--
1995.95-83,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1552.692,1562.079,Do you argue that the statute authorizes the court to award past cleanup costs as a remedy or that it just doesn't prohibit it?
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1562.079,1569.404,"--It doesn't expressly address the issue, but it does provide... allow the court to allow relief that is necessary."
1995.95-83,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1569.404,1579.209,"Well, do you say that actual money damages for past cleanup costs fits within that statutory description?"
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1579.209,1584.314,We think in certain circumstances a monetary remedy can be necessary to fulfill the purposes of the statute.
1995.95-83,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.112,1644.415,But this isn't a broad grant of equitable jurisdiction.
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1649.759,1657.003,"Well, we think that the primary circumspection or limitation on the court's power is really the requirement of the current endangerment."
1995.95-83,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1666.409,1671.255,"Well, do you think that the language to ""restrain any person"", et cetera and then to"
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1681.764,1682.395,"--Yes, we think it is."
1995.95-83,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1699.268,1708.313,"Well, it seems to me not just an injustice, but an injustice that is related to eliminating a... an extant threat to the environment."
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1708.313,1708.554,--That is correct.
1995.95-83,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1709.402,1723.872,"As I hear you now and as I heard Mr. Zaimes' concession in oral argument, I don't think you're disagreeing with Mr. Zaimes on this point anymore, as you seemed to be originally."
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1739.203,1743.277,"If Mr. Zaimes has made that concession, then we are in substantial agreement on that point."
1995.95-83,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1743.277,1748.198,"But I thought you went somewhat further, and let's take this case exactly, what the dates were."
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1801.957,1807.089,"It's our view that all of them may be reimbursable, but there are several other conditions that we would recognize."
1995.95-83,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.378,1853.692,I don't see how that's necessary to achieve the purpose of the statute.
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1864.09,1867.792,"--Well, Congress does not simply see... wishing to see that the sites be cleaned up."
1995.95-83,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.595,1872.266,Not in this statute.
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1893.871,1895.173,May I answer that question?
1995.95-83,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.173,1895.482,Yes.
1995.95-83,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1895.482,1905.699,"We draw a different distinction with regard to that line that Congress drew, and that is that it was concerned with directing the court's resources to imminent hazards, those that required immediate abatement."
1995.95-83,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1909.861,1910.812,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,1912.564,1917.096,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1995.95-83,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.765,1944.826,"No, I don't think that was the concession."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,1960.578,1962.04,The court--
1995.95-83,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.04,1977.821,"What he conceded is that a court could issue an order allowing the party now in possession of the property to clean up the hazard, the extant hazard, and saying, when you clean it up, you will be paid for... it will be paid for by the other party."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,1979.601,1985.705,"--In other words, availability of restitutionary remedies is present in the statute, and this is about one-half of our argument."
1995.95-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1986.496,1987.137,"Well, I'm not sure."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2006.912,2007.242,--That's correct.
1995.95-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2007.242,2010.805,Those were decided well before our opinion in Cort v. Ash.
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2010.805,2011.246,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-83,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2053.106,2056.129,"Well, there's nothing implied about the cause of action here, is there?"
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2056.129,2056.329,No.
1995.95-83,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2056.82,2061.594,Any person may commence a civil action on his own behalf.
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2065.866,2066.677,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1995.95-83,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.54,2117.751,"Yes, after the case is pending."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2128.199,2131.782,"Justice Scalia, let me respond to some comments you made which bear on this point."
1995.95-83,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.433,2168.958,But not to remedy... not to shift money around with respect to past threats.
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2171.92,2180.435,--The issue is that is presented before this Court is what should a property owner do upon the discovery of contamination on his property.
1995.95-83,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2214.409,2216.499,I might have enacted a different statute.
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2218.642,2218.852,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.95-83,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2221.864,2226.98,"Then why didn't they use the same words, encompassing words, that were used in CERCLA?"
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2233.803,2240.096,"--Justice Ginsburg, this is a very different statute from CERCLA, and in fact it is unique."
1995.95-83,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2250.964,2253.326,I'm talking about what you can recover.
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2263.361,2264.283,--Yes.
1995.95-83,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2264.283,2273.59,"And here there is no similar provision that says for what you've done to clean it up, you can recover."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2273.59,2279.862,We believe that Congress... Congress could have put the imminent hazard/endangerment provision in CERCLA.
1995.95-83,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2326.036,2342.455,"Well, what's your position, Mr. Romano, with respect to a situation where a property owner discovers the hazard, goes ahead and cleans it up so that there's no longer any imminent or substantial endangerment, and then goes to court?"
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2346.349,2358.998,"Well, I believe that under the proper circumstances this particular individual may recover his... may obtain equitable restitution of his environmental cleanup costs, those costs that were necessary, in the words of the statute--"
1995.95-83,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2358.998,2364.511,"So, you say then he doesn't have to present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2364.511,2370.594,--We don't believe that the condition of imminent and substantial endangerment has to be present at the time of the filing of the lawsuit.
1995.95-83,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2401.295,2409.189,"It's... but in 2, which is what says what the court can do, it refers to the endangerment."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2413.864,2414.285,Which?
1995.95-83,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2436.208,2450.488,"Well, but that may be a good argument, as one of my colleagues said, for a different statute, but it seems to me that this statute does require an imminent and substantial endangerment at the time you bring the lawsuit."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2450.488,2457.602,"--Your Honor, the only words that even hint on that is the language ""may present"" which, granted, is in the present tense."
1995.95-83,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2458.473,2458.663,Wait a minute.
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2494.119,2494.97,--Your Honor--
1995.95-83,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2494.97,2507.009,--Why would you eliminate somebody's cause of action for past damages so long as a State is pursuing a remedy to enjoin any future violation?
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2508.969,2513.954,"--If I understand Your Honor's question, it deals with violation of standards or permit conditions or so forth."
1995.95-83,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2590.878,2593.459,But that's just bad English.
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2612.02,2612.481,Your Honor--
1995.95-83,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2612.481,2616.035,"When we say may exist, we mean... what we mean is may exist, now."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2616.035,2623.428,"--I understand that there is for sure... for sure there is an ambiguity in the way the statute is written, and we believe that our reading of the statute--"
1995.95-83,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2623.428,2623.639,You missed my point.
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2633.679,2642.976,"--Your Honor, we believe that when Congress wanted to put limitations on when such lawsuits should be filed, it put them under the actions prohibited section."
1995.95-83,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2658.376,2672.775,"Well, would you say the same thing about (a)(1)(B)'s list of potential defendants like a present generator or something, that those are just kind of illustrative and you could bring an action against lots of other people too?"
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2672.775,2688.637,"You can bring an action under the terms of the statute against all past and present owners... not owners, transporters, basically all the group of defendants which are alleged to have contributed in some fashion to the contamination of the property."
1995.95-83,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2724.0,2730.044,"Well, I thought your client made the cleanup because ordered to do so by the City of Los Angeles."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2732.598,2735.949,"Your Honor, there was actually never an order."
1995.95-83,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2736.598,2739.039,But the city said you had to do it.
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2739.039,2743.042,"--The city said if you want to build your restaurant on this property, you better take care of that problem."
1995.95-83,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2768.22,2773.092,"Well, you still have some State causes of action here presumably."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2773.092,2778.026,"Your Honor, our experience in this case is that we actually do not."
1995.95-83,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2807.271,2809.08,That's... isn't that make sense?
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2830.004,2830.535,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-83,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2830.535,2836.648,--which would argue then against using this statute simply to try to get damages for something that's over and done with in the past.
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2836.648,2837.329,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-83,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2838.401,2839.552,But then how would you win?
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2863.177,2863.457,"No, we do not."
1995.95-83,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2865.16,2871.635,"What you're calling restitution, but I mean, you want to be reimbursed from them who didn't cause the problem for your expenditure."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2888.946,2897.472,"Your Honor, the issue as to whether or not in fact we are relying... we are entitled to obtain restitution from the Meghrigs is really not before the Court today."
1995.95-83,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2906.928,2911.379,May I ask another question that you could answer that's not strictly before us?
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2931.465,2944.111,"Your Honor, in response to the second question, we believe that the Meghrigs are responsible under State law, and in fact that's why we took an appeal from that order that was attached to... as an exhibit... an appendix to the petitioner's brief."
1995.95-83,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2944.111,2950.375,"What about under the Federal statute that says, has contributed or who is contributing?"
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2960.703,2962.336,That in fact we believe is incorrect.
1995.95-83,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2971.231,2983.289,"But just let's assume I said that they're correct, that the gas station long preceded their ownership of this property, that they did not contribute to the contamination."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2991.194,2994.105,--Under State law?
1995.95-83,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2994.105,2995.377,"No, under this statute."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,2995.377,3006.234,"They may well be deemed to have contributed under the Federal statute if they had discovered the presence of contamination on the property and did absolutely nothing about it, which the facts... that's what the fact show."
1995.95-83,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3006.234,3014.632,I thought there was... discovery wasn't made until... that your client wanted to do this building.
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,3014.632,3030.5,"Discovery by my client wasn't made, but we had found that there was... we believe that certainly the Meghrigs' agents, their father and the contractor that was managing the property on their behalf, they are the entities that removed the underground tanks."
1995.95-83,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3042.819,3045.35,Then if you can go to my other question.
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,3052.205,3069.636,"--We were faced with a situation where the issue was either go to Federal court and litigate this for opinion order, at the very minimum 90 days but more likely several months or years down the line, maybe all the way up to this Court before we could do anything about the property."
1995.95-83,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3070.297,3072.749,"Well, not according to the Government's interpretation."
1995.95-83,2,21434,daniel_romano,,3099.365,3109.833,"--I think that the short answer to that one, Your Honor, is that at the time that my client found out about the contamination, he was more concerned about taking care of the problem as opposed to suing people for recovery of his cleanup costs."
1995.95-83,3,33739,john_p_zaimes,,3222.547,3225.63,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-83,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3355.895,3356.886,"Thank you, Mr. Zaimes."
