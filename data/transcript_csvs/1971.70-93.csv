1971.70-93,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.409,"We will hear arguments next in number 93, National Labor Relations Board against the Nash-Finch Company."
1971.70-93,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,55.223,59.504,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-93,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,226.08,238.631,"The issue in this case does not, resolution of the issue in this case at least in your submission does not really depend at all on the ultimate outcome of anything in the Board's administrative proceeding, does it?"
1971.70-93,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,238.631,241.572,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-93,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,255.009,264.409,"Then you say that merits even on the --unlike for injunction or not, have not been litigated and not before us?"
1971.70-93,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,264.409,265.293,That is our --
1971.70-93,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,265.293,266.374,Usual questions?
1971.70-93,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,266.374,273.273,That we have asked to have the case remanded for a hearing on the merits of the Board's complaint.
1971.70-93,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,284.608,300.646,"Mr. Wallace, would the hearing in the District Court which you suggest merely go to whether or not the activities that have been enjoined are arguably protected or would you say the District Court could decide then and there, whether they are actually were protected or not?"
1971.70-93,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,300.646,308.685,"Well, that question is very closely related to the question that divided court in the Ariadne case in 397 U.S."
1971.70-93,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,308.685,310.317,(Voice Overlap) for you.
1971.70-93,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,310.317,314.596,Under the complaint in accordance with the majority opinion Ariadne.
1971.70-93,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,321.94,328.379,So that they -- if your position is this that it were arguably protected the District Court should enjoin the (Inaudible)?
1971.70-93,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,328.379,333.054,"Well, we understand that to be the law under guidance and related cases through Ariadne."
1971.70-93,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.054,339.211,Even though there is no way of getting the issue before the Court is to whether it is actually protected?
1971.70-93,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,339.211,343.848,Well that is what we understand the law should be Mr. Justice.
1971.70-93,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.534,517.414,What about Younger and (Inaudible) sort of an approach or Atlantic Coast Line?
1971.70-93,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,517.414,536.033,"Well, we have emphasized in our brief that we think cases concerning private litigation between private parties stand aside from the issue here which is the issue under the Leiter Mineral doctrine."
1971.70-93,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,536.033,543.115,"So if this were private parties trying to get the Federal Court injunction, the Younger case might well?"
1971.70-93,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,543.115,544.468,Might well control and --
1971.70-93,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,544.468,546.61,Even though it opened the case?
1971.70-93,1,41526,solomon_i_hirsh,,1726.416,1728.888,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-93,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1745.618,1747.021,Your motion is granted.
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,1765.754,1770.53,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors and may it please the Court."
1971.70-93,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1805.931,1814.391,"Of course, the Court has already said that those were -- do not mean exactly what they say as Leiter Minerals?"
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,1814.391,1818.483,"Yes, Your Honor, but that was not so much that they do not mean what they say."
1971.70-93,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1819.572,1821.122,They had not said enough.
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,1825.918,1840.899,"Yes, Your Honor and I would like to explore for this Court that United States exception that the Board talks about as well as a few other reasons why we believe this Court should affirm the decisions of the Lower Courts in denying to the Board the relief it requests."
1971.70-93,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2098.64,2106.31,"May I ask Mr. Harding, is any addition there on the issue before us, namely whether there was jurisdiction in the District Court to entertain this complaint?"
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,2106.31,2106.957,"No, Your Honors."
1971.70-93,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2111.477,2115.111,But the facts that you are telling us really do not bear on that question of board?
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,2115.111,2115.828,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-93,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2142.389,2154.169,"As I understood you conceded two minutes ago Mr. Harding, that if this record showed peaceful picketing, you would be out of the court?"
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,2154.169,2156.756,"Yes Your Honor, if it was peaceful picketing we would not have gone into state court."
1971.70-93,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2156.756,2163.846,"So to that extent, the facts are relevant to your argument in that respect, are they not?"
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,2163.846,2177.068,"Only to the extent, Your Honor that the Board has made this as a basis of its argument before this Court as to why it should have had jurisdiction given to the District Court and in our counter argument to that fact."
1971.70-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.06,2200.655,"Well, yes, but would you not be making the same 2283 argument here even if there was nothing involved in the State Court except peaceful picketing?"
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,2206.102,2206.978,"Perhaps, Your Honor but if there is --"
1971.70-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2206.978,2207.898,But perhaps?
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,2207.898,2210.212,"If there is only peaceful picketing, I doubt we would be here."
1971.70-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2210.212,2212.134,"Well, that is not the point?"
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,2212.134,2213.463,I realize that that is why I say perhaps.
1971.70-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.463,2223.829,"It so happens that the Court, that the State Court said that even if you limit picketing to two people, you cannot hand out any hand bill."
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,2241.577,2243.448,If there is only that issue involved Your Honor?
1971.70-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2243.448,2244.474,Yes.
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,2244.474,2251.824,If there is only that issue involved I think the Federal District Court might have felt itself quite bothered by that issue but I think -- I think the --
1971.70-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.824,2253.46,I know (Voice Overlap) Federal District Court.
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,2255.484,2258.668,My position is Your Honor should have been litigated in the State Courts.
1971.70-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2258.668,2262.574,So 2283 would bar the Federal Court in any position?
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,2262.574,2263.507,Yes sir.
1971.70-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2263.507,2263.692,Why?
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,2266.828,2272.067,I do not believe that that is really properly before this Court or I have -- in further answer to your question I --
1971.70-93,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.067,2282.872,"It is not or I do not think it would be before the Court as to whether the -- any, the issue is whether any part of the -- the Federal Court had power to enjoin any part of the State Court injunctions?"
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,2282.872,2297.469,"Well, the reason I say I do not believe it is properly before this Court is because the Board can adequately get around the limitations of 2283 and it could have and should have proceeded in the State Court and could have (Inaudible) its problems there."
1971.70-93,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2509.283,2516.059,Which of our cases emphasize mass picketing as you seem to have it just emphasized that?
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,2516.059,2524.925,"Well, Your Honor a number of cases, Wisconsin -- the Wisconsin cases, the Allen Bradley case has talked about that."
1971.70-93,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2524.925,2526.308,What about the Atlantic Coast Line?
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,2529.268,2532.079,I am not aware that it did Your Honor.
1971.70-93,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3113.527,3118.993,Do you consider it limited solely to executive?
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,3118.993,3119.606,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-93,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3131.207,3136.324,"Well, how do you account for the fact that the Solicitor General is here representing?"
1971.70-93,2,45030,william_a_harding,,3136.324,3141.217,"Well, Your Honor that is an internal procedure that the government follows, that I do not have any control over."
1971.70-93,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3310.045,3311.658,Thank you Mr. Harding.
1971.70-93,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3316.529,3318.505,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-93,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3453.081,3461.585,"Well, Mr. Wallace, I do not know that I have come upon all of them but there appears to be at least three sections."
1971.70-93,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3500.756,3508.506,Congress took that precaution and those provisions all relate to the Boards authority to seek relief (Voice Overlap) that applies directly to --
1971.70-93,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3508.506,3511.555,"What, how (Voice Overlap) to the question before us?"
1971.70-93,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3511.555,3519.318,"Well, I think the difference in this case and those provisions is that there the relief, they are directly on the rights between the parties."
1971.70-93,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3519.318,3529.144,"Well, I do not suggest that is not so, but might there not be an inference from the fact that at least three times Congress did this?"
1971.70-93,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3539.707,3545.907,"Well, it is hard to know what is behind the precautionary language of this kind. I do not know. (Voice Overlap)"
1971.70-93,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3545.907,3547.202,(Voice Overlap)
1971.70-93,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3547.202,3550.538,"Well, there is no specific reference in Norris-LaGuardia Act."
1971.70-93,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3550.538,3558.458,"It might be, it might be that there is a specific reference in Norris-LaGuardia Act in the 1935 Act, specifically named."
1971.70-93,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3558.458,3571.788,"Of course the answer there might be that Leiter Minerals was not decided until 1957 and even United Mine Workers case was, 330 U.S. that was decided after 1935 too."
1971.70-93,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3584.242,3584.802,"Well, or course."
1971.70-93,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3589.612,3595.91,"Well, these 1947 references are not Norris-LaGuardia, at least they say notwithstanding any other provision of law."
1971.70-93,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3595.91,3609.613,"And if the United States is not covered by the Norris-LaGuardia Act, and the agency is entitled the exemption of the United States, that would not been in the need for this sort of provision."
1971.70-93,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3609.613,3614.655,"Well, we need not argue that the United States is not at all subject to the Norris-LaGuardia Act."
1971.70-93,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3614.655,3617.323,"Well, it has been since so held."
1971.70-93,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3617.323,3617.982,Yes.
1971.70-93,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3618.24,3619.534,But it was the position of (Inaudible)
1971.70-93,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3619.534,3620.009,Yes.
1971.70-93,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3638.573,3644.709,"But it is the kind of injunction that is not specifically authorized again, under the terms and privilege of the Act."
1971.70-93,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3646.075,3651.325,"It -- well, yes, about Section 1337 of Title XXVIII."
1971.70-93,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3652.066,3653.853,Thank you Mr. Wallace.
