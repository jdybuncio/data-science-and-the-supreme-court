2019.18-1150,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.165,8.315,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1150, Georgia versus Public.Resource.Org, Inc. Mr. Johnson."
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,8.315,20.315,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Eleventh Circuit held that annotations to Georgia's official code are categorically ineligible for copyright protection."
2019.18-1150,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,178.545,187.07500005,"What do you understand the significance to be of the fact that these annotations, the references are official?"
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,187.07500005,187.8,I --
2019.18-1150,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,187.8,192.75,Does that -- does that give them more weight when they're cited to the court?
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,192.75,193.32,No.
2019.18-1150,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,198.54,203.375,Whether the -- the -- whatever the additional material is included in --
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,203.375,205.76,It does appear in the same publication.
2019.18-1150,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,252.285,253.11,This case --
2019.18-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,253.11,254.06,Except -- go ahead.
2019.18-1150,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,254.06,270.605,"But why isn't -- why isn't the legislature like the judge? The -- the judge puts his imprimatur on the annotations not copyrightable of the syllabus. And, here, it's the state legislature."
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,275.085,286.03,"Well, I think it's different because the general assembly is not enacting individual annotations through bicameralism and presentment."
2019.18-1150,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,297.19,300.925,"But they do it as -- as a -- what do they call it, authors for hire."
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,304.255,314.67,"The state does hold the copyright, that is correct, very much like how an official reporter held the copyright in Wheaton and Callaghan."
2019.18-1150,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,334.61,339.885,"Well, but, counsel, aren't they approved? I thought they were at least approved as a whole by the legislature."
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,339.885,355.47,"So I think the Eleventh Circuit's decision is perhaps a little confusing on this issue, but I don't think that there's any disagreement about the underlying facts. The answer is, as the Eleventh Circuit said in its opinion, the annotations are not individually enacted."
2019.18-1150,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,355.47,356.76,I -- I understand that.
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,358.53,358.91,"Right, right."
2019.18-1150,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,358.91,361.46,Aren't they approved as a whole by the legislature?
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,361.46,375.02,"So what the legislature does every year is passes a reviser act, and the reviser act reenacts the code, including OCGA 1-1-1, which calls for the statutory text to be merged with the annotations."
2019.18-1150,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,375.02,375.23,Okay.
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,401.35,407.295,So I don't think that adopting our position would cause the official law to be hidden behind a pay wall.
2019.18-1150,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,413.79,421.37,"But not the official annotations that the legislature has, in some fashion or another, given its official approval to."
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,421.37,424.75,The annotations are not the law.
2019.18-1150,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,430.44,438.79,You're not arguing that it's purely -- I thought you had disavowed the argument that it's only things that bind for which copyright's unavailable.
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,438.79,448.98,"So our position is that if a work is of a type that, as a class, can serve as a vehicle for establishing binding law like judicial opinions --"
2019.18-1150,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,448.98,458.345,And -- and aren't annotations in that category? Aren't they frequently used by state courts as indications of the legislature's intentions?
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,458.345,478.95,"No, not the type of annotations that we're talking about here. We're talking about traditional annotations that are research references or finding aids. They're things like, to give an example from JA 699, one of the annotations that we're claiming copyright in, says for a survey article on trial practice and procedure, see a particular law review."
2019.18-1150,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,478.95,484.49,So you're disavowing that they're ever used by state courts as indications of legislative intent? That never happens?
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,484.49,484.59,They are --
2019.18-1150,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,484.59,486.995,That's the representation you're making to this Court?
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,486.995,494.09,The annotations would never be used as an indication of legislative intent like you would cite legislative history material.
2019.18-1150,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,494.09,494.21,There are --
2019.18-1150,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,494.21,494.8,Why does Georgia --
2019.18-1150,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,494.8,496.91,"No, go ahead."
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,505.98,520.155,"So the -- it applies to all the annotations we're claiming copyright in. The Georgia Bar, I think of those as comments, not necessarily annotations. They're provided by the Georgia Bar Committee to the Code Revision Commission."
2019.18-1150,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,539.325,540.16,What is the --
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,540.16,541.45,-- or unofficial annotated code.
2019.18-1150,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,541.45,549.54,-- what is the -- what is the theory that distinguishes those annotations from the other annotations?
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,549.54,552.23,"I -- well, I think that, first of all, the author is different."
2019.18-1150,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,568.36,568.995,Why?
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,568.995,586.605,"I -- I -- now I think there could be maybe a debate or dispute about this, but I think that they probably would not be copyrightable because they are offered for the purpose of providing a gloss on the text, the drafter's intent for the statutory text in some cases."
2019.18-1150,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,590.12,597.4,Why would the Georgia Bar have particular insight into the intent of the legislature in enacting a provision of law?
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,597.4,610.675,"Well, often -- my understanding from reading the introductory text to these comments is that they're often drafted by people who were involved in drafting the legislation."
2019.18-1150,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,618.98,624.13,But a lot of people could be involved in -- in -- in the drafting of legislation.
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,646.03,664.48,So I think it's perhaps different because the Georgia Bar has specifically asked for these comments to be included in the OCGA and Georgia courts have treated them as having some authoritative weight. So I think that that's what makes it different.
2019.18-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,673.43,673.85,I -- I'm sorry --
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,673.85,674.63,-- copyrightable or not.
2019.18-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,674.63,717.49,"-- I didn't actually in reading this brief understand that. And I'm not sure the court below did because they relied on the comments as one of the reasons for why this was attributable to the state, for the very reasons you're giving, that the state asked for them, that the state commission who prepares them is involved generally in the drafting of the law. And so I don't think they separated out that the only thing you were seeking copyright protection for is the research comments and the -- what -- tell me exactly which part of the annotations you're seeking."
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,717.49,722.22,It's the materials listed at JA 496 to 497.
2019.18-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,724.15,724.27,"No, no."
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,724.27,724.88,-- if it would be helpful.
2019.18-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,724.97,727.175,That's all right. But I do have a question.
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,827.585,828.78,I think we --
2019.18-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,828.78,844.89,"And if it's going to explain the law, either by reference to comments or by reference to cases that reflect its intent, isn't that an explanation, an official explanation of the law?"
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,844.89,848.53,So I think we win if authorship is the standard.
2019.18-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,857.71,860.02,"No, it doesn't, because it sort of limits it."
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,890.97,915.62,"Well, I -- I think that the answer can't be that the fact that this is an official document makes a difference for copyright purposes under Wheaton and Callaghan. Again, those were official reporters. And if the officialness of the document renders it uncopyrightable, then almost -- I mean, all state government documents in some way are official."
2019.18-1150,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,937.76,944.87,"Mr. Johnson, why does Georgia have an official annotated code? Why not just an official code?"
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,944.87,949.33,I think it's for the benefit of readers so that those finding aids are present.
2019.18-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,960.8,965.05,"Probably governmental -- look, I mean, I thought this isn't that difficult."
2019.18-1150,0,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,1020.415,1035.75,The SG's position is acceptable to us and we win under that standard. Perhaps it would be helpful for me to explain quickly why we do win under that standard. So the Lexis and the Code Revision Commission are not acting in a law-making capacity when making these annotations.
2019.18-1150,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1035.75,1047.06,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang."
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1047.06,1107.02,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court in Banks determined that there was consensus that no copyright exists in a work by ""judicial officers in the discharge of their judicial duties."" Banks then held that a judge who in his judicial capacity prepares an opinion or decisions and other materials is not regarded as the author within the meaning of the copyright statute. Those principles from the judicial context also apply in the law-making context. So, if a lawmaker acts in his capacity as a lawmaker and creates a work in the discharge of his law-making duties that is within the process for creating law, no copyright exists. Now, in this case, this case is going to be controlled, however, by Callaghan. Callaghan upheld a copyright in annotations to judicial decisions by an official court reporter, a salaried public officer of the court, who was appointed and removable by the court."
2019.18-1150,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1116.665,1119.39,Mr. Yang -- I'm sorry. Finish your sentence.
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1119.39,1123.3,"Well, I was just going to say that the -- the annotations here are research aids."
2019.18-1150,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1136.85,1139.38,Don't finish it that far. (Laughter.)
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1139.38,1139.47,Okay.
2019.18-1150,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1143.3,1161.695,"I'm -- I'm glad I asked you to finish it because if -- I mean, you stressed that the Commission doesn't do anything with respect to these annotations. Suppose the Commission did do something with respect to these annotations. They didn't write them themselves, but they supervised the process carefully."
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1168.23,1172.33,I don't know that that would make a difference to the bottom line.
2019.18-1150,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1182.56,1185.6,Are you saying that the Commission just doesn't count as a lawmaker? Is that --
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1185.6,1194.345,"Well, and they're not discharging lawmaking duties, yes, because the Commission is composed of 15 individuals, five of which are not even in the legislative process."
2019.18-1150,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1203.56,1209.23,So -- so -- but the legislature sets up this Commission and puts a bunch of its members on this Commission.
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1209.23,1209.52,Yep.
2019.18-1150,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1209.52,1221.08,"And let's say, in my hypothetical world, this Commission actually takes its job seriously and imposes some editorial standards for what will and will not go into the annotation."
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1222.49,1227.87,"Same result and -- but it's also in the context of the rest of this case, Section 1-1-1."
2019.18-1150,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1245.54,1251.345,"Well, the people look at the annotations pretty carefully as guides to what that law is all about."
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1251.345,1252.33,"Well, if they looked at the annotations --"
2019.18-1150,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1252.33,1264.67,"And if the Commission is basically involved in -- in what should be in and what shouldn't be in to explain to people what the law means, why would that be copyrightable?"
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1264.67,1267.2,I don't think they're actually explaining what the law means.
2019.18-1150,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1285.21,1291.13,"So you think even if the Commission actually wrote the annotations, it would still --"
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1291.13,1294.075,"That's right, because -- and look what the annotations are."
2019.18-1150,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1311.42,1316.58,"Would it make a difference if -- if, instead of the Commission, it were done by the legislature itself?"
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1316.58,1319.39,"You know, I think that would be a little more complicated."
2019.18-1150,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1319.39,1321.69,But all they do is -- is describe what judges do.
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1321.69,1322.54,After the --
2019.18-1150,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1322.54,1322.75,That's it.
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1322.75,1324.24,"Oh, no, I think that would be the same."
2019.18-1150,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1324.24,1324.45,Okay.
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1324.45,1325.12,I -- I think you would --
2019.18-1150,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1325.12,1333.355,"Let's say it was adopted by the legislature too, and let's say we put the word ""official"" on it for whatever good that does market -- market power-wise."
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1334.94,1349.795,"Well, if it's done as it is done here, which I think, if you look, for instance, in the Respondent's brief at pages 2a and 3a, the -- the -- it's prepared -- it says the official code, I mean, is prepared by the Commission, legislative counsel, and Lexis."
2019.18-1150,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1360.15,1360.47,All right.
2019.18-1150,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1360.47,1361.17,Isn't a different --
2019.18-1150,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1361.17,1364.1,"Nice evasion, but if we could just answer the question -- (Laughter.)"
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1364.1,1364.7,"No, no, I -- but I don't think --"
2019.18-1150,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1364.7,1376.0,-- I'd be grateful. Let's say the legislature itself does the reviewing of all of the judicial opinions and then it collects the ones and then it enacts it and calls it official or not official.
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1378.945,1382.8,"Yes, if they are doing it in the same way, which is that they're --"
2019.18-1150,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1382.8,1383.35,Because it's not --
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1383.35,1384.03,-- they're covering the waterfront.
2019.18-1150,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1384.03,1385.87,"-- in the same capacity, right? I mean, that's what it comes down to."
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1391.475,1393.82,That is our understanding as drawn from Banks.
2019.18-1150,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1393.82,1394.4,Then the answer is no.
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1433.78,1434.39,"Well, I don't think --"
2019.18-1150,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1434.39,1437.76,And that -- that's -- that's what I thought that the argument was as I got the entire brief.
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1437.76,1439.2,I'm not sure there's any disagreement.
2019.18-1150,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1449.61,1451.435,"I -- I'm sorry, I don't understand."
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1453.85,1454.99,"Well, maybe this will clarify."
2019.18-1150,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1454.99,1465.615,"Let me -- let me clarify -- let me just get to something very simple, okay? Let's assume there are some states that have pro se guidelines."
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1480.36,1485.965,"If, for instance, this is like a -- your -- it's -- let me draw an example."
2019.18-1150,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1496.53,1496.62,Right.
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1497.43,1502.475,"We understand that -- no, we understand that to be in the context of the rule-making proceeding."
2019.18-1150,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1502.475,1502.85,All right.
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1502.85,1503.0,All right.
2019.18-1150,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1503.06,1542.15,"So why is that different if -- and I think your brief made very clear, committee reports, even on failed legislation, wouldn't be copyrightable. Materials prepared for that process are not copyrightable unless the individual -- the state didn't require them or -- or create them. So why is it that an official guide to an official code where the annotations merge with that code that are prepared by the state, why aren't those copyrightable?"
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1542.15,1542.38,There's a --
2019.18-1150,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1542.38,1543.4,Why aren't they like --
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1543.4,1546.68,"There's a few things that are, I think, incorrect in the premise."
2019.18-1150,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1569.35,1569.91,Suppose that weren't true.
2019.18-1150,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1569.91,1570.25,So is it --
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1570.25,1570.63,-- isn't the law.
2019.18-1150,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1570.63,1585.105,"Suppose the Commission, when it supervised, part of its supervision, it looked over the annotations and it picked out a few that it thought were egregiously wrong in terms of interpreting the law."
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1586.45,1588.67,"You know, I think it would start to be a little harder."
2019.18-1150,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1594.12,1602.095,"A little bit harder, but that's still copyrightable if the -- if the Commission is saying no, that's an incorrect interpretation of law?"
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1602.095,1602.79,"You know, I --"
2019.18-1150,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1602.79,1603.99,We'll take out that annotation?
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1603.99,1614.42,"-- I think because the Commission, is, again, making an observation with respect to what these other parties do, they don't have any particular expertise, it's not the legislature itself doing this, I think --"
2019.18-1150,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1614.42,1614.51,Okay.
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1617.13,1623.54,"Well, if the legislature did that, I think there would be a question whether that is part of the legislative process --"
2019.18-1150,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1623.54,1623.88,Isn't that --
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1623.88,1624.28,"-- for instance, for --"
2019.18-1150,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1624.28,1632.87,"-- isn't that Banks? I mean, isn't that the -- potentially Justice Gorsuch's hypothetical, the distinction between Banks and Callaghan or not?"
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1632.87,1633.68,"Well, I think Banks --"
2019.18-1150,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1633.68,1636.64,"In other words, can't you give up that hypothetical and still win?"
2019.18-1150,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1636.64,1655.195,"I think we could give it up, but let me -- let me take a step back and say we can look -- start looking to the fringes of this case, but when we look at the core of what -- what this is about and the way that this has arisen, the test that we think flows from Banks and Callaghan is one that takes care of the real-world consequences here."
2019.18-1150,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1655.195,1665.82,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Citron."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,1665.82,1676.02,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think it's useful to remember that the question Georgia presented in this case was whether the government edicts doctrine extends to documents that lack the force of law."
2019.18-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1729.71,1736.065,Why is it different if the state -- or is it? The state hires an official historian.
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,1751.695,1753.895,I think that is copyrightable because --
2019.18-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1753.895,1765.62999995,"Because? Why is that copyrightable and yet a comment made by the professor's cousin, who happens to teach in law school, is not copyrightable?"
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,1765.62999995,1766.39,Uh --
2019.18-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1766.39,1780.835,"The comment being on the state of the law, the comment being a summary of the cases, the comment being the -- the six things listed on page, whatever it was, page 497, the seven things."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,1782.68,1786.5,"I guess I want to answer both parts of the question, but I'm going to take the second part first."
2019.18-1150,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1815.11,1824.73,"I understand, Mr. Citron, that the SG is essentially saying, well, for these annotations, the state is not telling you what it thinks about the law."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,1836.04,1838.85,"Well, I -- I don't think they're the same for two reasons."
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1874.56,1876.57,How is that different from the court reporter?
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,1876.57,1885.04,"Because the court reporter doesn't -- isn't responsible for the text of the opinions at all, right? They're not allowed to move around the text and say, well, this would be clearer --"
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1885.04,1890.025,They're responsible for the text of what they -- they produce as the summary.
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,1890.025,1895.955,"What they add they are responsible for, but the court is not responsible for it, and that's the big difference."
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1935.92,1940.07,And what's the -- what's the difference between the Commission and the -- and the reporter? I'm sorry.
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,1940.07,1943.44,The difference between the Commission and the reporter?
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1943.44,1944.47,"Yeah, the court reporter."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,1944.47,1945.67,The Commission --
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1945.67,1952.775,"In other words, how do you deal with Callaghan and Wheaton, I guess, and Howell, if we're going to bring in the Sixth Circuit decision in Howell?"
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,1952.775,1966.63,"I think the difference is that the classic judicial reporter, particularly in the 19th century, which is what we should try to keep in mind, spoke in their own voice when they added materials to the Court's opinion. The Code Revision Commission does not speak in its own voice."
2019.18-1150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1986.37,2003.275,"Does this amount to anything other than the label that's put on this volume? Suppose they put -- they made it clear in labeling the volume that the law itself is the official -- the code itself is the official law of the State of Georgia, all of the rest is not official."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2003.275,2004.65,Uh --
2019.18-1150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2004.65,2006.055,Would that take care of the problem?
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2006.055,2021.19,"I don't think it would take care of the problem in the following sense. If the state is the one that actually puts together the annotations, and it's known that these are the state's annotations, labeling part of it official and part of it unofficial is not going to do the trick. But that does go a long way."
2019.18-1150,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2035.48,2048.32,"Mr. Citron, in both Wheaton and in Callaghan, both opinion mentioned that the cover pages said that these reports were by the individuals, not by the state."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2048.32,2048.9,Yeah.
2019.18-1150,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2048.9,2056.61,"And so the state wasn't claiming ownership or title to these annotations, correct?"
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2056.61,2057.365,That's right.
2019.18-1150,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2057.365,2071.76,"That's different from here, where neither Lexis nor -- am I wrong? I don't think the annotation tells us who prepared the annotations, or does it? I -- I didn't look specifically."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2071.76,2088.46,"I mean, the reason the Eleventh Circuit got confused about whether these comments were -- who they were authored by and whether they were distinguishable from the other kinds of annotations in which they claim copyright is there isn't anything on the face of the annotations to tell you who wrote them or who's responsible for them."
2019.18-1150,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2088.46,2088.73,All right.
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2099.15,2099.79,Well --
2019.18-1150,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2099.79,2102.67,"I know you don't accept their test, so don't fight the hypothetical."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2102.67,2102.9,Okay.
2019.18-1150,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2102.9,2103.5,Okay?
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2103.5,2104.01,Yes.
2019.18-1150,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2104.01,2106.24,Accept the hypothetical.
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2106.24,2107.265,Yeah.
2019.18-1150,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2107.265,2111.45,And tell me why they're wrong under their -- their test.
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2111.45,2115.845,I -- I think the simplest understanding is the following.
2019.18-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2181.34,2182.225,What does the --
2019.18-1150,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2182.225,2215.15500005,"Mr. Citron, may I ask you a basic question of -- of what matters here? One thing is that the annotations have the official state imprimatur, and you say that that's what matters. But why instead shouldn't it matter that these annotations are in no sense the law, they're just useful information on how the law has been interpreted and applied by others?"
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2215.15500005,2222.81,"I think it's what you mean by ""in no sense the law,"" which is, I think, a complicated concept."
2019.18-1150,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2249.25,2265.03,"Well, they're not saying it's a good summary or a bad summary. They may take comments from both sides, one interpreting it one way, one interpreting another way."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2292.39,2296.595,"Well, the best I can say about it is this."
2019.18-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2349.0,2350.41,"That's -- that's, I think, the question."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2409.96,2441.84,"I'll give you my best shot, okay? There are no cases in Georgia that have ever cited West's unofficial annotated code of Georgia because it's not official and it's not something you would bring to court and say: Well, look, an editor of Westlaw tells us that this is -- that this case is relevant or that this statute became effective on this date. There are lots of cases that cite the annotations to the OCGA, as such, in Georgia for lots of different kinds of propositions."
2019.18-1150,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2441.84,2457.08,"But I think one question that is -- I think Justice Ginsburg asked it, is -- is -- is some of your examples, they are government documents with a point of view, and -- and when you think about one of these annotation books, it doesn't look like it has a point of view."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2474.215,2480.71,So that's true of the judicial annotations because the judicial annotations are themselves summaries of the cases.
2019.18-1150,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2518.78,2520.28,"So what do you mean by ""the editor's notes""?"
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2520.28,2561.79,"The editor's notes are notes that appear in the OCGA that describe things like when this code provision becomes effective, whether it was the product of a veto, override, or how it was enacted, and it can be extremely important to deciding a case. So one of the cases that we point to where this -- an editor's note was cited is cited for the proposition that the -- the state changed the rule for when a breathalyzer test was admissible, and it did so retroactively to all cases that were pending on -- at the time that it was signed. The state cites -- the court cites the editor's note for that proposition, and that's the reason this person is acquitted in that case."
2019.18-1150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2561.79,2565.475,Is there -- is -- is there any other source for that proposition?
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2565.475,2573.0,"Sure, you could go back to the statute at large, just like you could for all the non-positive law titles of the U.S. Code."
2019.18-1150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2573.0,2593.21,"So, if there were an award given out by the Law Review Commission every year for the best treatise in a particular area, in other words, we think this is, you know, the best treatise, and as a result, it's cited more frequently and more authoritatively than other treatises, does that change the copyright status?"
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2593.21,2598.54,I don't think so because I don't think that that treatise is still speaking with the authority of the state.
2019.18-1150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2608.76,2622.2,"But, I mean, the fact that the courts are going to cite that treatise and, you know, with some -- probably more frequency than -- than others, so the fact that you have this editor's note that tells you it's retroactive, that's not what makes it retroactive."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2642.12,2648.985,"No, I -- I -- I will admit to you at the end of the day that the statute at large is going to control over the editor's note."
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2692.83,2693.515,There's a lot of --
2019.18-1150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2693.515,2694.035,You gave us a --
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2694.035,2694.655,Go ahead.
2019.18-1150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2694.655,2697.215,You gave us a two-part test.
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2700.44,2711.13,"It's just a work -- a legal work is going to do one of two things. It's going to purport to state what the law is or interpret it, or it's going to be a part of the process of making it."
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2718.55,2731.21,"There's a lot of debate about what the precedents mean here. Should we interpret them in the direction of the text of the Copyright Act, which clearly says states can get copyright protection for annotations?"
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2731.21,2738.655,"I mean, states can get copyright protection for annotations only insofar as they meet the authorship requirement of the Act."
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2748.04,2748.14,What --
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2748.14,2748.81,-- to change it.
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2748.81,2754.645,"What about Howell? Do you accept Howell as correctly decided, the Sixth Circuit decision by Justice Harlan?"
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2754.645,2758.35,"Yeah, we -- we accept Howell as correctly decided and we think it's a good case for us."
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2758.35,2759.28,Explain that.
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2759.28,2759.37,Okay.
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2759.37,2761.31,"Because it doesn't seem that way to me, but go ahead."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2761.31,2821.83,"I'll give it my best shot. So it's really important to focus on the order of operations in Howell and how it's different from what happens here. So, in Howell, Howell compiles, acting on his own, a compilation of the Michigan statutes together with his own annotations. After he does that, Michigan passes a statute authenticating just the -- the statutory portion of his work, and it says, you can treat that statutory portion as though it were published under the authority of the state. And that causes Justice Harlan to write an opinion that says, even though Howell did that work on his own, you can cut and paste that text directly out of his book in order to republish a compilation of the laws because no one can own the laws. The other stuff, which Howell had produced first on his own and the state had never authenticated, remained Howell's property. The exact opposite happens with the OCGA. Lexis produces the annotation for and at the commission of a state commission."
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2841.195,2843.57,"The merger can't make the difference, though, right?"
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2843.57,2855.305,"No, I think the merger does make a difference because that is the legislature deciding that these annotations will be part of the code and then publishing that code under the state's authority. It could do the opposite."
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2880.9,2885.74,"But, if you cited the annotations as binding law, that would be wrong."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2885.74,2888.425,"Well, two -- two things about that."
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2889.9,2891.64,Or even -- or even instructive.
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2892.645,2893.86,I don't think that's right.
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2906.83,2907.24,The court would do --
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2907.24,2907.61,-- way to use --
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2907.61,2913.48,"Correct me if I'm wrong, the court would do its own independent research to determine the weight to be afforded that authority."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2913.48,2913.81,Right.
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2938.77,2943.595,Can I ask you a question from a different direction? Which is the states' amicus brief --
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2943.595,2943.82,Uh-huh.
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2943.82,2960.86,"-- which is a cross-section of states, makes a very strong argument that this is going to create problems in terms of incentives for creating these annotations in the first place, and so the net result of your position, if it wins, so the states claim, is that there will be fewer of these annotations."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2961.85,2977.16,"Yeah, happy to. If the proposition, which has to be Georgia's view, is that the annotations are just the same as private annotations, there is at least one, and usually two, privately annotated legal codes available for every state in the union."
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2988.84,2989.42,So the states are just --
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2989.42,2990.14,-- by the differences in this case.
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2990.14,2997.905,"-- wrong about that? I mean, isn't there a cost/price issue that's involved? Or why are the states saying that if they're -- they have nothing to fear?"
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,2997.905,3000.57,I -- I don't think the states have anything to fear.
2019.18-1150,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3017.89,3018.26,"Well, I thought that --"
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,3018.26,3018.69,-- copyright issue is --
2019.18-1150,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3018.69,3021.4,-- Mr. Johnson told me that they would be more expensive.
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,3022.795,3025.63,I do dispute that in two respects.
2019.18-1150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3084.285,3094.94,What's your best -- what is your best evidence that the state actually edits what Lexis does or supervises the substance of what Lexis does?
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,3094.94,3135.47,"Well, so there's a couple of things in the publication manual that set forth how Lexis is supposed to communicate with the state, and it requires sending them memos with bracketing around what the new material is, Xeroxing the pages on which any ALR notes or opinions of the attorney general might be deleted and pointing them out for state approval. The publication manual also highlights situations in which the state is likely to tell them what kind of editor's note to create surrounding complicated amendments or the like. So the Commission is involved, but we don't have -- because the case was decided on summary judgment, we just don't have a record of how often this -- the Commission actually --"
2019.18-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3135.47,3140.32,The -- I just thought of a possible -- this should shed a lot of light in a number of areas.
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,3208.355,3209.86,"Oh, I'm comfortable --"
2019.18-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3209.86,3210.0,You are?
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,3210.0,3211.09,-- with you thinking that way.
2019.18-1150,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3263.015,3270.12,"Presumably, a certified copy of the committee report would not be post hoc."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,3270.12,3282.24,"Whether -- I think the point I was trying to make is post hoc or not might affect how much weight you want to give it, but the fact that it's a certified committee report is the thing that really makes the difference."
2019.18-1150,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3282.24,3321.82,"Now I -- I understand Justice Ginsburg's question because I do think there's -- the comments troubled me, taking the government and Petitioners' side, the editorial notes trouble me, but most of the references in the notes are just to judicial decisions and/or general research matters. If it were limited just to that, is that -- why can't the state --"
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,3321.82,3323.06,I -- I'll just give you --
2019.18-1150,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3323.06,3323.71,-- this is what --
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,3323.71,3324.18,Yeah.
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3397.505,3404.3,"But that would be a mistake, right? I mean, isn't that -- it would be a mistake to attribute the significance to it."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,3404.3,3406.56,I don't know if it would be a mistake or not.
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3406.56,3408.68,"Under -- under state law, it would be a mistake."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,3408.68,3415.23,"I mean, what -- what they did was attribute significance to the fact that you could find it there in the manual, when they were trying to figure out --"
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3415.23,3415.85,"But, under state law --"
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,3415.85,3416.27,-- what would be --
2019.18-1150,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3416.27,3417.545,-- isn't that -- that's wrong.
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,3417.545,3433.88,"Well, no, the state law would say that it would be wrong in construing the meaning of that statute, but it isn't necessarily wrong for figuring out what's excusable neglect, right? Whether it's good lawyering or bad lawyering, not to look at the annotations in the OCGA isn't governed by the statute."
2019.18-1150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3437.665,3443.885,"Well, but it would also be pertinent to the question of excusable neglect to look at what, you know, all the treatises said."
2019.18-1150,2,63195,eric_f_citron,,3453.03,3455.43,I -- I think you and I may have different instincts about that.
2019.18-1150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3473.995,3477.71,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Johnson."
2019.18-1150,3,63194,joshua_s_johnson,,3477.71,3531.65,"I want to start briefly by talking about the different portions of the OCGA, things like editors' notes. We talked in our brief about why the editors' notes should be copyrightable, why the Dominiak case that my friend on the other side just was describing doesn't undermine our copyright claim. But I think the crucial point on this is that PRO copied the entirety of the OCGA, including the judicial decision summaries that I think are clearly copyrightable under Wheaton and Callaghan. So PRO has to run the table on all portions of the OCGA to get an affirmance here, and I just don't think that they can. The PRO's main argument seems to be that the fact that the OCGA is official means that it cannot be copyrightable."
2019.18-1150,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3653.88,3655.12,"Thank you, counsel."
