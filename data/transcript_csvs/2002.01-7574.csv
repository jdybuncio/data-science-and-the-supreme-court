2002.01-7574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,19.774,"We'll hear argument next in Number 01-7574, David Allen Sattazahn versus Pennsylvania."
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,83.015,86.458,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-7574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,144.332,150.92,"But that wasn't the result of the same sort of factual determination by a jury that took place in Bullington, was it?"
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,150.92,152.201,"No, that's correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-7574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,192.082,194.721,"But in Bullington the verdict was unanimous, was it not?"
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,194.721,195.426,That's correct.
2002.01-7574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.426,198.148,"Well, isn't that quite a significant difference?"
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,203.432,216.89,"Well, Your Honor, they did not hang in the traditional sense of a hung jury, and the distinction between this case and a hung jury case is the following."
2002.01-7574,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,261.471,262.548,But you agree--
2002.01-7574,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,262.548,265.482,--That assumes the point in issue.
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,297.637,315.72,"--Well, Your Honor, this is like Smalis versus Pennsylvania, another double jeopardy case in Pennsylvania that was a decade before, in which Pennsylvania... this Court correctly found that Pennsylvania could say what was necessary for the court to enter a judgment--"
2002.01-7574,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,315.72,316.342,"Yes, but--"
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,316.342,318.032,--but not say what the constitutional--
2002.01-7574,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,318.032,336.032,"--that was a question of what was... whether or not there was double jeopardy, whether or not he, in fact, could be subject to a new trial, but you are telling us that the State in this case has said that this is his... the State's only chance, and that's not the way the State reads this law."
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,336.691,338.383,"--This is what the statute says, Your Honor."
2002.01-7574,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,342.72,346.639,The statute doesn't say anything about this is the State's only chance.
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,346.639,355.267,"--Your Honor, what the statute says... that's true, the statute does not expressly say this is your only chance."
2002.01-7574,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,390.024,401.52,"Mr. Dunham, do I understand that essentially what you are arguing is that we have here, to put it in simple terms, claim preclusion but not issue preclusion?"
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,438.859,457.974,"There's no issue preclusion with respect to aggravating and circumstance... aggravating and mitigating circumstances, Your Honor, but what's clear is that this jury had made a legally binding factual determination with respect to the issue of life or death, and--"
2002.01-7574,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,457.974,458.224,But this jury--
2002.01-7574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.224,458.696,--But it--
2002.01-7574,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,458.696,461.296,--didn't do anything but say We can't agree.
2002.01-7574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,461.296,462.782,"Yes, they just hung."
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,462.782,464.456,"--No, Your Honor."
2002.01-7574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.599,475.973,"And its verdict had to be unanimous in order to have any effect, did it not?"
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,475.973,499.75,"The verdict had to be unanimous for the jury verdict to be imposed, but by operation of Pennsylvania law, when... the judge is then given the opportunity to make two predicate factual determinations, and if those predicate factual determinations are found... and those are determinations relating to whether or not the State had proven its case... then the judge must impose a life sentence."
2002.01-7574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,499.75,505.323,"Well, could the judge have imposed a death sentence here in view of a 9 to 3 verdict of the jury?"
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,505.323,506.355,"No, it could not, Your Honor."
2002.01-7574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,506.355,516.756,"Well, then, it seems to me when you say Pennsylvania law says this and says that, as Justice Kennedy just... that's not what the supreme court of Pennsylvania said."
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,526.128,532.444,"The Pennsylvania supreme court... yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-7574,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,553.183,579.461,"Yes, I do think you can say that in this case, there was a judgment that could have been final had there been no appeal, and so therefore it's different from a hung jury case in some other instances where there's just no determination at all, because after the jury's failure to agree, the judge did impose a sentence that might have become final, that looked final in many instances, in... from many perspectives."
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,584.828,586.148,"Well, in fact, Your Honor--"
2002.01-7574,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,586.148,589.204,"I mean, I take it that's part of your case."
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,589.204,600.061,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, what Pennsylvania does is, Pennsylvania forecloses any appeal of the sentencing determination."
2002.01-7574,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,616.863,628.009,"Can I ask you, do you know from the record in this... does the record tell us in this case whether or not this criminal defendant was advised of the risk of taking an appeal?"
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,628.009,631.557,There is nothing in the record that indicates that he was advised of that risk.
2002.01-7574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,646.212,654.674,"Well, do Pennsylvania judges ordinarily tell potential appellants what the consequences of an appeal will be?"
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,654.674,658.761,"--Well, Pennsylvania judges tell them what rights that they are waiving, so--"
2002.01-7574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,658.761,660.868,By appealing?
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,660.868,662.187,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-7574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,666.357,669.124,What sort of a colloquy would that be?
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,669.124,674.447,--I--
2002.01-7574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,674.447,685.304,"I mean, you know, I can see where a defendant's being arraigned, or being advised whether or not he should have counsel, there's that sort of a colloquy, but--"
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,685.304,686.957,"--That's what I was thinking of, Your Honor."
2002.01-7574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,686.957,687.329,--Yes.
2002.01-7574,0,39105,robert_b_dunham,,694.675,697.481,"No, Your Honor."
2002.01-7574,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,704.335,704.973,Could you--
2002.01-7574,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,704.973,722.334,"--One of the things that we worry about in enforcing the Double Jeopardy Clause is the possibility that without its protection, the State, in effect, could fail in its attempts and try again and again and again and again."
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,1776.539,1791.65,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-7574,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1826.906,1839.205,"It does seem a little odd that... if you have case 1, where there are no errors and the defendant is not in any way prejudiced, and there is a life sentence, that's final."
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,1862.694,1880.998,"--Well, double jeopardy... the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't preclude a defendant having to make choices in making a decision, and there's nothing final about the life sentence that's imposed by a default judgment under the Pennsylvania statute."
2002.01-7574,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1887.025,1890.08,"--Well, is it final if he does not appeal?"
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,1907.626,1908.49,"No, Your Honor."
2002.01-7574,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1908.49,1908.945,Okay.
2002.01-7574,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1908.945,1914.685,"Well, this is like... it seems like Bullington in one respect, and not like it in another."
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,1954.27,1958.44,"Under double jeopardy analysis, I don't believe it has anything to do with it."
2002.01-7574,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1960.548,1965.377,"Well, if it has nothing to do with it, why did the court create the exception?"
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,1986.675,1992.87,--Because the proceeding itself requires a finding.
2002.01-7574,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2023.789,2042.077,"Well, from the dynamics of what the defendant faces when he's sitting at the table and he hears the verdict come in, he hears the verdict come in, no liability for the death penalty, the judge then sentences him to prison, and I had thought he would breathe a sigh of relief."
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,2050.583,2067.135,"--Exactly, and if he stops and is satisfied with a life sentence instead of trying to get an acquittal, which is the result of possibly seeking another trial, is that he could walk out of the courtroom an innocent man on second trial."
2002.01-7574,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2077.621,2080.138,Can you... can I interrupt with just one question?
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,2104.675,2110.315,--I believe the answer is no.
2002.01-7574,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2110.315,2110.937,I think that's--
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,2110.937,2129.512,"However, I think it's comparable to the guilty plea situation, where the Government could forego seeking death in order to... for an agreement to life, and the Commonwealth... the State would not be able to appeal that imposition of the life sentence."
2002.01-7574,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2144.949,2147.921,"--Well, but a hung jury is not quite like a plea bargain, though."
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,2160.72,2161.835,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-7574,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.15,2197.833,"Just... let me ask just one more question, then I'll be through."
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,2204.521,2206.955,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2002.01-7574,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2213.233,2216.41,So there would have been eligibility for the death penalty there.
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,2216.41,2223.635,--But the ultimate finding of the jury was that they were... that they acquitted the defendant based on their weighing situation.
2002.01-7574,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2237.298,2254.016,"Suppose we had a State with a system that said, if any... and I think some do have this system... if any one juror votes for life, then the sentence shall be life."
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,2289.41,2293.951,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't know that that would qualify as an acquittal."
2002.01-7574,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2327.759,2344.728,"So, you say it would make no difference if, instead of in this case, where the legal consequence following... follows a jury disagreement, a State that says we make, in effect, each juror the decisionmaker on the life-death question."
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,2344.728,2377.893,"I don't think that would still have the finality of an acquittal under this Court's double jeopardy jurisprudence, and of course, the hypothetical doesn't apply in this situation, because that's not what Pennsylvania said, but I don't believe that one juror holding out for life could possibly garner that finality that an acquittal has, and if... I believe there are certainly... there might be... there would be an argument in that case that if the defendant appealed, that--"
2002.01-7574,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2377.893,2378.969,Why not?
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,2391.639,2396.469,--A State could do that.
2002.01-7574,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2411.701,2424.87,"Well, do you think that that case that I gave you, where the State law says one juror for life is enough, and Pennsylvania, do you think there's any significant distinction between those two laws?"
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,2424.87,2433.211,"--I... well, I'm sorry."
2002.01-7574,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2461.9,2467.284,I take it you do believe that there is a difference between those two situations.
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,2467.284,2468.482,"--Well, there's a difference in language."
2002.01-7574,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2526.522,2529.494,May I ask... I said I wouldn't ask another question.
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,2542.125,2547.411,"Life would have been imposed, but it would have been imposed for a different reason."
2002.01-7574,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2547.411,2557.897,"Well, no, I'm asking, would the form of the judgment, the language used by the trial judge in entering judgment, would it have been any different from the language it did use in this case?"
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,2557.897,2561.424,"--Well, it would have been based on the unanimous verdict of the jury."
2002.01-7574,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2561.424,2563.076,That's not my question.
2002.01-7574,1,28518,iva_c_dougherty,,2568.444,2570.013,It would have been a life sentence in both cases.
2002.01-7574,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2570.013,2570.552,Yes.
2002.01-7574,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2947.032,2954.795,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-7574,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2997.437,3011.099,"May I ask how you would respond to my question about the State that has a system, any one juror who votes for life, if there's any one juror, it's a life sentence, and this case?"
2002.01-7574,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3015.064,3018.158,"--Justice Ginsburg, we think there is a distinction between those two."
2002.01-7574,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3074.879,3079.83,Why should that distinction be more critical than the so-called judgment distinction?
2002.01-7574,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3115.374,3137.31,"Justice Souter, it's true that the sentencing proceeding in this case culminated ultimately in the entry of a judgment, but the fact of a judgment we think is not dispositive for double jeopardy purposes, and that's because the core premise of the clean slate rule is that the entry of a sentencing judgment is not a double jeopardy disposition that bars the State from resentencing in the event of a retrial."
2002.01-7574,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3157.083,3164.209,"Well, but it does constitute an acquittal of the death penalty if there's no appeal."
2002.01-7574,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3164.209,3172.215,"I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, because the State can resentence in the event of a retrial."
2002.01-7574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3187.902,3189.676,If you win.
2002.01-7574,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3192.732,3194.029,If... I'm sorry.
2002.01-7574,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3194.029,3197.273,"I mean, you're right if you win, but you're wrong if you lose."
2002.01-7574,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3197.273,3209.533,"That's correct, but... of course that's correct, Justice Breyer, but I think the reason we should win is because the judgment that was entered in this case is not a factual acquittal of the nature that was considered--"
2002.01-7574,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3209.533,3220.307,"But, counsel, supposing the State law had a provision in it that the votes of the jurors shall remain secret, and the only thing that shall become public is the judgment, what would you do in that case?"
2002.01-7574,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3220.307,3227.2,"--Well, I think in that case... it would depend on how the jury were instructed."
2002.01-7574,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3227.2,3230.172,"Well, they're instructed just as they were in this case."
2002.01-7574,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3243.258,3254.198,"No, I think if the jury is required to make a unanimous verdict in either direction, and the judge imposes a sentence of life imprisonment because the jury has made a unanimous verdict, that would have--"
2002.01-7574,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3254.198,3260.969,"No, it doesn't... the ""because"" doesn't follow, because you don't know on the record I'm hypothesizing."
2002.01-7574,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3260.969,3270.916,"--Well, I think in that situation it would present some of the same difficulties that I was discussing in reference to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical in that it's unclear whether the defendant would have--"
2002.01-7574,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3270.916,3276.118,"Well, I take it the judge probably knows in Justice Stevens' hypothetical what the jury did."
2002.01-7574,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3276.118,3286.149,"--Right, and if the judge articulated it in his judgment in a way that distinguished between a judgment of a life sentence based on a unanimous jury verdict and judgment of a life sentence based on--"
2002.01-7574,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3286.149,3295.065,"No, in my hypothesis he enters exactly the same judgment he entered here, and he just says I'm... let's close the files on this case so the public won't know how the jury voted."
2002.01-7574,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3295.065,3313.148,"--Well, I think in that situation we'd have the same answer that we would to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, which is that because the defendant has not been afforded an opportunity to obtain finality, then the double jeopardy law would treat that judgment as final, and the State would not be permitted in that situation to revisit the sentencing judgment."
