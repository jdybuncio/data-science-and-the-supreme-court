2009.08-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.275,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1498, Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project and the cross-petition."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,8.919,23.896,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This as-applied challenge asks whether the government can make it a crime for Ralph Fertig and the Humanitarian Law Project to speak in association with the Kurdistan Workers Party."
2009.08-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,89.572,92.009,"But, Mr. Cole, don't you agree that some of the speech could be regulated?"
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,92.009,94.286,--Some of my clients' speech?
2009.08-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,94.286,94.836,Some of the speech of your client.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,94.836,107.143,"I don't think -- I don't think any of it could be prohibited, Your Honor, unless the government can satisfy the stringent scrutiny that this Court applies when Congress seeks to prohibit pure speech."
2009.08-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,109.28,111.92,You think all of the speech at issue is protected?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,111.92,117.48,"--I think that certainly all of the speech that I've just identified, which is the core--"
2009.08-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,117.48,118.155,You identified quite a bit.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,118.155,119.138,--Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,137.646,150.673,"Well, could the government, I assume -- I assume you will say NGO or other organization or person from giving tsunami aid to one of these organizations, from giving them money?"
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,150.673,152.872,"I think money is different, Your Honor."
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,152.872,154.873,Could they -- could the government prohibit that?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,154.873,158.527,"I think money is different because it's -- it's conduct, not speech."
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,158.527,158.823,Okay.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,170.803,171.053,Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.674,180.536,Brandenburg?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,180.536,183.188,"Well, I don't know whether it would necessarily be Brandenburg."
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,199.713,204.635,"But -- but if you get tsunami money, that frees up your other assets for terrorist money."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,208.787,219.863,"--Well, again, Your Honor, that -- if the government -- if the connection between the speech and the government's concern were sufficiently close, then maybe it could."
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,220.83,222.019,So why can't there be--
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,222.019,222.612,Then what's the test?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,224.391,238.928,"--I think the test is whether the -- whether the speech -- when it's speech, I think the test is whether the speech has been provided with specific intent or knowledge that it will further unlawful, terrorist ends of the group."
2009.08-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,238.928,239.696,What if it goes--
2009.08-1498,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,239.696,240.757,And that applies--
2009.08-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,240.757,244.786,--What if it goes to the mere existence of a group?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,271.009,271.602,Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,271.602,275.771,"--where they say, look, you can't travel to Cuba because we don't want to do anything that legitimizes the regime."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,275.771,276.442,Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,283.032,284.564,"No, I meant during World War II."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,284.564,284.954,Okay.
2009.08-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,284.954,288.608,I'm just trying to find an example that doesn't implicate the particulars of the issue today.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,288.608,289.279,"Right, right."
2009.08-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,296.824,299.635,"No, I didn't -- my hypothetical was confusing."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,301.554,302.163,--Okay.
2009.08-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,302.163,308.694,I meant to hypothesize a group that the government could reasonably determine should not be supported in any way--
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,308.694,309.349,Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,309.349,310.379,--because it legitimizes it.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,318.065,318.299,Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,343.536,355.094,But if you can't travel there -- suppose you want to travel there so that you can meet with and discuss lawful activities with people there.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,357.485,358.363,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,383.584,388.131,--Could the government stop you from meeting anywhere with the terrorists?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,388.131,390.642,--From meeting?
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,391.395,405.044,"Just meeting, traveling to one of these countries to actually do your teaching to a terrorist -- let's say the law said you're prohibited from traveling to meet any of these individuals."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,408.841,417.37,"--Well, then, if it's -- if it's traveling for the purpose of association, then it would be targeted at association, not at the conduct of travel."
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,417.682,419.585,But it's no different than the Cuba situation.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,419.585,426.334,"--No, but the whole point of the Cuba -- the Cuba travel cases is that -- again, as this Court said, it was an across-the-board ban."
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,434.001,439.406,"Well, suppose it's a ban just for travel to meet with terrorist organizations, Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,439.406,439.999,Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,447.884,448.995,But what about the -- what about the hypothetical?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,448.995,449.291,Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,460.519,472.217,"It's what the Chief Justice says: In any context, support ultimately will inure to the benefit of a terrorist organization, and we have a governmental interest in not allowing that."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,472.217,479.138,"There's no -- there's no dispute, Your Honor, that the government has a compelling interest in cutting off aid to terrorism."
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,482.262,483.884,"Well, it hasn't criminalized speech."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,496.086,497.24,"Right, but, Justice Scalia--"
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.24,501.892,I think that's quite different from a law that is directed explicitly at speech.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,501.892,505.425,"--Well, I don't -- I think it's not in this -- in this sense, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,526.666,528.62,That's not the right -- that's not the right number three.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,539.347,539.768,"Well, but--"
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,539.768,544.034,--not independently promoting the objectives of these terrorist organizations.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,546.704,547.5,--Well--
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,547.5,553.966,"But when they assist the organization by providing advice, that's a different matter."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,553.966,562.822,"--Well, the government says if they -- even if they speak in conjunction with the group, they -- and they're providing a benefit to the government, that's prohibited."
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.509,563.852,Okay.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,565.119,580.285,"--So, for example, under that view, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the L.A. Times, all of which published op-eds by Hamas spokespersons -- Hamas is on the list -- thereby providing a benefit to Hamas, working with the Hamas spokesperson, they're all criminals."
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.127,583.155,"Well, we -- we can cross that bridge when we come to it."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,583.155,583.518,--But--
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.518,589.968,"This is an as-applied challenge, and we are talking about the kind of advice and assistance that your clients want to give."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,589.968,591.31,"--Right, and, Your Honor, there's no--"
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,591.31,592.823,It's not a New York Times editorial.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,592.823,593.763,"--Well, it is, though."
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,600.447,600.868,"No, no."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,610.005,611.676,"--No, but it's not about -- it's not about whether you meet with them."
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.937,623.889,"It depends on what ""coordinating"" means, doesn't it?"
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,626.14,642.476,"--Well, let me -- let me also answer it this way, Justice Scalia: If you look at the specific speech which our clients seek to engage in, it includes writing and distributing literature in conjunction with the Kurdistan Workers Party in the United States advocating their support."
2009.08-1498,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,644.242,650.536,Supposing that -- what you say is you want to engage in political advocacy on behalf of the Kurds.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,680.269,691.531,"Well, I think -- I think if you -- if you specifically intend and know that your aid will further the group in its terrorist activities, then it's not protected speech."
2009.08-1498,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,696.154,698.198,--And that goes for all forms of training?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,711.258,713.427,"--Well, Justice Alito, this is an as-applied challenge."
2009.08-1498,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,726.158,732.25,"Well, just out of curiosity, I thought your position was that no form of training or assistance could be prohibited--"
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,732.25,732.905,"No, I was just--"
2009.08-1498,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,732.905,734.044,--consistent with the First Amendment.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,735.294,735.793,--No.
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,751.006,758.224,The end that Congress seeks to proscribe is the existence of these terrorist organizations.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,776.918,777.635,Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,777.635,784.728,But that is what fosters the terrorist organization and enables the terrorist activities.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,793.49,793.724,Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,847.964,850.838,"Mr. Cole, as I remember, Scales upheld a conviction, wasn't--"
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,850.838,864.661,"It did, Justice Ginsburg, but only because it interpreted the statute to be -- to be limited to specific -- to members -- active membership that is specifically intended to further the illegal ends of the group, precisely--"
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,864.661,876.703,"But it didn't -- it was not a statute which involves banning financial or other tangible support, and page 17 of your brief made -- this is a difficult case for me."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,887.387,888.245,--Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,888.245,888.682,Then you say:
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,899.16,901.691,"Well, I -- right, but--"
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,901.691,908.174,"Suppose the speech is tantamount to material support in that it legitimizes, encourages, or strengthens the organization."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,908.174,911.767,"--Well, two things in response to that, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,933.351,936.615,"In those cases, the real question was whether membership was enough, wasn't it?"
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,936.615,937.726,--Active membership--
2009.08-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,937.726,937.991,Yes.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,937.991,941.848,--which the government says constitutes more than mere nominal membership.
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,941.848,942.519,And this is support.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,943.377,961.481,"Well, Your Honor, in De Jonge, one of these cases, one of this Court's first First Amendment cases, the government argued that Mr. De Jonge aided the Communist Party in its illegal ends by conducting a meeting for them and being their lead speaker at the meeting."
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,976.148,979.973,But there wasn't a statute on the books that prohibited material support--
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,979.973,982.129,"--Well, I don't think it would--"
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,982.129,985.799,"--And here there is, and this is in aid of that prohibition."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,985.799,1007.273,"--Right, but Your Honor, what would -- if Congress came along after the Communist Party cases and said, okay, you've said we can't make it a crime to criminalize membership in the Communist Party; we are now going to make it a crime to speak in conjunction with the Communist Party -- do you think the decisions would have come out any differently?"
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1011.617,1016.192,I think it's very unrealistic to compare these terrorist organizations with the Communist Party.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1044.354,1048.211,"--Your Honor, this -- this Court accepted Congress's findings."
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1059.707,1062.924,"That may be, but people joined it for philosophical reasons."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1062.924,1064.125,"Oh, sure--"
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.125,1065.779,They joined it for philosophical reasons.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1073.399,1076.367,"--Well, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's fair, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1096.5,1097.046,Mr. Cole--
2009.08-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1097.046,1102.512,"--Mr. Cole, would you distinguish -- I think this came up in the court of appeals."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1138.263,1138.793,--Yes.
2009.08-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1143.185,1147.618,"Well, then -- then as -- suppose the group is not the two that we have here--"
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1147.618,1148.636,--Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1148.636,1150.633,--but Al-Qaeda and the Taliban?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1150.633,1150.96,Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1170.157,1172.672,But I want to be sure I understand that point.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1175.546,1178.53,--I think it might be different if we were at war with these groups.
2009.08-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.53,1182.417,"And if that's true, why aren't we now at war, with regard to our opposition to these organizations?"
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1182.417,1182.947,Well--
2009.08-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1182.947,1184.807,"What is the difference, as a practical matter?"
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1184.807,1185.634,"--Well -- well, two things, Your Honor."
2009.08-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1205.69,1207.737,But my question that I want to be sure you are focusing on--
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1207.737,1208.064,--Yes.
2009.08-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1208.064,1210.517,--but in the issues in this very case--
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1210.517,1211.188,Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1211.188,1213.325,--would they be different if we were now at war?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1213.325,1222.808,"I think it would depend, Your Honor, because the -- what -- what treason requires is aid to the enemy, and aid might be in the form of speech."
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.147,1236.005,"Well, in a way there is."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1254.356,1254.777,--Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1254.777,1261.324,--we -- we are supposed to allow our citizens to assist the terrorist organizations that are directing their violence against them?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1261.324,1262.088,Well--
2009.08-1498,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.088,1268.304,Why isn't that a sufficiently serious reason for the government to do what it's done here?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1268.304,1284.565,"--I think the question, Your Honor, is there -- is there any realistic nexus between writing an op-ed, advocating before Congress, urging a group to use lawful nonviolent means to resolve its disputes, and killing Americans?"
2009.08-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1285.439,1288.78,"Well, you've picked -- you've picked hypotheticals that are very easy for you."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1307.334,1308.446,Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1323.798,1327.623,"Well, one of the things that's being prohibited here that you challenge is providing personnel."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1327.623,1328.528,--That's right.
2009.08-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1358.363,1369.31,"Well, is your argument limited to personnel that engages in speech, or does it cover personnel that -- a nurse at one of the -- if there are any, Hamas hospitals?"
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1369.31,1369.653,--Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1382.789,1390.741,--When -- but the way you define the speech that you want protected is speech that is advocating some lawful activity.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1390.741,1391.224,--Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1391.224,1404.281,So what's unlawful about teaching people medicine and how to cure people from infection?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1404.281,1409.279,"If -- if that were what they were doing, Your Honor, if it was teaching, then it would be protected by the First Amendment."
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1411.198,1428.8,"So you see no difference -- you're not advocating a difference in this case between training that could reasonably be used in terrorist activities, because teaching people how to care for the ill could be used to teach people how to care for the wounded."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1428.8,1429.065,--Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1429.584,1430.161,All right?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1438.112,1438.393,"No, no."
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1438.861,1449.418,You are saying to us the case stands and falls on whether or not we accept that this statute regulates conduct as opposed to speech?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1449.418,1449.777,--No.
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1458.569,1459.849,"No, it regulates training."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1461.99,1462.723,--Yes.
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1462.723,1474.328,"--was whether there was a way in your challenge, or whether you are advocating any difference in the nature of the speech, that it's -- this is an as-applied challenge."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1474.328,1474.499,Yes.
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1475.389,1482.323,"And so the question -- because the only answer you have given us is if it's lawful speech, it's protected."
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1482.323,1487.806,"--No, I -- I think -- I think, Your Honor, that the answer -- maybe I wasn't clear in responding to Justice Alito."
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1498.599,1502.752,So give me an analytical framework to address that question.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1502.752,1503.314,--All right.
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1503.672,1510.281,The government says under O'Brien even the speech that you want -- forget about the tsunami aid speech.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1515.153,1515.402,--Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1515.402,1520.059,--Is there a difference and under what analytical framework would we reach it?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1520.059,1533.083,"Well, I think the question -- the question at the -- at the -- at the bottom would be whether there is a sufficient connection between the speech which is being expressed and the government's compelling interest."
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1551.64,1553.372,We have to be conscious of the white light.
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1581.284,1581.892,--Right.
2009.08-1498,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1583.187,1584.064,What's your -- what's your best case?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1584.064,1591.575,"--Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life was a pre-enforcement, as-applied challenge to the provisions of the BCRA."
2009.08-1498,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1593.232,1596.387,Do you want to give an answer to the Taliban and the Al-Qaeda?
2009.08-1498,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1596.387,1597.807,"Oh, I'm sorry -- I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1498,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1640.179,1641.477,"Thank you, Mr. Cole."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1643.197,1650.52,"With your permission, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1701.729,1711.743,"If a terrorist was arrested in the United States from one of these groups, would they be barred under the statute from serving as their attorney in a U.S. court?"
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1711.743,1717.194,"--Justice Sotomayor, if -- if there are--"
2009.08-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1717.194,1722.505,Isn't that material support under the definition that you have been advocating?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1722.505,1730.078,"--Justice Sotomayor, I believe that that would be excluded from the statute -- should be excluded from the statute, and indeed even Petitioners have never suggested--"
2009.08-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1730.078,1731.782,"No, but I'm asking you why."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1731.782,1738.513,--Because I think that there the canon of constitutional avoidance would clearly come into play.
2009.08-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1748.087,1749.292,And so can I -- can I ask you something?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1783.01,1785.105,--It can--
2009.08-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1785.105,1787.62,And that -- that's part of what they're claiming their speech involves--
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1787.62,1788.228,--The statute--
2009.08-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1788.228,1789.133,--training and doing that.
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1789.133,1794.335,--The statute cannot legitimately be read to -- to include their independent advocacy.
2009.08-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1802.906,1804.251,But that doesn't--
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1804.251,1804.781,--as they see fit.
2009.08-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1804.781,1807.765,--answer -- what is the right of the people peaceably to assemble?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1835.174,1836.581,"Again, the statute--"
2009.08-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1836.581,1839.596,--for the recognition of a -- of a legitimate goal?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1839.596,1843.422,"--Again, the statute does not prohibit the Petitioners from petitioning peacefully."
2009.08-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1922.812,1923.171,But it isn't--
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1923.171,1924.437,--or foreign organizations.
2009.08-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1924.437,1925.061,--whatever way they wish.
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1963.796,1978.572,"Justice Ginsburg, you're exactly right that, in addition to engaging in independent advocacy, Petitioners can meet with members of the foreign terrorist organizations, can join the foreign terrorist organizations, that membership is not prohibited by the statute."
2009.08-1498,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1983.741,1987.395,Can they -- can they advocate to the association?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2001.204,2003.091,"--Absolutely, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-1498,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2010.091,2020.132,"And suppose the organization's board of directors agrees with that and wants them to address the general membership on that point, and they are doing it with the blessing of the organization."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2020.132,2040.655,"--Justice Kennedy, I want first -- I'm going to answer your question, and I'm going to say that that's still not covered, but I want also to make a general point, which is that this Court can exhaust all the hypotheticals that it has in this case, and it will be irrelevant to the case at hand, and that would be so for two reasons."
2009.08-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2087.012,2087.168,"Well, wait."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2089.102,2089.305,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2089.305,2102.63,"--They say in this case that they want to provide training in the issue of humanitarian international law, and they want to provide training and expert advice and assistance in respect to how you petition the UN."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2189.608,2198.23,"Justice Breyer, I think the objection is exactly what Justice Kennedy suggested with his hypothetical, because his hypothetical is actually perfectly aligned with this case."
2009.08-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2214.008,2214.335,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2228.093,2242.758,"--Well, that something, which is the teaching the foreign terrorist organization how to petition international bodies in order to get various kinds of support, financial or otherwise, that will strengthen those organizations in everything that they do."
2009.08-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2243.932,2258.536,"Fine, and if a reasonable person would know that, that it's going to help them, then it is unlawful, if it's going to help them and a reasonable person would think it was going to help them in their unlawful activities."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2259.628,2260.704,--Congress was the reasonable person here.
2009.08-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2290.96,2294.911,And doesn't that lead to -- kind of logically lead to the conclusion that mere membership could be prohibited?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2316.525,2324.181,"I -- I actually don't think -- I mean, Congress clearly did not mean to include that."
2009.08-1498,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.686,2348.935,Why do you say Congress clearly did not intend that?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2361.21,2366.474,"--That is certainly not the way the government reads the statute, and that's not the way the government has ever read the statute."
2009.08-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2405.021,2421.813,"--Well, but petitioning the United Nations -- and that's what you are teaching them -- does not, on its face, seem to me to be something that reasonably you would think was going to aid them in their unlawful objectives, but for the realm of ideas."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2422.998,2423.876,This would be--
2009.08-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2423.876,2431.823,--and then Congress put a thing in here which says: Don't construe this statute in a way that will abridge First Amendment rights.
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2433.993,2436.306,--And I think you are exactly right about that.
2009.08-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2436.306,2445.412,"And is there any evidence that something like that would, in fact, but for the realm of ideas, help this organization commit its terrorist acts?"
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2445.412,2463.483,"Justice Breyer, I believe that the legislative record is quite clear that Congress thought that various kinds of aid given to the legal and legitimate activities of the terrorist organization, in fact, further the aims of the -- in fact, further the illegal and illegitimate goals."
2009.08-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2473.886,2474.666,But you -- but you--
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2474.666,2475.352,--no financial firewalls.
2009.08-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2475.352,2482.036,"--You say that the -- not only the membership, but they can meet and they can discuss."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2498.438,2509.434,"Justice Ginsburg, I agree with you that there may be some hard cases that are at the borderline between the two, as there are in most statutes; that there may be hard cases."
2009.08-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2539.11,2553.258,"General, you've talked about -- there has been a lot of discussion about the legitimate activities allowing -- facilitating illegitimate activities by freeing up personnel and all that, and legitimizing the group."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2571.424,2581.279,"No, I believe we -- we have, Mr. Chief Justice, although if we didn't emphasize it enough, I -- I will plead error, because I think that it is an -- a crucial point to this case."
2009.08-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2582.982,2588.618,Do you have -- I don't mean to -- do you have particular references to where in your brief you made the argument?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2588.618,2588.965,--Yes.
2009.08-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2595.445,2595.897,"Yes, I know."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2610.673,2616.546,"I think that that's right, Mr. Chief Justice, that we have not specifically addressed the strict scrutiny argument."
2009.08-1498,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2630.931,2632.398,Why is O'Brien the correct standard?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2639.1,2661.199,"--Justice Alito, I think that the -- the training and advice clauses are, of course, part of a statute which regulates material support and resources of all kinds, and to the extent that what you're saying is, you know, training and advice, those are always speech restrictions if you find them in a statute, I think that that's not right."
2009.08-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2675.132,2676.068,How about training to--
2009.08-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2676.068,2688.749,"What's involved here -- I think they said that they want to train them how to do lawful things, how to pursue their goals in a lawful, rather than a terrorist, way."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2702.838,2710.009,"--Congress, of course, allowed them to engage in all the advocacy that they wish on behalf of these groups."
2009.08-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2712.458,2716.521,"But they want to communicate, and you say they can communicate."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2722.051,2728.719,"--Well, I think if they are engaged in just discussion of ideas, this statute does not prohibit that."
2009.08-1498,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2740.371,2745.37,Do you stick with the argument made below that it's unlawful to file an amicus brief?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2745.37,2747.336,Justice Kennedy--
2009.08-1498,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2747.336,2750.474,I think I'm right in saying it that that was the argument below.
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2750.474,2752.101,"--Yes, I think that would be a service."
2009.08-1498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2781.211,2784.584,Then it seems to me that your opponent's argument here today is prohibited.

2009.08-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2808.76,2823.477,"--General, I understand, I could be wrong, that many petitioners or respondents go out to the industry and say we need some amicus briefs, and they flood in from all sides."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2828.536,2828.832,"--Well, if the PKK--"
2009.08-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2828.832,2832.564,--came out and said we need a brief -- amicus briefs from law professors?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2832.954,2846.371,"--If -- if the PKK or the LTTE or Al-Qaeda or any of the other organizations on this list said we want amicus briefs, and somebody provided an amicus brief--"
2009.08-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2846.371,2847.588,--Without pay.
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2847.588,2850.634,"--for themselves -- for themselves, there would be no problem."
2009.08-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2854.318,2857.255,How can we can ever separate--
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2857.255,2857.633,--for the PKK itself.
2009.08-1498,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2857.633,2866.645,"--Under the definition of this statute, teaching these members to play the harmonica would be unlawful."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2884.84,2895.396,"Well, I think here we have the congressional definition of what kind of training is bad, and that definition focuses on training in specialized activities."
2009.08-1498,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2906.268,2911.829,"Well, Mohammed Atta and his harmonica quartet might tour the country and make a lot of money."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2911.922,2912.297,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2948.718,2952.825,"Well, in that -- on the -- just forget the harmonica for a second; I'm more worried about the lawyer."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2970.506,2985.876,"--Well, first of all, Justice Breyer, I want to sort of repeat the -- what I -- what I said about the need to find a substantial amount of uncertain or unconstitutional applications, or with respect to any kind of facial challenge or with respect to this challenge--"
2009.08-1498,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2985.876,3000.606,"But I want to know if that's what you're saying, what I just said: that an organization has American citizens, engages in terrible stuff, but they are not entitled under the Constitution to have a lawyer in the United States who does legal work like filing amicus briefs."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3000.606,3017.58,"--To the extent that there is any constitutional claim that they would be entitled to representation, whether it's a Sixth Amendment claim or a due process claim that might exist in criminal cases, that might exist in habeas cases, that might exist in civil cases, then the government believes that the statute should be read so as not to include that."
2009.08-1498,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3017.58,3020.454,Why do these hypotheticals make any difference?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3059.282,3062.203,"Well, I -- I do think that the answer to that is yes, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3062.203,3069.124,The answer on the other side is: All we want to do is speak about lawful activities.
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3090.677,3096.066,"No, I think my line is you can communicate, but you can't provide material support."
2009.08-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3100.998,3101.501,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3106.17,3107.515,No--
2009.08-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3107.515,3107.733,"Oh, okay."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3107.733,3110.764,"--you can communicate with -- on your own, for sure."
2009.08-1498,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3115.852,3119.507,But Justice Ginsburg's question is: Can you advocate peaceful means?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3130.253,3135.705,"--Can you say to an organization: Look, you guys really should lay down your arms."
2009.08-1498,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3136.017,3137.078,And here's how to do it.
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3141.905,3160.505,"--Well, now you can't, because when you tell people here's how to apply for aid and here's how to represent yourself within international organizations or within the U.S. Congress, you've given them an extremely valuable skill that they can use for all kinds of purposes, legal or illegal."
2009.08-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3162.396,3168.738,"So you can -- you can communicate, but the communications are censored."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3181.466,3191.367,"--The discussion must stop when you -- when you go over the line into giving valuable advice, training, support to these organizations."
2009.08-1498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3192.416,3195.961,May I ask a sort of basic question that I've had trouble with throughout the whole argument?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3211.078,3223.058,"--Well, the -- both the lower courts -- I think the district court and the court of appeals, I think, had a kind of confused analysis here, which is that they said, well, it's vague as applied."
2009.08-1498,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3237.912,3244.173,"Unless you're in an overbreadth situation, a vagueness challenge can be an as-applied challenge."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3251.329,3251.891,"--No, that's--"
2009.08-1498,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3251.891,3252.952,We have cases like that.
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3252.952,3270.913,"--That's exactly right, Justice Scalia, and -- and -- and with respect to the as-applied vagueness claim, the government's position is there's -- there's -- there -- it's not vague, because you can go through these declarations, you can go through these complaints, and you can know exactly what's included within--"
2009.08-1498,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3270.913,3271.569,But -- but I have the same--
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3271.569,3271.756,--the statute and what's not.
2009.08-1498,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3271.756,3273.597,--I had the same question as Justice Stevens.
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3286.324,3287.903,"Well, it--"
2009.08-1498,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3287.903,3302.195,"--I -- I can't -- I can't think of a case in which the Court, pre-prosecution in a declaratory judgment, has said that it's improper as applied to certain things."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3304.082,3312.86,"--No, I -- I -- I don't think you are wrong, Justice Kennedy, and especially with respect to a case where all the activity is -- clearly fits in one box or the other."
2009.08-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3319.903,3321.26,"Well, but that's -- I'm not -- I'm not sure that's right."
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3337.147,3346.517,"--Well, as I said, Mr. Chief Justice, there will be some hard cases, there always are when it comes to applying statutes."
2009.08-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3349.297,3349.531,"--No, my -- my point is that this--"
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3349.531,3350.904,The question is the indeterminacy.
2009.08-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3350.904,3351.169,--Yes.
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3359.542,3362.026,I think it -- it actually is pretty clear in this case.
2009.08-1498,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3372.128,3385.921,Does this -- what -- what these plaintiffs are seeking to do -- does it have any resemblance to the 150 prosecutions that you have brought under this Act?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3411.097,3417.281,"--Justice Ginsburg, I think that this is not the typical case."
2009.08-1498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3432.2,3434.135,"Specifically, does this particular man have to be prosecuted?"
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3434.135,3435.044,I'm sorry?
2009.08-1498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3435.044,3441.119,Is this particular individual in risk of being prosecuted if he makes the speech to the United Nations?
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3441.119,3447.647,"Justice Stevens, I do believe that this individual can make whatever speeches he wants at the United Nations."
2009.08-1498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3456.112,3458.249,And is there evidence that he would be prosecuted if he--
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3458.249,3467.499,"Of course, that's a different thing as to how prosecutorial judgment is used to decide which are the high-priority cases and which are the low-priority cases."
2009.08-1498,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3467.499,3474.62,"--But in essence, this is an action to enjoin a potential prosecution against somebody for making a potential speech?"
2009.08-1498,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3478.024,3479.775,"Again, the government did not bring this action."
2009.08-1498,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3504.576,3505.78,"Thank you, General."
2009.08-1498,2,20648,david_d_cole,,3510.386,3511.809,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1498,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3568.816,3569.69,I -- I agree.
2009.08-1498,2,20648,david_d_cole,,3572.127,3572.814,That's right.
2009.08-1498,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3572.814,3576.233,I just haven't seen an as-applied challenge on declaratory relief.
2009.08-1498,2,20648,david_d_cole,,3578.748,3579.356,No.
2009.08-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3632.054,3635.334,"If O'Brien applies, what remains of your case?"
2009.08-1498,2,20648,david_d_cole,,3635.334,3662.779,"If O'Brien applies, then I think the Court would still be applying the scrutiny that asks, is there a reasonable fit -- is there a reasonable fit between the specific speech that's at issue here, speech on issues of public concern, advocating only lawful activity, and the -- and that the government legitimately seeks to further, which is stopping support for terrorism?"
2009.08-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3663.231,3669.287,"That analysis of the activities that you are proposing has not been done by the lower courts, correct?"
2009.08-1498,2,20648,david_d_cole,,3669.287,3671.381,"--Well, the lower courts struck--"
2009.08-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3671.381,3675.16,"They -- they haven't -- they struck it on vagueness grounds, but none--"
2009.08-1498,2,20648,david_d_cole,,3675.16,3675.413,--Right.
2009.08-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3675.819,3682.004,--none of the courts either subjected this to strict scrutiny or the reasonable fit--
2009.08-1498,2,20648,david_d_cole,,3682.004,3688.702,"--No, and, in fact, the government has never even attempted to defend the statute under strict scrutiny, because I think it clearly could not satisfy strict scrutiny."
2009.08-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3693.359,3699.294,"Well, why don't -- why don't we remand it to the lower courts to apply strict scrutiny if we agree with you that O'Brien doesn't apply here?"
2009.08-1498,2,20648,david_d_cole,,3699.294,3704.055,--I think it would be appropriate to remand for -- for application of strict scrutiny if you read it that O'Brien doesn't apply.
2009.08-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3754.161,3767.905,"--Mr. Cole, there were congressional findings that money is fungible first for terrorist groups, like -- that if you give them money for legitimate means, that it's going to be siphoned off and used for illegitimate means."
2009.08-1498,2,20648,david_d_cole,,3767.905,3768.357,--Right.
2009.08-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3768.357,3778.384,"So, why isn't that enough, either under strict scrutiny or a lesser standard, reasonable fit standard, to say that you can't teach these groups how to get money?"
2009.08-1498,2,20648,david_d_cole,,3778.384,3778.668,Right.
2009.08-1498,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3785.555,3792.317,"No, one of your -- one of your stated aims, at least of one of the groups is to teach them how to get aid for tsunami relief."
2009.08-1498,2,20648,david_d_cole,,3792.317,3792.457,--Right.
2009.08-1498,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3825.79,3827.319,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1498,2,20648,david_d_cole,,3827.319,3830.723,"And we have suggested that you should, therefore, interpret the statute in -- consistent with that."
