1994.93-6892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.938,"We'll hear argument next in Number 63-6892, Matthew Wayne Tome v. The United States."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,49.133,53.536,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-6892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,198.4,202.714,You say it's inconsistent with the plain language of the rule.
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,207.015,217.814,"We're indicating that the statement was offered, but whether it was offered for rebuttal, we have some question in regard to that."
1994.93-6892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.814,219.825,What is that question?
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,219.825,234.895,"The question is that in terms of rebuttal it did not meet the premotive standard, and it's implicit and inherent in the rule that any statement which is made to rebut occurs prior to the motive to fabricate."
1994.93-6892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,234.895,238.678,"Well, let's go through the language phrase by phrase."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,252.656,269.616,"Our contention, Your Honor, is that by offered, that means that the court has to make a decision that if the statement, if it is allowed in and accepted, that a jury would find that a statement actually rebuts."
1994.93-6892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,269.616,276.322,So you say the court has to make a decision and then the jury has to make the same decision?
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,276.322,300.539,"The court has to make an initial determination similar to the determinations made in other evidentiary questions as to preliminarily whether the statement does in fact rebut, because if the court... if a party is allowed to present a statement which does not in fact rebut, even though they're offering it, it's a misrepresentation upon the court."
1994.93-6892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,301.257,307.0,But in all sorts of evidentiary rulings it's a question of relevancy.
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,321.081,325.843,--Because this is a rule with a particularly narrow purpose.
1994.93-6892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,347.86,352.23,"Well, do you think the Federal Rules of Evidence simply froze the common law in place?"
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,352.23,355.082,That's not our contention.
1994.93-6892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,367.571,375.656,"But the rules have also been interpreted to mean that they have liberalized admissibility of evidence, that that was one of their purposes."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,375.656,391.717,"That's correct, Your Honor, but the hearsay rules in particular are rules of exclusion, and most of them are derived from the common law, and this rule must be read in the context of the common law."
1994.93-6892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,441.64,447.944,"Well, that's the only change that the advisory committee's notes mention."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,447.944,448.983,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-6892,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,448.983,451.437,"The grammar's against you, isn't it?"
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,466.697,467.987,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-6892,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,467.987,481.707,"Wouldn't the natural way, if that were the intent, to... the modifier recent apply to all three, wouldn't the natural way to write it have been recent fabrication, comma, improper influence or motive?"
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,491.802,494.754,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-6892,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,505.914,512.025,"Well, the reason it was put into the rule may be that it was intended simply to modify fabrication."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,537.102,568.142,"We would also agree with what His Honor has indicated regarding, there was a rejection of the Weinstein view by the committee which adopted the Federal rules, and they did indicate that they did not want there to be widespread use of hearsay only upon the declarant being available for cross-examination, and there was a rejection of the Weinstein view, there was a rejection of the Model Codes of Evidence which were adopted in adopting this rule."
1994.93-6892,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,574.877,581.191,"If we find that recent modified simply fabrication, do you lose the case?"
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,581.191,581.712,No.
1994.93-6892,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,589.777,592.078,"Well, can you walk me through the rule?"
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,601.464,606.319,--It's improper motive or influence.
1994.93-6892,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,606.319,610.65,"Well, improper in your view, then, does modify motive?"
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,610.65,619.626,"Yes, as well, Your Honor, and I think that's the way most commentators in most cases have read it, that it's improper motive or improper influence."
1994.93-6892,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,619.626,626.97,"Well, is it an improper motive to want to be with your maternal parent?"
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,626.97,633.896,The charged improper motive was actually that she wanted to be with her mother rather than her father.
1994.93-6892,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,633.896,634.797,Is that improper?
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,634.797,650.127,"That's the charge that the Government made that the defense counsel was asserting, and they... it's only upon a charge of an improper motive that all these statements were allowed in."
1994.93-6892,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,656.689,664.697,"I suppose it would be improper in the context that it's improper to allow you, to allow the witness to change their testimony."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,666.196,699.93,"It's improper in the sense that that's the way the rule makes out the motive, and the Government claimed that defense counsel had charged that the improper motive was that the child wanted to live with her mother rather than her father, and that that child had the same identical motive at the time she first made her first accusation as of the time of trial, therefore the statements did not rebut."
1994.93-6892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,735.322,746.92,"Mr. Gandert, here's the problem that you confront if you sever the recent, the word recent from the latter part, namely from improper influence or motive."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,804.327,816.314,"--Your Honor, we would contend that this case concerns a recent fabrication, and what happened here is there was a 14-month delay before the child made her first accusation."
1994.93-6892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,816.314,819.546,"I'm not talking about what it concerns, I'm talking about your reading of the text."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,849.667,852.188,"It doesn't tend to disprove it, because--"
1994.93-6892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,852.188,870.23,"Now, it may not tend to disprove a recent improper motive if you can show that, well, that statement was not before the motive arose anyway, but it would tend to disprove the existence of any improper motive whether recent or not."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,870.23,881.187,"--That... in this case, the problem is that the child had the same motive, so no motive was disproved."
1994.93-6892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,896.526,908.395,"Well, you don't disprove the motive to rebut a charge of recent or improper... oh, I see, you think you must have to eliminate the existence of the motive."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,915.281,920.022,That's exactly what you have... what His Honor indicated that you have to do.
1994.93-6892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.022,945.189,"Oh, I stand by my view that it certainly tends to disprove that in this case, if you can show, this is not something that I've been pumped up for at trial, that my mother put in my ear in order to get me to go back to live with her, as I want to do, but rather, I said this way back, long before it's at all likely that anybody put the notion in my head."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,946.079,950.703,It's not probative because it doesn't meet the strict requirements of the rule.
1994.93-6892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,969.865,972.305,What you've just said indicates that you're modifying what you said earlier.
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,981.202,983.635,--It possibly--
1994.93-6892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,983.635,989.138,"Which would make this whole thing academic, right, if it could, at least the three pediatricians... were they pediatricians +/?"
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,993.032,993.831,--It's 80--
1994.93-6892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,993.831,996.181,All of it might come in under the catch-all.
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,996.181,1006.079,"--We contend that it would not, but the Tenth Circuit failed to go into that thorny issue and decide whether or not the statements were admissible under other rules."
1994.93-6892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1043.723,1066.677,"Well, the trial judge seemed to have some confusion about whether it would come in, would have to have a limiting instruction that it would be hearsay, that hearsay somehow, even if it fell under an exception, wasn't admissible for all purposes, it would have to be admitted... it was very confusing, I thought."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1077.677,1080.167,I believe what Your Honor said is correct.
1994.93-6892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1184.897,1213.445,"If the rule speaks in terms of, in such a way that grammatically it seems that the word recent modifies only the word fabrication and not the word improper influence or motive, doesn't... and if you're correct about the common law, doesn't that suggest that this rule differs from the common law?"
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1213.445,1218.648,I think that what occurred when this rule was written is that the drafters were not being precise.
1994.93-6892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1225.513,1228.305,"Well, it--"
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1228.305,1232.259,--They did not see the problems involved with not defining the terms exactly.
1994.93-6892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1232.259,1237.494,"--Well, I don't think the committee operated like it was said Congress did in the last case."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1266.825,1284.076,"That... it's not necessary to reach... to find that to rule in our favor, and what we indicate is that this common law rule is a bright line rule which is easy to apply."
1994.93-6892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1301.297,1307.901,Are you saying that we should simply ignore the language of the rule and revert to the common law?
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1307.901,1310.343,--I think that the language--
1994.93-6892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1310.343,1312.744,Could you answer that yes or no?
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1312.744,1324.593,"--No, we don't ignore the language of the rule, but we have to read it in context, most in accord with the context and ordinary usage."
1994.93-6892,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.475,1345.235,"Mr. Gandert, why don't you go back to your first point and emphasize the word rebut, and would your argument not be that a prior consistent statement does not rebut an improper motive or influence unless it occurred before that arose?"
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1345.235,1346.097,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-6892,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.097,1349.939,"So the word rebut is the key to your case, is it not?"
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1349.939,1356.823,"That's correct, and our contention is that rebut means disprove by means of a premotive consistent statement, and that--"
1994.93-6892,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1356.823,1363.138,"And if it's made after the motive or the improper influence occurred, it doesn't have any probative force as rebuttal."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1363.138,1364.159,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-6892,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1364.159,1364.817,That's your point.
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1371.105,1381.651,"Some commentators have indicated that recent is superfluous, but recent is a temporal term which means something."
1994.93-6892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1389.234,1393.108,"Well, then, why does rebut have to mean totally demolished?"
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1410.489,1434.795,"--Because rebut has to be read in the common law way, with the common law history in mind, and with the pre-1975 cases in mind, and rebut, when the Federal rules adopted that rule, adopted the traditional way of looking at that rule."
1994.93-6892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1434.795,1449.074,"I never knew it was traditional to say to rebut means you have to totally demolish, bowl over, that it would be enough to weaken the force of opposing evidence."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1449.074,1460.532,"It doesn't... it doesn't in that context, but in the context of the common law, it has to be a premotive statement, a statement which occurs prior to the motive to fabricate."
1994.93-6892,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1460.532,1467.838,Now you're backing off the stress on the word rebut and going back to the terms of the exceptions.
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1467.838,1484.347,"Oh, I think rebut has to be read in terms of its common law history and the way it was considered at common law, and at common law, as Justice Stevens indicated, only statements made prior to motive to fabricate actually had rebuttal value, and actually did, in fact, rebut."
1994.93-6892,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1526.295,1529.056,"Excuse me, may I say, why isn't that right?"
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1568.142,1572.444,"--Because this rule was adopted under Article VIII, and--"
1994.93-6892,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1572.444,1575.366,"It just happens to be, but I mean, they recodified the thing."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1592.199,1603.766,"--The problem with looking at it from the Government's position is that it makes meaningless the rebuttal requirement, and what happens then, it opens the floodgates toward manufactured evidence."
1994.93-6892,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.883,1635.5,"The rule would presumably have read that prior consistent statements by witnesses may be admitted if relevant, period."
1994.93-6892,0,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,1635.5,1637.4,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-6892,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1646.046,1647.448,"Very well, Mr. Gandert."
1994.93-6892,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1649.448,1657.662,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-6892,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.007,1734.453,"Would you agree on that basis, Mr. Wallace, that even if it were not admissible under 801(d)(1)(B)(3), it might nevertheless be admissible on the ground the district court relied on?"
1994.93-6892,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1734.453,1739.378,"Well, the district court relied on this ground as well."
1994.93-6892,2,30517,joseph_w_gandert,,3424.609,3428.81,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.93-6892,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3479.555,3480.746,"Thank you, Mr. Gandert."
