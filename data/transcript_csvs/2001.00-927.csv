2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,51.805,62.652,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case arises out of an explosion that killed four employees on a drilling barge on the inland waters of Louisiana."
2001.00-927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,82.595,94.519,"Well, Mr. Roberts, the Coast Guard does have regulations, though, that require an emergency plan and fire control devices."
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,94.519,97.974,"Not... not that apply to this vessel, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,140.851,145.355,Fire safety regulations are... are different from... from--
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,145.355,146.841,"No, no."
2001.00-927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,164.668,188.021,"--Well, if... if the Coast Guard has regulations that try to contain a hazardous event, after it occurs, as opposed to regulations trying to prevent it in the first place, do you say that the containment approach just doesn't qualify under this statute as a Coast Guard regulation?"
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,188.021,197.367,"No, Your Honor, but... but with respect to... to this vessel, as I... as I was saying, they don't have such regulations."
2001.00-927,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,231.257,236.025,"Mr. Roberts, do you think you could explain to us... just go back to the basics."
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,256.017,256.897,--Yes.
2001.00-927,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,307.924,310.884,--May I... may I interrupt you right there?
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,342.556,367.63,"--It's completely displaced on the inspected vessels because the Coast Guard has comprehensive authority over those and has exercised its comprehensive authority on the inspected vessels by promulgating comprehensive regulations, and those regulations include specific ones addressing specific hazards, as well as general provisions such as the one that I was referring to that requires that the vessels be fit for the service that they're intended and safe and seaworthy."
2001.00-927,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,391.581,399.526,"--Getting back to the inspected vessels, because this might have a bearing on... on how we write the opinion in this case, even though it's uninspected."
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,409.161,419.379,Not with respect to regulation in terms of setting occupational safety and health standards and enforcing occupational safety and health standards.
2001.00-927,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,431.18,435.076,I hope I didn't take you too far off the track.
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,437.147,448.558,"To get back to the uninspected vessels that... that Justice Ginsburg had asked about and which is what we... we have in this case, on those vessels, there's very limited authority."
2001.00-927,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,494.781,499.573,But some... some uninspected are more closely watched?
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,499.573,511.225,"Some uninspected are more closely watched, and we... we would submit that no uninspected vessel is comprehensively watched as to occupational safety and health."
2001.00-927,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,551.783,560.393,"How could one know that this is a little-inspected vessel, as... as distinguished from uninspected but more inspected?"
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,560.393,571.836,"Well, there are different types of... of uninspected vessels, and the... depending on the type, different sets of regulations apply to them."
2001.00-927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,621.032,640.79,"Now, Mr. Roberts, it seemed to me here the administrative law judge seemed to say that the OSHA regulations were not preempted because the Coast Guard didn't require precisely the same thing that OSHA did."
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,663.404,675.479,--The Government's view is that you don't look to see if there's precisely the same regulation in precisely the same manner of the same... the same degree of stringency.
2001.00-927,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,699.06,703.38,Apparently both the Coast Guard and OSHA agree here.
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,703.38,704.562,"--Yes, they agree."
2001.00-927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,738.635,744.684,How much of a dispute would survive the Solicitor General's review of the two agencies' decision?
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,744.684,764.122,"--Well, we didn't... we didn't need to resolve any dispute because there's been a longstanding understanding between the two agencies, based on the language of the OSH Act, as to how the... how the two... the authority of each agency interacts with the other."
2001.00-927,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,764.122,768.298,If I can go back to inspected vessels just for 1 minute.
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,799.442,800.944,Yes.
2001.00-927,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,803.025,803.624,That's the best understanding--
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,803.624,821.99,"--My answer was intended to say the same thing, that at bottom, the same test applies whether the particular working conditions have been addressed, but with respect to inspected vessels, the working conditions have been addressed comprehensively by the Coast Guard through specific regulations and through general regulations."
2001.00-927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,913.194,916.673,--That... that view is also expressed in the... in the joint agreement.
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,929.827,936.444,"It was published in the... in the Federal Register at... at the time that it was... it was entered into, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,987.662,1004.292,"I take it the reason you say we don't have to get into the distinction between the... the hazard view and the area view is that the area view has been interpreted, I think as you put it, narrowly to take into consideration the particular area in which the particular hazard occurs."
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1004.89,1007.809,That's... that's one... one reason.
2001.00-927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1014.05,1014.776,--Yes.
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1014.776,1027.892,--the act because it would mean that the regulations of the toilets preempt the... any regulation of the vessel and expose all those... all the hazards that might exist on the vessel would not be subject to... to regulation.
2001.00-927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1029.339,1043.095,"I... I guess my only question is, given that narrow interpretation, I wonder if there is all that much difference between the hazard view and the... and the area view as it has been... been stated."
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1043.095,1072.742,"Well, I... I think that... that there is the potential for... for different results to arise between the two views, even with the... the narrow interpretation of... of the area view because the area is identified, say, as the... the atmosphere on the boat."
2001.00-927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1102.047,1112.185,"Are you saying that the regulations just have to be an exact... if the regulation is not an exact duplicate of what OSHA would do, it isn't covered?"
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1112.185,1113.32,"No, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1122.874,1136.366,"So, if you regulate smoke... if the Coast Guard regulates smoke because of some reasons but doesn't address the particulates in the smoke, OSHA could come in and have a regulation for smoke coming out of the vessel?"
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1136.366,1149.381,"Yes, if... if the Coast Guard's regulation didn't address the injury... the particular injury that would result from the smoke, that the... that the OSHA regulation was trying to--"
2001.00-927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1149.381,1150.603,"Well, what if the--"
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1150.603,1151.61,--to get at.
2001.00-927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1151.61,1155.001,--Coast Guard regulations said that we're going to regulate this aspect of smoke.
2001.00-927,0,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1160.225,1178.519,"If the Coast Guard had made that determination and expressly concluded that a regulation of that was not warranted, then that would be an exercise of its authority over... over that working condition and the OSH Act would be displaced."
2001.00-927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1198.492,1199.883,"Very well, Mr. Roberts."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1201.71,1218.531,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Coast Guard has absolute authority to regulate uninspected vessels, as well inspected vessels, and there's not one iota of difference between the two."
2001.00-927,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1233.363,1234.345,Yes.
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1246.476,1248.251,"I would hope so, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1263.915,1266.298,"Now, where are you... you're reading from a Coast Guard regulation?"
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1266.298,1266.977,"Yes, sir, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1266.977,1269.36,Where... where will we find it in the papers?
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1269.36,1276.817,"We'll find that on page 13 of the amicus brief on behalf of the AWO, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1282.497,1284.449,"Now, is this for uninspected vessels?"
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1284.449,1295.435,"For uninspected vessels, Your Honor, operators of uninspected vessels covering emergencies, including rough weather, crossing hazardous bars, man overboard, as well as fire at sea."
2001.00-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1341.47,1348.983,"Well, there's a difference between having statutory authority and discretion to exercise it."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1371.578,1372.785,"That's... that's fairly correct, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1406.213,1412.63,But let's take a... perhaps a practical example in response to Justice Ginsburg's question.
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1425.167,1428.847,"I would say that's an extreme example, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1429.637,1433.965,Those are the... the kinds of examples that perhaps focus your attention.
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1433.965,1434.755,"--Your Honor, yes."
2001.00-927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1523.681,1533.459,"Well, but it seems to me to that that argument... that position of the Government is just consistent with the statute because the... the statute applies to working conditions."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1533.459,1534.145,--Correct.
2001.00-927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1534.145,1556.72,"And I... I would be surprised if the Coast Guard had regulations on... on drilling barges that related to... to blowout preventers, mud cavity depressors, chemical mixturing material for mud, drilling bits."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1559.984,1570.53,"Well, Your Honor, they... what the Coast Guard has is broad, general authority according to 14 U.S.C. 2, and they can board an uninspected vessel."
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1601.439,1611.558,"Well, but they said... the Government said, for example, in respect to the... the regulations that you cited having to do with safety on page 13--"
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1611.558,1612.66,"Yes, sir."
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1612.66,1620.077,"--where they said that part 27, which is what you were quoting from, applies only to towing vessels, that it didn't apply to barges."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1653.301,1654.74,I would disagree.
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1654.74,1655.298,Is that right?
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1658.433,1661.688,Those do apply under the subchapter C uninspected vessels.
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1675.076,1676.811,"Well, I'm just saying which ones apply--"
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1676.811,1677.161,--Which ones.
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1677.161,1678.263,--other than the ones I listed.
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1678.263,1682.049,Your Honor--
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1682.049,1684.374,"I mean, you know, they go through this in a big appendix, and... and are they wrong in their appendix?"
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1684.374,1685.444,"--Yes, I think they're reading--"
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1685.444,1687.115,Which... which part of the appendix is wrong?
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1687.115,1690.379,"--I think they're reading the... the statutes too narrowly, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1726.069,1727.012,"Okay, 160."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1729.635,1730.361,--Yes.
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1731.942,1735.757,"Well, you better tell me the... I mean, you know, I'm just checking them and I'll look up later."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1735.757,1736.1,--Okay.
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1759.245,1769.711,"What I'm getting at is that they... let's say a few minimal applications... applied to the Belden, all right, which is, I take it, your... your barge, to Mr. Belden."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1769.711,1770.302,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1770.302,1772.981,And they have a big appendix designed to show that.
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1789.009,1795.034,"Your Honor, I don't have their appendix in front of me, but yes, I would go... we have... we have a list of regulations that we've... we've applied to--"
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1795.034,1802.283,"I know and they went through those, and they went and said that every one of those that you say, by and large, don't apply with certain exceptions."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1804.866,1806.04,"--Oh, I understand, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1806.04,1808.343,--to find out what I do have to look up and what I don't.
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1808.343,1815.71,"Your Honor, we would... we would submit that, yes, the ones we talk about 33 C.F.R., part 160 clearly applies."
2001.00-927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1855.629,1861.029,But I don't know what that has to do with the complexity of a... of a well drilling operation.
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1873.096,1879.64,"Your Honor, I think it does go back that... that this is actual exercise of authority by the Coast Guard."
2001.00-927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1879.64,1884.272,--But... but this applies to working conditions that... that I've just mentioned.
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1887.688,1894.152,"Your Honor, we think the working conditions... I believe Justice Souter mentioned it... is clearly the working conditions on the barge itself."
2001.00-927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1906.585,1907.824,"Well, that... that's OSHA's problem."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1907.824,1916.393,"--Your Honor, I guess we haven't discussed is the relationship of master to seaman is entirely different from that of employer to employee."
2001.00-927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1916.393,1920.425,"But before you get into that, I... I just want to touch base on one thing."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1957.188,1958.051,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1958.051,1958.376,Yes.
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1958.376,1964.537,They have... they possess statutory authority to regulate and they have exercised that authority.
2001.00-927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1982.31,1992.265,"No, counsel, but isn't it true that what it really boils down to is whether rules of the road or navigation lights are regulations of working conditions?"
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,1992.265,1994.287,"I believe so, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2040.373,2042.315,But your client isn't a seaman.
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2043.385,2045.84,"--It's an employer of seamen, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2083.103,2094.474,"Mr. Veters, that might have been a more persuasive argument if we didn't have 30 years of experience with this understanding between the... the two agencies."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2108.7,2111.387,"No, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2139.041,2144.506,"You're now addressing a different question, whether there's any statutory authority for this arrangement."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2147.881,2149.104,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2149.104,2157.729,Where is this massive confusion if for 30 years this has been in place and at least the agencies are telling us that... that it's working okay?
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2157.729,2167.86,"Your Honor, there's no confusion in the Fifth Circuit because the Fifth Circuit in the Clary cases and the Donovan cases says with respect to the working conditions of seamen, the OSH Act doesn't apply."
2001.00-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2177.492,2181.284,I thought you said... I thought you said that it confused it.
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2188.987,2189.697,--That's correct.
2001.00-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2189.697,2192.536,And the Government is telling us that's not so.
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2199.743,2201.91,"Yes, 1980."
2001.00-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2201.91,2209.488,"The Government said, well, as they read it, that just goes to... it wasn't clear that it wasn't an inspected vessel."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2209.488,2211.047,No.
2001.00-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2240.0,2246.464,"--you've had it for 30 years outside the Fifth Circuit, and there hasn't apparently been this massive confusion."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2252.353,2256.657,"Your Honor, I think that we have three amicus briefs that were filed."
2001.00-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2272.236,2275.924,"Well, why should it be anticipate since this has been going on so long?"
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2275.924,2279.659,"--Your Honor, I would submit that there is... there has been confusion on this issue."
2001.00-927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2296.062,2322.896,"What about a... a kind of contrary parade of horribles to yours if... if we were to accept the Fifth Circuit view, and that is assuming that the Coast Guard regulates running lights and marine sanitation devices, as they were called, and things like that and does nothing more, and it does nothing more than it purports to do right now?"
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2344.156,2346.595,"Your Honor, I do not believe there is a huge gap."
2001.00-927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2349.506,2362.158,"Well, if they... on your theory, if they... if the Coast Guard regulates running lights, OSHA can do absolutely nothing about blowouts like this, and that seems to me a pretty big gap."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2362.158,2373.793,"--Your Honor, the... the Coast Guard has the absolute authority, statutory authority, to board, inspect, investigate any vessel they choose randomly at will, whatever they want to do, and to seize that vessel, to control it--"
2001.00-927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2373.793,2384.235,"If that were... if that were... I mean, if that were the answer to my problem, I would have expected Congress to tell the Coast Guard not only that it may regulate, but that it must."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2413.603,2416.698,"--Your Honor, what... I go back to what I said earlier."
2001.00-927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2438.96,2452.204,Congress apparently has... has not been... been particularly concerned about the... the Secretary's interpretation of this statute and the... to the effect of the... OSHA jurisdiction.
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2460.651,2461.794,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2461.794,2477.287,"So, if... if you say, well, if Congress doesn't like it, Congress can do something about it, Congress could do something about the... the administrative position and it hasn't done anything about it, which suggests that that's a... a good reason behind the rule of deference."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2477.287,2486.385,"Your Honor, the rule of deference only applies if the... it is consistent with the intent of Congress and the statute is unambiguous in its intention."
2001.00-927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2487.215,2492.999,And you say this is an unambiguous statute despite the... the presence of the word exercise there?
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2492.999,2494.15,"--I do, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2532.805,2536.1,The antitrust division and the FTC do it all the time.
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2536.1,2539.62,"--Your Honor, I can't speak--"
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2539.62,2540.37,Is that illegal too?
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2540.37,2544.938,"--I'm not an antitrust lawyer, Your Honor, about which I could... I could speak to that."
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2544.938,2547.321,"I mean, I just wondered how general statement was."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2549.936,2551.022,No.
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2578.222,2584.167,"Well, that's why I wondered maybe it has to do how comprehensive the regulation was, and that's what I was interested in."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2584.167,2593.168,"--Your Honor, they've just chosen... OSHA has chosen not to regulate inspected vessels pursuant to a memorandum of understanding, but it does not... it doesn't change the statutory scheme one bit."
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.168,2596.096,"Well, the word is exercise."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2599.495,2599.757,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2599.757,2604.141,"So, if they decide not to exercise their authority, then I guess they're not exercising it."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2604.141,2605.036,"You're right, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2605.036,2606.93,"They can choose not to exercise it, I suppose."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2611.542,2617.167,"But, Your Honor, the statute doesn't say comprehensive, pervasive exercise; it says exercise."
2001.00-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2629.232,2637.401,"So, if the Coast Guard didn't regulate the toilets, then OSHA could regulate it."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2637.401,2640.288,"According to OSHA, Your Honor, that's correct."
2001.00-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2641.175,2643.422,What about you?
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2660.941,2663.236,--If there were no express--
2001.00-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2663.236,2675.384,"If the Coast Guard didn't regulate anything on this particular class of uninspected vessels, then would there be authority in the Occupational Safety and Health--"
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2675.384,2684.257,"--If there was just the mere possession of authority without the exercise, I would argue, Your Honor, that they still... the Coast Guard still has been charged with their responsibility and they still would have that responsibility."
2001.00-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2688.495,2693.583,--But you don't... you don't put anything... I misunderstood your argument before.
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2698.695,2699.63,"--Yes, Your Honor--"
2001.00-927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2699.63,2708.263,"So, if they didn't choose to exercise any authority, that OSHA could... could regulate."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2720.785,2721.623,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2731.631,2738.977,"No, but... as I understand your theory now, it wouldn't matter even if they had not exercised it."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2738.977,2741.615,"Your Honor, I'd say... I would agree with that."
2001.00-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2856.664,2860.151,"Thank you, Mr. Veters."
2001.00-927,1,38407,patrick_j_veters,,2860.151,2860.926,--Thank you very much.
2001.00-927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2860.926,2863.621,"Mr. Roberts, you have 11 minutes remaining."
2001.00-927,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2863.621,2885.228,"With the exception of part 160, which doesn't regulate occupational safety and health, none of the regulations identified by respondent applied to the Mr. Belden as is explained in the... in the appendix in our reply brief."
2001.00-927,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2932.858,2941.315,"What do you say about his argument that, yes, oh, that may be true in writing, but in fact the people who did investigate this accident was the Coast Guard?"
2001.00-927,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2941.315,2947.972,The Coast Guard has... has responsibility for investigating marine accidents.
2001.00-927,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2988.175,2992.463,"Mr. Roberts, how far can a memorandum of understanding go?"
2001.00-927,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3012.251,3023.334,"The... the question of who has authority here is governed by section 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act, not by some agreement between the... Coast Guard and OSHA."
2001.00-927,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3031.815,3037.391,"So, you don't... you don't rely on the memorandum as any independent basis for a ruling--"
2001.00-927,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3037.391,3038.558,"--None whatsoever, Your Honor."
2001.00-927,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3163.104,3172.09,--Are there some drilling platforms on the Outer Continental Shelf which are registered vessels and so are completely under the Coast Guard's jurisdiction as to drilling--
2001.00-927,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3172.09,3173.593,Yes.
2001.00-927,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3210.931,3219.795,"--On those vessels, if the Coast Guard chose, could it allow OSHA a specific regulation of a concurrent... sort of a concurrent jurisdiction?"
2001.00-927,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3219.795,3234.551,"The... it... it could have if it... if it hadn't exercised its comprehensive authority over those vessels, but it has exercised its comprehensive authority over those vessels, in contrast to the situation here."
