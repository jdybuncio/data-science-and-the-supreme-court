1956.204,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,12.109,"Number 204 William Benz et al., Petitioners, versus Compania Naviera Hidalgo, a Corporation."
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,15.286,18.214,"May it please, Your Honors."
1956.204,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,511.912,513.679,"Where is that allegation again, Mr. --"
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,513.679,517.082,At page 484.
1956.204,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,703.953,705.62,What finding -- what finding is that?
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,705.62,708.506,That is --
1956.204,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,708.506,709.396,Finding four?
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,709.396,714.476,"Finding 11, finding of fact 11, on 241 of the record."
1956.204,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1040.654,1051.338,"Mr. Tanner, may I ask before you get to that, are -- are you suggesting that the finding in 12 at page 242 is without support in the record as this?"
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1051.338,1052.027,Yes.
1956.204,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1056.61,1060.64,"Well, are you asking this Court to disregard this finding on the ground --"
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1060.64,1065.924,"The word ""sole"", I -- I think it's clearly contradictory to other findings."
1956.204,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1065.924,1072.539,Well I -- I don't -- I don't -- what I'm trying to get at is what your position is.Are you asking us not to accept this finding on the ground --
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1072.539,1072.807,No.
1956.204,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1072.807,1073.874,-- not supported on the record?
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1073.874,1074.087,No.
1956.204,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1081.859,1082.055,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1082.055,1084.12,-- I don't think it was the sole mental process.
1956.204,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1084.12,1096.784,"Now, but the fact is -- they have facts to fact, and we have to proceed to the decision of the issues here, accepting the finding here, is that it?"
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1096.784,1102.898,"Well, I assume that you can take these findings in their entirety."
1956.204,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1155.862,1165.66,"Well, may I ask, Mr. Tanner, was this -- that word ""sole"" was that attacked in the Court of Appeals?"
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1165.66,1167.506,I can't answer that.
1956.204,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1175.047,1182.802,"Well, is it the posture of the case here that as to this fact -- finding of fact in any event, both lower courts acted upon it."
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1186.192,1205.817,"I can't -- I -- I -- if they did, there was nothing in their opinion that they acted solely upon that particular finding that I've been able to find out or ascertain."
1956.204,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1512.68,1517.554,"Well, Mr. Tanner, can we get at it in terms of this Finding 12."
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1538.318,1539.008,That's right.
1956.204,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1543.041,1567.977,"Now, this -- this finding is that the Sailors' Union of the Pacific picketed in order to compel the respondent shipowner to modify those articles to fix a shorter period than they provided and that wage rates and other conditions different from those under the articles, is that it?"
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1567.977,1569.297,And that's what the finding said.
1956.204,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1569.297,1569.58,Yes.
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1588.504,1589.397,I think so.
1956.204,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1589.92,1590.821,And is that your -- is that your both position?
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1590.821,1591.953,That's our position.
1956.204,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1747.058,1758.568,Were these people for whom the union acted were the employees within the meaning of section 7 of the Taft-Hartley Act?
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1758.568,1760.537,I would think so.
1956.204,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1764.761,1767.417,"They have been -- they have been discharged, have they?"
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1767.417,1767.597,Yes.
1956.204,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1842.45,1848.475,"But Mr. Tanner, aren't you up against the difficulty that here is a finding that they were discharged at the time that you did this picketing?"
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1848.475,1851.063,"Oh, I -- I think they were discharged."
1956.204,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1851.063,1851.826,We can't go behind that.
1956.204,0,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,1851.826,1852.029,No.
1956.204,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1895.481,1906.666,Mr. Mosser.
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,1906.666,1908.623,May it please the Court.
1956.204,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2289.374,2305.709,"And why do you say that, that purpose would not be something for a determination by the National Labor Relations Board either as to prohibition or as to permits of picket?"
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2305.709,2322.356,"The petitioner's argument on that point, Mr. Justice Brennan, relies on the -- the case of Weber versus Anheuser-Busch and other cases which deal with the question of the National Labor Relations Board's jurisdiction to enjoin."
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2386.482,2406.061,"Would that permit the National Labor Relations Board to hold that in picketing as they did or as workers do, they are within their protected right and yet you could sue that get damages in the state court?"
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2413.145,2413.259,I think --
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2413.259,2415.993,"Between that kind of a -- that kind of a conflict, could you?"
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2415.993,2421.156,I think there is certainly the possibility of that type of a conflict.
1956.204,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2509.231,2510.197,Are you --
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2510.197,2510.296,All --
1956.204,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2510.296,2521.37,-- are suggesting that Laburnum would have been decided as it was but for -- even without the facts as to violence who would like to do the picketing?
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2521.37,2526.264,"I believe so, and -- and that is certainly the position we are taking here."
1956.204,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2551.735,2565.298,"Well, as Justice -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter just suggested the peaceful picketing which is what we have here was found lawful by the Board if it's properly a case for the Board."
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2577.709,2593.231,"Well, I -- I think this if -- if this conduct, this picketing is protected picketing under the National Labor Relations Act as amended, then no cause of action would lie."
1956.204,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2660.78,2679.013,"But does -- doesn't that suggest that everytime that it was protected peaceful picketing of any employer if the State allows an action in tort based upon damages suffered from the picketing, even though it's protected picketing, nevertheless, the employer may have a judgment in damages."
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2679.914,2689.776,"He may -- he may not have a judgment in damages if the state court finds, as you have said, that it was protected picketing because that would be a substantive defense."
1956.204,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2689.776,2692.244,The state court doesn't know anything about it --
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2692.244,2692.416,I --
1956.204,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2692.416,2695.34,-- whether it's protected or not.
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2695.34,2707.627,I understood -- I got the impression from what you've said in reply to -- your reply to an earlier question in the series of questions put to you just now by Justice Brennan.
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2728.471,2729.481,I think that is correct.
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2729.481,2730.423,Is that what you said?
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2730.423,2731.224,That's what I said.
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2731.224,2737.029,"So then, the matter gets down to the fact that in this case -- what was the defense in this case when suit was brought?"
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2741.036,2745.919,Their main defense as it's expressed both in the questions here and below --
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2745.919,2748.601,What -- what was the defense in the pleading?
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2755.429,2761.572,They alleged defenses under the claim that the Court lacked jurisdiction.
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2761.572,2763.523,Why?
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2763.523,2786.6,"Initially, when we had the injunctive part of the case is in, they were relying on the National -- on the Norris-LaGuardia Act as well as on the National Labor Relations Act as amended and I believe ultimately, it boiled down to a position and certainly in this Court the position is that the National Labor Management Relations Act deprived the Court of jurisdiction."
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2786.6,2795.143,"What I want to know is, in view of your answer a little while ago, namely, that they could invoke the defense of the National Labor Relations Act."
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2801.37,2804.389,That has been something that has never been clear to me.
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2822.997,2831.688,By the wat -- it lacked jurisdiction because this is a matter that can't get into courts -- in any court ab initio it must first go to the Labor Board.
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2831.688,2831.774,That --
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2831.774,2832.393,Is that right?
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2832.393,2833.005,-- that is their argument.
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2833.005,2845.637,"And -- and isn't that raising the claim that the National Labor Relations Act preempted this field and the State can, on its own, say something as a tort which may be sanctioned by a federal act?"
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2845.637,2863.728,"Well, I think there's a difference, Your Honor, between claiming that the National Labor Relations Act provided a substantive defense and preempted state policy to the contrary and saying that the National Labor Relations Board jurisdictionally preempted the field and gave it to the National Labor Relations Board."
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2863.728,2863.792,Well --
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2863.792,2867.59,I think it's the latter argument they have made rather than the former one.
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2867.59,2877.527,"Well, if -- if this is a matter for the National Labor Relations Act or rather if it's open."
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2887.196,2887.484,I agree.
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2887.484,2891.663,-- under the -- under a violation as to which there must be a finding by the Board.
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2891.663,2892.516,I think that's correct.
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2892.516,2910.273,"Then why haven't they invoked the defense that although this is a damage suit, Oregon can't give a right and (Inaudible) that the Federal Act is taking away that right."
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2910.273,2912.166,"Well, I don't think they have."
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2913.428,2913.71,Yes.
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2913.71,2915.884,-- I have attempted to answer it in the brief as well as my in argument.
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2915.884,2917.52,What is the answer?
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2917.52,2922.655,The answer in this case is that I think the activity was not protected for two reasons.
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2922.655,2924.174,That is a matter of law you are say you don't have --
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2924.174,2924.563,Yes.
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2924.563,2926.136,-- to get the Board to pass on it.
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2926.136,2926.43,Yes.
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2926.43,2928.348,Now what is -- what are reasons?
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2928.348,2942.618,"First that this, is a dispute basically between a foreign shipowner and a foreign crew for employment aboard a foreign vessel."
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2962.839,2970.844,What case did we -- we had a case involving that problem of the extent to which the Federal Act is applicable to a foreign ship and a foreign crew.
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2970.844,2974.991,There was the case -- I don't think there have been any in this --
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2974.991,2977.261,"I don't mean under the Labor Act, but under another Act."
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2977.261,2981.73,"Yes, and it was in the statutory thing -- well it was the Jones Act, I believe --"
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2981.73,2982.123,The Jones Act.
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2982.123,2986.856,-- between a case of Lauritzen versus Larsen which Mr. Justice Jackson wrote a rather lengthy opinion.
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2986.856,2989.135,That's what I'm referring to.
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,2989.135,3007.373,"And in that case, it -- it was pointed out that the universal word, ""any seamen"", words, ""any seamen"" in the Jones Act weren't intended to apply to any seamen in the world but only to those which would normally come within the jurisdiction and legislative intent of this country."
1956.204,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3019.793,3021.853,Here you have domestic waters.
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,3021.853,3034.216,"Here you have domestic waters and further in this case and the petitioners make a point of it, the picketing itself was on American soil and what we are seeking damages for, is that picketing."
1956.204,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,3066.898,3068.887,You are giving a second reason or cause?
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,3068.887,3076.341,"Now, there's a second reason and that relates to the nature of the dispute which started here."
1956.204,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,3162.343,3163.992,What case was that?
1956.204,1,32146,john_d_mosser,,3163.992,3166.896,That's Southern --
1956.204,2,34007,kneland_c_tanner,,3669.085,3698.802,"I just want to make one observation I trust the Court to bear in mind that the cases cited including the Southern Steamship case, the Court was dealing with a remedy or a right that the -- that the parties that were -- had committed the wrongful conduct is still board on the Southern Steamship case gave some relief to men which this Court held was unworthy of relief."
