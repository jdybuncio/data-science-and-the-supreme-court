1969.387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,17.682,"Today's calendar for argument is Number 387, California against John Anthony Green."
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,18.652,20.89,Mr. Chief Justice -- thank you.
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,350.191,366.071,"Before you proceed to the facts to this case General James, is there any available evidence showing the legislative history of this amendment in the California code relating to evidence, any -- is there anything --"
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,366.071,366.21,Yes --
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,366.21,370.001,That you know off that shows why the state legislature did this?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,370.001,372.416,Yes Your Honor.
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,410.387,412.359,These notes indicate what?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,423.642,444.509,"Well, it was a conclusion of the commissioners that this was the federal rule of evidence and that there was no reason why these statements shouldn't be used as had been suggested by Wigmore in his latest work has been expressed by McCormick in his work on evidence."
1969.387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,532.363,538.859,Is the availability of the primary speaker in the courtroom one of the conditions of the California statute?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,538.859,539.562,Yes Your Honor.
1969.387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,539.562,541.563,As it is under the proposed federal rule?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,541.563,543.547,"Yes, yes."
1969.387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,573.188,577.974,And you do not see this as conflict with any prior decision of this Court?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,577.974,581.789,I don't know of any prior decision of this Court that it conflicts with.
1969.387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,594.952,595.015,That was this?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,595.015,608.266,"-- declarance wasn't there or he made himself unavailable by an exercise of a privilege or as in Smith versus Illinois, the defendant was precluded from some effective interrogation."
1969.387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,608.266,619.484,"In the Douglas case, this Court equated the assertion of the Fifth Amendment right as being the same as not being present, not being available?"
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,619.484,639.817,It effectively denied cross examination to the defendant and he wasn't able to examine the witness over the declarant in Court and this Court pointed out that it would have been different had he been able -- had he been able in Douglas to cross examine Loyd which he was not.
1969.387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.202,720.75,(Inaudible)
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,720.75,738.97,"In this case it was approved by the first, the reading of a preliminary hearing transcript and also by the statement made to an officer of the juvenile court by the officer himself who testified concerning these statement of the defendant."
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,738.97,742.568,Have here two types of a prior statement.
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,751.357,751.96,Correct.
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,751.96,763.569,"On one end and additionally an unsworn statement made in no judicial proceeding but made to an officer, to made to an officer while at the -- of the juvenile court?"
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,763.569,764.24,That's correct Your Honor.
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,764.24,765.148,unsworn?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,765.148,765.516,Yes.
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,765.516,771.336,"And there may or may not be a difference with respect to the two, I know you --"
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,771.336,771.972,We submit that the reason involvements --
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,771.972,774.207,-- shouldn't have involved in this --
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,774.207,777.354,Under the rule of confrontation at least --
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,777.354,777.631,Right.
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,777.631,789.447,And that perhaps judicial policy of policy of legislature in adapting one rule or another are -- where the various conflicts arise.
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,795.505,801.797,But you did and the Supreme Court of California confesses error with respect to the later?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,801.797,806.58,Only as it pertained to the in to the state court ruling which we bound by at that time.
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,806.58,808.855,"That's why -- right, because by previous state court decision?"
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,808.855,809.258,That's right.
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,817.594,818.528,Right.
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,824.487,825.016,Yes.
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,825.016,825.957,Right.
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,825.957,840.453,"But we made no intention of conceding the issue, we were bound at that time by final state court decision which we were contesting unsuccessfully or heads were bloody but on bout at that time."
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1105.958,1109.997,"Now, is this testimony that he was giving at the trial or is this --"
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1109.997,1119.32,This is testimony he was giving at the trial following the reading of his cross examination at the preliminary hearing.
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1325.308,1328.248,Was the -- excuse me a bit.
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1332.751,1334.327,Yes Your Honor.
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1337.917,1340.907,You think that makes any difference?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1340.907,1378.561,"No I don't but I think in this particular case, it clearly demonstrates that this man had the opportunity to confront the declarant at the time the earlier statement was made and further cross examination, the important aspect of confrontation, the presence before the ultimate trier of fact and he had that he had the attorney and the attorney did a good job in both questioning the witnesses at the preliminary hearing and then following it up with an examination of the minor witness, the officers and the other witnesses at the trial."
1969.387,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.561,1380.365,"It means counsel -- excuse me, excuse me."
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1380.365,1381.879,"Well, go ahead."
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1381.879,1385.157,What's the object of a preliminary trial in California?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1385.157,1390.456,Primarily to determine whether there is probable cause to hold the defendant to answer.
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1390.456,1393.428,"And if it's found, what is done?"
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1393.428,1404.839,An information is filed within a period of 15 days in the superior court and the defendant is thereafter arraigned in the superior court and a date is set for trial.
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1404.839,1411.518,Held for the purpose of determining on whether or not there will be a warrant?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1411.518,1412.82,An information filed.
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1412.82,1414.986,"Information, what information?"
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1414.986,1417.64,An accusation filed against him.
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1417.64,1420.061,You don't have any grand jury investigation?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1420.061,1425.454,"Yes, we have both the grand jury and the preliminary hearing in California."
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1425.454,1427.257,"Well, this one was not a grand jury investigation?"
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1427.257,1430.272,"This was not a grand jury, this proceeded by information."
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1440.725,1448.562,Suppose the Court had decided on preliminary trial there would be -- there was no probable cause?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1448.562,1451.77,The man would not be held to answer at the preliminary.
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1451.77,1453.09,Hew would be released?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1453.09,1458.343,He would be released and the complaint would be dismissed.
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1458.343,1467.074,What's the difference in the procedures when you try him for preliminary trial here and back to the trial of the case?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1467.074,1469.907,"Well, actually, the grand jury --"
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1469.907,1471.506,Put on witnesses?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1471.506,1473.054,At the grand jury proceeding?
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1473.054,1475.135,"At the proceeding, at the preliminary?"
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1475.135,1475.944,At the preliminary?
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1477.032,1479.055,And then the defendant put on witnesses?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1479.055,1483.559,"Ordinarily not, he would be there to merely cross examine --"
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1483.559,1484.79,He cannot put on witnesses?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1484.79,1485.984,He may put on witnesses.
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1485.984,1486.966,But he may?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1486.966,1497.003,"He may put on witnesses, he ordinarily does not because the question there is, is there probable cause to hold the defendant to answer?"
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1500.414,1504.33,If he wants to have a lawyer and put on witnesses he has a right to do both?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1504.33,1515.356,"Oh yes, he has a right to a lawyer at the preliminary and in California would be furnish a lawyer at the preliminary hearing if he was unable to afford one."
1969.387,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1515.356,1528.776,"Well, what is the reason suggested by that is not the kind of a trial or proceeding or you could use the evidence from here, if you could use it from any other place, that it had been a cross examination or counseling?"
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1528.776,1538.055,"I would submit that there -- this, that there should be a right to use this preliminary examination evidence at a later time."
1969.387,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1538.055,1543.719,But the reason suggested why you shouldn't is the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment in answer to Justice Black's question?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1543.719,1545.472,That's right.
1969.387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1545.472,1548.359,Can California proceed --
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1548.359,1548.688,pardon me.
1969.387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1548.688,1559.226,Were you finished Justice -- can California proceed by way of information or indictment by a grand jury without any preliminary hearing at all if they want to?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1559.226,1562.813,You can proceed by a grand jury indictment without a preliminary hearing.
1969.387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1562.813,1564.476,But not by information?
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1564.476,1570.323,Not by information unless the defendant waives a preliminary hearing.
1969.387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1570.323,1583.363,"Just to have that clear, the preliminary hearing is an absolute right if they proceed by charge by information but not so by grand jury indictment?"
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1583.363,1585.279,That's right Your Honor.
1969.387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1589.836,1590.601,Very well.
1969.387,0,45129,william_e_james,,1590.601,1591.092,Thank you Your Honor.
1969.387,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1591.092,1594.572,Thank you General.
1969.387,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1597.911,1599.085,May it please the Court.
1969.387,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3659.443,3663.389,It was urged before the California Supreme Court and they reserved judgment.
1969.387,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3700.021,3701.641,Even assuming all the evidence was properly.
1969.387,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3701.641,3703.605,Even assume that it all came in.
1969.387,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3713.734,3717.031,"Well, the last sentence of the opinion says just that."
1969.387,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3720.999,3721.589,That's correct.
1969.387,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3721.589,3723.128,So it's wide open.
1969.387,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3723.128,3723.802,Pardon me?
1969.387,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3723.802,3725.263,It's wide open if you will get that --
1969.387,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3725.263,3726.291,That's correct.
1969.387,3,45129,william_e_james,,7003.624,7004.89,Mr. Chief Justice --
1969.387,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,7004.89,7004.999,Mr. James.
1969.387,5,45129,william_e_james,,7004.999,7006.898,And may it please the Court.
