1972.71-1255,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,33.114,36.07,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1255,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,248.446,250.369,The photographs were unconnected with the --
1972.71-1255,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,250.369,255.186,Unconnected with the robbery.
1972.71-1255,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,379.091,381.478,Mr. Korman this trial took place in May of 1968?
1972.71-1255,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,381.478,384.348,That’s correct.
1972.71-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.843,998.229,Was there testimony in this case about the pretrial identification?
1972.71-1255,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,998.229,999.351,Yes there was.
1972.71-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,999.351,1001.294,At the time?
1972.71-1255,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1001.294,1004.068,"Only during the defendant’s case, yes."
1972.71-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1004.068,1005.549,Only during the defendant's case?
1972.71-1255,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1005.549,1010.905,"Right, the prosecutor did not offer any evidence during the course of the trial then."
1972.71-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1010.905,1015.343,Do you think there is not Gilbert problem in this case?
1972.71-1255,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1015.343,1019.194,"No, I do not – I don't follow you in what way?"
1972.71-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1019.194,1022.905,"Well, let’s assume that Wade did apply the photographic identification."
1972.71-1255,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1022.905,1024.288,Yes.
1972.71-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.288,1038.996,"And the prosecutor in examining his witness brought out the fact of pretrial identification absent counsel, it wouldn’t help to show no taint then, would it, under Gilbert?"
1972.71-1255,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1038.996,1040.685,No.
1972.71-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.237,1043.928,Is there any problem like that in this case or not?
1972.71-1255,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1043.928,1054.351,"Well, there is -- we do not dispute the finding of the Court of Appeals that it was the government who asked that Ash’s photograph be introduced and that it was at the government’s behest that all five --"
1972.71-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.351,1059.029,Would you say then that if Wade were held to have applied in this case that this case would automatically be reversed?
1972.71-1255,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1059.029,1062.796,That’s correct and that’s precisely what the Court of Appeals did.
1972.71-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1062.796,1068.996,"But if -- so that the finding of no taint, there was a finding of no taint wasn’t there, here?"
1972.71-1255,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1068.996,1069.907,By the District Court.
1972.71-1255,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1069.907,1072.573,"Yes, but that wouldn’t overwrite a Gilbert violations?"
1972.71-1255,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1072.573,1077.202,"No, it would not."
1972.71-1255,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1233.609,1236.512,Bailey was acquitted by jury or as he was acquitted by the --?
1972.71-1255,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1236.512,1239.865,He was acquitted by the judge after the jury was unable to reach a verdict.
1972.71-1255,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1239.865,1240.64,I see.
1972.71-1255,0,22634,edward_r_korman,,1240.64,1253.09,"In the second place even as to Ash, three of the witnesses on the day before trial were able to give only uncertain identifications and the fourth wasn’t even able to pick out his photograph."
1972.71-1255,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1341.759,1344.635,Thank you Mr. Korman.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,1347.72,1351.626,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1707.799,1749.625,"Mr. Cohn, suppose instead of having had the interviews in the context of this case, the police had the same five photographs of five different people all of whom where at least have thought to be suspect for one reason or another and took them around the neighborhood and exposed them to people and said, “Have you ever seen any of these men before” and then, if so where and narrowing it down to the day and the details would -- what could you say about that exposure of the photographs?"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,1749.625,1759.067,Mr. Chief Justice I draw a line between identification procedures that are investigative.
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1845.076,1855.822,It is not your claim as I understand it that photographs cannot be used in a variety of different ways during the investigation of a criminal offense.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,1884.496,1885.065,That’s correct.
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1887.926,1889.26,Through eyewitnesses?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,1889.26,1890.405,Yes.
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1890.405,1891.41,Who testified?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,1891.41,1894.976,Here is where we part ground with the government.
1972.71-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1944.189,1959.833,Mr. Cohn you say that this is positive evidence and I take it that is that way you distinguish Mr. Korman’s example where the prosecuting attorney is simply horse shedding the witness without any photographs?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,1959.833,1971.867,"In a horse shedding situation the statements of the witness are not admissible as positive evidence, perhaps for him piece -- for the purposes --"
1972.71-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1971.867,1976.349,Well but a photograph isn’t admissible until a witness in court identifies it?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,1976.349,1977.502,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1999.92,2005.285,Had she already identified the defendant at that time from the stand?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2005.285,2010.667,At that time she had already been asked by Mr. Bailey’s counsel.
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2012.507,2012.647,Yes.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2012.647,2014.357,"I am sorry, the answer is yes sir."
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2014.357,2014.831,Yes.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2014.831,2015.382,"Yes, she had."
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2015.382,2019.835,"She’d already made an identification independent of any photograph, hadn’t she?"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2019.835,2020.523,In court.
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2020.523,2021.108,Yes.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2021.108,2035.647,"That is correct, but now are we to use her identification itself outside of court as positive evidence to buttress the identification in court?"
1972.71-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2056.275,2064.524,How do you contend that her testimony was used independently to buttress during the trial?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2068.052,2080.549,"Well, if we can refer to the appendix, Your Honor, I believe that would be at --"
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2080.549,2083.786,Did this occur at the time of the government’s case in Chief?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2083.786,2084.302,No Your Honor.
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2089.983,2090.657,Mr. Cohn --
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2090.657,2091.065,Yes sir?
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2091.065,2102.269,-- Isn't the standard rule as the federal court rule of evidence that pretrial identifications are admissible in evidence to corroborate in court identification?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2102.269,2103.212,That’s my understanding.
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2103.212,2105.09,That's generally the rule?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2105.09,2105.566,Yes.
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2105.566,2116.784,"So that if government wants to do if may have the witness identify the witness in court and then say, did you identify it before, and the witness can answer it --"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2116.784,2117.26,That’s correct.
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.26,2126.29,-- or the government can simply offer the pretrial identification without even getting around to the identification in court?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2126.29,2128.629,That’s my understanding.
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2128.629,2129.357,"Now, how does it do that?"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2136.396,2136.909,Either way.
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2142.827,2145.601,A policeman can say this is the best identify this?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2145.601,2145.961,Yes.
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2145.961,2147.809,What was done here?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2147.809,2164.778,"What was done here was, well, first of all she was asked, on page — well, if I can start on page 104 of the appendix."
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2209.908,2211.297,Where are we now?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2211.297,2221.453,"On page 123 is where Mr. Fallon, the police officer who accompanied –- this wasn't involved with the 66."
1972.71-1255,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2235.09,2237.286,This is Mr. Bailey’s attorney?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2237.286,2243.212,"This is Mr. Bailey’s attorney, “Did you at anytime show her several of photographs in color?”"
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2268.59,2270.291,And the number five is Ash?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2270.291,2271.334,Number five is Ash.
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2321.493,2323.495,So Mr. Stanford is Bailey’s attorney?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2323.495,2324.099,That’s correct.
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2324.099,2326.135,Mr. Pennet is the prosecutor.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2326.135,2326.577,That’s correct.
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2326.577,2328.28,"And Mr. Rosen is Ash’s attorney, is that right?"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2328.28,2329.448,That is correct.
1972.71-1255,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2363.217,2365.238,Mr. Rosen did agree?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2365.238,2385.497,"He agreed and I suggest that he agreed that once the court had ruled that Ash, his pictures could go in that what his statement is that the least amount of prejudice would be of all the five pictures go in, but the court has already ruled by this time on Mr. Stanford’s request."
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2385.497,2394.601,"Well, as he ruled or has he indicated that he has a leaning, said “I would be disposed to admit it, that’s hardly a ruling at that stage.”"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2402.59,2414.767,I suggest Your Honor that we’ve had now pages of argument on the subject and that at the end of that paragraph the court himself suggests that should we introduce all five.
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2414.767,2418.186,"Well, at least Mr. Rosen didn’t have to agree."
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2418.186,2428.3,"I agree, Your Honor, if I were there and if I were second guessing him I would not agree to any form of, but he was the man under fire."
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2428.3,2436.117,"He wasn’t – he wasn't agreeing until -- I mean at the top of page 130, the same page he said, “It is not going into evidence,” he is --"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2436.117,2439.15,"Oh, he is objecting all along."
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2439.15,2440.877,I haven’t read this carefully.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2454.743,2463.635,That’s the way the Court of Appeals apparently read it and I would certainly to say that a permissible reading.
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.635,2489.043,"Mr. Cohn would you say that if it were held that Wade applies to photographic identifications of those involved in this case that based on what we’ve just been over here, there was a Gilbert error in the sense that the prosecution should be charged with having relied on pretrial identification, so that a finding of no taint would not suffice?"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2489.043,2490.343,That’s correct sir.
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.343,2500.816,"You would think even though the government carefully avoided pretrial identifications on its side of the case, the defense and the defense brought it up?"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2500.816,2501.141,Yes.
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2501.141,2502.484,First presented it to the jury?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2502.484,2503.71,Yes.
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.71,2506.564,That nevertheless a finding of no taint would not suffice then?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2506.564,2524.122,"Well, what we really have here is a blatant situation, like where we have the pictures instead of a confession being used and its' -- it's a problem of how you are going to -- we have two codefendants in the case and how do we handle this --"
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2524.122,2529.006,Well how will the government avoid this sort of thing?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2529.006,2543.602,"By having a counsel at the photographic identification, I suppose is the easy answer, by seeing that a case such as this is tried separately, rather than together."
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2546.022,2548.163,Where there motions here to severe?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2548.163,2549.645,"I’m afraid not, Your Honor."
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2549.645,2552.473,"Well, then you can’t --"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2552.473,2554.771,"Well, the problem was I am not sure."
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2560.712,2560.921,No.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2560.921,2561.472,I was unable to find one on motion.
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2561.472,2573.728,"The purpose, when a motion to severe is not made and then isn't it a reasonable inference that both of the defendants thought it was their advantage not to be severed."
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2573.728,2580.608,"Well, unfortunately I cannot cross examine the mind of Rosen, the attorney here as to what he had here."
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2580.608,2584.216,Well I’m just talking about inferences from known facts.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2584.216,2591.117,That is possible.
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2614.103,2623.605,"Well, would you agree that what triggered the introduction of the five photographs was the proposal to introduce the Bailey photograph?"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2623.605,2623.963,I will.
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2625.902,2627.786,So that this was not the government’s idea?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2627.786,2632.528,It was the government’s idea then to go on and introduce the Ash photograph.
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2644.06,2657.864,"But once having avoided a motion to severe and elected to have a joint trial, this is the type of difficulty that is inherent in a joint trial, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2657.864,2659.634,"That’s correct Your Honor, and at the same time --"
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2659.634,2663.467,Sometimes lawyers can foresee that and sometimes they can’t.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2663.467,2681.951,"But at that the same time it would be avoidable by the government -- counsel, by the court cautioning that all that we have to have in here is that there was a photograph of Mr. Ash shown to Mrs. Apple and she did not identify him."
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.087,2714.466,Assuming there was not a -- assuming there was not a so called Gilbert violation here and then the finding of no taint would -- would avoid a reversal even if Wade applied the photographs. Wasn't there a finding of no taint here sufficient for that purpose?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2714.466,2717.201,"As far as the in-court identification is concerned, when you say no taint."
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.201,2720.146,Yes.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2720.146,2724.983,The trial judge found that there was no taint on the in-court identification.
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2724.983,2726.606,It came from an independent basis?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2726.606,2730.341,That it came from independent basis.
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2730.341,2738.301,Are you satisfied that would suffice even if Wade were applicable in this case?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2738.301,2738.937,"No, You Honor."
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2738.937,2740.205,Absent of Gilbert?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2740.205,2752.366,"Sorry, Your Honor, if we were at that point if that issue where here, I would argue that based upon this record that that was not the permissible finding."
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2752.366,2752.843,I see.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2752.843,2755.82,But that issue was not brought here by the government.
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2755.82,2762.389,"Accepting that finding though, the finding in form is sufficient in form?"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2762.389,2774.811,"The Court of Appeals ruled that it was not sufficiently detailed, that it was much too general and I’ll stand on that if I may."
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2774.811,2777.362,I think Justice Powell had [laughter] Mr. Cohn.
1972.71-1255,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2777.362,2778.134,Mr. Cohn.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2778.134,2779.079,Yes Mr. Justice?
1972.71-1255,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2779.079,2785.112,"The first photographic identification in this case was on February 3, 1966."
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2785.112,2785.773,That’s correct sir.
1972.71-1255,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2785.773,2791.486,Let’s assume for the moment that Mr. Ash had been indicted at that time.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2798.754,2808.373,"That’s correct sir because under Kirby once you have the indictment or information, or arrest then I would assume the rest having to do with this matter."
1972.71-1255,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2808.373,2826.203,"Suppose one of those witness is, let’s say the customer who was in the bank, had been in Seattle and the FBI had wanted to ascertain whether she could identify the indicted defendant."
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2834.342,2855.736,"That is my position, but I do not agree with all of the unstated implications that I hear because it would seem to me that notice to counsel would be adequate and then he could go or he could retain counsel out there to appear at the photographic identification."
1972.71-1255,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2862.491,2875.178,"Your formulation doesn’t depend at all on whether or not the photographic showing is or is not suggestive, counsel must be present at any event?"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2875.178,2877.436,That’s correct and I don’t think that the way it is right.
1972.71-1255,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2884.179,2885.053,May I ask you Mr. Cohn?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2885.053,2885.214,Yes.
1972.71-1255,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2885.214,2888.196,Has there ever been the suggestion of harmless error in this case?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2888.196,2920.084,"No sir and the where you’ve had such indefinite identification as I suggest and here again I part ways with my brother here that once that the photographic identification could be read to have to contribute of whatever positive in this that was to the identification or at least we cannot say that the witnesses would not have been the less definite, but for the identification."
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2920.084,2943.003,Didn’t the government have a rather strong case when they had the would be accomplish testified that Ash had asked him to join in this enterprise and then told him the day afterward that he had carried it out and then you would have one witness at least who made a positive identification?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2945.918,2953.084,"But whether it was strong enough Your Honor, for the jury without the photographic identification --"
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2953.084,2963.295,"Suppose the government had stopped right there, just put the would-be accomplice, and the lady who was positive about the identification, stopped there."
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2965.748,2967.19,Oh sure!
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2967.19,2969.746,And then if you had a conviction you wouldn’t be here?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2969.746,2980.706,"That’s correct, but what we do not know from our vantage point is whether the jury would have been conducted and that’s our problem."
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2980.706,2985.307,"We never know that is a certainly in a harmless area case, do we?"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,2986.383,2989.822,That’s a judgmental factor that’s correct.
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3063.641,3073.644,"A few moments ago, Mr. Justice White asked you something about a Gilbert violation as contrasted with Wade violation."
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,3076.043,3077.411,"Well, I understood what he asked me."
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3077.411,3082.587,"Perhaps I’d better just ask Justice White some other time, but I did not understand you --[Laughter]"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,3082.587,3085.006,I’m not retired to positive idea either.
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.528,3117.375,"I thought or either one to Gilbert whether there indicated I think the government in this case achieved, not only asked the witness to identify the government courtroom now, but referred to a pretrial identification to which is set that engaged naturally, and that the pretrial identification had been without counsel that then there was an automatic reversal and then a no taint finding would not suffice."
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,3117.375,3118.441,That is correct but then the next question --
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3118.441,3120.863,[Voice overlap]
1972.71-1255,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3120.863,3123.75,On automatic reversal only so we’re not harmless error?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,3123.75,3125.114,But when --
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3125.114,3146.065,"In Wade if the government just has in-court identification and there has been a pretrial identification without counsel, if the government can demonstrate that the in-court identification is independently based and not tainted --"
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3146.065,3146.68,That is right.
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3146.68,3151.242,-- it doesn’t be the absence of counsel won't result in a reversal?
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,3151.242,3161.826,"But, I thought you were also applying that to the Gilbert and the question being whether the in-court identification can come in at a new trial."
1972.71-1255,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3163.897,3186.126,"I thought Mr. Cohn that your argument Mr. Ash was that there was a Gilbert violation because the way that the Ash photograph got into evidence, and if that were so and the principles of Wade and Gilbert applied to photographic identification and then I take it that Gilbert would require a reversal unless there were harmless error."
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,3186.126,3196.817,And we would have a requirement of a new trial and then we’d have the question of whether the in-court identification itself is salvage.
1972.71-1255,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3196.817,3206.036,"Yes, but recalling Gilbert we sent the case back for a new trail unless there were a determination of harmless error, no issue of taint then involved, if there --"
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3206.036,3207.461,If the taint is irrelevant.
1972.71-1255,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3207.461,3207.82,That’s right.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,3207.82,3208.561,"All right, okay."
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3210.451,3225.759,"If you have evidence of the pretrial identification itself, which by hypothesis in Gilbert violated the constitution then even an untainted in-court identification doesn’t correct that constitutional error, I understand that."
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,3225.759,3228.084,There would have to be then a new trial.
1972.71-1255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3228.084,3229.046,Yes and then you’d have a question to which you referred.
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,3229.046,3232.009,"Yes, then you'd have that question, that’s when it is."
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3232.009,3244.313,"Because you -- unless there is a Gilbert violation here, the issue of the applicability in Wade to photographs isn’t here at all --"
1972.71-1255,1,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,3244.313,3244.541,Yes.
1972.71-1255,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3244.541,3249.231,-- if you accepted no taint.
1972.71-1255,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3249.231,3250.946,Thank you Mr. Cohn.
1972.71-1255,2,22634,edward_r_korman,,3251.882,3259.223,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would just want to allude to one or two points."
1972.71-1255,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3400.782,3402.255,Thank you Mr. Korman.
1972.71-1255,3,41166,sherman_l_cohn,,3414.059,3417.725,"Thank you, for the privilege."
