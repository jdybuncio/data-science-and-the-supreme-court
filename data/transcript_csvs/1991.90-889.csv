1991.90-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.309,"We will now here argument in Case No. 90-889, William Sky King v. St. Vincent's Hospital."
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,52.698,57.337,"Mr. Chief Justice, and my it please the Court:"
1991.90-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.317,336.832,No limit?
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,338.972,341.112,"No, Your Honor, none."
1991.90-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.783,348.735,You think... so you say... and he has to be permitted to return?
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,364.759,372.195,--The longest tour of duty that is covered by this section at this time is the 3-year AGR program.
1991.90-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,415.066,421.736,"What if the employer has abolished the position when the person wants to come back, he just no longer has that?"
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,421.736,423.017,Right.
1991.90-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.514,441.994,"I'd like you to tell me what that flows from because I no more see that in the text of this provision than I see any time limit, and I wonder why you're willing to imply the one but not imply the other?"
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,441.994,447.882,"--Well, it says that the employee shall be permitted to return to such employee's position."
1991.90-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.299,460.799,By implication.
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,460.799,467.109,"--Yes, we think it's a tenable reading of that language."
1991.90-889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,515.792,539.985,"Ms. Wax, do you think we owe deference to the most recent Veterans' Reemployment Rights Handbook regulations in this area in light of the very dramatic shifts by the Department of Labor in their view of this statute and its requirements over the years?"
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,539.985,552.762,"Well, Your Honor, this Court has stated in Monroe v. Standard Oil, that the Veterans' Reemployment Handbook is an authoritative source of the interpretation of the act."
1991.90-889,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,601.413,610.285,What... can you explain it to me why is it that the Government says this is not an initial period of active duty for training?
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,610.988,611.488,--Yes.
1991.90-889,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,611.488,612.33,What is it?
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,612.33,617.079,It is active duty for training.
1991.90-889,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,618.968,621.592,And that's different from an initial period of active duty for training?
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,621.592,644.161,"Yes, Your Honor, initial active-duty training, which by statute and regulation lasts 90 days or less... 30 to 90 days, that's covered by Section 2024(c), a separate provision of the act which provide reemployment rights for initial active-duty training."
1991.90-889,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,646.036,650.659,I don't understand that because that says for not less than <twelve> [= 12] consecutive weeks.
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,650.659,657.141,"Excuse me, right, 90 days--"
1991.90-889,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,657.141,658.718,It has to be more than 90--
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,658.718,660.998,"--Excuse me, 3 to 6 months."
1991.90-889,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,692.813,695.313,--This is a new job.
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,703.215,704.465,Right.
1991.90-889,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,704.465,710.337,"And it was longer than 12 weeks, so he's not covered by (c), so (d) clicks in."
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,710.337,712.056,Right.
1991.90-889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,822.37,826.415,"Yes, but under that one, I guess it's under (b)(2), he's got to reapply, doesn't he, for a job?"
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,826.415,827.79,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,827.79,829.602,And here he just shows up and says I want to go to work.
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,829.602,831.726,"Correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,831.726,834.975,"And also, isn't there a difference in their protection from discharge after they get back?"
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,834.975,835.85,Correct.
1991.90-889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.85,844.658,"How does it make sense to say you're protected from discharge under (a) and (b) and you get no protection under (d), when you might be away even longer, as you say?"
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,844.658,845.611,Right.
1991.90-889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.172,890.373,"Yeah, but why should they have to reapply instead of just showing up like these people do?"
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,890.373,891.373,Well--
1991.90-889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.373,893.809,That cuts the other way on that part of it.
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,893.809,918.035,"--On the other hand, probably in exchange for these greater protections, a post-discharge... a post-return discharge protection, a longer period to reapply, the Government... Congress decided to give employers a sort of quid pro quo of leeway to put the person in their old job or in another job, for example."
1991.90-889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,933.404,942.915,"I thought you were going to answer by saying when it was originally drafted, (d) really did just apply to short leaves for training, like not over about 3 months, or so."
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,946.586,948.835,"Your Honor, that's another answer to the question."
1991.90-889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.363,963.221,"As originally drafted, isn't it fair to assume that Congress thought these were all short-durational training leaves?"
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,963.221,971.575,"--Well, at the time it was drafted, the only leaves were the short leaves which are listed in the legislative history, Your Honor."
1991.90-889,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1017.511,1024.867,Were any of those short training leaves at the time the statute was first enacted wholly voluntary in the sense that this one was not?
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1044.937,1047.046,"No, Your Honor."
1991.90-889,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1081.063,1087.889,"That was kind of essential to the status of being a reservist, whereas this particular training assignment is not."
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1089.779,1098.227,"--Well, it's not required of you in order to be in the Reserve, but Your Honor, we don't think anything turns on that."
1991.90-889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1250.635,1268.299,"Ms. Wax, I know it's irrelevant to our decision in the case, but are there any pending efforts in Congress to sort of make these statutes a little more compatible than they are now in the fashion they ask they be interpreted?"
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1268.299,1288.291,"Your Honor, to my knowledge, the Department of Labor and the Department of Defense in the wake of Operation Desert Shield and Storm has attempted to draft a new statute that would rationalize this scheme to some extent."
1991.90-889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1291.431,1300.021,Because it just doesn't fit together the way you would think it would if somebody were looking at the whole problem and trying to draft legislation.
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1300.021,1304.629,"--Well, Your Honor, we don't really agree with that."
1991.90-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1412.257,1439.434,"Ms. Wax, what you said earlier about how accepting the respondent's position would cause National Guard members to be at a disadvantage compared with Federal Reserve members, what provision governing members of the Federal Reserve did you have in mind?"
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1439.434,1452.835,"Federal reservists who serve in the Active Guard Reserve are called under 10 U.S.C. 672(d), which governs active duty on a voluntary basis."
1991.90-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1503.94,1505.456,But is (b) that covers them.
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1505.456,1506.3,Correct.
1991.90-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1508.034,1509.439,"Yes, the Federal."
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1509.439,1509.798,Yes.
1991.90-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1509.798,1514.593,"Which is what I suspected, although I didn't know how you got there."
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1518.874,1520.622,"Four years, Your Honor."
1991.90-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1520.622,1521.012,Yes.
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1521.012,1521.512,But--
1991.90-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1521.512,1536.725,"And you're arguing... I mean, so you argue, gee, the... you know, if you accept the respondent's position, Federal reservists will be treated enormously more favorable than National Guard people."
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1551.002,1553.251,"--Well, actually, they won't in practice, Your Honor."
1991.90-889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1598.984,1599.639,"Let me ask one quick question, just to help me out."
1991.90-889,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1616.178,1622.551,"No, they're training... provisions that govern training duty by National Guards people, I think, as far as I recall, Your Honor."
1991.90-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1622.551,1625.082,"Very well, Ms. Wax."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,1627.502,1632.594,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1682.371,1685.573,Is this somewhere in your brief or in the record?
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,1685.573,1685.899,It is in the Government's brief.
1991.90-889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1685.899,1687.071,In the Government's brief.
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,1687.071,1693.616,It's cited as Army Regulation No. 135-18.
1991.90-889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.229,1725.244,Good point.
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,1725.244,1737.896,"I also point this out to you, that AGR personnel will be ordered to active duty or full-time duty for 3 year periods."
1991.90-889,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1854.364,1859.971,"Well, you'd have to do it, like it or not, under some of the other provisions of Section 2024."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,1859.971,1860.815,Precisely.
1991.90-889,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1914.339,1917.572,Or maybe have a different meaning.
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,1917.572,1924.116,"Different meaning, yes, Justice Kennedy."
1991.90-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2398.846,2405.219,"May I interrupt, Mr. Hopkins, this is kind of a critical part of the whole problem, as I see it."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,2448.888,2450.248,"Your Honor, I respectfully disagree."
1991.90-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2470.319,2471.88,"Well, this is not an appropriation today."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,2471.88,2472.255,--That's right.
1991.90-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2491.637,2505.024,"Well, it says for the purposes of subsection (c) and (d) of this section, full-time training or other full-time duty performed by a member of the National Guard under section... several sections, including 502... is considered active duty for training."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,2516.565,2539.743,"I'm saying, Your Honor, that certainly there was a recognition when 502, or when this 1980 amendment was made, that there was active duty for training under 502(f), and also under these other statutes."
1991.90-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2539.743,2542.288,Let me ask this question a little differently.
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,2551.785,2554.565,Yes.
1991.90-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2554.565,2557.298,Under what section?
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,2557.298,2569.872,"Well, certainly under 2024(d), and then the way I interpret that, he would have been entitled to a leave to attend to summer camps, got to drills--"
1991.90-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2569.872,2570.325,"No, no, no."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,2587.489,2590.441,"--Justice Stevens, I think I understand that."
1991.90-889,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2660.163,2666.036,Then what was the purpose of the amendment that Justice Stevens has been talking about if it was not that?
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,2666.036,2684.248,The purpose of the amendment was to recognize that there was some active duty for training under 502(f).
1991.90-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.954,2734.305,"Is it possible to argue, because that... the 1980 amendment refers to both subsection (c) and (d), did they really intend that he have the rights that were provided for under subsection (c), which would then have a duration limit on it, active duty... and refers to active duty."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,2738.226,2749.206,"I think there some durational limitations, and that's where I draw the source of my argument from is the fact that a 2024(c) does in fact include those durational limitations."
1991.90-889,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2749.206,2772.009,"Mr. Hopkins, I guess the only, for those of us who, you know, believe in words, what you're trying to invite us to hang the difference on, I guess, I think, is the phrase ""leave""... ""leave of absence""."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,2778.506,2778.959,No.
1991.90-889,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2779.334,2781.802,They just say he must be rehired.
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,2803.309,2803.856,--Yes.
1991.90-889,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2803.856,2809.089,"Because you never... a leave of absence, you never leave the employment status, do you?"
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,2810.791,2811.01,That's my opinion.
1991.90-889,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2853.712,2856.133,"He doesn't even have to give notice before he comes back, right?"
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,2864.957,2883.496,And I say that's a clear signal of the intent that you must interpret this statute with the background of the common meaning that Reserves are part-time soldiers and they're full-time workers.
1991.90-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2933.711,2935.007,"Well, I understand all that about the leave of absence."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,2952.017,2988.86,"--Your Honor, in my opinion, to answer that you would need to read the structure of intendment of the Universal Military Training Act, where the idea was so that we could return employees to the work place to create a system whereby we would allow civilians to have an initial period of training, and then we would ask that they participate in these short-term programs after that."
1991.90-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2994.388,2998.434,"Well, that relates to (d), but (c) contemplates longer periods of service."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,2998.434,3001.526,--Contemplates a minimum of 12 weeks.
1991.90-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3001.526,3001.932,Right.
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,3005.51,3026.797,I would respectfully say... and I don't have the citation here not anticipating that question... but I would respectfully say that that concerns a person who initially joins the Reserves who is initially involved in the Reserve program.
1991.90-889,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3042.526,3045.493,"Well, I don't know, maybe I'm reading these wrong."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,3062.721,3067.0,"In my opinion, this person volunteers, but he's then ordered."
1991.90-889,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3069.531,3070.406,That doesn't make the difference?
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,3070.406,3071.17,That's--
1991.90-889,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3071.17,3074.778,"Well, then I don't see why he's not covered by (c) either."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,3081.323,3081.557,--Yes.
1991.90-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3091.881,3096.894,"But under (c), you wouldn't have to give any duty to give him a leave of absence, so your opinion would have been absolutely right."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,3104.22,3104.875,--Yes.
1991.90-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3104.875,3108.561,And then all your language problems in your brief seem to me would be sound.
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,3110.435,3127.945,"Your Honor, we have toyed the issue questions 2024(d), and I'm here to say that it may... I would not be troubled nearly as much if it were 2024(c) as it is 2024(d)."
1991.90-889,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3131.865,3152.31,"--Well, Mr. Hopkins, didn't Ms. Wax tell us that the term (c) is a term of art and doesn't cover this person?"
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,3152.31,3154.87,--Yes.
1991.90-889,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3154.87,3160.884,"Now, I don't enough about Army regulations to know, but was that her explanation?"
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,3160.884,3161.228,Yes.
1991.90-889,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3168.179,3168.741,"Well, you sound like it."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,3169.615,3176.613,"--Quite honestly, the last time I saw any orders was when I was in the Korean conflict, and I hoped then that I never saw another one."
1991.90-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3214.675,3219.189,How long is that initial period typically for the young person you're referring to?
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,3219.189,3223.172,"It's typically, based on my reading, 6 months."
1991.90-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.361,3261.984,"And they wouldn't be covered if they'd been on a weekly program, or one of the regular programs of once a month weekend duty and two weeks, so forth."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,3267.076,3267.622,Yes.
1991.90-889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3270.497,3276.243,It is initial in the sense it's their first period of duty of longer than 12 weeks.
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,3287.115,3294.08,"--Well, I would simply say that I read ""initial"" in the sense that I think it was intended."
1991.90-889,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3311.106,3314.307,"Well, we will see what we can do, but Ms. Wax tells us that that's not permissible."
1991.90-889,1,27258,harry_l_hopkins,,3314.307,3326.286,I would also like to speak to the guidance that the Government claims should come from the handbook.
1991.90-889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3455.125,3457.14,"Thank you, Mr. Hopkins."
1991.90-889,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3460.575,3461.091,"Yes, thank you."
1991.90-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3491.22,3494.64,"But it was changed in 1980, and you rely on the 1980 amendment."
1991.90-889,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3497.39,3499.357,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3521.097,3521.753,What way?
1991.90-889,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3524.003,3524.737,No.
1991.90-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3532.016,3533.218,"No, no."
1991.90-889,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3536.622,3545.37,"--Your Honor, we adhere to our position that ""initial"" is a term of art that refers to a prescribed period of training that everyone has to do."
1991.90-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3545.37,3549.821,"So what you're saying is if we choose to ignore the word ""initial"" you don't mind."
1991.90-889,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3549.821,3553.976,"If you choose to give another meaning to the word ""initial"" we don't mind."
1991.90-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3554.226,3554.695,"No, it's neither of those."
1991.90-889,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3578.418,3585.448,I take it that you think that in fact 2024(f) amended both (c) and (d) essentially.
1991.90-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3585.448,3585.962,"Well, it says so."
1991.90-889,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3596.209,3598.723,"Your Honor, we think that's one plausible interpretation."
1991.90-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3598.723,3608.312,"The whole statute fits together very nicely if you do it that way, because then (d) refers to training of periods less than that specified year, and (c) refers to those longer."
1991.90-889,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3613.701,3616.528,"Your Honor, that's one plausible interpretation."
1991.90-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3624.29,3633.459,"But it was clearly interpreted as... I mean, it was understood obviously from the text and the difference in language, the original draftsmen were dealing with the problem of shorter periods."
1991.90-889,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3633.459,3636.739,"--That's all that existed at the time, yes."
1991.90-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3636.739,3645.734,"Well, if you cover... if he's got some relief under (c), you don't even need to consider (d)."
1991.90-889,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3645.734,3647.093,True.
1991.90-889,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3649.155,3655.153,"Because (d) says if no relief under (c), you get it here."
1991.90-889,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3655.153,3658.793,"--Your Honor, under Justice Stevens' theory, he'd have relief under (c) or (d)."
1991.90-889,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3713.458,3715.161,"Thank you, Ms. Wax."
