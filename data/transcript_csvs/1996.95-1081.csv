1996.95-1081,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.059,"We'll hear argument next in No. 95-1081, Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, Department of Labor."
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,26.329,29.041,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1081,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.596,153.052,"Mr. Salloum, may I get you to... Salloum, may I get you to clarify for me how the employer is injured here?"
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,168.631,195.118,"--If a Burnside action was filed separate and apart from the Longshore Act, the employer would be faced... if the employer sued the 23 asbestos manufacturers directly, the employer would be faced with certain common law defenses in the Burnside tort action, tort indemnity action, that the employer would not be faced in a direct action by the worker against those defendants under the Longshore Act."
1996.95-1081,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,267.726,273.841,"So, you say you might not be made whole or as whole as you would be otherwise."
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,339.285,342.216,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,364.4,391.928,"Well, you know, what you're basically saying is that the rule should kick in once the employer starts making payments, but that's not... it's not consistent with our holding in Estate of Cowart which said a person satisfies the prerequisites attached to the right and thus becomes a person entitled to compensation at the moment the right to recovery is vested, that is, at the time of the injury."
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,391.928,393.268,"Your Honor, that's exactly what we're saying."
1996.95-1081,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,393.268,398.513,But I think we've kind of decided Cowart and relatively recently.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,399.993,401.135,"No, I'm not, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,404.995,417.214,"Well, I would think if we followed Cowart, we would have to say that Mrs. Yates was not entitled or qualified for a benefit until her husband's death."
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,417.214,420.917,"--That I think, Your Honor, is a source of confusion for the Fifth Circuit."
1996.95-1081,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,458.832,470.148,But do you think that Cowart would make Mrs. Yates a person entitled to compensation as soon as he knew he had been exposed to asbestos?
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,470.148,471.359,"I am, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,471.359,472.471,Because they might divorce.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,477.835,479.194,"I think it's very consistent with Cowart, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,533.271,539.956,"Yes, but the question that... I'm still not sure I understand your answer because the question is, when did she become a person entitled to compensation?"
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,539.956,546.131,"Your Honor, she became a person entitled to compensation at the same time that her husband became a person entitled to compensation."
1996.95-1081,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,546.131,548.231,Even if the next day she died.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,548.231,555.037,"Yes, Your Honor, because the prejudice to the employer would not be there if she died."
1996.95-1081,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,558.676,562.91,She would... there would be no prejudice to the employer unless she later became a person entitled to compensation.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,562.91,563.631,"--No, sir."
1996.95-1081,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,579.701,588.907,"No, but supposing she did get a settlement of her contingent claim later on and then she died before he did but she had that money, you know, tucked away."
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,593.432,595.652,"No, that's exactly right, Your Honor, because--"
1996.95-1081,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,595.652,597.902,She wasn't a person entitled to compensation.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,597.902,605.75,"--Well, the purpose... if these questions are asked without consideration to the reason that 33(g) was enacted by Congress--"
1996.95-1081,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,605.75,607.789,You sound like you're arguing the dissent in Cowart.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,607.789,609.56,"--No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,612.522,615.595,"It's a very plain language, strictly literal interpretation."
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,615.595,617.237,--That is the plain language.
1996.95-1081,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,650.407,655.272,"Well, but the operative clause there was again a person entitled to compensation."
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,655.272,672.022,That operative clause I believe was considered by this Court in the context of the addition by Congress in 1984 that they are barred regardless of whether the employer makes the payments or acknowledges liability.
1996.95-1081,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,672.022,676.765,Let me ask you something about the Burnside action or actions like that.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,697.049,699.59,"Your Honor, I believe it would be strictly based on tort indemnity."
1996.95-1081,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,699.59,701.531,--And that's a State law cause of action?
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,701.531,703.351,"It's a State law cause of action, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,707.445,713.499,"In other words, the third party has no duty to make an adequate settlement, no duty that runs to the employer?"
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,716.891,718.732,"That's correct, as I understand it, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,718.732,723.626,There's no breech by entering into a settlement that deprives the employer of--
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,723.626,733.02,I think that representing a third party asbestos manufacturer that settles out from under an employer without that employer's consent runs the risk of paying twice.
1996.95-1081,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,733.02,737.595,"--Well, but if that's true, then the act does have a policing mechanism."
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,739.396,743.679,"Well, but, Your Honor, I believe the policing mechanism would be the Burnside--"
1996.95-1081,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,743.679,745.329,And the policing will be I guess the third party.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,748.572,752.776,--The third party and the worker would be well advised to seek approval.
1996.95-1081,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,754.445,761.38,"Mr. Salloum, I'll ask what may be an embarrassing question but it goes to the reason that I'm not following your argument."
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,805.659,815.444,"--Your Honor, I believe you're absolutely right on the nature of the spousal claim, but I believe that you will see under the Longshore Act that a claim for disability by a worker is purely economic."
1996.95-1081,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,822.51,823.361,I see.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,828.193,828.824,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,828.824,829.305,I see.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,829.305,830.046,That's correct.
1996.95-1081,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,854.61,855.281,All right.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,877.137,879.728,"No, Your Honor, and that's a very important point."
1996.95-1081,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,887.932,890.033,What's your authority for that answer?
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,890.033,897.43,It's section... it's the dependency provision of the Longshore Act that says that it's only the dependents of the worker at the time of his injury--
1996.95-1081,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,897.43,897.96,At the time.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,897.96,899.98,--that are entitled to recover under the Longshore Act.
1996.95-1081,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,943.128,946.151,"But they have to be dependent at both times, don't they?"
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,946.151,947.913,That's correct.
1996.95-1081,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,972.477,973.007,Neither spouse would benefit.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,973.007,973.818,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,973.818,987.898,"Now, is your answer or is the dispositive character of your answer affected by the fact that the claim against the third party is not or need not be purely economic?"
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,999.255,1000.216,That's exactly right.
1996.95-1081,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1000.216,1003.84,"Whereas if the spouse later brings one, it would be limited to economic."
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1013.383,1030.436,"You know, last night, Your Honor, I was thinking about that, and looking at the purpose for which that statute is there, that same thought occurred to me because Congress could well... Congress speaks in terms of 933(a) which says a person entitled to compensation need not elect his remedy."
1996.95-1081,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1045.156,1052.88,"But if the entitlement refers to, in effect, a general tort law entitlement, then your argument would fail, wouldn't it?"
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1052.88,1054.691,"Well, no, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1078.337,1092.517,"Well, that's right, but if entitlement to compensation is really... or if the entitlement that the statute speaks of is making reference to the tort liability, then there would be no entitlement on the part of the spouse prior to the death of the harbor worker."
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1097.139,1100.892,"Well, I'm really... I'm not sure I follow you, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1104.025,1105.303,"Well, you said you were thinking the same thing--"
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1105.303,1111.418,"--Well, I was thinking the same thing in the context that a person entitled to compensation... I think Congress was looking at it in the context--"
1996.95-1081,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1111.418,1120.434,"--You don't mean... when you refer to the person entitled to compensation, you mean just compensation under the act, not compensation in a tort action."
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1122.207,1131.831,"--Well, I mean the section 933(g) speaks in terms of a person entitled to compensation having to comply with the employer approval requirement."
1996.95-1081,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1131.831,1133.523,"I know, but what does a person entitled to compensation mean?"
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1139.478,1141.669,It means a person entitled to compensation under the act.
1996.95-1081,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1141.669,1151.806,"I think that's clear, isn't it, from 933(a) which says... which distinguishes between compensation and damages?"
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1158.369,1160.211,"It is clear, Your Honor, and you're correct."
1996.95-1081,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1171.748,1177.522,"Can I ask you a couple of technical, very general questions that are... probably have a clear answer?"
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1198.737,1199.576,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1200.557,1201.368,Thank you.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1247.877,1248.558,"--No, sir."
1996.95-1081,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1248.558,1250.05,Or is that your answer to Justice O'Connor?
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1250.05,1250.58,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1250.58,1250.93,"Okay, I got that one."
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1296.54,1297.221,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1297.221,1299.733,And you're saying your view is there's no way of drawing a line short of that.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1312.131,1314.172,That was the dissent in Cowart.
1996.95-1081,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1314.172,1314.592,Yes.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1314.592,1315.343,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1315.343,1319.334,"And once you're past that position, once you're saying that's no good anymore, then it must encompass anybody who's hurt--"
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1319.334,1320.446,It must encompass--
1996.95-1081,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1320.446,1323.989,"--working for you I mean, you know, who might eventually be entitled to compensation."
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1323.989,1347.324,"--If the purpose of section 33 is to be accepted by this Court, 33(g) would apply to every worker and those claiming through that worker who file a claim for compensation under the Longshore Act, if they settle for less than the compensation they're entitled third party without the consent of the employer, they come within the requirements and allegations of section 33(g)."
1996.95-1081,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1347.324,1359.751,"Mr. Salloum, your petition for certiorari presented two questions, and the second of them was, does the Director of the Office of Workmen's Compensation Programs have standing to respond in the court of appeals in opposition to a private party?"
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1361.583,1362.662,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.013,1364.575,"Before you do, could I ask one other question?"
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1364.575,1364.896,Sure.
1996.95-1081,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.896,1378.093,"In a pre... when the wife settles before the husband dies and asks for approval of the settlement, how does... how do you decide whether she must ask for approval?"
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1381.526,1383.169,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1383.169,1389.59,How can you say that she's entitled to anything more than zero at that time when she asks for the settlement to be approved?
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1389.59,1391.102,"Well... I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1996.95-1081,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1391.102,1397.086,"I mean, how... what is the standard by which you know the duty to ask for approval of the settlement arises?"
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1398.696,1412.607,"Well, if it... the effect would be the same if it's... I guess the criteria would be based upon her age, her husband's age, his average weekly wage, other factors that enter into the compensation liability for both the husband and the wife."
1996.95-1081,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1421.851,1423.213,Even to... even as to the wife.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1423.213,1424.435,Even as to the wife.
1996.95-1081,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1440.614,1444.076,But the difference is that the wife gets less than the husband?
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1444.076,1446.348,"Yes, depending on the number of children that there are."
1996.95-1081,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1447.239,1451.5,What if she's... it seems to me there are variables in there.
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1454.114,1454.773,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1454.773,1463.79,"But I'm very much puzzled by that, exactly what is the standard that determines her duty to seek approval of a settlement that arguably is less than she might become entitled to."
1996.95-1081,0,40560,richard_p_salloum,,1463.79,1464.21,Yes.
1996.95-1081,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1528.801,1530.363,"Very well, Mr. Salloum."
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1531.683,1535.827,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1081,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1561.763,1582.406,"Ms. Brinkmann, just last week we had a case involving the word employee in which the Government was arguing that the word employee sometimes in the statute can mean current employees and sometimes can mean current or past employees."
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1604.512,1615.648,"Well, Your Honor, we believe that in this particular case, when you look at the structure of 33(g), there are many reasons why this cannot be interpreted to someone who has a potential entitlement."
1996.95-1081,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1643.926,1647.088,And will the timing of his death affect the amount of her entitlement?
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1647.088,1648.09,Yes.
1996.95-1081,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1648.44,1650.47,Which is what I think Justice Stevens was getting at.
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1651.461,1652.393,--Exactly.
1996.95-1081,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1674.477,1680.611,"Ms. Brinkmann, if we said, or may be entitled to compensation, she would fit in that category."
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1705.097,1711.182,"--Actually, the widow... the wife does not have to be dependent in fact if she's married and living with--"
1996.95-1081,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1711.182,1713.763,"Yes, but she does have to be the wife at that time."
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1713.763,1714.474,--That's correct.
1996.95-1081,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1714.474,1720.479,"So, we know all... the entire universe of people who may be entitled we know at the time of injury."
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1720.479,1721.767,"No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1742.082,1743.822,Wage earning.
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1743.822,1748.447,--wage earning... thank you... capacity does that person become entitled to compensation.
1996.95-1081,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1759.002,1767.409,I was just making the point that we're talking about derivative liability and all the people who are derivative of the worker are known.
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1776.614,1782.868,"--At the time of death, you would be able to tell whether or not she was the spouse at the time of death."
1996.95-1081,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1782.868,1789.393,And the children presumably are not beneficiaries if they have reached majority at the time of death?
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1789.393,1790.364,That's correct.
1996.95-1081,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1790.364,1798.72,"So, you wouldn't know at the time of exposure to asbestos whether the children would ever be eligible."
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1799.681,1800.9,"I believe that's right, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1801.881,1802.372,Excuse me.
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1803.44,1803.971,--Yes.
1996.95-1081,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1803.971,1804.362,May I?
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1817.78,1820.204,"Yes, I believe so if that is the fact at the time of death."
1996.95-1081,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1820.204,1825.537,But then you wouldn't know... you wouldn't be able to identify the universe of people later entitled to compensation even at the time of injury.
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1825.537,1826.148,That's correct.
1996.95-1081,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1886.024,1887.967,Why is it that she could?
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1903.436,1904.708,"Yes, under that--"
1996.95-1081,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1904.708,1911.824,"Why is she entitled to that, whereas the worker who... let's say the ordinary case."
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1954.912,1961.095,"--Your Honor, I think if I'm understanding you correctly, my answer is that the person entitled to compensation does recover."
1996.95-1081,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1967.329,1977.525,"So, everyone whom... if an employer refuses to sign, the employer has to pay the full amount of compensation anyway."
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1977.525,1981.197,"Yes, they have to pay the compensation that the person is entitled to under the act."
1996.95-1081,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1981.197,1986.791,"Anyway, and that's with an ordinary worker who is hurt and they're paying out paychecks... paying out compensation checks."
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1986.791,1987.572,Based on disability.
1996.95-1081,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1987.572,1988.884,Based on disability.
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1997.33,2001.692,"There are many other choices, as people have already mentioned."
1996.95-1081,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2037.475,2039.486,Can I ask you one final question and that is this.
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2080.752,2083.293,Mrs. Yates may never have gotten benefits.
1996.95-1081,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2102.306,2102.927,What harm is done?
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2106.181,2106.912,She--
1996.95-1081,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2106.912,2116.826,The only harm I can see that's being done is that you're requiring her to go to the employer whereas in some situations that will be a vain act because she won't end up being the widow.
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2120.95,2129.304,"--It's part of the problem I think, Your Honor, with what Congress looked at when they eventually decided to not require workers to elect remedies anymore."
1996.95-1081,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2149.558,2151.849,Then I didn't understand your answer to my question.
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2175.243,2182.379,"A person who's entitled to compensation would be because they have an entitlement, but if she is not yet entitled, she cannot go and file a claim, no."
1996.95-1081,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2186.753,2194.938,"You know, that position is inconsistent, is it not, with the rule that was promulgated after the '84 amendments?"
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2203.304,2205.154,"--No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2226.278,2227.78,At the time of the injury.
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2227.78,2232.342,--That doesn't mean that the person... Mrs. Yates' entitlement to compensation vested at that time.
1996.95-1081,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2236.646,2264.122,"Is it clear that if we rule, as you suggest, and the wife in this case is not a person entitled to compensation at the time she makes the settlement... is it true that when she does become a person entitled to compensation and brings a suit against the employer, that the employer cannot offset under 33(f)?"
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2267.956,2271.609,"You don't have to decide that, Your Honor, and we do think that that's an open question."
1996.95-1081,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2280.865,2282.745,But I was talking about offset for the previous--
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2282.745,2283.586,--Yes.
1996.95-1081,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2288.539,2290.269,--But you did take a position in your brief on it.
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2294.082,2295.113,"--Yes, Your Honor, we did."
1996.95-1081,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2298.804,2301.268,Let me ask you a very simpleminded question.
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2327.054,2339.272,"I think that it would be reasonable for Congress to have distinguished between someone who already has a vested right to compensation, a known alternative remedy, vis-a-vis a person who only has a potential, perhaps entitlement at a later point in time."
1996.95-1081,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2403.574,2407.798,"That's simply a procedural rule, isn't it, almost a pro forma type of rule?"
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2407.798,2409.518,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2410.64,2412.88,Why would that control the outcome of something like this?
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2412.88,2424.928,"--Because Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 15 addresses specifically the situation where courts of appeals are reviewing agency actions, and that rule envisioned that someone from that agency would be in the court of appeals as a party respondent."
1996.95-1081,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2428.371,2439.978,"Well, do you think that, say, the rules... a rule could confer standing on a respondent party such as the Director here even though Congress had not... had indicated not?"
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2439.978,2440.928,"--It's not standing, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2455.897,2457.379,Excuse me.
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2460.051,2467.815,"--Under... in the district court, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, there are different provisions... situations--"
1996.95-1081,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2467.815,2469.438,Surely you can't intervene in a suit unless you have standing.
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2469.438,2473.989,"--I guess it depends on how you describe standing, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2486.057,2489.581,You don't think Article III standing is required for... on the part of the intervenor?
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2489.581,2492.742,"--I think under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it depends."
1996.95-1081,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2499.127,2504.71,"Well, surely the Rules of Civil Procedure can't confer standing in the face of the Article III requirement."
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2504.71,2506.571,"--We agree with that, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2533.689,2536.651,"Well, what about the Newport News case?"
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2539.652,2547.347,Newport News addressed the question of whether or not within the statutory definition of a person adversely affected or aggrieved.
1996.95-1081,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2562.297,2568.531,"Is the Tax Court... when we get cases that originated in the Tax Court, is the Tax Court a party before us?"
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2568.531,2569.723,I don't--
1996.95-1081,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2569.723,2572.906,"I mean, surely it's different when the agency is set up as an adjudicator."
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2585.531,2590.587,"--Your Honor, we believe that the board, for example, would not be an appropriate party for that very reason."
1996.95-1081,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.145,2611.071,"But it is the decree of the board... of... it is not the decree of the Labor Department, is it--"
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2611.071,2611.979,No.
1996.95-1081,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.979,2614.373,--that entitles this person to compensation?
1996.95-1081,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2616.112,2633.854,"Under section 921(c), Your Honor, the Longshore Act itself makes clear that the court of appeals under that provision, once the Benefits Review Board opinion is petitioned to the court of appeals, the court of appeals has the authority and power to modify, reverse, to act on that board's opinion."
1996.95-1081,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2661.513,2662.995,"Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann."
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,2665.506,2678.266,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1081,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2703.964,2707.587,But judicial inquiry is warranted as to what the statute says I take it.
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,2707.587,2712.991,"--Yes, sir, but interpretation beyond the clear meaning of the statute is what I'm referring to."
1996.95-1081,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2770.427,2779.422,"Mr. Wynn... Mr. Clark, one thing I think perhaps you can teach us, although if you think it's not relevant, let us know."
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,2796.684,2807.022,"--With respect to the pre-death settlements, all parties were then operating under the Dorsey and O'Leary cases out of the Benefits Review Board, and they're cited in Cowart."
1996.95-1081,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2824.483,2827.725,All of these settlements were... I thought... then I'm confused.
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,2841.454,2850.769,"--Yes, but they're still under the category of pre-death settlements, settlements made during the lifetime of Mr. Cowart, the traumatically injured worker... excuse me... occupationally injured worker."
1996.95-1081,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2850.769,2855.743,"Yes, but there were... none of the settlements were approved although--"
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,2855.743,2857.755,None of the pre-death settlements were approved.
1996.95-1081,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2857.755,2865.278,"--Yes, although some of those settlements postdated the time when the worker himself began to receive benefits."
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,2865.278,2865.929,That's correct.
1996.95-1081,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2865.929,2867.97,And no approval was sought for those.
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,2867.97,2870.502,"No approval was sought, and may I add that no--"
1996.95-1081,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2870.502,2871.093,Why not?
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,2871.093,2892.818,"--No approval was required, and it's right there in the petitioners' appendix to the petition for certiorari, pages 49 and 48 and 62 and 63, is because 33(g)(1) only applies when the, quote, person entitled to compensation, end of quote, settles for an amount less than the compensation to which he was entitled."
1996.95-1081,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2940.87,2945.552,You have to make that evaluation at the time that the settlement is entered into.
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,2961.463,2967.317,"--Justice Scalia, you look at the time of the settlement under Cowart to determine person entitled to compensation status."
1996.95-1081,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2968.857,2969.398,Yes.
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,2969.398,2982.545,"--To determine actuarial for the claim that Mrs. Yates is advancing, which is a mix and match approach for the petitioners, you do it after the husband has died and she at that time files a claim for compensation."
1996.95-1081,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2982.545,2984.078,I hope we're talking about the same thing.
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,2992.572,2997.174,You look at it when the person entitled to compensation makes a third party settlement.
1996.95-1081,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2997.174,2998.225,At the time of the settlement.
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,3000.208,3000.617,"Correct, yes, sir."
1996.95-1081,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3008.043,3017.069,What happens if your actuarial calculations are wrong and the employer is in fact liable for more than what the settlement was?
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,3018.569,3028.495,"--Well, he... both the party... the actuarial determination would have to be made by the administrative judge in the formal hearing and if either party... yes, they can appeal."
1996.95-1081,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3028.495,3029.156,"No, no."
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,3044.345,3044.625,Yes.
1996.95-1081,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3044.625,3045.707,The risk is on the employer.
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,3045.707,3046.177,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-1081,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3046.177,3053.752,"Why... if there had never been a settlement, she was... would have been entitled to compensation under some provision of the act other than 933(f)."
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,3054.042,3056.165,I don't I think I follow your question.
1996.95-1081,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3056.165,3064.3,"If there had never been any settlement at all, there never was a settlement offer, your client would have been entitled to compensation under the act, but not 933, some other provisions of the act."
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,3064.3,3071.212,My client would have been entitled to compensation under section 9 of the Longshore Act for death benefits.
1996.95-1081,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3071.212,3073.706,"Yes, but not 933(f), some other thing."
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,3073.706,3074.154,"Of course, not."
1996.95-1081,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3074.154,3074.936,"Yes, of course, not."
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,3074.936,3075.376,Yes.
1996.95-1081,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3075.376,3077.567,"Now, if there is a settlement and it requires approval--"
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,3077.567,3078.439,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-1081,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3078.439,3079.4,--and she didn't get it.
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,3079.4,3080.118,It requires--
1996.95-1081,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3080.118,3081.04,Suppose it did.
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,3082.211,3083.321,--May I be precise?
1996.95-1081,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3087.134,3087.825,"Yes, correct."
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,3087.825,3088.436,--for which she--
1996.95-1081,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3088.436,3090.407,Suppose that applied and she didn't get it.
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,3118.323,3135.507,"--I believe the shorthand answer to that is, one is that section 33(g)(2) says that failure to obtain a prior written consent from the employer and carrier terminates or forfeits your rights to compensation and medical benefits."
1996.95-1081,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3144.951,3145.782,Thank you.
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,3145.782,3147.014,Basically in the dissent.
1996.95-1081,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3205.591,3211.305,That can be figured out actuarially just as when he is going to die can be figured out actuarially.
1996.95-1081,2,44172,wynn_e_clark,,3215.118,3215.637,"Yes, sir, you could."
1996.95-1081,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3239.382,3240.624,"Thank you, Mr. Clark."
1996.95-1081,3,40560,richard_p_salloum,,3243.436,3246.939,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1081,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3248.338,3255.705,"Mr. Salloum, Mrs. Brinkmann gave a different answer to the question about is... who is a potentially qualifying widow."
1996.95-1081,3,40560,richard_p_salloum,,3262.069,3263.489,"--Your Honor, that's the first thing I was going to address."
1996.95-1081,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3307.068,3309.64,"Of course, that was the rule for 12 years prior to Cowart, wasn't it?"
1996.95-1081,3,40560,richard_p_salloum,,3309.64,3310.96,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1996.95-1081,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3310.96,3316.163,"That was the rule that was generally applied for 12 years prior to Cowart, wasn't it, by the Benefit Review Board?"
1996.95-1081,3,40560,richard_p_salloum,,3316.163,3317.815,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3358.221,3360.541,Why can't the employer just say no?
1996.95-1081,3,40560,richard_p_salloum,,3365.276,3366.987,"No, that's not correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3372.379,3376.483,"That... if the employer says, no, I won't approve the settlement, the employer has to pay the whole thing."

1996.95-1081,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3376.984,3377.445,Okay.
1996.95-1081,3,40560,richard_p_salloum,,3384.678,3385.78,"That's not correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1081,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3385.78,3388.301,"If the employer says, no, she gets ordinary compensation."
