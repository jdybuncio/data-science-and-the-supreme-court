2010.09-1343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.689,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1343, J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,10.872,13.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,35.839,43.659,"When you say ""its distributor"", was this distributor at all controlled by the defendant?"
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,43.659,44.695,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,67.858,74.797,"It might be better to refer to it as the company that distributed its product, rather than calling it ""its distributor""."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,74.797,75.864,"Very good, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,75.864,76.814,"It's loaded, it seems to me."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,76.814,77.666,"Very good, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,77.666,84.653,"Mr. Fergenson, in your question presented to this Court, you asked whether there's personal jurisdiction -- and I'm quoting here --"
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,102.914,109.185,"Your Honor, that's what the New Jersey Supreme Court held, and that's how we fashioned the--"
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,109.185,110.303,That's your question presented--
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,110.303,110.753,--the test.
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,110.753,116.291,"--Did this -- well, I'll just ask you, then: Did this manufacturer target the United States market?"
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,119.993,120.693,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,120.693,121.309,Okay.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,136.003,136.705,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,136.705,139.822,It only wanted to sell its product in a few States?
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,139.822,140.656,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,147.076,147.476,"Right, anywhere."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,160.953,166.974,"As many as possible, wherever the distributor could find a customer, yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,166.974,167.39,Exactly.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,174.711,175.163,Well--
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,175.163,177.546,You targeted the entire United States?
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,181.733,192.791,"--Well, Your Honor, because, first, this Court's jurisprudence looks to a direct act from World-Wide Volkswagen and even before, as it brought forward Hanson."
2010.09-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.932,212.003,"Mr. Fergenson, I suppose you could say the same thing about any United States manufacturer--"
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,212.003,212.836,Yes.
2010.09-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,212.836,216.74,--who would desire to sell his product in any of the States that would buy it?
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,216.74,217.94,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,217.94,227.262,And to say that this foreign manufacturer is therefore suable in any State would mean that any American manufacturer is suable in any State?
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,227.262,227.978,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.978,229.63,None of our cases hold--
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,229.63,231.582,"Well, suable in any State where the incident arises."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,272.207,283.932,"Well, Your Honor, in Burger King, in Hanson, in World-Wide Volkswagen, the purposeful availment is defined as conducting activities within the forum State."
2010.09-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,294.74,303.428,In all of those cases there was a forum in the United States where someone injured in the United States could sue.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,342.554,343.254,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,343.254,343.92,Which one?
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,343.92,344.838,Ohio.
2010.09-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,348.457,350.742,It could be reached in Ohio.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,389.283,402.441,"Well, Your Honor, first, the issue of convenience, choice of law, conflict of law, as a determinative factor was rejected by this Court."
2010.09-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,402.441,406.81,I'm asking you the question: Where can it be sued?
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,421.47,430.527,"Well, Your Honor, under Ohio law, the -- there can be an assignment."
2010.09-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,441.133,442.668,I don't understand.
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,442.668,455.476,"Mr. Fergenson, just picking up where Justice Ginsburg left off, Ohio is a perfectly good place for jurisdiction over a claim between the British manufacturer and its distributor in Ohio."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,484.995,503.206,"Well, Your Honor, Ohio explicitly provides, and they are -- it's arisen in statute of limitation cases, and it goes back to Travelers Indemnity v. Trowbridge, that an action under both express and common law indemnity arises under contract."
2010.09-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,518.382,520.834,What kind of common law indemnity are we dealing with here?
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,543.866,545.649,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
2010.09-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,557.424,563.245,"No, I would just like to know first -- you said there is jurisdiction in Ohio and not in New Jersey."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,586.61,590.597,Ohio has New Jersey -- jurisdiction.
2010.09-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,614.011,614.644,It's a forum what?
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,614.644,617.713,"--That's a convenience issue, a forum non conveniens."
2010.09-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,639.042,640.828,And the claim in suit.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,642.594,646.232,"--And -- and the cause of action, yes."
2010.09-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,665.944,673.049,"I still don't follow how Mr. Nicastro gets involved with assignment, indemnity."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,728.886,731.036,"It -- Your Honor, it is."
2010.09-1343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,750.8,760.238,"Your answer to Justice Ginsburg -- I don't want to make your argument for you, but it seems to me all of a sudden you're talking about how Ohio law will help you out."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,782.167,784.686,"I agree, Your Honor; it is choice of law."
2010.09-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.686,791.84,"--Also, I don't think it's worth your time, because frankly it doesn't make a whole lot of difference to me whether they can sue in Ohio or not."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,793.375,795.292,"And, Your Honor--"
2010.09-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.292,796.911,--What about in the United States?
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,799.029,801.731,"--No, because--"
2010.09-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.731,803.165,The United States would not?
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,806.017,825.263,"--Well, Your Honor, in the -- in Justice O'Connor's footnote on national contacts in Asahi, which was not disputed and I think essentially accepted by Justice Brennan, in that footnote it states that national contacts is for the national sovereign to decide."
2010.09-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,825.263,825.929,That's right.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,844.475,853.747,"This Court has not evaluated under the Fifth Amendment what circumstances it may be, and this is speculation, how Congress would establish it."
2010.09-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,855.116,855.583,Of course.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,856.449,856.949,"--Yes, sir."
2010.09-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,857.433,859.235,Hypotheticals are always speculation.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,859.235,860.201,I think that--
2010.09-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,860.201,861.687,How do you speculate about that?
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,861.687,875.779,"--Your Honor, I think that, without Klaxon and with a reasonable choice of venue, Congress could establish a uniform system to bring -- to bring foreign defendants into this country."
2010.09-1343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,875.779,891.456,"Would you say the same thing if, hypothetically, since we're engaging in a hypothetical, the distributor were in France, machine manufactured in England, distributor is in France, and the distributor then selects the United States and then the same facts, New Jersey?"
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,897.074,899.693,"I think that, with that one step--"
2010.09-1343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,899.693,902.645,Assuming the statute that Justice Scalia hypothesizes.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,902.645,903.078,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,905.328,923.206,"It's a little odd that the States, which have residual sovereignty, which are not limited sovereigns, would not have jurisdiction, but the United States, which is a limited sovereignty other than in the foreign affairs area, which may be relevant here, does have jurisdiction."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,924.658,943.953,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that if one looks at this as part of the Congress's power to control, let's say, imports, then as a condition -- and this is what the proposed Foreign Manufacturer's Legal Accountability Act--"
2010.09-1343,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,943.953,951.642,"Well, Congress has power to control the jurisdiction of Federal courts, and Congress says Federal courts have jurisdiction over this matter."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,951.642,952.675,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,952.675,955.094,"Mr. Fergenson, could I try another hypothetical?"
2010.09-1343,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,955.094,960.748,But the question is why the State can't make the same choice that the Congress does.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,972.722,993.136,"Well, Your Honor, I think -- and I go to two words in particular in Burger King, one taken from Hanson, which is essential -- it is essential in each case that there be a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum; and then the other--"
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,993.136,1000.992,"But, Mr. Fergenson, the question is whether seeking to serve a market -- and here you're seeking to serve a market in each of the 50 States -- is purposeful availment."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1033.129,1033.913,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1033.913,1039.7,"There is jurisdiction in Illinois, even though your relationship with your distributor was in Ohio."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1045.771,1053.008,Because there was a direction of the distributor to go into the State where the accident occurred.
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1053.008,1053.341,Okay.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1079.758,1084.646,"If the -- yes, Your Honor, if the states are assigned by name."
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1084.646,1085.979,And now I say: Let's forget these ten distributors.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1090.716,1104.976,"Because that distributor -- unless that distributor is told, you must go, like a traveling salesperson, you must go into each State, you must personally go into each State -- that's purposeful availment."
2010.09-1343,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1104.976,1112.063,"Mr. Fergenson, with respect, this distributor was told to sell as many products as it could in as many States as it could."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1112.063,1113.213,"No, it was not, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1121.069,1121.469,"Excuse me, counselor."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1150.754,1151.754,--Yes.
2010.09-1343,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1151.754,1152.237,I know there's a--
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1152.237,1152.987,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1152.987,1157.341,--And you approved all marketing efforts.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1166.197,1167.83,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1214.161,1219.732,--Then why was your number and name both printed on the machine and in the warranty book?
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1229.957,1235.158,"And, Your Honor, the record shows that we were sued in Kentucky, we were sued in Massachusetts."
2010.09-1343,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1243.764,1245.716,I think you've begged my question.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1245.716,1246.766,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1246.766,1248.834,You did travel to certain of the trade shows--
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1248.834,1249.268,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1249.268,1250.101,--with the America company?
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1250.101,1250.401,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1250.401,1255.488,You did make suggestions with respect to advertising?
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1262.844,1274.033,The -- the company that distributed the products stated in a letter that we conformed our advertising to what you suggested.
2010.09-1343,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1274.033,1274.985,Okay.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1299.267,1300.734,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1300.734,1301.086,--and has caused injury?
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1301.086,1301.919,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1336.559,1338.059,Right.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1338.392,1338.959,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1338.959,1353.937,"--Now, first, the word ""distributor"" hurts, so I'm going to take that out, and I imagine a hypothetical -- I know your case differs from that, but I'm going to ask them how it differs, not you, okay?"
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1427.367,1471.146,"Your Honor, I believe that the -- that the principles of law as stated, because they're law and they're applied in each case, it could -- which you apply to the facts, I believe that the rejection of the convenience test by this Court in World-Wide Volkswagen, Savchuk, and in Shaffer, where Justice Brennan posited that there be a convenience test, that those--"
2010.09-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1471.146,1472.598,I don't know what a convenience test is.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1513.508,1516.158,"--I believe that that conflicts, Your Honor, with Asahi."
2010.09-1343,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1516.158,1517.793,"Asahi, okay."
2010.09-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1517.793,1535.755,"Asahi -- Asahi, Mr. Fergenson, was a litigation between a Japanese component part manufacturer and a Taiwanese finished product manufacturer."
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1607.803,1622.979,"Your Honor, I would have to look at -- and -- and the answer would not be, off the cuff, the same."
2010.09-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1649.63,1652.248,You -- you made a point about the trusted legal system.
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1664.64,1665.84,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1689.205,1689.605,Those that--
2010.09-1343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1689.605,1692.707,"Perhaps you would like to reserve some of your time for rebuttal, counsel?"
2010.09-1343,0,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,1692.707,1693.373,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1693.607,1694.107,Thank you.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1702.063,1704.515,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1712.685,1722.309,"What if he said: We want to do that, but we don't like New Jersey, so don't sell our products in New Jersey, and the Ohio company nonetheless does so?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1725.928,1735.034,"I would say under those circumstances, yes, because the purpose that -- this particular manufacturer purposefully availed themselves of the entire U.S. market."
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1735.034,1740.854,"But he said: But I have no intention of selling in New Jersey, I'm afraid I might get sued there and I don't want to get sued there."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1748.775,1751.746,"So every State with the exception of New Jersey, is that the hypothetical, Your Honor?"
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1751.746,1752.446,Yes.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1752.446,1755.447,"Then I would say under those circumstances, yes, New Jersey would be excluded."
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1755.447,1757.08,"Oh, it would be excluded?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1757.08,1757.447,Yes.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1758.365,1762.351,So it depends on the intent of the manufacturer?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1762.351,1765.886,"--I think it's the intent and the additional conduct of the manufacturer, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.909,1792.621,"What if a manufacturer tells a distributor, you have international distribution authority, you can sell my machine anywhere in the world, sell as many as you can anywhere in the world; that would include the United States, right?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1792.621,1793.573,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1793.573,1795.505,And therefore it would include New Jersey?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1795.505,1800.142,"Under those circumstances, of course, which are different from our case, it would seem to me--"
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1800.142,1801.342,I know; it's a hypothetical.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1801.342,1803.011,"--Of course, of course."
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.283,1814.0,It would include New Jersey.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1814.0,1814.75,"--Yes, it would."
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1814.75,1818.687,Purposeful availment of the government of New Jersey?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1818.687,1822.056,I would say the manufacturer has to take some additional conduct.
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1822.056,1824.59,"I mean, availment doesn't mean much if that's all it means."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1824.59,1825.107,"Well, if--"
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.107,1829.661,You tell somebody distribute in the world and you are availing yourself of the government of New Jersey?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1829.661,1833.113,"--If there is purposeful availment and additional conduct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1835.648,1836.215,Additional conduct?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1836.215,1837.232,Correct.
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1837.232,1840.017,"What I have written down in my notes, which you can add to--"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1840.017,1840.434,Sure.
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1840.434,1843.219,--is that there are three things that happened.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1901.758,1902.875,"You do, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1902.875,1903.542,I do.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1955.225,1957.094,I would say--
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1957.094,1959.111,"Now, that's my basic concern here."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,1959.111,1981.46,"--I would say in -- in response to your hypothetical question, that because there was purposeful availment where they came to the United States, attended trade shows in an effort to sell their product to anyone who would come to that trade show throughout the United States, and those sales were in fact consummated, then in that case I think that the manufacturer has done more than just intend to sell."
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1983.162,1983.529,Yes.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2012.395,2012.879,I understand.
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2012.879,2013.529,All right.
2010.09-1343,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2013.529,2014.245,What is--
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2014.245,2017.097,Maybe you could respond to Justice Breyer's--
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2017.097,2017.431,Yes.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2017.431,2024.786,"In -- in my judgment, it's not enough to just have intent, it's not enough just to send the product out on, adrift on the stream of commerce."
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2029.071,2029.523,Trade shows.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2029.523,2034.475,"--in your hypothetical, attending the trade shows, perhaps hiring a distributor, selling the products--"
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2034.475,2036.094,"Well, that's the same as the first; that's the sale."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2036.094,2036.61,--That's right.
2010.09-1343,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2040.062,2061.912,"Mr. Ross, do you think if there's a small business in the United States that sells a product and that actively seeks to serve a foreign market, maybe it's Great Britain, maybe it's China, and that product blows up in that foreign country -- Great Britain, China -- do you think that the manufacturer, the American manufacturer is subject to jurisdiction there?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2061.912,2063.795,Yes.
2010.09-1343,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2068.565,2070.265,All -- all over the world this is true; is that right?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2070.265,2070.767,--Yes.
2010.09-1343,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2071.267,2078.171,And it is the jurisdictional rule that civil law systems have always had?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2078.171,2079.087,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2079.587,2105.321,"But -- and I assume that if we do this to a company in England, any country in the world, and we say that this satisfies due process, we would have to honor a judgment from Bangladesh based upon -- against an American company, based upon a similarly modest degree of -- of availment, right?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2105.321,2109.642,"--Well, Your Honor, it depends on the extent of the availment, I would say, under those circumstances."
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.642,2113.677,"Just as -- just as modest as what you propose here, or as extensive."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2117.812,2119.248,It seems to me -- if there's--
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.248,2123.45,"But the same kind of contact in India, which has different -- different states in India."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2128.37,2128.754,--All right.
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2128.754,2145.731,And we would have to honor a judgment by a court of Madras against an American manufacturer who had as little contact with Madras as exists here.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2145.731,2148.017,I would say under -- yes.
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2148.017,2148.7,We would have to?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2148.7,2149.283,"Yes, I would say."
2010.09-1343,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2149.283,2151.219,"Mr. Ross, we do that now; isn't that right?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2151.219,2152.469,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2152.469,2152.819,We do?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2160.741,2161.908,That's a slightly--
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2161.908,2169.597,"--and then that manufacturer, that potter in West Virginia, now has to go to wherever he ends up -- wherever that pot ends up?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2169.597,2173.349,"--That's a slightly different scenario in my judgment, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2173.349,2173.899,Ah.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2173.899,2176.501,--because the distributor came to the manufacturer.
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2179.12,2180.072,We turn it on that?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2200.283,2201.068,--I understand that.
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2201.068,2202.818,I want to -- you've thought about it more than I.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2203.101,2203.484,I understand that.
2010.09-1343,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2203.484,2205.77,Can we go back to Justice Scalia's question?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2211.174,2211.84,I think--
2010.09-1343,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2211.84,2215.626,--if there is a -- a proper jurisdictional basis.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2215.626,2216.694,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2216.694,2223.147,"We do, and we would like you to recognize ours, and we don't get that reciprocity, but we are still trying to get it."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2231.837,2233.622,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2233.622,2243.145,"That's true when there is a proper jurisdictional basis, which is what we're talking about here: What does the United States mean when it says there is a proper jurisdictional basis?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2252.084,2268.343,"Well, Your Honor, if the corporation, the manufacturer is purposely availing itself of the Madras market and hires a distributor to go to Madras and to sell its products, then indeed I don't see why a court in Madras would not have -- and the product explodes or causes some horrific--"
2010.09-1343,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2268.343,2287.674,"--To it really, to you -- are you saying that Justice Breyer's hypothetical creates jurisdiction, that the mere sale to a distributor anywhere creates jurisdiction, wherever that distributor is marketing the manufacturer's product?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2301.215,2303.85,--My position is exactly what Your Honor has just stated.
2010.09-1343,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2312.17,2316.907,What -- what difference does attending some trade shows in the United States mean -- make?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2324.145,2325.18,I think--
2010.09-1343,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2325.18,2326.38,Would there be no jurisdiction then?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2326.38,2329.131,"--Well, it depends on the web site."
2010.09-1343,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2341.522,2342.056,But not in New Jersey.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2342.056,2345.51,"Not in the State of New Jersey, but a lot of other places."
2010.09-1343,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2345.51,2351.83,Where did the New Jersey company that bought this machine find out about it?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2351.83,2359.984,"Well, Mr. Curcio, who was Mr. Nicastro's employer, went to one of these convention trade shows in Las Vegas, where he saw the machine."
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2371.458,2376.945,--What difference does it make that they go to a trade show somewhere other than New Jersey?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2390.539,2400.645,"The difference for this case, precisely this case, is that we feel that under those circumstances there may have been minimum contacts, even under a traditional sense here."
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2400.645,2401.511,With Nevada?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2401.511,2405.799,"No, with New Jersey, because the British manufacturer was there."
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2417.587,2426.86,"If you interact with somebody from New Jersey, you have committed availment of the government of New Jersey?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2426.86,2427.66,--It's more than that.
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2427.66,2429.312,There are a lot of people from New Jersey.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2429.312,2432.347,"It's more than -- it's more than that, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2445.072,2447.94,He didn't tell them to just seek out a person from New Jersey.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2449.726,2451.376,He was prepared to sell to anyone.
2010.09-1343,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2458.997,2469.603,"And Mr. Ross, isn't the point that he was selling by using large convention sites in the United States, expecting that people from other -- would show up to those large convention sites?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2492.719,2494.087,"That's exactly correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2494.454,2500.658,What if there is no scrap metal plant in Montana?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2516.834,2523.071,"--Well, if someone from Montana attends one of these trade shows and decides to purchase one of these machines--"
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2523.071,2523.954,"No, no."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2528.557,2531.843,--Under those circumstances I would say not.
2010.09-1343,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2531.843,2536.628,The basis would only be the plaintiff's residence?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2536.628,2537.53,That's correct.
2010.09-1343,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2537.53,2539.28,And we don't accept that as a sufficient basis.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2539.28,2539.699,That's correct.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2540.782,2550.555,"Well, I thought -- I thought this was what the case was all about: Whether this is -- the stream of commerce is sufficient to add a basis on top of the plaintiff's residence."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2563.981,2574.086,"Well, it seems to me that if the, if the manufacturer has purposefully availed itself of the entire United States market, which is inclusive of Montana--"
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2574.086,2574.553,Yeah.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2574.553,2577.122,--and the machine somehow winds up in Montana.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2577.122,2578.157,"No, no."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2578.924,2579.674,The individual.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2579.674,2580.19,Yes.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2580.19,2582.776,So the individual is in Montana; the accident happened somewhere else?
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2582.776,2583.192,Yes.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2583.192,2594.434,"Under those circumstances, I would say that wherever that machine was sold into, whether it was in an adjoining State, and the fellow from Montana lived across the border, say--"
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2594.434,2595.017,"Yes, exactly."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2595.017,2598.719,--I would say that the jurisdiction would be better put where the accident occurred.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2598.719,2600.921,Could it be put elsewhere?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2602.221,2610.693,I would say that if the -- if the manufacturer has not purposefully availed itself of the State of Montana--
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2610.693,2611.16,Right.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2611.16,2612.36,--and has taken no steps--
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2612.36,2613.145,Right.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2613.145,2618.013,"--to push into Montana, even though it is seeking to sell to the entire United States--"
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2618.013,2618.363,Yes.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2618.363,2619.965,--I think the better location for that--
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2619.965,2623.517,"Well, better -- I know -- I know you think it's better, but can he be sued in Montana?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2635.892,2636.344,--Right.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2636.344,2642.414,The manufacturer may reasonably assume his machines aren't going to be in Montana because there is no scrap metal business in Montana.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2648.152,2648.485,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2664.577,2672.65,"Right, but the market cannot be simply the United States, because you carve out New Jersey if the manufacturer does, you carve out Montana."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2672.65,2673.033,That is correct.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2673.033,2673.633,Okay.
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2673.633,2682.956,"--But what I'm thinking is this area of law has treated States as if they're foreign countries, in a certain way analogous to."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2723.414,2725.699,"Well, there are conventions."
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2727.401,2728.984,What does it say?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2728.984,2735.138,"--They basically state, according to my understanding, that where the tort occurred to the signatories to that convention, which includes--"
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2735.138,2735.671,And we're one?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2735.671,2737.704,--The United Kingdom; which Includes the United Kingdom.
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2737.704,2738.306,And are we one?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2738.306,2745.01,"That -- then in those cases, where the tort occurred there would be jurisdiction over the foreign manufacturer."
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2757.217,2758.836,Did you refer to that?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2760.086,2760.719,They're in our brief.
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2760.719,2761.053,They're in your brief?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2761.053,2761.538,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2761.538,2770.192,"Is -- this EEOC Convention on Jurisdiction and Judgments, does that operates only within the Community?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2770.192,2771.027,That's correct.
2010.09-1343,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2776.215,2785.654,"Does your argument depend on whether the manufacturer is the manufacturer of the whole machine as opposed to a component part, like Asahi?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2810.986,2823.077,"I would say no jurisdiction for a component manufacturer under those circumstances, unless the component manufacturer was deliberately manufacturing a product for sale into a State in the United States."
2010.09-1343,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2823.077,2825.946,"Well, it's like Justice Breyer's hypothetical."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2829.564,2837.552,"That's correct, but the manufacturer in your hypothetical did not purposely avail itself of the United States market."
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2848.342,2854.596,"What if -- let's say he does know, it's a component part for something that is sold, widely sold, in the United States."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2856.881,2866.404,"Our position is that under those circumstances, if the manufacturer did not purposely avail itself of the United States market by hiring a distributor--"
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2866.404,2868.939,Why would it be -- so you have an entirely different test?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2868.939,2870.975,--That's the components -- I'm sorry.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2870.975,2876.795,You have -- you have an entirely different test for a component manufacturer than you do for the finished product manufacturer.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2887.068,2887.685,Right.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2887.685,2888.769,Why is that different?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2889.902,2890.971,I think it's different.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2906.564,2911.183,Let's say he makes the 25-inch blade that only goes into this machine.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2915.754,2918.956,"--I would say there is a difference, because that component--"
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2918.956,2919.422,I'm sorry.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2925.26,2929.395,"--I think it's -- I think it's the same test, but it would come out differently for the component manufacturer."
2010.09-1343,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2930.797,2948.725,"And Mr. Fergenson, isn't that what Justice O'Connor said in Asahi, that the component manufacturer may have all the knowledge in the world -- for Justice Brennan, that was enough; for Justice O'Connor, it was not enough that knowledge was insufficient, that there had to be purposeful availment, that there had to be an active decision, a choice to seek the market."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2954.045,2954.629,--Exactly.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2954.629,2967.27,How can there not -- how can there possibly not be purposeful availment if the manufacturer of the 25-inch blade knows it's only going to be used in McIntyre's machine and it knows that McIntyre is trying to sell its machine in the United States?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2967.27,2974.959,Because the manufacturer of that blade did not specifically target the United States market.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2974.959,2979.697,He put it in a product that is only going to be -- that he knows is going to be sold in the United States.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2979.697,2981.13,But it's not specifically designed for them.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2983.731,2984.764,You have a partnership.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,2995.706,2999.241,"Now, under those circumstances, I would think there would be a difference."
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3020.238,3027.593,"Suppose the company in Nottingham only sells to the United States, that's the only place its machines are -- are marketed?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3027.593,3028.777,That would be different then.
2010.09-1343,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3030.929,3033.164,Then the component manufacturer would be liable in New Jersey?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3033.164,3037.366,--Because he is basically piggybacking on the actions of the manufacturer.
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3037.366,3049.257,"What about today, is there any difference between the trade show, and he did show up at seven trade shows, I -- I mean the manufacturer here had a representative at several trade shows, you're right."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3049.257,3049.707,Twenty-six.
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3049.707,3052.043,"Twenty -- no, well, the record said seven."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3052.043,3054.661,There were 26 trade shows.
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3054.661,3055.261,Is that in the record?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3055.261,3056.361,"Yes, it is."
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3059.097,3077.11,Okay.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3091.518,3092.036,Right.
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3092.036,3092.653,All right.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3096.572,3100.726,And if the goat poisons someone in the United States and the -- and the person who raised the goat--
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3100.726,3101.176,Yes.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3101.176,3102.392,--purposely availed itself--
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3102.392,3103.843,"No, no, don't use the characterization."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3108.729,3113.533,"--If -- if they take steps, concrete steps, additional conduct, then yes."
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3114.383,3115.016,Okay.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3117.068,3117.518,Sadly even if--
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3117.518,3130.911,"--then everyone with a -- with a -- everyone with a Internet site who also sells to a buyer who says anywhere in the world, perhaps -- I don't know how far that reaches -- seems pretty filled with implications?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3130.911,3131.711,"--Yes, it does."
2010.09-1343,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3135.613,3137.315,But it's the same you think?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3138.032,3147.337,I think if there is purposeful availment and if the Internet is being used to market specifically into the United States and the product causes harm to someone in the United States--
2010.09-1343,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3147.337,3154.174,"There are -- there are -- there are some cases, just beginning -- as a beginning stages, aren't there, involving sales through the Internet?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3154.174,3154.641,--Yes.
2010.09-1343,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3173.219,3177.773,"But -- but you were cut off before you finished your answer, I want to make sure I understood it."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3202.222,3208.476,"That was one of the four examples that Justice O'Connor gave us in Asahi, advertising for--"
2010.09-1343,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3208.476,3209.578,I want to know what your position is?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3209.578,3209.961,--Yes.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3221.302,3224.171,Maybe everybody knows this except me.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3234.859,3235.526,"Yes, you can."
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3235.526,3238.847,So they don't even have to send the web site to the United States?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3240.197,3252.655,"If it's an interactive web site where you can sit in New Jersey, order a product, the product is then delivered by the foreign manufacturer into New Jersey and the product then chops off four fingers of someone's hand--"
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3252.655,3253.857,So it has to be interactive?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3253.857,3254.69,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3254.69,3262.879,"If it's just -- what if it says, here, we're McIntyre on the web site name, we make these machines, give us a call at this number if you want to buy one?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3262.879,3263.296,Not enough.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3263.296,3263.779,Not enough?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3263.779,3264.796,That's like a billboard.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3272.318,3274.27,And this distinction is somewhere in the Due Process Clause?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3274.27,3279.222,--I believe that the Due Process Clause requires the additional conduct.
2010.09-1343,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3286.911,3300.719,But was the sale here negotiated in -- or part of the sale negotiated in Nevada or the person just -- the New Jersey manufacturer just was interested in the machine and then later contacted the Ohio distributor?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3300.719,3306.04,"In this case, the manufacturer says they own the machines until they're paid for in full."
2010.09-1343,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3308.325,3311.943,I'm -- I'm -- I'm trying to relate what happened here to the Internet hypothetical.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3312.31,3312.61,Right.
2010.09-1343,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3312.61,3314.729,--Internet hypothetical where there's just an advertisement.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3314.729,3315.529,Right.
2010.09-1343,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3315.529,3317.029,And at first I thought you were saying that's sufficient.
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3323.335,3333.606,"If the Internet web site is interactive, so you can sit in New Jersey, order the product, complete the transaction, send money, and in response to the money coming, you get a product--"
2010.09-1343,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3333.606,3334.506,Not just an advertisement?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3334.506,3335.475,--Not just an advertisement.
2010.09-1343,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3335.475,3349.033,Even though that's the cause for the buyer's interest in it and he pursues -- pursues his -- his transaction after finding out all the information on the Internet from an Ohio distributor?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3349.033,3353.818,"It's not enough, in my judgment, if -- under the Internet example that you just gave."
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3364.876,3365.543,Complete?
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3367.245,3368.295,--That's correct.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3368.295,3377.683,"What if it's -- you know, punch these numbers and we will send you an application for a machine, is that not enough, because he's got to complete the transaction?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3377.683,3389.908,"I would say under those circumstances, that that's part of what the manufacturer requires, but the end result is that the machine winds up in New Jersey through this contact between the person and the manufacturer, then I would say that would be enough for jurisdiction."
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3389.908,3399.966,"So that if they say, fill this out, and contact this person, McIntyre, whatever, in Ohio, that's where you can get one of our machines, that's enough?"
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3399.966,3410.238,"I would say in that case they have deliberately targeted the entire United States market, but they want you to go through their distributor, which they have hired--"

2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3411.023,3414.475,"--in Ohio, and he sends it, it's the same situation."
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3423.914,3424.83,"--Thank you, Mr. Ross."
2010.09-1343,1,16809,alexander_w_ross_jr,,3424.83,3425.347,Thank you.
2010.09-1343,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3425.347,3427.597,"Mr. Fergensen, you have two minutes remaining."
2010.09-1343,2,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,3427.597,3429.215,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3456.115,3456.315,I think--
2010.09-1343,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3456.315,3456.682,"Mr. Fergenson, could I ask you a question?"
2010.09-1343,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3456.682,3457.932,--I'm sorry.
2010.09-1343,2,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,3462.384,3463.4,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1343,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3463.4,3465.686,It's a point that your adversary raised in passing.
2010.09-1343,2,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,3481.261,3486.665,And the New Jersey Supreme Court said there was a suggestion that some trades could have been by consignment.
2010.09-1343,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3520.422,3521.105,It is a different question than I asked.
2010.09-1343,2,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,3523.207,3523.49,Yes.
2010.09-1343,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3523.49,3526.826,But you're not claiming that there might not be on others?
2010.09-1343,2,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,3526.826,3547.156,"The evidence in the record under 9102 which Ohio has adopted, I think can only be reasonably viewed -- and this Court obviously treats it as de novo, on a jurisdictional review -- can only be viewed as not a consignment because MMA was in the business of selling the products to others."
2010.09-1343,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3576.925,3584.662,"Mr. Fergenson, Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen -- pick your car company -- sells many millions of cars to the United States."
2010.09-1343,2,15968,arthur_f_fergenson,,3592.435,3606.159,I think that most sophisticated distribution networks -- and this one was not -- I -- the defense takes it as a -- takes on the issue of this as a scheme.
2010.09-1343,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3623.704,3624.489,"Thank you, counsel."
