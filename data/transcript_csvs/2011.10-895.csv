2011.10-895,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.715,"We'll hear argument next in Case No. 10-895, Gonzalez v. Thaler."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,5.402,8.587,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-895,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,58.988,64.549,"What if he had identified a constitutional issue, speedy trial issue?"
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,71.282,71.906,"Yes, it does."
2011.10-895,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,122.822,127.634,So what if it identifies something that is not remotely a Federal constitutional issue.
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,137.379,143.174,It -- it works in the sense that it's not a jurisdictional bar to going forward.
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,152.247,154.104,How do -- how do you decide whether it's a jurisdictional bar?
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,163.696,165.022,--This Court so held--
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,165.022,165.947,That is jurisdictional.
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,167.726,169.101,--Because this Court held in Miller-El--
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,169.101,169.523,Okay.
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,198.43,199.323,"--Well, I don't--"
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,199.323,200.088,Isn't that right?
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,200.088,211.378,"--I don't agree that the so-called content validity of a document that is post hoc certifying a gatekeeping requirement is itself jurisdictional, because there is a--"
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,211.378,216.377,"Well, let's take the Fourth Amendment, I mean, which says"
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,239.758,242.413,"--No, a warrant may well not be valid if it doesn't--"
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,242.413,242.912,--It won't be valid.
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,244.082,247.818,--But the certificate of appealability is invalid is matter of law here.
2011.10-895,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,254.049,262.609,"Just to take a kind of nutty example, Ms. Millett, suppose that a judge took a piece of paper and typed the words ""certificate of appealability"" on top and issued it."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,265.404,267.292,Still jurisdiction to take the appeal.
2011.10-895,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,280.601,283.6,So what counts as a certificate of appealability is I guess the question.
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,287.192,288.252,"--Well, I think it--"
2011.10-895,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,288.252,289.613,--to which jurisdiction attaches?
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,289.613,290.346,--There's more to it.
2011.10-895,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,325.317,353.459,"Ms. Millett, suppose, instead of having a statute broken down into (c)(1), (2) and (3), Congress had written (c) as just one paragraph that says: You must have a certificate of appealability, and this is what the certificate must contain."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,366.036,370.407,"Well, my position would be harder for precisely the reason you phrased."
2011.10-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,416.153,426.727,"Suppose the Petitioner asks for a certificate of appealability on 10 issues, and the circuit judge says I'm granting it on issue 1, I'm denying it on issue 2 through 9, 2 through 10."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,430.131,431.909,--There is jurisdiction to consider.
2011.10-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,437.938,450.027,"Well, in that situation then, if the State moves to dismiss the arguments that are made by Petitioner on issues 2 through 10, would the -- would the panel be obligated to do that?"
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,450.027,451.153,"--No, it wouldn't."
2011.10-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,458.602,473.922,"It could do that without issuing a new -- without issuing a certificate of appealability, without saying we think that the judge who issued the certificate of appealability was incorrect, that jurists of reason could disagree on issues 2 through 10?"
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,473.922,481.592,"Well, I think -- I think whether you have to -- the panel would then have to do the paperwork of doing a new certificate of appealability."
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.465,498.01,"Ms. Millett, it seems to me you beg the question when you say that the issue is whether the appeal will go forward."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,510.582,513.549,"--Well, it's a statutory construction question, but Congress--"
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,513.549,523.528,"And it seems that the structure of the statute wants an appeal to go forward on a particular issue, and -- and not in -- not in general on -- on who knows how many issues."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,523.528,526.495,"--Well, Justice Scalia, with respect, that's not what the statute says."
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,536.603,541.177,"It says it doesn't come forward, doesn't come forward unless there is a certificate of appealability."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,541.177,541.427,Yes.
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.427,548.863,And then it says the certificate of appealability shall indicate which specific issues are issues satisfying the showing required.
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,548.863,549.612,But nowhere--
2011.10-895,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,560.714,565.776,"Then that would exclude this case, wouldn't it, because there is a constitutional issue."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,587.797,591.064,--There -- there are other issues that were raised.
2011.10-895,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,597.545,616.224,"It's a little odd that you would identify that issue for the court of appeals when the court of appeals couldn't take it up because it wasn't reached below, because the case was -- was dismissed at an earlier stage."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,616.224,622.736,"Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, your question actually captures why these mistakes happen by court of appeals judges."
2011.10-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,695.75,710.539,"Can you -- can you make the argument -- does it help you -- in distinguishing the notice of appeals section, to -- to say that the notice of appeal had to say the judgment or order that's being appealed?"
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,738.728,744.586,I think certainly that there is that point.
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,797.783,798.267,"Well, but--"
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,798.267,799.534,--but didn't want to go into the speedy trial--
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.534,806.561,"--Done everything humanly possible and just because of the mistake of a -- of a district judge, it can't go forward."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,821.101,822.006,--That can be appealed.
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.006,824.412,The same -- the same terrible result could--
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,824.412,825.664,That can -- that can be appealed.
2011.10-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,873.192,877.75,But is it necessary for you to go -- is it necessary for you to go as far as you seem to be going?
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,883.482,884.137,--That's--
2011.10-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,884.137,902.538,"So if -- well, I understood what you just -- your argument to be that it doesn't even have any effect, that so long as there is any document that's called the certificate of appealability, then anything can be considered by the court of appeals panel without the issuance of a -- of a certificate of appealability covering the issue."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,924.481,926.887,"--No, I'm sorry if I misspoke."
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1027.799,1038.811,"--Ms. Millett, as I understand the State, the State is not contending that (c)(2) is jurisdictional, so you're -- you're arguing against a position they haven't taken."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1059.927,1061.346,Right.
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.346,1066.782,So I think you're -- you're exaggerating the consequence of what the State is urging us to hold here.
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1066.782,1073.03,"Well I think this -- my point is that a substantial showing was made, so this Court doesn't even have to determine the status of (c)(2)."
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1073.03,1073.544,Right.
2011.10-895,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1075.12,1080.681,"Counsel, before your time expires, I'd like to ask one question on the merits."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1117.371,1118.245,With--
2011.10-895,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1118.245,1120.449,--with 22 -- with 2244?
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1123.666,1128.271,"--No, I think -- in Jimenez is -- we are -- we are happy to take the language of Jimenez which--"
2011.10-895,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1128.271,1129.726,"I know, but you're not taking its holding."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1129.726,1130.443,--I'm sorry?
2011.10-895,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1130.443,1133.271,You -- you take language from it.
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1133.271,1133.645,No--
2011.10-895,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1133.645,1144.095,"But I read -- I read Jimenez to say that the court should be reading this alternative ""or"" language in exactly the way the Fifth Circuit did."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1144.095,1147.92,"--This Court said in Jimenez that the -- quote, I'm quoting here,"
2011.10-895,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1168.288,1170.191,Jimenez held that it's an either/or.
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1184.778,1186.747,Two responses to that.
2011.10-895,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1251.36,1255.279,"Well, Ms. Millett, let's take a look at the text of 2244(d)(1)."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1306.164,1314.377,"First of all, the language forks out again, and so it says the date on which the judgment becomes final, and then there is the two options for finality--"
2011.10-895,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1314.377,1315.222,Right.
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1317.328,1326.122,"--Well -- and the question in this case is how do we know when that -- that direct review process, what you're calling the lose prong, ends?"
2011.10-895,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1350.724,1359.626,There's no suggestion in section (a) that there is ever going to be a conflict between these two ways of a judgment becoming final.
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1385.769,1390.16,"--One, I don't think the text compels that one way or the other."
2011.10-895,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1393.81,1405.961,"But it does, it does suggest, Ms. Millett, that final, two ways -- conclusion of direct review is you've gone up the ladder and that's it."
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1429.529,1436.482,"--And the issue is -- and I hate to call it the ""lose prong"" -- but when did he lose?"
2011.10-895,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1447.133,1455.516,So you would have a difference between 2255 and 2254.
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1487.348,1488.116,--No.
2011.10-895,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1501.624,1501.999,--I'm not talking about test.
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1513.978,1528.348,"That's a result -- but that's already a result of Jimenez, which had this whole reopening process that I -- unless the Federal system were to do that, there is -- as this Court noted in Wall v. Kholi, you can have discretionary applications that can be called direct review as well."
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1572.018,1573.832,--Where -- where is 2244(d)(1)?
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1574.705,1578.39,2244(d)(1) is attached to the appendix.
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1578.39,1581.201,To the petition for cert?
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1581.201,1582.515,Petition for cert.--
2011.10-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1582.515,1583.607,Why isn't it in your brief?
2011.10-895,0,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1601.896,1605.176,"--I apologize for the inconvenience, Your Honor."
2011.10-895,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1605.176,1605.99,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1611.267,1616.188,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1657.811,1662.779,You agree with your friend that the only fault here was on the part of the judge and not the Petitioner.
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1662.779,1665.513,We agree that the judge is at fault.
2011.10-895,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1688.095,1690.809,What are we arguing about?
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1711.819,1714.003,--If the Court of Appeals judge does it?
2011.10-895,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1714.003,1715.766,"The judge, in the Court of Appeals."
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1732.917,1737.35,"If he does that before the Court of Appeals issues its judgment, we believe that's permissible under the statute."
2011.10-895,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1737.35,1737.864,All right.
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1768.585,1771.958,"Well, the problem in this case, the Court of Appeals did not do that."
2011.10-895,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1773.943,1775.237,So they entered judgment without it.
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1777.535,1779.707,"--Okay, because Mr. Gonzalez--"
2011.10-895,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1779.707,1781.235,What is the horrible thing about that?
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1781.235,1786.235,--Mr. Gonzalez can't qualify for a COA under the standards this Court has set forth in Slack and Miller-El.
2011.10-895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1797.527,1808.289,"Mr. Mitchell, do you think the Federal Court of Appeals could do it nunc pro tunc without first making the determination that the trial judge was supposed to have made it?"
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1808.289,1812.396,A circuit judge can issue a COA under the statute.
2011.10-895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1812.396,1817.27,"But he would have to make the determination required by (c)(1), no?"
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1817.27,1818.628,"You would have to make the determination, yes."
2011.10-895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1818.628,1818.908,Yes.
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1818.908,1819.564,"But, the question--"
2011.10-895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1819.564,1822.828,And that wouldn't necessarily point him just to the Speedy Trial Act.
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1826.641,1836.761,--That's correct and often the courts of appeal will have their own circuit rules that govern how litigants should seek certificate of appealability.
2011.10-895,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1836.761,1837.416,You tell me.
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1877.651,1882.743,But at the same time any other appeals that should not have been taken will be cut off at the district court as they should be.
2011.10-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1882.743,1894.594,"Counsel, are you accepting Justice Scalia's point that the certificate of appealability doesn't have to jurisdictionally describe the substantial constitutional issue?"
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1894.594,1897.387,"No, it must describe the constitutional issue--"
2011.10-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1897.387,1910.945,"So you agreed with the question he posed to your adversary, that you are saying that this was deficient because both, it didn't indicate the issue, and because it didn't describe the substantial constitutional question?"
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1910.945,1921.942,--Our contention is that a certificate of appealability must indicate a specific constitutional claim under C(3) to qualify as a certificate of appealability under C(1).
2011.10-895,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1921.942,1926.298,"General Mitchell, but you that C(2) is not jurisdictional, is that correct?"
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1929.422,1930.049,That's correct.
2011.10-895,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1930.049,1930.891,"If that's right, why?"
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1930.891,1933.403,C(2) is phrased differently from C(3).
2011.10-895,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1962.575,1968.712,But C(3) says: Shall indicate which specific issues satisfy the showing required by C(2).
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1981.226,1988.425,"Well, perhaps analogy from other areas of appellate jurisdiction -- sometimes a district court may issue a final judgment for the wrong party."
2011.10-895,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2000.654,2019.258,"Can we back up and tell me why the statute we are dealing with 2253, why does jurisdictional, if jurisdiction means, as we have said, that class of cases that the Court is competent to hear."
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2024.706,2025.614,--Right.
2011.10-895,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2025.614,2029.955,Federal petition by a State prisoner.
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2043.261,2043.464,Yes.
2011.10-895,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2043.464,2051.551,"2253, it seems to me, is a processing rule that applies to both categories."
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2074.464,2078.29,"Well, 2253(a) reads as though it's a grant of appellate jurisdiction."
2011.10-895,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2099.266,2115.885,"So is it doubles the -- 2254 is jurisdictional; 2255 and then 2253, which tells how you are to proceed under either one of those, is not simply a mandatory how you do it but jurisdictional."
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2115.885,2121.084,"Right, 2253(a) is the provision that establishes appellate jurisdiction in habeas cases."
2011.10-895,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2146.481,2158.632,The feature of this case that I think is very unsettling is there is an issue for the court of appeals to decide.
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2188.307,2200.91,"Well, we view the purpose of 2253(c) as keeping cases out of the courts of appeals when habeas petitioners have no chance of obtaining ultimate habeas relief."
2011.10-895,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2205.925,2212.671,"If you say -- if you say that, here's Judge Gaza, and he says: Yes, there's a statute of limitations question here."
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2242.818,2245.91,--He can't grant the COA under Slack.
2011.10-895,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2249.549,2254.86,"But then presume, General Mitchell, that he thinks that it does but he just forgot to write down speedy trial."
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2268.867,2274.802,--Well the first problem is the speedy trial in this case encounters a procedural bar.
2011.10-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2276.038,2277.317,Put that to one side.
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2277.317,2290.217,"--And assume that this were a case where he had a substantial Constitutional claim and the circuit judge simply forgot to write it down, the statute requires that the Constitutional claim has to be indicated in writing in the certificate."
2011.10-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2290.486,2293.453,"Counsel, I'm a little confused, okay?"
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2321.861,2323.191,--He doesn't have to--
2011.10-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2323.191,2341.62,"And that seems to be what you're, you're wanting to happen because a judge would have to say: I'm dismissing on a procedural ground and I believe that the claim is more than non-frivolous, that it has a substantial basis."
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2341.62,2343.29,--He doesn't have to--
2011.10-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2343.29,2349.602,Doesn't that speed the habeas process in the normal cases?
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2368.374,2369.435,--Right.
2011.10-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2387.93,2388.507,So what do we do then--
2011.10-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2388.507,2389.365,Maybe it's a good time.
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2393.409,2393.877,--Thanks.
2011.10-895,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2450.525,2478.341,"General, it seems to me that Ms. Millett's best argument is an argument just about the oddity of what would happen if we adopt your construction of the statute, which is that the time begins to run before a habeas petitioner actually can file a State habeas petition, and whether that's so odd as to make this a -- a wrong way to construe the statute."
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2478.341,2479.515,"In some cases, that will happen."
2011.10-895,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2494.773,2498.037,"In -- in this very case, that was so, right?"
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2508.89,2509.44,--Yes.
2011.10-895,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2509.44,2514.968,And the mandate issued September -- some date in September.
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2514.968,2515.499,Right.
2011.10-895,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2515.499,2521.169,So there could be no State habeas until the mandate issued.
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2535.616,2536.895,That's correct.
2011.10-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2550.391,2551.343,--What happens if it happens?
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2551.343,2558.792,"Well, if that were to happen, then the prisoner should file a protective habeas petition under Rhines v. Weber."
2011.10-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2569.742,2570.631,Does that -- does that make any sense?
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2582.001,2586.985,"Well, the Fifth Circuit has had this regime now for almost 8 years, since Roberts was decided."
2011.10-895,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2639.883,2643.069,"Well, why then -- I mean, you can read the statute differently."
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2687.422,2696.59,--Because it would also -- Your Honor's proposal would allow habeas applicants such as Mr. Gonzalez to take appeals when the statute precludes them from taking them.
2011.10-895,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2696.98,2698.247,"But no, you're giving the conclusion."
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2720.895,2721.581,--It doesn't necessarily--
2011.10-895,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2721.581,2731.358,"And then the language -- it allows that, I believe -- and the purpose would allow it, for after all, the purpose is to be more efficient, not less efficient."
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2737.715,2738.37,--Several harms.
2011.10-895,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2751.366,2752.692,They really can't.
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2764.562,2771.932,"--Well, it would have to be both merited and also not encounter an insurmountable procedural obstacle, which is the problem that plagues Mr. Gonzalez."
2011.10-895,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2771.932,2791.628,"Well, if there is an insurmountable obstacle -- although, as in this case perhaps we don't reach the constitutional issue -- there is one there, so it is appealable, but we say we do not reach it because there is this impossible procedural obstacle that here blocks it."
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2807.34,2811.325,"If States are allowed to waive (c)(3), it will open opportunities for gamesmanship."
2011.10-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2818.009,2818.961,Do you want to finish your sentence?
2011.10-895,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2818.961,2823.054,"We ask the Court to vacate and remand, or in the alternative, affirm."
2011.10-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2823.663,2824.458,That's a different sentence.
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2838.89,2839.842,Mr. Chief--
2011.10-895,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2839.842,2848.043,Do you have any idea of how much the jurisdictional question plagues the courts below?
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2866.97,2868.14,--No.
2011.10-895,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2910.298,2949.265,"So if someone on the court of appeals noticed that yes, the certificate pinpoints the only case, only question that the panel can decide at this juncture, but there is a lurking constitutional question, then isn't 28 U.S.C. 1653 exactly what the panel would do then, is 1653 says that detective jurisdictional allegations can be amended in the trial or the appellate court."
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2974.333,2976.442,--That could certainly happen.
2011.10-895,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2985.734,2990.889,"Well, the appeal couldn't go forward on that issue, because that issue hasn't been decided below."
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,2998.213,3002.244,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't -- I think that, first of all, I don't think that's right."
2011.10-895,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3011.381,3017.753,Then how common is it for courts of appeals to reach substantive issues in the first instance?
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3020.05,3021.595,"Well, it certainly could send it back."
2011.10-895,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3028.328,3047.444,"Wouldn't -- wouldn't the most sensible procedure be -- let's forget the efficacies of 2244 and 53, but you -- you have a case where there is a statute of limitations question and that has come up for review."
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3063.779,3082.758,"--Even if the court of appeals would normally do that, this Court said in Slack that if the court of appeals -- or if the district court kicks the case out on a procedural ground, the certificate of appealability has to indicate at least that the procedural issue is debatable and also that a constitutional issue in the case is debatable."
2011.10-895,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3096.269,3099.908,"But if a court of appeals -- if a court of appeals judge can do that, can we do that?"
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3099.908,3101.795,--This Court could do that.
2011.10-895,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3110.167,3115.821,"You read -- you read that to be any circuit justice, or only the circuit justice from the circuit in which the case comes from?"
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3115.821,3127.349,"Well, the court has procedures in place where like, an application for a certificate of appealability would normally go to the circuit justice, and then I suppose could be referred to the Court."
2011.10-895,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3127.349,3129.599,It doesn't say that--
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3129.599,3133.705,"Well, but this Court's procedures indicate that."
2011.10-895,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3139.265,3143.531,Circuit judge -- or circuit judge or judge.
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3143.531,3145.263,--A circuit justice or judge.
2011.10-895,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3145.263,3145.622,Yes.
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3145.622,3146.452,Right.
2011.10-895,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3146.452,3149.7,--So I could just sign this tomorrow and that would moot this case and get rid of it.
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3150.901,3151.821,I don't think so.
2011.10-895,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3151.821,3152.309,No.
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3155.07,3160.038,Under this Court's procedures the application I think would have to go to Justice Scalia--
2011.10-895,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3160.038,3160.443,Right.
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3163.567,3163.707,--and then come back.
2011.10-895,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3163.707,3164.3,So there !
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3164.3,3181.98,"However, even if this Court were to issue a certificate of appealability, if the -- if the Court determined that there was actually a debatable constitutional issue in this case, which no Federal judge has done to this point, I don't think that it could still reach the procedural issue that's presented in the second question."
2011.10-895,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3230.006,3230.911,Ms.--
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3230.911,3237.396,It indicates that -- that they didn't think that the speedy trial claim was implicitly included in the certificate of appealability.
2011.10-895,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3237.396,3239.611,"--Ms. O'Connell, could I just clarify your argument?"
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3246.875,3247.281,That's right.
2011.10-895,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3247.281,3270.88,"So, I mean, (c)(2) is -- it appears to be a substantive inquiry jurisdictional, that in any case the court is going to have to make this -- is going to have to ask itself whether a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right has been made, and that would seem to be a very odd thing to do for jurisdictional purposes."
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3270.88,3273.88,"I -- I don't think it is, Justice Kagan."
2011.10-895,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3289.341,3295.745,"But in most cases the Federal question inquiry is just look, I'm looking at your complaint; do you cite a Federal statute?"
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3306.507,3314.879,"--It is, and -- and once a -- a judge issues a certificate of appealability on that question it should be presumed that it's been satisfied."
2011.10-895,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3319.032,3323.22,Well is it a jurisdictional rule that we're -- rule that we're going to presume that it's been satisfied?
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3330.763,3331.936,--Yes.
2011.10-895,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3344.601,3357.563,"So if the panel looks at the merits of constitutional issue, as to which there is a reference in the certificate of appealability when it -- when it writes its opinion it first has to ask itself, was there a substantial showing?"
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3368.482,3368.934,I mean.
2011.10-895,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3398.797,3405.687,"Then let's go on to (c)(3), because (c)(3) seems to be just a documentation requirement."
2011.10-895,2,16657,ann_oconnell,,3428.612,3436.079,"Justice Kagan, I think it's because we don't actually know that a substantial showing has been made until a Federal judge tells us that."
2011.10-895,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3445.404,3447.092,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-895,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3449.308,3452.462,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-895,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3483.358,3484.699,"I don't understand that, Miss Millett."
2011.10-895,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3498.539,3502.692,"--Well, the question is what one means by the so-called natural conclusion of direct review."
2011.10-895,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3537.881,3539.098,Let me make sure I understand you.
2011.10-895,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3543.489,3543.879,--Correct.
2011.10-895,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3559.153,3567.837,You're saying 99 percent of the -- of the defendants who take an appeal through the Texas system don't file a petition with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals?
2011.10-895,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3575.301,3576.022,--I'm talking about the former.
2011.10-895,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3576.537,3576.911,Yes.
2011.10-895,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3576.911,3579.391,"--The point is, that--"
2011.10-895,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3579.391,3586.649,"The argument is that under habeas review these petitioners are not going to be in good shape, right?"
2011.10-895,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3588.778,3590.93,--They -- they may or may not.
2011.10-895,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3661.663,3665.27,I just have a -- I don't understand the 99 percent figure.
2011.10-895,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3670.628,3672.953,It's 99 percent of -- the way--
2011.10-895,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3672.953,3675.874,So 99 percent of the convictions that were entered.
2011.10-895,3,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3679.952,3681.341,--Some of them did.
2011.10-895,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3683.871,3684.48,--Okay.
