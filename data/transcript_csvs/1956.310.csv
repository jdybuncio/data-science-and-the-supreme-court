1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,18.903,22.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,246.711,263.437,"May I -- may I interrupt to ask you whether the difficulties referred to created by the 1887 Act were difficulties peculiar to patent or whether the general difficulties about residents, inhabitants and all that business?"
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,263.437,275.173,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the answer is that the difficulties were particularly oppressive as regards to patents but also extended to other areas."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,275.173,277.866,They covered the whole area of jurisdiction in the federal court.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,277.866,285.96,"Yes, but it -- in the Stonite case, this Court referred to the decision in Bowers against Atlantic."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,311.272,313.22,Or -- or the complaint --
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,313.22,313.373,Yes.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,313.373,316.058,-- is not having a restrictive venue more numerous?
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,316.058,319.862,"Yes, sir."
1956.310,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,352.768,354.563,"That is the petitioner's brief you're talking about, isn't it?"
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,354.563,356.399,"Yes, sir, did I misspeak myself?"
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,424.58,428.114,An inhabitant roughly meant incorporated?
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,428.114,432.392,As there can be no question at that time as far as corporations are concerned.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,439.735,447.777,"So that the practical, the -- let's see what the reality of this problem is."
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,461.283,463.558,"No, sir, that is what the respondent contends."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,463.558,463.946,What?
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,463.946,465.794,That is what the respondent contends.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,465.794,467.259,(Voice Overlap) I mean that -- I beg your pardon.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,467.259,467.715,"Yes, sir."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,470.583,471.306,What?
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,471.306,475.487,That is the contention of the respondent.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,475.487,477.732,I thought you are urged to ask the respondent.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,477.732,479.164,"Yes, sir."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,479.164,480.537,And you -- you rejected it?
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,480.537,481.029,I rejected it.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,481.029,482.649,That's what the Court of Appeals held.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,482.649,483.137,That's right.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,483.137,491.881,"The division is between those who say wherever -- wherever the corporation does business in the International Shoe sense, is that right?"
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,491.881,493.19,"Yes, sir."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,493.19,495.524,Never mind whether it's incorporated in that state.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,501.578,502.739,That is the contention of --
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,502.739,509.495,"In contrary, the contention is that the 1897 Act persists."
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,509.495,510.107,"Yes, sir."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,510.107,518.308,"That's your position, namely, either you must sue where the corporation has its home where it's chartered or whether infringement took place?"
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,518.308,518.989,"Yes, sir."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,519.602,530.99,"And that you carved and that the specialized venue provision of the 1897 continues and isn't absorbed by or extended by, whichever where you want to look at it, by the general venue provision?"
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,530.99,531.463,"Yes, sir."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,577.983,593.381,Is it fair to take judicial notice of the fact -- I mean is it fairly accurate to state judicial notice of the fact that the infringes normally that overwhelmingly be the corporate infringes or is that to do this as well?
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,596.163,597.573,I agree with your later statement.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,602.344,603.54,But one can take notice of it.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,603.54,611.148,Certainly.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,723.346,724.777,"Well, I didn't understand that that was your --"
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,724.777,727.059,"Particularly, as regards to corporate -- I beg your pardon, sir."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,727.059,728.666,I didn't understand that was the argument.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,736.153,739.81,"Well, I think the argument is better stated the other way."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,745.608,746.382,Whichever you will have.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,746.382,748.799,"But the result, Your Honor, is this."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,772.78,773.981,I understand that argument.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,773.981,775.573,"So, the policy is destroyed."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,775.573,780.205,I was addressing myself to your suggestion that it all turns on the word “reside” --
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,780.205,780.303,Well --
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,780.303,791.549,"-- rather than, if you have no patents -- suppose you have no special patent venue statute, no venue statute, specifically directed towards patent litigation, then the general venue statute was governed, wouldn't it?"
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,791.549,792.331,"Yes, sir."
1956.310,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,792.331,795.441,What did the court below do with our Stonite case?
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,795.441,803.897,"The -- the -- excuse me, the court below, Your Honor, gave lift service to the Stonite case and then ignored it."
1956.310,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,829.852,830.469,Legislation.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,830.469,832.163,Legislation.
1956.310,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,851.443,853.139,That's what we refused to do in Stonite.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,853.139,857.12,"That's exactly what you refused to do, is insert in the special patent venue."
1956.310,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,862.764,865.231,"So, that was before the revision?"
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,865.231,872.11,"Yes, sir, in 1942 was Stonite."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,885.713,889.527,"If we had done that in Stonite, the result would have been the opposite of Stonite, wasn't it?"
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,889.527,894.992,"Yes, sir."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,916.573,919.297,Did you continue to say substitution?
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,919.297,919.828,"Yes, sir."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,919.828,922.882,I suggest its absorption.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,940.734,941.174,"Yes, sir."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,941.174,941.79,Is that right?
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,941.79,942.69,That's what they have held.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,943.227,949.343,"So, it isn't merely a question of interpreting a word in the special patent statute."
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,949.343,952.354,"Well, it is a -- it is a question."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,962.794,963.888,That's all right.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,963.888,964.811,All right.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,973.529,973.566,Justice Clark --
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,973.566,974.655,-- of discussion.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,974.655,976.683,-- is quite candid.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,995.003,996.208,"Yes, sir, all right."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,996.208,1014.015,"Or it isn't as though we had an independent, as though we had only this patent venue provision to call upon to construe it as a self-contained provision of law, but the Clark opinion and the other opinions that hold that say is that you shouldn't cut down."
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1015.56,1015.66,Surely.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1015.66,1023.105,You shouldn't cut down the generality of venue by the specific provisions as to patent.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1023.105,1042.113,"I would respectfully suggest that certainly, that's their position and I think the fallacy they fall into, if I may say so, is that it is a rather well established doctrine as I understand it that successor acts are presumed to be perpetuate the prior law in the absence of evidence to the contrary."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1042.113,1044.461,"But by stating their position, I don't mean to agree with them."
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1044.461,1048.344,"I understand that, but I would like to suggest that you have to get there."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1173.869,1177.362,"That is no longer true, is it?"
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1195.74,1203.054,"Not by abrogation of -- of the rule but residence and inhabitant are synonymous, Your Honor."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1230.553,1240.966,But haven't we carried -- haven't we carried -- hasn't this Court carried what was decided in the matter of due process in the International Shoe?
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1244.955,1245.062,I think for --
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1245.062,1247.529,As the recent case in the Seventh Circuit who came here.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1250.625,1251.912,I'm not familiar with it.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1588.44,1605.223,Would you be good enough to indicate what situations would be covered by the general -- what situations would not be covered by the general venue statute if you didn't have a particular patent venue statute?
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1605.223,1609.128,What situations would not be covered by the general venue statute --
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1609.128,1623.66,What does -- what situations does the special venue statute authorize that would not allow the same kind of suit that -- that we had only the general venue statute?
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1623.66,1625.39,I don't -- I don't conceive of any.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1629.937,1631.1,Let me put it this way.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1657.673,1662.603,I don't conceive of any -- any such case.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1662.603,1670.401,That is the situations now whether the infringer either has his home incorporated.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1670.401,1671.943,"Yes, sir."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1671.943,1678.726,"Or he commits an act of infringement, but how about doing business?"
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1694.014,1695.554,"Now, that's exactly our case."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1704.039,1704.548,Judgment.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1708.155,1708.824,"Yes, sir."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1708.824,1713.511,"You couldn't be sued, could you?"
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1713.511,1717.36,We could be sued either in West Virginia or in New York under the general statute.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1717.36,1718.165,Under the general statute?
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1718.165,1718.812,"Yes, sir."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1718.812,1729.704,"But under the special statute, you could only be -- you could be sued where you infringed and you could be sued in -- what's your home state?"
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1729.704,1730.232,West Virginia.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1730.232,1730.519,West Virginia.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1730.519,1731.895,It happens to be where we infringed.
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1731.895,1736.604,You could be sued in -- in your chartering state and where you infringed.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1736.604,1737.255,"Yes, sir."
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1737.255,1745.047,"But if you have a -- say a vacancy in New York, you couldn't be sued under the general -- you could be sued under the general statute, is that right?"
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1745.047,1747.058,"But not under the special one, unless that's sale --"
1956.310,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1747.058,1753.244,Because the general statute gives you a wider range but doesn't exclude anything that you now have under the special statute.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1753.244,1754.329,That's the way I understand this.
1956.310,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1754.329,1755.7,Mr. Irons?
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1755.7,1756.342,"Yes, sir?"
1956.310,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1756.342,1781.906,"May I ask you, while the general statute, relative to corporations, venue as to corporations apply solely as to corporations, is there not still a broader purpose though in the special patent venue statute applicable to natural persons as well?"
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1781.906,1787.544,"And perhaps, also partnerships, that is the rationale the court below stated."
1956.310,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1792.287,1803.623,"So, it would not be true to say that the special patent venue statute serves no purpose."
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1808.141,1814.198,"Yes, sir, but it would also be squarely contrary to the intent of Congress to make that provision apply to all defendants."
1956.310,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1814.198,1815.738,Yes.
1956.310,0,22512,edward_s_irons,,1815.738,1832.526,"And if Your Honor will bear with me, I would invite your attention to the petitioner's opening brief on pages 23 and 24."
1956.310,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2096.864,2098.138,Mr. Hulbert?
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2098.138,2113.717,May it please the Court.
1956.310,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2251.201,2257.93,"Well, you can -- you can start out with that as a postulate without begging the whole question."
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2265.793,2266.26,"Well, that is the --"
1956.310,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2266.26,2268.091,I know that's what this controversy is about.
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2268.091,2270.072,"That is the conclusion I reach, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1956.310,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2270.072,2276.079,"Well, very well, but you can't start out by saying that's the definition statute and therefore, it must be read into everything that follows."
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2276.079,2277.278,That is my contention.
1956.310,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2277.278,2287.109,"Well, I -- I -- we're listening to you with interest but I don't want to have the conclusion stated by way of compulsion at the beginning."
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2287.109,2289.811,"I didn't intend to do that, Your Honor."
1956.310,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2411.988,2419.904,"Except that every statute is -- a statute that has a history, the history is not to be disregarded."
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2419.904,2422.853,"Of course, it is not to be disregarded, Your Honor."
1956.310,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2645.085,2654.072,"Well, if -- if that Reviser's Note doesn't mean what Mr. Irons said, what does it mean?"
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2664.781,2683.153,"Well, I think it is ambiguous and furthermore, it is possible they had in mind what was referred to by Mr. Justice Frankfurter earlier of the change of law with respect to corporations generally in the International Shoe case."
1956.310,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2704.612,2706.074,"Well, I don't see the ambiguity."
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2715.14,2722.443,The only thing that it could be ambiguous is if you look behind it and read the cases which they then sight.
1956.310,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2729.393,2734.272,Did they cite International Shoe as authority for this --
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2734.272,2734.564,No --
1956.310,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2734.564,2734.607,-- to reach the point?
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2734.607,2736.053,"-- they did not, Your Honor."
1956.310,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2736.239,2737.68,But you do.
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2737.68,2738.143,I do.
1956.310,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2738.626,2742.898,"Well, if they cite it in other cases, why wouldn't they cite that?"
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2742.898,2745.849,"I don't know what was in their mind, Your Honor."
1956.310,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2745.849,2752.546,"Well, I -- I don't either and I thought you said a little while ago that we -- we should read the statute rather than to --"
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2752.546,2752.601,Refer to the notes.
1956.310,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2752.601,2754.378,-- in the situation of this kind.
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2773.22,2788.743,"All I can say is -- on that, Your Honor, that they had just in the earlier part of the chapter or even right in that part where they are discussing it under 1391, given a definition of residence of a corporation."
1956.310,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2801.191,2816.024,"Mr. Hulbert, what worries me is that that mode of dealing with this problem leads out the central what to me is the central fact, namely, that good, bad or indifferent reasons, would be enough for me to inquire."
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2915.8,2937.423,"One of the answers to that, Your Honor, I think is found in the -- in the history of patent venue which Mr. Irons did not go into and which we have dealt with rather at length in our brief because we feel it is an argument which was not brought before this Court in the Stonite case."
1956.310,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2937.423,2944.62,"But if you're asking us to reconsider Stonite, I -- I will listen with more understanding to the argument."
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2944.62,2967.052,"I do not believe it is necessary to reconsider Stonite, Your Honor, because we were dealing with a different statute at that time in which the general venue provision was very clearly dependent onto a -- a -- the first general venue provision whereas the patent venue statute was an entirely -- it was entirely apart."
1956.310,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2968.084,2969.329,Do you mean physically apart?
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,2969.329,2969.784,Yes and --
1956.310,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2969.784,2977.235,"Yes, but the 1948 codification is merely putting things -- making things more tidy."
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,3016.044,3025.587,"Well, I think, Your Honor, they did more than that and that they assembled in one place, the different specials, acts and statutes relating to venue."
1956.310,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3030.447,3036.026,"That is your strong point, if I may say so, but I do not think it answers the question of Chief Justice."
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,3036.026,3036.393,I have another --
1956.310,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3036.393,3040.951,"But the long side of it would be to revise and say, “We haven't changed the word.”"
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,3058.611,3059.615,I think that's being fair.
1956.310,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3210.299,3211.791,"What -- what was that case, Mr. Hulbert?"
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,3211.791,3213.704,"The Bowers case, Your Honor."
1956.310,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3213.704,3216.333,Who was the judge?
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,3228.476,3229.996,"I don't have to know, Your Honor."
1956.310,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3230.933,3231.622,Judge Schatz.
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,3237.251,3240.455,"Perhaps, there were abuses, which were known locally, but at least --"
1956.310,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3240.455,3241.555,Not in Boston clearly.
1956.310,1,44884,w_r_hulbert,,3241.555,3251.248,"Not in Boston, Your Honor.[Laughs]"
1956.310,2,22512,edward_s_irons,,3746.583,3755.45,"I have, sir, very brief comments, Your Honor."
