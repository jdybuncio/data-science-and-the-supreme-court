1973.72-6041,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,21.957,"We’ll hear arguments first his morning in 72-6041, Pernell against Southall Realty Company."
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,27.336,30.008,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,151.57,157.292,Did the trial court deal with the tenant’s counterclaims?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,157.292,159.149,"I would think that they did, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,185.229,186.656,And had ruled against the tenant?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,186.656,187.615,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,187.615,207.706,"Well, doesn’t Judge Riley’s opinion in the Court of Appeals give the impression that rule of the Superior Court permits the raising of that claim as a defense only, but that if you want a money judgment on your counterclaim, you have to simply pursue a different remedy in the Superior Court?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,207.706,214.455,"The thrust of the opinion, Your Honor, is to require the tenant to bring his affirmative claims in a separate proceeding."
1973.72-6041,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,219.022,222.318,"Oh, but the Court of Appeals has interpreted that rule?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,222.318,222.808,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.944,246.851,"Well, you’re not asking us at any rate to second guess the Court of Appeals as to what the rule of the Superior Court reads, are you?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,246.851,247.681,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,263.953,268.416,"Well, but that’s just what the Court of Appeals said that the rule didn’t mean, as I read it."
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,268.416,278.087,"Well as I read it, Your Honor, the Court of Appeals said that the tenant may very well have the right to a jury trial if he brings his affirmative claims in a subsequent proceeding."
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,284.341,286.668,Does the rule say you can recover damages?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,286.668,288.001,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,288.001,288.174,Which rule?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,288.174,291.757,The rule specifically says that he can recover a money judgment.
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,291.757,293.63,Money judgment in that action?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,293.63,294.104,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,295.099,297.548,"Well, then the Court of Appeals is wrong you say?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,297.548,298.315,"Pardon, Your Honor?"
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,298.315,305.961,And you say the Court of Appeals is wrong in its interpretation of its statute?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,305.961,311.785,"Your Honor, the Court of Appeals didn’t say that the tenant couldn’t bring the counterclaims in the possessory action."
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,319.419,327.544,"Well, could he file another claim for the damages with a jury?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,327.544,329.217,In a separate proceeding.
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,329.217,330.591,In a separate proceeding?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,330.591,331.467,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,337.875,342.309,"But on the opinion of the Court of Appeals, you could sue and you could recover?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,342.309,343.567,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,343.567,346.674,And that means the difference is filed in another lawsuit?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,346.674,347.592,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,347.592,349.218,Which means $30.
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,352.408,368.971,"Well, it may be court cost, Your Honor, but the problems are, in terms of administration of justice, are quite serious because here we have two trials instead of one, the same witnesses, the same evidence, the issues on the possessory action and the counterclaims clearly overlap."
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,368.971,375.59,"Well, don’t you have some actions in equity where you can’t recover damages and if you want damages, you have to go over the laws of it?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,375.59,376.921,"Yes, that might be the case, Your Honor, but--"
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,376.921,377.342,It might be?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,377.342,380.193,But we’re not dealing here with any equitable claims.
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,380.422,382.144,But you’re dealing with damages?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,382.144,382.542,Your Honor?
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,382.542,383.786,You’re dealing with damages?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,383.786,386.575,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,386.575,390.212,What is the Section you rely upon?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,390.212,390.495,The --
1973.72-6041,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,390.495,391.448,For damages?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,391.448,393.713,"The rule of the Superior Court, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,395.717,398.531,Where is it?
1973.72-6041,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,398.531,402.673,In the appendix or brief?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,402.673,405.319,"I’m not sure where it is in the brief at this point, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,447.958,448.395,Main brief?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,448.395,463.593,"Our main brief at page 7, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,621.752,636.055,"Ejectment, as I understand it or as I remember it from law school, was an action that tried title and forcible entry and detainer was an action to try the right of possession."
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,639.402,639.554,This --
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,639.554,642.255,This -- no issue of title is involved in this case?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,642.255,644.284,No issue of title is involved in this case so --
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,644.284,646.207,"Purely the issue of the right of possession, wasn’t it?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,646.207,647.532,"Merely the right of possession, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,647.532,665.461,"And as I remember that, that was tried at common law by a justices of the peace with 12 good men and true, but who were not considered to be the equivalent of a common law Seventh Amendment jury, isn’t that correct?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,665.461,666.287,"Your Honor, I think the --"
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,666.287,667.634,Am I --
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,667.634,668.383,"Point here, firstly --"
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,668.383,669.241,I’m going pretty far back.
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,673.439,678.193,"The forcible entry and detainer which you speak of, Your Honor, is not precisely the same thing as what we have here."
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,683.06,694.156,"Well, I thought -- but the point is -- your point is, isn’t it, that whether or not the Seventh Amendment right to jury is applicable depends upon the historical roots of what this --"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,694.156,695.02,"No question, Your Honor, but our --"
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,695.02,697.39,-- district action is.
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,697.39,698.259,"Yes, that is our point, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,698.259,698.766,Right.
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,698.766,703.41,"And our point is that in England in 1791, which was the critical date for application of the Seventh Amendment --"
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,703.41,704.436,Right.
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,704.436,707.245,-- the forcible entry and detainer actions were purely criminal actions.
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,714.202,716.038,And those were the justice of the peace’s actions?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,716.038,718.089,"They certainly were, Your Honor, but justice of the peace--"
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,718.089,719.809,Not King’s Bench actions?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,719.809,720.037,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,720.037,720.529,Is that correct?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,720.529,722.519,"No, ejectment was tried in the King’s Bench."
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,723.901,725.977,"But, ejectment is to try title, isn’t it?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,725.977,727.032,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,727.032,727.44,I thought it was.
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,727.44,731.935,"The ejectment at first of all, was purely to try possession."
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,837.868,848.633,"Well, then you do say that that justice of the peace, 12 men and true was the equivalent of a common law Seventh Amendment jury, do you?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,848.633,850.575,"We believe it was, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,850.575,853.104,I thought I’d learned otherwise in law school.
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,856.204,865.158,"It’s possible, Your Honor, it’s concerned about the question of 12 men versus more than 12 questions of challenges to juries."
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,884.391,886.983,The -- that’s the Hof case?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,886.983,889.151,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,889.151,901.914,"Held -- a decision by this Court held that a jury before the criminal justice of the peace here in the District of Columbia was not a Seventh Amendment jury, didn’t it?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,901.914,902.786,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1125.904,1134.75,"Can you give me any other case with -- on a jury trial, it’s a summary trial today where you take three weeks to pick a jury?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,1134.75,1138.898,"The point is, Your Honor, these cases go very quickly."
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1150.872,1156.195,How many cases does the Landlord and Tenant Court handle in a day now?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,1156.195,1160.218,"Well, that may be a little misleading, Your Honor, the number of cases."
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1166.256,1167.282,A day?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,1167.282,1167.923,Pardon?
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1167.923,1168.808,A day?
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,1168.808,1170.398,"Well, it’s hard to say a day, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1170.398,1171.495,Hundreds a day -- hundreds a day.
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,1171.495,1175.571,"In the year 1971, the court handled the 122,000 cases."
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1175.571,1177.661,"Well, could they do that in many cases with juries?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,1177.661,1179.295,"No, Your Honor. It’s quite clear that they couldn’t."
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1179.295,1183.01,"So, that’s the difference between summary and a jury trial, isn’t it?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,1183.01,1184.063,"It may not, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1211.604,1216.829,I don’t think you need to spend that much time with the word “summary” (Inaudible)
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,1216.829,1226.352,Alright.
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1317.65,1344.795,"Do you suppose that even if you shouldn’t prevail upon your historic argument, your basic constitutional argument, that you could still make an argument that Congress intended -- Congress intended that there’d be a jury trial and there is, therefore, an implicit statutory right to a jury trial here whatever the constitution or common law right may or may have not been?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,1345.726,1346.244,Yes and --
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1346.244,1353.046,"-- as I understand it, there always was a statutory right until 1970."
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,1385.577,1389.376,"I’m not quite sure, Your Honor, because the statute itself was repealed."
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1392.483,1398.022,"But it’s very clear that Congress, is it not or am I mistaken that Congress thought it was unnecessary --"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,1398.022,1399.117,Congress thought --
1973.72-6041,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1399.117,1402.283,-- and that Congress intended to give a statute -- right to a jury.
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,1402.283,1403.267,"There’s no question, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1403.267,1408.14,"Well, isn’t it more accurate to say that Congress thought the constitution gave a right to the jury?"
1973.72-6041,0,37007,norman_c_barnett,,1408.14,1409.282,"Well, that’s what they said, Your Honor."
1973.72-6041,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1439.057,1442.136,"Very well, Mr. Barnett."
1973.72-6041,1,27648,herman_miller,,1442.18,1446.811,Mr. Chief Justice and mem -- and the Court.
1973.72-6041,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1519.234,1520.379,"What year was that, Mr. Miller?"
1973.72-6041,1,27648,herman_miller,,1520.379,1523.166,In 1964.
1973.72-6041,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1524.247,1525.932,1864.
1973.72-6041,1,27648,herman_miller,,1525.932,1538.638,"Now, this continued on until the Hof case was decided where a comprehensive discussion and review of the historical situation was made by Mr. Justice Story."
1973.72-6041,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.866,1683.711,"Yes, but you could get it on the trial de novo?"
1973.72-6041,1,27648,herman_miller,,1683.711,1685.232,You could have it on a trial de novo --
1973.72-6041,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1685.232,1687.256,"Well, you had a right eventually to a jury trial?"
1973.72-6041,1,27648,herman_miller,,1687.256,1689.594,"Yes, in the Supreme Court --"
1973.72-6041,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1689.594,1692.488,"And -- so, what do you say about that?"
1973.72-6041,1,27648,herman_miller,,1692.488,1697.368,"Well, in that connection, that was repealed in 1921."
