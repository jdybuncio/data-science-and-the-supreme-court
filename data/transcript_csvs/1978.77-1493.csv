1978.77-1493,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.383,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in Gladstone, Realtors against Village Of Bellwood."
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,20.212,24.557,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.77-1493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,450.381,457.669,"Mr. Howe, was there a cross-petition for certiorari from that portion of the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,457.669,463.567,"No sir, there was not, no cross-petition has been filed in this case."
1978.77-1493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,626.625,649.904,"Mr. Howe, you do concede, I guess, don't you that the practices alleged by -- that were carried on by the realtors in this case known colloquially at least as racial steering were violative of the substantive provisions of the Act?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,649.904,654.84,"For the procedural process of this case Your Honor, that is correct."
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,654.84,660.32,"And what Section of the Act do you concede they may violate, Section 3604?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,660.32,673.993,It is arguable and there is substantial case law in the lower courts that racial steering as to a direct victim of such a racial practice does have a cause of action.
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,675.136,677.601,I am not asking about who has the cause of action?
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,682.779,685.368,"If the allegations are true, there is a violation of 3604."
1978.77-1493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,685.368,686.772,At least for the purposes of your argument?
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,686.772,689.421,"For purposes of our argument today, that is correct."
1978.77-1493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,689.421,694.39,But your submission is that the steeree has to be the plaintiff [Voice Overlap]
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,694.39,698.894,"That is correct, that is correct Your Honor."
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,882.059,882.888,"Mr. Howe, may I interrupt you once again?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,882.888,884.343,Surely.
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,884.343,894.931,Do you concede that -- these plaintiffs still allege that they suffered and harm themselves and you concede that they are persons aggrieved within the meaning of Section 3610?
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,894.931,911.55,"Your Honor, I think that the answer to that question would have to depend upon the extent to which the decision of this Court in Trafficante would be extended or broadened to cover the class of plaintiffs in this particular litigation."
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,911.55,915.009,"Let me change it, you argue that they are not persons aggrieved within that?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,915.009,921.735,We take no position because no action has been raised under 3610 for these plaintiffs.
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,921.735,927.593,"I see, but they are not -- but you do concede, don't you that they are suing for an injury to themselves rather than the third parties?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,927.593,936.778,The injury that they allege to have occurred to them is a result of an alleged unlawful housing practice directed to third parties.
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,941.83,942.151,Right.
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,942.151,947.191,But the District Court and the Court of Appeals both held that this was not the case since they were not bona fide homeseekers.
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.191,952.817,"I understand, [Voice Overlap] they make the Trafficante allegation that they were denied the opportunity to live in an integrated community."
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,952.817,955.949,"That is correct Your Honor, but under 3612, they are supposed to [Voice Overlap]"
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.949,970.625,"And your submission I gather is in the alternative, either that's not enough to make them persons aggrieved because there is a little difference between this case and Trafficante or alternatively even if they are persons aggrieved 3612, somehow or other, is a less broad --"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,970.625,978.851,Our contention Your Honor is that 3612 in no way includes the definition of persons aggrieved as being a person who can bring an action.
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,978.851,980.531,"I understand, it does not have that language in it --"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,980.531,981.445,None whatsoever.
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,981.445,984.119,It also does not have any limiting language in it either.
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,984.119,1004.789,"It does not have limiting language, but our concept of the statutory scheme is that in order to give meaning to the statutory scheme, we must hold that 3610 does have a broader class of claimants that can bring an action or bring up the process into force than that which would be allowed under 3612."
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1032.526,1035.694,"Of course the Court of Appeal say, well, there are alternative remedies."
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1035.694,1039.065,That is the position of the Court of Appeals towards of course we take exception.
1978.77-1493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1039.065,1042.074,"Even then also, anything else in this case --"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1042.074,1045.122,"No Your Honor, it is not, because in the –"
1978.77-1493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1045.122,1048.731,(Inaudible) did not they?
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1048.731,1049.979,You have to understand that –
1978.77-1493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1049.979,1051.012,Didn't the floor manager --
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1051.012,1053.052,Yes he did Your Honor.
1978.77-1493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1082.488,1085.961,Is there any language in legislative history that points to it?
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1085.961,1095.991,There is no language whatsoever Your Honor that the Congress of the United States ever considered or gave thought to an indirect victim bringing an action under this Act.
1978.77-1493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1095.991,1108.46,"Is there any language in the legislative history that said when Congressman Seller was talking, he was talking about the aggrieved person, which is what you just said."
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1108.46,1109.358,"Yes Your Honor, he is --"
1978.77-1493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1109.358,1115.063,But do you have any language in the history that backs you up or is that your statement?
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1115.063,1128.765,"Our statement Your Honor is that Congressman Seller when he was working with the bill, looked at 3610 and 3612 as being alternatives for a direct victim."
1978.77-1493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1185.0,1188.597,"Of course, Congressman Seller was also a Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, wasn't he?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1188.597,1190.093,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1493,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1190.093,1191.796,You are not saying he did not know what he was talking about?
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1191.796,1192.934,"No, I am certainly not."
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.258,1227.586,Was not that Trafficante suit under both sections?
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1227.586,1243.192,"Your Honor, that question has been raised by the respondents and while it is true that there had been an intervention filed in the court below under 3612, the decision of this Court addresses itself solely to Section 3610."
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1251.485,1256.903,"We certainly did not put Section 812 aside, did we?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1256.903,1268.969,"You did not put it aside, but you did not address it and Justice Douglas in his decision stated that all other issues, there was no opinion of the Court and that the Court was not going to address those."
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1311.389,1312.076,Mt. Howe --
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1312.076,1312.301,Yes sir.
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1312.301,1314.422,-- while I have you interrupted again.
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1320.618,1321.515,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1321.515,1323.452,There is a definition of person aggrieved.
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1323.452,1325.021,There is indeed.
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1325.021,1332.321,"But you would say, the claimant would have been injured by the housing practice, that is a broader concept than the direct victim concept."
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1332.321,1339.61,"When you talk of injury, you talk about something that somebody has incurred as a result of a housing discrimination."
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.258,1360.373,"I understand your argument, but maybe I am just repeating what Mr. Justice Marshall asked, but is there anything in the legislative history, the language of the statute that you can point to that says there is this distinction between direct and indirect victims?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1360.373,1375.162,"No, Your Honor and we submit the reason that we cannot do that is because Congress never considered the distinction between a direct or indirect victim but rather throughout, the thread of the legislative history was that they were talking about people who were barred access to housing."
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1390.138,1398.331,Most of what they are thinking of is direct victims than most applications of Sections 810 and 812 were expected to be alternative remedy application.
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1398.331,1400.621,"As far as the direct victim, yes Your Honor, we concede that."
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.621,1402.261,"Yeah, well, most that they ever thought about."
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1402.261,1402.837,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1402.837,1408.261,And there is nothing indicated that they thought about this narrow category of indirect victims pursuant to one Section and not the other.
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1408.261,1413.11,"That is correct, until the decision of this Court in Trafficante which extended the concept of person aggrieved."
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1413.11,1414.537,I see.
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1414.537,1428.791,"But prior to that, there is nothing in the legislative history at all which would support any finding that the concept of an indirect victim was to have any kind of right under either 810 or 812."
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1429.681,1435.122,"I guess that if you are right, Trafficante was wrong?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1435.122,1438.18,"Your Honor, that is not a decision that has to be reached by this Court."
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.663,1469.989,"But insofar as the silence of Congress is concerned about indirect victims, it is no more meaningful here than it was in Trafficante?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1469.989,1485.718,"I would concur that the silence of Congress and as Mr. Justice Douglas suggested, the legislative history of the Fair Housing Act is a very little help in trying to interpret what the Act was intended to cover."
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.105,1567.351,"You must think that, you do not think that the Trafficante indicated that the people who had exhausted their administrative remedies could then sue under 812?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1567.351,1587.482,"No Your Honor, I do not think we can construe it that way because it provides specifically in 810, how a person may go to court after having instituted the process of filing a complaint with the secretary, the referral to a state agency the unsatisfactory solution to that problem and then allowing a person to go into a United States District Court."
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.439,1595.369,"But when he gets there, what Section is he under?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1595.369,1604.086,"He is under Section 810, 810(d)."
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1604.086,1607.509,Is that where the cause of action is given?
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1607.509,1620.372,"Cause of action was given in the 810 (a), which states that any person who is harmed, any person aggrieved by an unlawful housing discrimination may file a compliant and then we follow through the process."
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.372,1622.839,But that does not give them a cause of action in court?
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1622.839,1629.655,"It gives them a cause of action after they have exhausted their administrative remedy, then they proceed to file a case in court."
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.655,1648.312,Well then I suppose the Trafficante says moreover these rights may be enforced by civil actions in appropriate United States District Courts without regarding the amount of controversy of brought within 180 days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice has occurred.
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1668.154,1672.742,"The Court could be wrong Your Honor, but you do not have to reach that decision in this case."
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.742,1690.582,"Well, I would suppose if the Court was right, it was saying that these very rights that were rejected in the administrative process could be brought in the Court under 812 and that would include indirect purchases?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1690.582,1701.886,"We would disagree Your Honor on the basis that in order for a person first of all under Section 810 to be able to proceed under 810, if they are a person aggrieved, it is much broader."
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.423,1711.577,So you are arguing that this reference of 812 then is just wrong?
1978.77-1493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1711.577,1712.803,"No, no --"
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.803,1714.377,I think the reference is correct because it is --
1978.77-1493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1714.377,1722.697,I understand Mr. Howe that your argument was that the opinion of the court by Mr. Justice Douglas was simply summarizing these provisions in the statute?
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.697,1723.753,"That is correct, it is merely a summarization."
1978.77-1493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1723.753,1730.264,"He also goes on to talk about 813, which gives the attorney general authority to bring a civil action in any appropriate United States District Court."
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1730.264,1732.178,That is correct.
1978.77-1493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1732.178,1733.533,And that passage is on page 12 --
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1733.533,1735.222,That is correct to that top --
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1735.222,1741.535,And he refers to these rights?
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1741.535,1745.039,I think that these rights referenced Your Honor would be to --
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.039,1751.81,"Having just left Section d, 810(d)."
1978.77-1493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1751.81,1752.394,The rights --
1978.77-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1752.394,1754.886,"Well, never mind, I was just wondered what your position was?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1754.886,1766.128,"Basically, it is that would be the individual rights but you can proceed if you are a direct victim under 810 or 812, indirect would only be able to go through 810 and the action would be brought pursuant to 810."
1978.77-1493,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1766.128,1786.73,"Mr. Howe, having in mind that there appears to be a considerable ambiguity question about it, how much in the scales should there be weighed the ultimate objectives of the legislation as a whole?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1786.73,1796.253,The preamble of the Fair Housing Act states as an objective of this country to provide for free and open access to housing.
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1897.909,1905.147,"Mr. Howe, there is one another difference on this very point and may be I am wrong in my reading, but 812 authorize suits in state courts as well as [Voice Overlap]?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1905.147,1905.789,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1905.789,1907.673,Whereas 810 only authorizes federal act?
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1907.673,1908.275,That is correct.
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1908.275,1911.11,"Well, how does that cut, I do not -- is there any inference to be drawn from that?"
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1911.11,1924.993,"No, I do not think any inference should be drawn from that at all except to allow or to create and say that the rights given under this statute may be enforced alternatively in a state court by a direct victim."
1978.77-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1924.993,1927.997,And 812 provides for a stay if there is a pending administrative act.
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1927.997,1931.958,That is correct also Your Honor.
1978.77-1493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1931.958,1956.379,"The TOPIC case on which you so heavily relied and on which the District Court relied in this case, in that case Judge Kennedy's opinion says that the court holds -- we hold that the language of Section 3612 does not authorize lawsuits to vindicate the rights of the third parties."
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1968.573,1973.122,"Your Honor, we go back to the concept again of injury versus right."
1978.77-1493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1978.726,1989.472,They have asserted an injury as did the plaintiff in Trafficante to themselves resulting from these practices made early go by the statute?
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,1989.472,2000.661,Yes and that injury that this claim was deprivation of the right to live in an integrated society and there is no where in 3604 any corollary right to the right to live in an integrated society.
1978.77-1493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2000.661,2012.297,But you would concede at least that their allegations are not those of somebody asserting their rights of third parties?
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,2012.297,2017.245,Their allegation is that as a result of there having been some infringe to the third parties --
1978.77-1493,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2017.245,2021.313,What you are saying is that the rights that they assert and rights that are simply not created by the statute.
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,2021.313,2034.614,That is correct Your Honor and that the rights that they say or the rights that they say were infringed was racial steering against absent third parties and as a result of that steering against those third parties which would be made unlawful under 3604.
1978.77-1493,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2038.248,2041.862,Do you think Trafficante helps you very much on that?
1978.77-1493,0,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,2041.862,2062.6,"Well, I think the concept of Trafficante does show that this Court did consider Section 810 to confer broad standing of the person aggrieved concept and we would suggest to the Court that its absence of any person aggrieved language in Section 812, this Court should not imply person aggrieved in Section 812."
1978.77-1493,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2083.96,2088.186,Very well Mr. Howe.
1978.77-1493,1,23767,f_willis_caruso,,2090.846,2094.891,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1978.77-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2353.244,2392.689,"Let me test out how far you would carry this, suppose someone living in the Springfield or Peoria came in and said -- in a complaint alleged that they did not like the country life, they had wherever was they were living and they wanted to move into a totally integrated community and they were thinking about coming into this particular complex, but the situation that has been described in the pleading is existed and therefore they bring a suit under 3612 in federal court immediately."
1978.77-1493,1,23767,f_willis_caruso,,2394.836,2403.757,"Well, I think that this case does not extend anywhere near that far, anywhere near that far."
1978.77-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2403.757,2409.358,"But I am just trying to see how long the arm is, how you would carry it?"
1978.77-1493,1,23767,f_willis_caruso,,2409.358,2423.209,"The first thing is that in the complaint, the area involved is specifically delineated by streets, a very specific area where this steering activity was taking place is delineated, it starts from there."
1978.77-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2423.209,2428.217,"Well, I am assuming you consume that my hypothetical, that is the same?"
1978.77-1493,1,23767,f_willis_caruso,,2428.217,2450.561,"And the people involved suing here are the village itself or this area is all included within the village and the people who live in the community, although one of whom live right in the municipality, Miss. Sharp lives in Maywood, which is on a budding community, subjected to the same kind of problems and in the same marketplace."
1978.77-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2450.561,2454.944,Do they need to live in the same community to get relief?
1978.77-1493,1,23767,f_willis_caruso,,2454.944,2473.044,"I think it is a practical matter of the experiences and it seems that the experience would be and the violation of future would be people living either in that community or very close by because they are affected by the damage that we allege, the manipulation of the marketplace."
1978.77-1493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2487.593,2500.608,"The fact is that the Trafficante opinion in at least two places and of course the opinion emphasizes that the plaintiffs were occupants of a precise and limited apartment complex, does not it?"
1978.77-1493,1,23767,f_willis_caruso,,2500.608,2502.096,Yes it does.
1978.77-1493,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2503.337,2514.306,"At least one of those references would seem to pretty clearly limit the standing in that case to people so situated, would not you agree?"
1978.77-1493,1,23767,f_willis_caruso,,2514.306,2518.097,I would agree that it is very limited and would be limited.
1978.77-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.052,2539.556,"Is it true that there are 8,200 people in the Trafficante apartment complex?"
1978.77-1493,1,23767,f_willis_caruso,,2541.635,2547.952,"They were about 22,000 at this time Your Honor and Bellwood interestingly enough was a very built-up community."
1978.77-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2566.938,2587.81,"You would agree, would not you Mr. Caruso that you have to go beyond the holding in Trafficante in order to sustain your position because of the fact that appear, the plaintiffs in Trafficante were tenants or occupants of the apartment complex in question?"
1978.77-1493,1,23767,f_willis_caruso,,2587.81,2613.966,"I think that the case is different than Trafficante in that respect that Trafficante was a particular apartment complex, although a very, very big one, and Bellwood is different because it is homeowners, it is a community itself and it is different because the villages involved trying to protect the values of the homes from being depreciated by this process and thereby limiting the tax pay."
1978.77-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2662.31,2681.877,"But even if Trafficante has limits, which it certainly does and even if this exceeds those limits, that is a long ways from taking the position that only direct purchasers have a cause of action under 3612."
1978.77-1493,1,23767,f_willis_caruso,,2681.877,2690.613,The position that only direct purchasers would have a cause of action does not seem to follow anything in the Act or any of the existing decisions.
1978.77-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2866.711,2872.666,Very well Mr. Caruso.
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2879.83,2883.486,Yes Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1493,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2993.808,3013.258,"Mr. Wallace, the government's brief on page 6, in it is introduction and summary of the argument says, “we submit that the individual respondents have standing to challenge petitioners’ racial steering practices under the Fair Housing Act.”"
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3025.327,3051.248,"We have not taken a position in our brief Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but we have no disagreement with the opinion of the Court of Appeals on this subject and indeed HUD has entertained complaints from municipal corporations similarly situated and initiated investigations in response to such complaints."
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3073.068,3076.38,My question Mr. Wallace was simply this.
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3121.37,3129.689,"It is 3604 or what we call Section 804 of Title VIII, 3604 (a)."
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3203.164,3213.767,"Well, now were any one of these plaintiffs been rendered unavailable to housing as a result of the actions of these defendants?"
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3213.767,3230.997,"No there -- as I look at, as we look at the right that they are asserting under the statute, it is not a right as counsel for the petitioners as expressed to live in an integrated society, Congress could not guarantee that --"
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3230.997,3231.08,No.
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3231.08,3250.216,"-- and did not purport to guarantee that, but it is a right not to be injured by the effects of practices that are proscribed under the statute and it is a right not to be affected by the racial steering that the statute prohibits."
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3338.783,3341.48,"Well, that is a result of steering."
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3341.48,3342.611,That could be a result of steering.
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3342.611,3346.241,"No, that is the hope for result of steering."
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3346.241,3354.239,"Yes, often the result is that he was shown something else and he liked it and he moved in and he never knew about the other and he wasn't trying to get into the other."
1978.77-1493,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3354.239,3360.073,"That is there in this case, what is the different than “red lining?”"
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3360.073,3368.429,"Red lining is usually used in reference to credit practices by lending institutions, and areas –-"
1978.77-1493,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3368.429,3370.108,It is lending on property.
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3370.108,3375.17,"Yeah, that is right, areas where it is harder to get a mortgage fund, even though --"
1978.77-1493,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3375.17,3379.032,"But here, they had lines which is saying, whether they were red or blue?"
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3379.032,3388.644,"Well, here there were areas where steering of customers by the real estate companies was done on the basis of race."
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3474.472,3496.194,"Just let me be sure I fully understand you that the plaintiffs’ entire substantive claim, substantive statutory claim, forgetting again about 1982, is based upon the second half of 3604 (a), forgetting or otherwise make available, make unavailable, excuse me, is that correct?"
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3496.194,3503.503,Well that is our theory that we have operated on about where steering as proscribed in the statute.
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3503.503,3506.067,And what the injury as to these plaintiffs.
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3506.067,3514.548,"No, there are other provisions there that some have looked toward in the literature as bearing on the steering --"
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3514.548,3515.608,But I am asking you --
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3515.608,3522.503,But we have relied on 3604(a) and no court has ever expressed doubt that steering is prohibited by the statute.
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3522.503,3524.052,"Oh, surely, I think that is been conceded by your brother."
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3524.052,3526.332,"Yes, that has been conceded for purposes of this case."
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3526.332,3528.332,"Yes, yes."
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3528.332,3546.208,"So, we are dealing here with the typical kind of private complainant about racial steering and the injury that is typically alleged in a racial steering case."
1978.77-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3646.235,3654.283,Do you understand the challenge here to be a case of controversy challenge?
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3654.283,3656.717,"Well, there has been --"
1978.77-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3656.717,3660.059,Solely or what?
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3660.059,3661.322,I do not think it solely.
1978.77-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3687.627,3702.551,"A statutory question in the sense that even if there is a case of controversy, Congress did not intend this particular kind, this class of person do have the right to get in the court, even he could get in the court under 810."
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3702.551,3704.213,"It seems to me that, that has been --"
1978.77-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3704.213,3711.779,Although there would be no difference between that person under 812 or 810 as far as case of controversy is concerned.
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3711.779,3715.116,That in my view is the principle question in the case.
1978.77-1493,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3717.062,3727.961,"Mr. Wallace, to get back to 3604, which is apparently the ‘a’, which you say as the source of the substantive right."
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3751.601,3755.931,"Not at all, not at all Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-1493,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3792.012,3799.656,But what about an individual seller who refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of property?
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3799.656,3804.239,"Well, he I think would be liable as a matter of fact."
1978.77-1493,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3804.239,3806.384,In spite of Congress's concern --
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3806.384,3831.005,"They were concerned that someone should not be claimed to have refused to sell to someone because of his race, if that person was not a good faith purchaser who made a bona fide offer, but if the seller was going to refuse to even show the property or talk to anyone, the concern did not carry over."
1978.77-1493,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3844.665,3847.177,And not to negotiate it?
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3847.177,3848.052,"Well, that is right."
1978.77-1493,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3883.617,3896.423,"Mr. Wallace, is there any cause of action that may be brought under the Act, under Section 3610 requiring extortion of administrative remedies?"
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3904.943,3908.075,That is our understanding of the statute and indeed --
1978.77-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3908.075,3909.628,Except for the United States?
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3909.628,3910.833,Except for the United States.
1978.77-1493,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3916.144,3919.963,What are the advantages of using 3610?
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3919.963,3940.338,"There are great advantages and they are the ones that Congress actually anticipated in providing this as an alternative remedy and that is that many matters are informally settled without the expensive litigation through the good offices of HUD, through the conciliation process."
1978.77-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3954.784,3955.625,It is cheap.
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3955.625,3956.93,"It is cheap, that is right."
1978.77-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4166.225,4169.184,It sounds like you were preparing like a witness yesterday?
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4169.184,4184.68,"[Attempt to Laughter] Well, we did recount there in some rather lengthy textual footnotes, the immediate derivation of Section 812."
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4563.171,4568.036,"How far does that go Mr. Wallace, according to the Chief Justice's question?"
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4568.036,4569.688,"Well, it goes to people who --"
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4569.688,4577.916,"Any residents of Illinois can sue and say, I am uncomfortable living in a state where there are any communities; they are not fully disaggregated?"
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4577.916,4585.131,"We do not think so, we think they have to show a more direct interest that their own community is affected by the practices that they are complaining us."
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4585.131,4587.96,The state is community in a broader sense?
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4587.96,4589.512,It is -- the best --
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4589.512,4590.741,So is the United States?
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4590.741,4597.76,"The best answer I can give you is that, that is not the kind of complaint that HUD has received --"
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4597.76,4606.892,"But you just made the point that Trafficante must, its logic must take us way beyond a single apartment complex, now how far beyond?"
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4606.892,4612.071,Probably to the point where the complainants are realistically being affected.
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4612.071,4620.143,"Maybe as a resident of Illinois, I do not like having any non-disaggregated community in the entire state in which I live."
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4620.143,4622.854,"Well, it isn't their feelings being hurt, it is --"
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4622.854,4623.991,"Well, I am hurt by it."
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4624.908,4651.919,"[Attempt to Laughter] Well, the question is whether the way they have to live is affected by unlawful practices of someone else that the Congress has proscribed and that they are complaining of, not whether their feelings are hurt because the law is not being observed by everyone in the country or in their state."
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4668.755,4670.265,Economically affected or how?
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4670.265,4694.018,"No, they do not require a pleading the way a court might, but for example, if they got a complaint from a former employee of a real estate company that the company was engaging in steering practices and that employee does not anyway say that he is still in that community and is affected by those practices."
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4717.324,4719.165,"But not necessarily economically, he does not have to show that --"
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4719.165,4720.254,"No, no."
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4720.254,4724.329,-- twice the value of cost of the market price of his house is going down?
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4724.329,4728.851,"No, he just has to show a direct interest of his own."
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4740.328,4742.667,And therefore relied on private attorneys general?
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4742.667,4743.44,That is correct.
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4743.44,4746.141,And I just wondered how many private attorneys general there are?
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4746.141,4751.169,"Well, we hope enough to enforce the statute."
1978.77-1493,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4764.353,4765.866,That is the red line to which --
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4765.866,4769.261,That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1978.77-1493,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4778.292,4794.677,"Mr. Wallace, on this question of the scope of Trafficante, you know, apparently Bellwood had some 20 or 25,000 people and that if we have to compare to 8,200 in Trafficante, but then I just recall that the complaints actually concern a limited area within Bellwood, does not it?"
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4794.677,4796.212,"Well, they specified --"
1978.77-1493,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4796.212,4799.304,"Does that go across in the Maywood, I am not sure of it?"
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4799.304,4805.532,They specified a limited area to which black customers were being steered.
1978.77-1493,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4815.837,4821.775,"I see, so the relevant number of people for purposes of comparison is the population of Bellwood?"
1978.77-1493,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4821.775,4824.34,I would say so Your Honor.
1978.77-1493,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4825.983,4827.131,Very well Mr. Wallace.
1978.77-1493,3,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,4829.552,4832.872,"Yes, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1493,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4866.162,4868.639,The Court left open a 1982 question?
1978.77-1493,3,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,4868.639,4869.777,That is correct also Your Honor.
1978.77-1493,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4869.777,4872.827,But it did not mention 812?
1978.77-1493,3,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,4872.827,4886.584,"It did not mention it in the footnote but it dealt with the 1982 but it did in this language at the end, and then taking your concurring opinion to Mr. Justice White wherein you stated that you would limit it to the facts of the case as presented."
1978.77-1493,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4910.74,4912.315,And that would almost go to the merits?
1978.77-1493,3,30915,jonathan_t_howe,,4912.315,4926.805,"It could Your Honor, but I think that the fact that we like to point out is that there is a distinction between the class of defendants in Trafficante as to the class of defendant in this particular case."
1978.77-1493,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5022.905,5023.607,Thank you gentlemen.
