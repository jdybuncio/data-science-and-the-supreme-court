1956.79,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,31.845,"Number 79, International Brotherhood of Teamsters versus Vogt, Incorporated."
1956.79,0,21378,david_previant,,33.769,55.538,"If the Court please, this case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin to review a judgment of that Court which restrains the petitioners from peaceful picketing at the place of employment of nonunion workingmen."
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3191.126,3211.912,"If the Court please, I would like to just -- for the enlightenment of the Court, restate a few things about the pleading and the manner of disposing of the case on the pleading."
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3329.721,3336.092,Is there anything in the record to establish that finding?
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3336.092,3337.347,"In the record, yes."
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3351.434,3353.298,"No, that isn't what I mean."
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3371.967,3375.957,"There are allegations in the complaint, if Your Honor please."
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3377.941,3379.728,Were they controverted?
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3379.728,3383.009,Which I think support that position entirely.
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3383.009,3384.367,Were they controverted with respect to --
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3384.367,3392.02,"No, they were not controverted, not in any manner of shape or form."
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3433.028,3439.792,Was there anything in the evidence to show how many patrons might go by that way or what the traffic is or what --
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3439.792,3442.899,"No, there is -- there is no direct evidence on that point."
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3442.899,3445.841,"Well, how did they arrive at this finding?"
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3448.865,3481.932,"Well, I think they arrived at that finding, Mr. Chief Justice, upon their own knowledge of the situation as it existed in that locus because that is a sort of a trunk -- county trunk road, off even the -- off the main highway and is in a distinctly rural situation where it is not used by persons who are normally engaged in business back and forth."
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3481.932,3491.871,But wouldn't they have to have some evidence and know what possible or probable patrons of the owners business might pass that way?
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3495.584,3508.14,"My only answer to that is, and was indicated a moment ago, I think that they -- they knew what the situation there was, just as I --"
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3508.14,3508.338,They knew --
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3508.338,3509.075,-- knew what the --
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3509.075,3510.38,-- they knew his business?
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3510.38,3511.099,I beg your pardon?
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3511.099,3514.38,"They knew his business, the character of it and how --"
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3514.38,3530.506,"I am very positive that, while they didn't have any direct evidence on the subject because of the number of people that might pass there, that they were surely conversant with that site in the rural district in which it was located."
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3530.506,3542.479,"Well, could they decide -- decide the number or probable number of people who would pass that way and be influenced without any evidence in the record on the subject?"
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3542.479,3544.515,"Well, let me say this in answer to that."
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3548.096,3548.593,"Well, I see they did."
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3548.593,3550.3,Yes.
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3550.3,3550.627,I just wondered what to think about it.
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3550.627,3566.338,"And, if you take that into consideration as only one of the elements which led the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin to come to the conclusion that it came to in the -- in the second opinion, I would like to --"
1956.79,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,3566.338,3575.096,"Was there any controversy about that fact about the number of people that passed and that the location of this area, any dispute about it on -- from the other side?"
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3575.096,3575.925,No.
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3575.925,3577.41,No?
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3579.434,3580.202,I don't remember that it was disputed.
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3580.202,3582.997,I so read the briefs.
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3582.997,3584.751,I don't remember that it was disputed.
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3590.091,3595.348,"Well, it wouldn't be in the record if it was first mentioned in the second -- second decision of the Supreme Court, would it?"
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3595.348,3597.384,"Well, that's true."
1956.79,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3604.511,3606.186,Page 30 of what?
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3606.186,3609.048,Page 30 of the transcript.
1956.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3860.868,3862.615,I think it was Mr. Justice Brennan.
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3862.615,3892.693,"Well, it was directed to that point as to whether or not there is a difference between picketing which results from a demand upon the employer to recognize it as a bargaining agent and picketing which is indulged in without any demand or communication between the Union and the employer."
1956.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3979.152,3980.15,If what?
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3980.15,3981.118,An unfair labor practice.
1956.79,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3981.118,3981.937,"I say, if what."
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,3983.909,3998.0,"If an employer, Mr. Justice Black, bargains with a union, it does not represent a majority of the employees involved in the Union, he is guilty of an unfair labor practice."
1956.79,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4085.466,4088.234,"Well, that would be true of any picket line, wouldn't it?"
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4088.234,4090.078,That would be true of any picket line.
1956.79,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4090.078,4090.338,Yes.
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4090.338,4091.494,"Yes, but --"
1956.79,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4091.494,4092.45,"So, why do you say --"
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4092.45,4097.398,"They claim they weren't -- Mr. Justice Douglas, they claim they were not picketing this employer."
1956.79,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4097.398,4109.593,But you just say that the -- the existence of a picket line itself is not to bring coercion on the employer.
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4116.447,4123.221,There was no dispute here between the employer and the -- and these three unions.
1956.79,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4127.462,4128.06,I understand.
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4128.06,4128.477,That --
1956.79,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4128.477,4133.716,The Court found that the purpose was to coerce the employer.
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4133.716,4135.352,"Yes, the Court found that."
1956.79,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4135.352,4145.724,"I say if you can infer that just from the mere fact of picketing, why -- why can't you infer it in every case what this picket line has shown?"
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4145.724,4147.541,"Well, I think there are a good many cases --"
1956.79,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4147.541,4158.237,What kind of a case would you say would be saying the doctrine that you are arguing before was adopted?
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4161.688,4163.884,"Do you mean, when a picketing would be permissible?"
1956.79,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4163.884,4164.689,Yes.
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4164.689,4181.598,"Well, I think it would be permissible in any controversy between an employer and a Union where the objective of the Union was lawful such as wages, hours, and working condition or any facet, lawful facet."
1956.79,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4181.598,4186.078,But your argument would outlaw all organizational picketing.
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4186.078,4191.029,"Under the Wisconsin statute, and I think it should be."
1956.79,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4345.59,4346.003,"You mean, the employer --"
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4346.003,4347.141,-- to join --
1956.79,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4347.141,4353.227,Where the employees coerced the employer to coerce his employees.
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4353.227,4354.453,That's right.
1956.79,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4354.453,4360.1,"Now as I understand it, the sign between you and your adversary here is very narrow there."
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4370.066,4370.383,"Well, Mr. --"
1956.79,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4370.383,4371.96,"They say if that evidence is there, --"
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4371.96,4371.968,That's right.
1956.79,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4371.968,4372.912,-- you have a case.
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4372.912,4373.731,That's right.
1956.79,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4373.731,4373.879,That's your --
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4373.879,4377.839,The Supreme Court of Wisconsin found that that was one of the purposes.
1956.79,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4377.839,4391.583,"And that's the question as to whether there was any evidence from which that could be found.Of course, in a given a case, we have very strong evidence to show not only a purpose to violate the law, but a constant continuing violation of the law."
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4391.583,4392.08,That's right.
1956.79,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4392.08,4407.634,"On everything it was said on the placards and everywhere else, he says here there is no evidence of that kind on which there could rationally be a finding that there was a purpose here to coerce the employer to coerce the employees."
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4407.634,4414.149,"Well, the mere stationing of the picket under the circumstances and facts which exist in this case show that purpose."
1956.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4417.929,4419.826,"Well, suppose there had not been --"
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4419.826,4420.812,"I beg your pardon, sir?"
1956.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4420.812,4426.331,"Suppose there had not been -- this isn't my first day in this chair, and maybe this doesn't work."
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4432.866,4433.323,Yes?
1956.79,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4433.323,4436.736,Would you have had a case?
1956.79,1,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4436.736,4440.01,"Well, that's a very interesting question."
1956.79,2,29161,jacob_l_bernheim,,4932.708,4935.73,"Well, I don't have mine but I'd be glad to send them."
1956.79,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4935.73,4937.504,"Could that be done quickly, Mr. Bernheim?"
1956.79,2,29161,jacob_l_bernheim,,4937.504,4941.117,I could have them mailed out today.
1956.79,3,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4941.117,4943.522,Do you -- how many copy do you desire?
1956.79,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4944.398,4945.037,When will --
1956.79,3,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4945.037,4946.023,-- to make.
1956.79,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4946.023,4950.155,"We'll have -- we'll have to make do with one, if you have that."
1956.79,3,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4951.67,4951.798,"Well, I'll leave it with the clerk, --"
1956.79,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4951.798,4953.133,-- came before the Supreme Court of Wisconsin.
1956.79,3,34752,leon_b_lamfrom,,4953.133,4960.012,-- the one that I have here.
1956.79,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5076.155,5078.69,"Thank you, Mr. Lamfrom."
1956.79,4,21378,david_previant,,5083.688,5089.346,I'm addressing myself to the question asked from Mr. Chief Justice Warren.
1956.79,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5205.945,5218.945,"May I say, I am cheered by the suggestion that, in Wisconsin, the atmosphere is such that that's a reasonable expectation on the part of the employer."
1956.79,4,21378,david_previant,,5218.945,5232.736,Thank you.
