2003.03-6696,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,36.606,"We'll argument first this morning in number 03-6696, Yaser Esam Hamdi vs. Donald Rumsfeld."
2003.03-6696,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,14.368,18.983,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-6696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,99.059,109.236,Do we have precedents for applying the writ in wartime situations to enemy combatants?
2003.03-6696,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,109.236,111.525,"For aliens, yes."
2003.03-6696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,112.34,116.373,But for a citizen who turns out to be an enemy combatant?
2003.03-6696,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,116.373,117.419,--There are two--
2003.03-6696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,117.419,119.128,What precedents do we look to?
2003.03-6696,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,119.128,122.564,"--There are only two precedents that I'm aware of, Justice O'Connor."
2003.03-6696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,169.456,173.424,"That's not the complaint, or the allegation here, is it?"
2003.03-6696,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,173.424,180.146,"The allegation here is that, as I understand it, is that Mr. Hamdi is an enemy combatant, whatever that means."
2003.03-6696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,190.389,191.6,"Well, it's an English word."
2003.03-6696,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,194.323,195.035,That's correct.
2003.03-6696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,195.035,202.075,I assume it means someone who is... has taken up arms against the armed forces of the United States.
2003.03-6696,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,204.831,205.163,No.
2003.03-6696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,210.473,215.651,"Well, if the Government's right, he is an unlawful belligerent, I take it, if the Government's right."
2003.03-6696,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,215.651,228.185,"--Well, the Government hasn't claimed in this, on the record in this case, which is limited to the Mobbs Declaration, it doesn't say anywhere in the Mobbs Declaration that Mr. Hamdi is an unlawful combatant."
2003.03-6696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,259.573,267.707,"Well, it certainly is possible that a U.S. citizen could end up fighting for the enemy in a war against our country."
2003.03-6696,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,268.885,270.147,That's happened.
2003.03-6696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,270.147,270.911,Yes.
2003.03-6696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,270.911,271.674,Happening.
2003.03-6696,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,271.674,287.361,"And so when that individual is captured then, by our country, the question is, to what extent does the habeas statute apply, and if it does, are the proceedings limited in some way?"
2003.03-6696,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,290.88,299.711,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that the... his status is the thing that is the subject of the habeas proceeding."
2003.03-6696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.364,314.135,"But you could say the same thing about, about noncitizen combatants."
2003.03-6696,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,337.475,337.79,--Your Honor--
2003.03-6696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,337.79,338.271,Or would you?
2003.03-6696,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,339.499,339.75,--No.
2003.03-6696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,351.302,356.364,"Well, I'm still not clear what you do with Justice O'Connor's question and it's basically the Quirin case."
2003.03-6696,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,367.168,367.964,"Well, yes."
2003.03-6696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,376.962,387.635,I'm asking you to distinguish between citizen and noncitizen in the hypothetical case where each are combatants against the United States and are captured.
2003.03-6696,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,388.779,390.01,--Not in the Quirin case.
2003.03-6696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,390.739,394.441,Any difference in your view and under your theory of the case that you're presenting here?
2003.03-6696,0,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,394.441,395.04,Yes.
2003.03-6696,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1567.993,1570.583,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2003.03-6696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1609.127,1638.509,"But the question of whether it's a criminal procedure or this detention without... does the Government have any rhyme or rationale as to why some of these people... I think Mr. Dunham mentioned Lindh, there is also Moussaoui, there is this John... they are also being kept away from returning any place because there are criminal charges against them."
2003.03-6696,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1657.216,1663.091,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that reflects the sound exercise of prosecutorial and executive discretion."
2003.03-6696,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1697.271,1697.885,"At the moment, nobody--"
2003.03-6696,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1731.913,1750.571,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I'm not sure I can give you the outer bounds, but what I can say is that the case here before you today in Hamdi, and the case in Padilla, suggests that the amount of time that is necessary to allow for interrogation without access to counsel in order to get intelligence is not an indefinite period of time."
2003.03-6696,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1764.563,1766.636,Would it be--
2003.03-6696,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1766.636,1768.792,"--Mr. Clement, how can you assume--"
2003.03-6696,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1768.792,1785.426,"--Would it be a helpful line of inquiry for a district court, assuming that there is some jurisdiction in the district court, which you would contest, to have testimony as to how effective interrogations are and how long it takes."
2003.03-6696,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1789.773,1791.219,I suppose you could.
2003.03-6696,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1861.418,1866.946,"We can accept that, but what do you, what do you make of Section 4001."
2003.03-6696,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1876.671,1884.952,"That's right, Justice Souter, but I would be quick to add that we... I mean, all 4001(a) says is that an individual must be detained pursuant to an act of Congress."
2003.03-6696,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1884.952,1885.284,Right.
2003.03-6696,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1885.284,1902.099,"If one needs an act of Congress, and we question whether this really has anything to do with the detention of enemy combatants by the military, but to the extent an act of Congress is necessary, as I think Justice O'Connor's questions indicated, the authorization of force provides more than ample statutory--"
2003.03-6696,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1902.099,1906.549,It certainly did... may I just ask one more question?
2003.03-6696,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1989.527,1991.965,"Well, Justice Souter, I would say a couple of things."
2003.03-6696,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1999.752,2003.021,"Well, there are 10,000 troops there, but it's two and a half years later."
2003.03-6696,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2024.168,2026.042,"--I realize that, Justice Souter."
2003.03-6696,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2083.758,2091.992,You come with an authorization that the President relied on and which I will assume he quite rightly relied on at the time it was passed.
2003.03-6696,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2106.98,2114.301,"Well, again, Justice Souter, I can't imagine that the rule is that the executive somehow suffers if Congress doesn't fill the breach."
2003.03-6696,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2121.52,2129.156,"Yes, but when you say the executive, I think your response is assuming that the executive has the power."
2003.03-6696,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2146.087,2150.054,"But Justice Souter, they have authorized the use of force."
2003.03-6696,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2152.012,2159.2,"Without any specific reference to this situation, without any specific reference to keeping American citizens detained indefinitely."
2003.03-6696,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2168.363,2169.159,"--Well, absolutely."
2003.03-6696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2169.159,2178.903,"So if it expires after two and a half years, it would just not mean you have to give them counsel after two and a half years or give them a hearing after two and a half years."
2003.03-6696,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2183.536,2184.981,"It would, Justice Scalia--"
2003.03-6696,2,23813,frank_w_dunham_jr,,3375.035,3376.511,May it please the Court.
2003.03-6696,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3509.074,3509.953,"Thank you, Mr. Dunham."
