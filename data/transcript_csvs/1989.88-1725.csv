1989.88-1725,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.522,"We'll hear argument now in No. 88-1725, Juan Francisco Venegas v. Michael Mitchell."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,12.308,15.26,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,77.833,82.92,"Well, Mr.... there's no issue in this case about what the defendant would have to pay?"
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,82.92,84.654,"There is no issue... that's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,84.654,88.891,The... the lodestar amount is all that he has to pay?
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,88.891,89.774,That's correct.
1989.88-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,89.774,90.124,All right.
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,91.124,93.026,It was a projected short trial.
1989.88-1725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.276,145.56,Do we know that that was his standard form contract?
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,145.56,148.179,"Well, it was a printed form contract, Your Honor."
1989.88-1725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,148.179,150.196,Including the one trial limitation?
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,150.196,153.583,"That would be the assumption, yes."
1989.88-1725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.583,154.65,That... it... it's a--
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,154.65,159.302,There's no evidence to that effect other than it appears to be a printed form contract.
1989.88-1725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,159.302,166.641,"--It... it has been asserted that that's unusual, that that particular feature is unusual in contingent fee contracts."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,166.641,170.26,"Well, it is our position that it is... it is unusual."
1989.88-1725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,207.985,210.087,"Now, is... is that the right way to interpret?"
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,219.776,224.346,"That would be the reasonable way of interpreting it, not the way Mr. Mitchell interpreted it, however."
1989.88-1725,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,224.346,229.731,"Mr. Mosk, does the Central District... that's where this case was tried, wasn't it?"
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,229.731,230.7,"Yes, sir."
1989.88-1725,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,230.7,235.968,Have any policy of regulating contingent fees?
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,235.968,241.106,"Well, Your Honor, the answer is no, not by rule."
1989.88-1725,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,283.283,295.276,"But you haven't made any independent claim here that the contingent fee should have been reviewed the way all contingent fees would be, regardless of a civil rights case?"
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,295.276,316.189,"No, Your Honor, other than to say that all contingent fee agreements, and especially in civil rights cases, when called to the attention of the court, the court has a duty to exercise supervisory power over them, as they have done in... in every court throughout the nation."
1989.88-1725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,316.189,317.222,Have we held that?
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,320.641,322.26,"No, Your Honor, you have not."
1989.88-1725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,335.984,338.87,And... and does that supervision go to all aspects of the contract?
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,342.322,346.708,It goes to its fairness and to the circumstances surrounding it.
1989.88-1725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,424.226,433.831,"Did he have... did Venegas have his own counsel at that point, or was he... in these hearings in the district court?"
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,439.235,456.697,"At a... at a point in time after Mr. Mitchell, who was counsel of record, filed his lien, at some point at the hearing itself another counsel had to be hired and was hired and did present written argument, yes."
1989.88-1725,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,456.697,473.141,But apparently none of the parties make any objection to the authority of the district court to make this determination and whatever the determination is with respect to the contingency fee contract that is going to be binding on all the parties for state law purposes.
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,473.141,477.943,The answer is nobody objected to the... to the determination as such.
1989.88-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,481.764,488.068,"Well, I thought the district... I thought the district court really only made... it made some remarks about it that really left it to the state law."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,488.068,488.484,--No.
1989.88-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,495.155,498.607,"But said it was really a matter of... for state law to take care of, didn't he?"
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,498.607,510.148,"--Well, except for what we consider is that the first bastion, the first guard, is the court itself in which the attorney appears, in which all the facts are demonstrated."
1989.88-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,513.967,523.823,You think the validity of every contract... contingent fee contract in a case that's tried in Federal court... the validity of that contract is a matter of Federal law?
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,523.823,525.141,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,526.643,528.561,"Well, what is it a matter of?"
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,528.561,534.549,"--It is a matter of the Federal court determining at that stage, as they have in many, many cases--"
1989.88-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,534.549,535.965,With reference to what law?
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,535.965,539.184,--In reference to Federal law.
1989.88-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,539.184,540.453,"So, it is a--"
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,540.453,541.153,"Yes, it's a--"
1989.88-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,541.153,543.238,"--Federal law issue, the validity of that contract?"
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,543.238,551.241,"--In a Federal... well, it's not the question so much as the validity; it's the question of the regulation of the attorney and the reasonableness of it."
1989.88-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,578.292,584.696,"Well, let's... let's assume that this contract is completely valid and enforceable in state court."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,584.696,584.996,Yeah.
1989.88-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,584.996,590.933,"And if this case had been tried in state court, the contingency fee contract would have been enforceable and valid."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,592.416,597.436,Except for the... the... except for the Fracasse v. Brent withdrawal aspect.
1989.88-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,597.436,599.621,"Well, that may... that may be so."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,614.798,617.25,"Because... it's not a question of not enforcing it, Your Honor."
1989.88-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.754,626.939,"Well, I know, but if it determines it's unreasonable, it won't enforce it."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,628.975,631.408,"--Well, it is a question of enforceability, yes."
1989.88-1725,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,659.91,677.538,"Well, I can understand the court... maybe a Federal court saying, well, we've got this matter before us, we might as well deal with this contingent fee contract, but then saying it's a... it's a matter of state law and we'll just... we'll find out what the state law is and then... and apply state law to it."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,679.657,700.154,"Well, all we're suggesting, Your Honor, is that it's the first line of defense because an attorney, as an officer of the court before whom he or she appeared, is to determine whether or not that attorney, for example, is... is... is taking undue advantage of his client."
1989.88-1725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,702.287,721.234,"Well, Mr. Mosk, I thought you argued, with reference to the third question raised in your petition, that a Federal court in a civil rights case should not uphold a contingent fee agreement which is unenforceable under state law."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,721.234,721.6,--Right.
1989.88-1725,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,721.6,730.09,So I thought your argument was to the effect that the Federal court had to look to state law for enforceability.
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,735.91,753.872,"Our position, Your Honor, is that, number one, as a matter of Federal law, the court should not enforce a contract... contingent fee contract where the lawyer has withdrawn prior to the advent of the contingency because that is a matter of general law."
1989.88-1725,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,766.279,770.298,But the first of those arguments isn't... isn't raised in your petition for certiorari.
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,770.298,771.583,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1989.88-1725,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,793.581,806.34,"Well, I hope you will devote some of your time... and, of course, your ability to do that depends on questions from the bench as well as your own schedule, I realize... to the question of... the first question presented."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,806.34,806.623,Yes.
1989.88-1725,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.266,1068.61,"Mr. Mosk, is... this argument you're making assume... it seems to me it assumes that... that a reasonable attorney's fee is one single number and that there couldn't be a whole bunch of reasonable attorney's fees that vary enormously in amount."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,1102.866,1104.133,"Well, several reasons."
1989.88-1725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1127.498,1128.266,"No, that's not quite right."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,1133.754,1136.437,"--Well, except that... that's true, Your Honor."
1989.88-1725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1149.097,1153.382,"Well, there's just no relationship whatsoever in this case between the time and the amount of the fee."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,1153.382,1154.049,That's correct.
1989.88-1725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1154.049,1156.049,"You've got $2,000 or $3,000 an hour, I think."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,1156.049,1158.334,I missed... that... I did misspeak on that... that--
1989.88-1725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.334,1159.101,Yeah.
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,1159.101,1159.617,--one element.
1989.88-1725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1171.474,1173.843,"Yeah, but it's a difference between being in a factor and being the standard."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,1173.843,1174.543,--Well--
1989.88-1725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.543,1180.497,"I mean, if contingency is one factor in the reasonable fee determination by the court, but it's the whole ball game in this... in the contract."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,1180.497,1183.901,"--Well, it's the whole ball game either way."
1989.88-1725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.167,1191.638,"Well, he has to win, but in... in determining the amount of the fee, contingency is the entire standard under the contract."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,1195.257,1204.379,"--But he's... but... yes, Your Honor, but he's better off with the 1988 between plaintiff and defendant because if it's a low amount, he gets his time anyway."
1989.88-1725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1206.53,1208.949,"Well, in some cases yes, some cases no."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,1210.182,1215.103,"--The only... the... in this case he gets a windfall, a windfall which--"
1989.88-1725,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1215.103,1216.705,"Well, he gets what he bargained for."
1989.88-1725,0,40058,richard_m_mosk,,1216.705,1223.692,"--Well, as far as the contract aspect... and the respondent has said that, a contract's a contract."
1989.88-1725,1,19579,charles_a_miller,,1819.815,1825.719,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1725,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1959.306,1960.841,"Mr. Miller, could you help me on the facts here."
1989.88-1725,1,19579,charles_a_miller,,1977.201,1978.469,"It did not, Your Honor."
