1988.88-396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.272,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-396, Colonial American Life Insurance Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue."
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,39.225,43.76,"Thank you, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-396,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,108.267,109.552,"Well, one could phrase it differently."
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,123.193,124.962,"--That is one way to phrase it, Justice Stevens."
1988.88-396,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,124.962,127.914,"Because it's clear if it is an expense, it's deductible currently."
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,129.479,130.729,"No, Justice Stevens."
1988.88-396,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.243,151.393,Ms. Chiechi--
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,151.393,152.345,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1988.88-396,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,152.345,153.395,--Do I say your name right?
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,153.395,154.129,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1988.88-396,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,154.129,163.985,What... what does an insurance company do by way of the expenses of an agent?
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,205.978,220.488,"In the year that a directly written insurance policy is issued, an insurance company, in connection with what it would pay the sales agents incurs the sales agent's expense, sometimes in the range of about 60 percent of the initial premium on ordinary whole life insurance."
1988.88-396,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.739,248.239,"Oh, there was."
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,249.241,249.641,Yes.
1988.88-396,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.641,251.543,And so you think it's about equivalent to what they do with the--
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,251.543,252.643,In the regard that you were raising.
1988.88-396,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,353.574,354.341,--Ms. Chiechi--
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,354.341,355.341,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1988.88-396,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.341,368.251,"--would you explain to me how you read 809(c)(1), Now, that's a section of the Code that talks about premiums."
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,368.251,369.367,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1988.88-396,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.367,382.058,And yet you say that it incorporates this whole concept of deduction of ceding--
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,382.058,384.276,Section 809--
1988.88-396,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,384.276,384.693,--commissions.
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,384.693,385.293,"--Excuse me, Justice."
1988.88-396,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,385.293,395.734,"Now, do you say that this is a return premium or do you say it's other consideration arising out of reinsurance ceded?"
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,395.734,416.814,"We believe it's both but you need not reach the second phrase in the statute, Justice O'Connor, because clearly the term return premium, as amplified by the regulations under Section 809(c)(1) provides that the term return premiums is to include amounts of premiums or other consideration returned to another life insurance company in respect of--"
1988.88-396,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.814,434.193,"Well, the government says the words ""return premiums"" apply only to premium income which either an initial insurer or a reinsurer has to return to the policyholder due to mortality experience or other contractual obligations."
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,436.561,437.061,--That--
1988.88-396,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,437.061,437.928,--ceding commissions.
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,437.928,440.113,--That assertion I believe is unfounded.
1988.88-396,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,470.18,481.905,"Well, do you argue that the last clause in premiums and other consideration ""arising out of reinsurance ceded"" would cover your case if return premiums do not?"
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,481.905,482.838,We believe that it could--
1988.88-396,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,482.838,485.354,Do you argue that in your brief?
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,485.354,495.96,"--We don't... we don't elaborate on that argument, Justice Kennedy, because we believe that it's clear that return premiums cover the ceding commissions, but... and, therefore, that you wouldn't have to reach the second phrase."
1988.88-396,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,499.328,507.118,"What about the phrase ""arising out of reinsurance ceded"", does that modify return premiums?"
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,507.118,507.45,No.
1988.88-396,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,511.469,515.039,And do both parties agree on that?
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,515.039,517.523,--I cannot speak for counsel for the Commissioner.
1988.88-396,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,517.523,519.158,All right.
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,530.383,531.033,In the long run?
1988.88-396,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,540.672,543.291,What you're really arguing about is the tax years in question.
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,543.291,545.809,Yes.
1988.88-396,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,545.809,550.546,"If you lose the case, you may prevail dollar-wise over the long-run."
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,553.029,557.2,"Well, if what you are suggesting is that this is a question of timing, that is true."
1988.88-396,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,566.822,571.126,"Was your tax court decision, incidentally, reviewed by the full court?"
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,571.126,572.56,"No, it was not, Justice."
1988.88-396,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,572.56,577.697,Is there a similar decision on the point that was reviewed by the full court?
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,577.697,590.337,"I don't believe there is any decision of the tax court that's been reviewed by the full court, but there have been, I think, five decisions that have been handed down since the first case, Beneficial Life, in 1982 decided this question."
1988.88-396,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,590.337,608.316,The legislative history argument that you make seems to have occurred only in a discussion of the nature of indemnity reinsurance dealing with the problem of double taxation of modified coinsurance agreements.
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,617.422,630.396,"Well, that proves our point, Justice O'Connor, in that Congress believed that the rules it otherwise prescribed in Part I of Subchapter L govern indemnity reinsurance just as they govern directly written insurance."
1988.88-396,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,730.309,732.909,"Yes, but there is this difference, and I wish you would comment on it a little bit."
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,759.376,759.828,Well--
1988.88-396,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,759.828,761.678,It's in effect a change in the purchase price.
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,761.678,765.898,"--Well, in a sense it is a price rebate, when you have just two parties involved."
1988.88-396,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,765.898,766.282,Right.
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,766.282,772.802,And we are not suggesting in any way that three parties is necessary to resolve this issue.
1988.88-396,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,796.334,797.784,May I ask you another question.
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,805.957,807.559,"Yes, it would be includible in--"
1988.88-396,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.559,809.909,"Your opponents don't disagree with that, do they?"
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,809.909,811.411,--Not as far as I'm aware.
1988.88-396,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,811.411,811.861,It's funny.
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,814.063,817.665,In a footnote in our reply brief we point that out.
1988.88-396,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,817.665,818.231,--Thank you.
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,823.402,825.771,"No, it cannot be."
1988.88-396,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,825.771,831.258,"Well, that's a difference also in this transaction and the policy of direct insurance, isn't it?"
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,834.627,835.127,I'm sorry.
1988.88-396,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,836.744,842.296,In your... in the case we're talking about can the reinsurance company cancel--
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,842.296,843.182,"I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy--"
1988.88-396,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,843.182,843.715,--the contract?
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,843.715,847.267,"--when you say reinsurance company, are you talking about the ceding company, the policyholder?"
1988.88-396,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,847.267,848.552,"No, not the ceding company."
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,852.004,859.842,The reinsurer cannot cancel any more than a life insurance company can cancel a life insurance policy that you've purchased.
1988.88-396,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,859.842,864.096,Right.
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,864.096,888.344,"If I may continue, the result which we urge in this case, the 809(c)(1) requirement that the ceding commission be excluded in full in the year in which it is paid, or, alternatively, that 809(d)(12) and Section 162 would require the same result, is totally consistent with the manner in which insurance companies would treat the commission under any NAIC accounting."
1988.88-396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,892.665,893.831,Ms. Chiechi--
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,893.831,895.031,"Yes, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1988.88-396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,895.031,902.687,"--In the government's brief and in your brief, too much is made of the distinction between indemnity reinsurance and assumption reinsurance."
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,917.613,920.815,Indemnity reinsurance is like directly written insurance.
1988.88-396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,925.017,926.467,It's really a novation between the second--
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,926.467,926.985,No.
1988.88-396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,928.735,929.152,--No?
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,929.152,936.991,"There is a separate insurance policy that is issued by the reinsurer in indemnity reinsurance to its policyholder, the ceding company."
1988.88-396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,959.523,960.79,That is a novation and--
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,960.79,961.19,--Yes.
1988.88-396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,961.19,962.808,--that is a new deal between--
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,962.808,963.575,Yes.
1988.88-396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,963.575,964.575,--the second insurance company and the policyholder.
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,964.575,964.975,Yes.
1988.88-396,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.277,965.86,Is it really a novation?
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,969.812,972.081,It is generally considered to be a novation.
1988.88-396,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.866,976.3,I would think so.
1988.88-396,0,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,976.3,977.735,--But generally it is--
1988.88-396,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.735,978.102,How can you--
1988.88-396,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,978.102,978.702,--considered--
1988.88-396,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,978.702,982.437,--You normally can't get out of a contract with me by just giving it to somebody else and writing me a letter saying you--
1988.88-396,2,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,982.437,986.84,"--If the policyholders consent, Justice Scalia, and there are in fact--"
1988.88-396,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.84,988.44,"--If they consent, then there would be a novation?"
1988.88-396,2,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,988.44,988.792,--Yes.
1988.88-396,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1178.683,1179.799,"Very well, Ms. Chiechi."
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1185.62,1188.738,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1212.87,1215.822,May I ask... because I want to be sure I find this out at the beginning.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1215.822,1216.172,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1216.172,1220.81,Is the receipt of the ceding commission taxable as ordinary income?
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1220.81,1222.943,To the ceding company it is.
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1223.628,1229.248,Then why isn't the government kind of getting... getting it both ways in a sense.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1229.248,1237.419,"Well, it's not unusual, your Honor, for a receipt of a payment for an asset to be taxable in full in the year that it's received."
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.002,1241.954,"No, but that would normally be taxable as a capital gains, of course."
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1256.397,1259.515,"--Well, I don't think that there is any necessary parallelism between them."
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1291.384,1292.484,--Can you give me another example?
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1305.692,1308.677,--I think you can imagine many situations that would be somewhat similar.
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.198,1315.75,Can you give me an example that happens in the real world?
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1315.75,1340.965,"--Well, take, for example, an auto company that sells cars and takes installment loans back from its customers and then discounts those loans away to a third party that purchases the loans today, giving the car company that sold the loans a slightly smaller amount of money than the face value of the loans to reflect the time value of the money."
1988.88-396,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1482.891,1496.066,"Well, I would think that your arguments could be made equally with regard to the original insurance company in the deduction of commissions."
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1508.724,1509.324,"That's correct, Justice--"
1988.88-396,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1509.324,1509.941,--of the commissions.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1509.941,1510.958,--O'Connor.
1988.88-396,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1527.083,1527.852,Right.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1527.852,1528.635,--materials that they are not to be.
1988.88-396,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1528.635,1543.612,"And you can read 809(c)(1), as the taxpayer reads it, as an indication that Congress likewise intended to make the same provision for reinsurance ceding commissions."
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1543.612,1551.801,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't think that there is anything in the background of 809(c)(1) or in its language that directly covers a ceding commission."
1988.88-396,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1551.801,1559.305,"Well, it says less return premiums and premiums and other consideration arising out of reinsurance ceded."
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1600.465,1604.001,"Well, let me make two points in response to that, Justice O'Connor."
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1710.57,1716.574,"Mr. Dreeben, what does that other phrase in... in (c)(1) mean in your estimation?"
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1722.961,1734.869,"That was designed, Justice Scalia, to cover the situation when the initial insurer pays money over to a second insurance company to obtain indemnity reinsurance."
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.521,1791.954,"Now, wait."
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1796.89,1798.406,"--Yes, that's correct, your Honor."
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.406,1800.092,I thought the money goes the other way.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1800.092,1802.508,"Well, in this transaction it does and that's we say that that--"
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1802.508,1804.294,When doesn't it?
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1804.294,1816.368,"--It doesn't, for example, when an insurance company purchases something called yearly renewable term reinsurance, which is much like what everybody thinks of as an insurance contract."
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1828.092,1832.027,But that is still considered reinsurance ceded--
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1832.027,1832.563,That's correct.
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1832.563,1836.681,--when you're buying just an annual renewable term policy?
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1836.681,1837.215,That's correct.
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.602,1843.985,Okay.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1843.985,1846.887,This is one and so is yearly renewable term.
1988.88-396,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1846.887,1854.91,"Can those payments by the initial insurer ever be called return premiums, or are they under this second clause that you're discussing?"
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1854.91,1857.345,"They're under the second clause, Justice Kennedy."
1988.88-396,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1898.339,1899.305,May I ask one other question?
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1899.305,1900.29,"Yes, Justice--"
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1900.29,1911.246,Would you agree that for some purposes the Code does draw a distinction between indemnity reinsurance transactions and assumption reinsurance transactions?
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1911.246,1912.996,"--Yes, it clearly does in several different places."
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1912.996,1924.82,"Does it... for example, in an assumption reinsurance transaction I take it the money received by the ceding company is not taxable as ordinary income."
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1925.354,1927.006,The money received--
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.006,1935.778,A ceding company... for something equivalent to a ceding commission would not be taxable in that transaction as ordinary income to the ceding company?
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1935.778,1936.062,--No.
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1937.178,1937.645,Put it in that--
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1937.645,1938.38,Yeah.
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1949.085,1959.227,"--So that even if it's a capital transaction, the selling company... the receipt of the ceding commission by the selling company would be ordinary income?"
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1959.227,1959.743,That's correct.
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1959.743,1960.177,I see.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1960.177,1975.32,"It's harder to say how the question would have come out had Congress not specifically written a rule that prevented these sales of insurance policies from being treated as capital gain, but it did that to avoid the favorable effects to the ceding companies in these--"
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.32,1982.508,Could you tell me one... just an example of a difference in tax treatment between the two kinds of transactions?
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1982.508,1984.342,--Between the assumption transactions--
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1984.342,1987.894,And the indemnity reinsurance.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1988.412,2002.756,"--Well, one difference that Petitioner has made much of is the provision under which a ceding company in either transaction can deduct its payments to the reinsurer."
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2033.108,2033.591,Right.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2033.591,2043.647,"--Pays some of them over to the reinsurer, and so he uses the same section of the Act to neutralize the effect of the receipt of those premiums."
1988.88-396,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2068.027,2081.022,Mr.... to say that the sections relied on by Petitioner have nothing to do with it... you don't deny that the language that we've been talking about could fairly be read to include those... just reading the language itself... do you?
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2081.022,2085.239,"--Well, I don't think so as to return premiums."
1988.88-396,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2113.743,2114.159,How about
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2117.611,2124.949,"Well, I think that that language is sufficiently flexible so that a lot of different readings could be given to it."
1988.88-396,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2153.468,2155.736,Do you set forth 809(d)(7) in your brief?
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2155.736,2156.286,--Yes.
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.157,2163.29,What a strange way to say it.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2171.079,2172.865,I think that the language--
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.865,2179.284,Arising out of... I would think that it... it reverses who is getting the consideration.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2179.284,2179.617,--Well--
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2179.617,2181.267,What a strange way to say it.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2181.267,2186.604,"--The language could probably have been written better by Congress to clarify its meaning, but--"
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.604,2188.104,If they meant what you say they meant.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2188.104,2202.899,"--Well, they clearly meant it too because they wrote in the legislative history discussing the (d)(7) section in absolutely unmistakable terms that it refers to a payment from an initial insurer over to a second company."
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.899,2206.601,And that's a consideration arising out of... right?
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2206.601,2206.984,Yes.
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2206.984,2208.886,All right.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2219.075,2220.944,"No, I don't think so, Justice O'Connor."
1988.88-396,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2220.944,2222.827,"Well, you can sure read it that way."
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2226.68,2229.466,"Well, there's several points."
1988.88-396,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2363.969,2377.277,"In any of the five tax court decisions that gave a ruling in favor of the Petitioner, did the tax court rely on the second clause, the ""arising out of"" clause?"
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2377.277,2378.395,"No, Justice Kennedy."
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2452.508,2459.03,But isn't there the distinction that Justice Scalia mentioned earlier?
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2467.953,2469.136,"That's true, Justice Stevens."
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2526.722,2533.276,"Of course, I think one could argue in the same way, that they should treat the two kinds of reinsurance as the same for all purposes."
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2534.812,2540.799,"Well, there are reasons to distinguish between them based on the fact that the forms of the transactions do have some differences."
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.511,2565.081,"Well, it is understood... or, agreed by both parties that Congress really didn't think much about ceding commissions?"
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2565.081,2567.764,"Well, I think it's fair to say that Congress did not think a lot--"
1988.88-396,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2567.764,2567.964,Yes.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2567.964,2584.143,"--about ceding commissions, and that really undermines the suggestion that the broad and open-ended language of 809(c)(1) be read to cover a problem that Congress never really had in mind when it clearly had other problems that it was deliberately writing to address."
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2720.765,2723.967,I'm fascinated with this language of (c)(1).
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2762.906,2768.309,--This would be a payment that covers years for which premiums have not yet been--
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2768.309,2768.475,Not yet been paid.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2768.475,2768.842,--received?
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2768.842,2769.909,Right.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2769.909,2775.963,I would think that it would have to treat it as a deferred expense and not deduct it all in the year in which it paid it.
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2788.187,2788.521,All right.
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2788.521,2791.539,"So, that I do not think would be a permissible result."
1988.88-396,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.539,2795.127,And that... that's consistent with your position at the other end?
1988.88-396,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2795.127,2806.249,"Yes, I think so, because at the other end it's simply saying that the ceding commission reflects identifiable benefits over many years so it has to be allocated to the years in which the benefit is produced."
1988.88-396,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2807.367,2809.034,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1988.88-396,4,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,2810.986,2814.088,"Yes, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1988.88-396,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2865.973,2866.373,Excuse me.
1988.88-396,4,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,2866.373,2867.139,"--Yes, Justice."
1988.88-396,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2867.139,2878.547,The government points out that Congress has explicitly provided that you do not treat agent's commissions the way the government urges this ought to be treated.
1988.88-396,4,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,2878.547,2892.104,"The reason why... what the counsel said was that the reason why directly written expenses are currently deductible is because of some provision in the Congressional legislative history of Part I, Subchapter L."
1988.88-396,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2942.121,2946.675,"Yes, but you keep going by the fact that the agent's commission is paid to a third party."
1988.88-396,4,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,2954.714,2957.899,"It's different, but it's not relevant to the determination here."
1988.88-396,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2960.618,2963.001,It does seem like a discount from the purchase price of--
1988.88-396,4,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,2963.001,2963.803,--And a price rebate.
1988.88-396,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2974.158,2978.479,"--But you can't deduct all of the purchase price in one year, can you?"
1988.88-396,4,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,2990.037,2992.27,But that's not what indemnity reinsurance is about.
1988.88-396,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3008.999,3011.967,"But, surely you're paying money for something."
1988.88-396,4,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,3018.871,3023.675,"--It got in return the issuance of insurance, and that was the cost of issuing that insurance."
1988.88-396,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3045.791,3056.896,"But it's not as if the indemnity... it's not as if transport were itself an insured in the same way that the policyholder in a single deal is an insured, is it?"
1988.88-396,4,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,3056.896,3069.204,"With due respect, transport is as much a policyholder of the reinsurer Colonial as you or I would be policyholders of an insurance contract with an insurance company."
1988.88-396,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3106.025,3111.112,What makes it hard to go along with you is you say buys the reinsurance.
1988.88-396,4,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,3130.157,3132.191,"Well, it's in a sense a price rebate."
1988.88-396,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3134.81,3141.964,--It's a price... I know of no price rebate that is... that is so extensive that the purchaser gets money when he goes in.
1988.88-396,4,18601,carolyn_p_chiechi,,3151.82,3158.675,--The Commissioner's counsel suggests repeatedly that there needs to be some specific provision to allow the deduction which we seek here.
1988.88-396,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3214.342,3215.678,"Thank you, Ms. Chiechi."
