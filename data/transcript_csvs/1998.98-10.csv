1998.98-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.026,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 98-10, Jefferson County, Alabama v. William Acker."
1998.98-10,0,32793,jeffrey_m_sewell,,10.538,13.322,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,49.423,58.9,"Well, in this case, Mr. Sewell, the... the county brought the action in State court, didn't it, to collect the taxes?"
1998.98-10,0,32793,jeffrey_m_sewell,,58.9,59.331,"Yes, sir."
1998.98-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,59.331,65.063,And then the defendants... the judges removed it to Federal court.
1998.98-10,0,32793,jeffrey_m_sewell,,65.063,65.635,That's right.
1998.98-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,65.635,79.163,"And so, it... you say at that point the Tax Injunction Act applied to prevent the State from... from collecting a tax?"
1998.98-10,0,32793,jeffrey_m_sewell,,79.163,90.342,I say that the Tax Injunction Act ought to apply to a tax collection case whether it's removed by a defendant by a taxpayer to Federal court or whether we had brought the case ourself in Federal court.
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,956.971,962.223,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-10,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1052.303,1058.718,But the way the tax is designed is that you are... it is illegal to engage in the duties unless you pay the tax.
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1062.861,1063.76,I don't--
1998.98-10,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1063.76,1070.225,There... there is a prohibition to... against engaging on the duties themselves.
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1070.225,1076.539,"--What it really says is it's unlawful to do it without paying the tax, and then you have to see what that means."
1998.98-10,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1083.979,1090.273,Does it matter at all that under State law the county is prohibited from imposing an income tax?
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1092.063,1092.323,--Not on--
1998.98-10,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1092.323,1092.844,They can't do it.
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1094.286,1095.635,"--Well, let's go right to the merits."
1998.98-10,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1098.879,1103.263,I think the removal argument is tangled up a little bit with--
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1103.263,1108.629,"--Well, it shouldn't be because the... there is no question that they... they need to show a colorable Federal defense."
1998.98-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1126.521,1129.245,--Some judges in this jurisdiction have paid the tax.
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1139.142,1145.798,I just don't think Federal duties apply in any direction on... on the private decision about paying your tax on your personal income.
1998.98-10,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1150.642,1168.624,It seems to me a Federal judge could have taken the position that it is simply unlawful to condition under State law my performance of my Federal powers and exercise of my Federal responsibility.
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1174.558,1181.323,"If... we have... in deciding whether removal is proper, you have to look at what case was brought in State court."
1998.98-10,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1197.635,1210.093,"Well, here the judges I suppose could have taken the position that the... that the disposition of the case that was brought was simply a... a predicate to what could have been an injunction against their performance of their... their Federal responsibilities."
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1210.093,1211.783,"Well, I don't think it is a predicate to an injunction."
1998.98-10,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1216.376,1217.017,Why not?
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1217.017,1231.897,"Well, if for no other reasons, inequity wouldn't... the legal remedy of collecting the tax is sufficient, but beyond that, what this tax says is what's unlawful... what happens when it's unlawful and the tax isn't paid is interest and penalties."
1998.98-10,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1233.569,1243.644,"Well, it provides for interest and penalties, but I suppose if there is arguably a prohibition against the exercise of the... of the professional responsibilities, State equity would... would enforce it."
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1243.644,1251.551,"If this... again, if the State... if the suit in State court arose in connection with that act, that would be the act at issue in the removal."
1998.98-10,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1258.895,1264.669,"Well, just... just... on... on that point, in... this district has multiple locations."
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1273.555,1283.391,"--That may well be and it may well be true too that when a Federal judge goes to different States... I mean, an appellate judge goes to different States, he might become subject to their taxes also."
1998.98-10,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1285.013,1294.519,Doesn't it say on... the language of it is it is called a license fee for the privilege of engaging in or following such vocation or occupation.
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1301.263,1304.606,--The... this issue is already well plowed in this Court's cases.
1998.98-10,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1313.722,1313.993,No.
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1319.238,1322.541,"Well, the tax doesn't have to be an income tax to be valid."
1998.98-10,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1335.591,1337.13,Or gross receipts.
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1337.13,1342.354,"Yes, and... well, income as used in the broadest sense, as near as we can tell from looking at that statute."
1998.98-10,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1376.417,1377.619,Do you have any thoughts on the merits?
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1377.619,1381.42,"That's what I was kind of working on there, Justice Scalia."
1998.98-10,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1461.847,1476.107,"Mr. Jones, if we should agree with you about that issue on the merits, what about the issue that the Eleventh Circuit didn't decide and that is the diminution of compensation?"
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1477.338,1489.507,"Well, the O'Malley v. Woodrough, the Court held that... that a tax on the incomes of Federal judges would not be a diminishment of their compensation for Article III purposes."
1998.98-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1489.507,1495.551,"--Mr. Jones, I don't think the tax in Michigan discriminated against the Federal workers because they were Federal workers."
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1501.984,1507.686,"It did discriminate on the basis of sovereignty, though, and I believe you dissented in this case."
1998.98-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.686,1507.916,I did.
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1509.799,1512.15,It's the majority's view is what I was trying to describe.
1998.98-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1512.791,1513.092,Yes.
1998.98-10,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1528.934,1535.057,"It's certainly cited, if not in our brief, in one of the briefs."
1998.98-10,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.482,1542.673,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
1998.98-10,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1544.555,1549.679,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-10,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1650.495,1653.089,You do not cite decisions that are only 2 years old?
1998.98-10,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1653.429,1662.256,"--Your Honor, I... I didn't think of it until I saw what their reply brief said, and that... I wasn't sure that it was going to come up until I was actually preparing for my argument today."
1998.98-10,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1668.199,1673.774,"If it is, it's pretty important because the Court would then have an obligation to remand on its own."
1998.98-10,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1673.774,1674.704,--That is correct.
1998.98-10,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1674.704,1680.427,"And in Caterpillar, that was... going in, that was recognized that this Court should have remanded."
1998.98-10,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1694.128,1698.57,But in this case they were never asked to remand on the grounds of 1442(a)(3).
1998.98-10,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1716.185,1724.07,I don't follow that because I don't think the tax collector in Alabama could originally have brought this case in Federal court.
1998.98-10,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1731.727,1733.647,"--I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1998.98-10,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1759.214,1763.817,"And even if you're wrong about that, there's enough... it's an arguable--"
1998.98-10,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1763.817,1764.606,Yes.
1998.98-10,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1764.606,1765.197,--proposition--
1998.98-10,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1765.197,1779.118,"And as this Court has said on many occasions, the... one should not confuse the issue of jurisdiction with the issue of the merits, and that... and that so long as we have a colorable Federal immunity defense, we would... we would be able to be in court."
1998.98-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.339,1798.212,--I... I don't think that's confusing jurisdiction with the merits.
1998.98-10,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1811.894,1814.846,"--Well, I agree with that, Your Honor."
1998.98-10,3,32793,jeffrey_m_sewell,,3239.932,3240.573,"Yes, sir."
1998.98-10,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3325.734,3326.465,Mr. Sewell--
1998.98-10,3,32793,jeffrey_m_sewell,,3326.465,3326.895,"Yes, ma'am."
1998.98-10,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3326.895,3331.347,--what about the argument that this discriminates against Federal employees?
1998.98-10,3,32793,jeffrey_m_sewell,,3334.749,3336.762,"If that were so, there would be, but that's not so."
1998.98-10,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3362.922,3369.905,"The point on discrimination I think is not... one point is that it's unlawful because of that, but the other is that it just... it helps to characterize the tax."
1998.98-10,3,32793,jeffrey_m_sewell,,3381.625,3398.277,"My response is, is that Kentucky also prohibits its cities by State law from levying an income tax, and that all of the exemptions, the exemptions for insurance companies and the others, in... in the ordinance that this Court considered in Howard... those other exemptions... my understanding is, when you go back... you've got the ordinance."
1998.98-10,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3402.891,3407.132,"Of course, Holloway was decided long before Davis against Michigan."
1998.98-10,3,32793,jeffrey_m_sewell,,3407.132,3408.874,You mean Howard?
1998.98-10,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3435.464,3440.779,"Well, was Federal immunity argued other than the fact that it was a former enclave?"
1998.98-10,3,32793,jeffrey_m_sewell,,3440.779,3442.95,I think that... that there--
1998.98-10,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3442.95,3443.971,Maybe that question almost answers itself.
1998.98-10,3,32793,jeffrey_m_sewell,,3444.772,3445.163,--I think it answers.
1998.98-10,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3458.203,3459.414,"Thank you, Mr. Sewell."
1998.98-10,3,32793,jeffrey_m_sewell,,3459.414,3460.247,--Thank you.
1998.98-10,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3460.247,3461.497,The case is submitted.
