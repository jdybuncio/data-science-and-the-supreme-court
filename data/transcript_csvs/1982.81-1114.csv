1982.81-1114,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.637,We will hear arguments next in the case of Illinois versus Abbott & Associates.
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,61.41,63.394,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-1114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,230.138,239.325,"Suppose the Attorney General came back and said, we don't have a transcript of the... what happened before the grand jury any more."
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,261.471,267.701,"Well, I think we first have to address the question of whether it is part of the investigative files or other materials of the Attorney General."
1982.81-1114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,267.701,276.573,"Well, suppose the Attorney General says, we just don't have a transcript any more now, and let's just assume that's correct, that's accurate, he's telling the truth."
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,276.573,277.447,Okay.
1982.81-1114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,286.961,289.725,You mean they're not in the possession of the court?
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,289.725,291.66,"--No, I don't believe they're in the possession of the court."
1982.81-1114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,293.286,313.871,"Well, so you're saying that if a transcript of the testimony is in the hands of the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division or the Attorney General, you're entitled to it under this statute with no court proceedings at all, but if the same transcript is in the possession of the court you have to make some showing?"
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,313.871,316.105,"No, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,322.228,324.743,Do you need to be that elaborate to answer the question?
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,324.743,336.08,"--No, I just meant to go to the next point, which is that the ""extent permitted by law"" language raises the question of by what standard the court should release the materials."
1982.81-1114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,342.03,355.573,"So that if the material, if the transcript, the physical transcript, is in the possession of the Justice Department, the Justice Department must join you in going to court even though it has physical possession, is that right?"
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,355.573,356.618,"Yes, that is correct."
1982.81-1114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,356.618,358.821,"You say you don't even need to go to court, do you?"
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,360.459,365.754,"We do not say, we have never said, that it is automatic disclosure upon demand."
1982.81-1114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,365.754,369.537,"Well then, what sort of an inquiry would the court make in that case?"
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,369.537,376.252,"We believe that the court should inquire, first of all, what reasons for secrecy remain in the transcripts, in the documents."
1982.81-1114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,376.252,378.58,Where do you get that out of the statute?
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,382.141,384.765,"By the language ""extent permitted by law""."
1982.81-1114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,384.765,386.78,And what do you think that refers to?
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,386.78,395.414,"We believe that refers to Rule 6(e), which indicates that a court may disclose materials preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding."
1982.81-1114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,406.723,411.736,May I ask this question.
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,420.203,421.7,Yes.
1982.81-1114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,421.7,426.496,"And if Rule 6(e) contains a particularized need requirement, you must meet it."
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,426.496,431.699,We believe that the particularized need requirement arose in cases involving--
1982.81-1114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,431.699,433.259,"Involving private parties, not public."
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,441.802,449.908,"--Well, we believe you need the Hart... well, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act is designed to state the Congressional purpose, to state to whom the materials--"
1982.81-1114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,449.908,451.956,It tells the Attorney General what he has to do on your request.
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,464.294,470.246,"--The statute is an expression of Congressional intent, not only with respect to grand jury materials--"
1982.81-1114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,470.246,472.807,"Well, I'm just interested in grand jury materials at this point."
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,472.807,479.273,"--That's why we need the statute, because the Congress has indicated the intention, the reasons why, for national antitrust enforcement--"
1982.81-1114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,479.273,485.551,"Well, do you concede that without the statute you couldn't get these materials under 6(e) without a showing of particularized need?"
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,485.551,487.302,--That is correct.
1982.81-1114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,494.111,496.314,If you did not have this statute--
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,496.314,497.062,Yes.
1982.81-1114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,497.062,503.201,"--and you merely went before the court on a 6(e) motion, would you have to show particularized need?"
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,503.201,516.506,"We believe that it is not only because we are a public entity, but also because the Congress with respect to this specific matter has indicated an intent that the materials be turned over."
1982.81-1114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,516.506,518.037,"Well, you still haven't answered my question."
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,520.022,520.631,Yes.
1982.81-1114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,520.631,528.629,"--before the Act was passed, there's an open question as to what showing a public agency such as the Illinois Attorney General must make under 6(e)."
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,529.893,530.766,"Oh, I see."
1982.81-1114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,530.766,536.358,"--if there were no Hart-Rodino Act, could you get these materials just without showing particularized need."
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,536.358,538.593,I believe that we may be able to do that.
1982.81-1114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,540.106,540.999,"If that's true, why do you need the statute?"
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,540.999,552.837,"--We need the statute because the statute quite clearly states that in this regard, with respect to antitrust enforcement by the states, Congress has indicated a compelling need in the balance for determining--"
1982.81-1114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.837,554.366,Let me phrase the question differently.
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,559.879,561.018,"--Yes, we believe that."
1982.81-1114,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,561.018,564.099,Lessens it?
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,566.533,585.496,"Yes, we believe that the showing of need for disclosure has been demonstrated by Congress, has been supplied by Congress; and you balance that against what reasons remain with respect to the particular materials in the file which countervailingly--"
1982.81-1114,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,585.496,587.774,You have to do more than just make the motion.
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,587.774,589.493,--Pardon me?
1982.81-1114,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,589.493,592.382,You have to do more than just make a motion.
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,592.382,592.913,Yes.
1982.81-1114,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,599.584,602.692,"Well, that's what Justice Stevens was trying... just what do you have to show?"
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,602.692,617.265,"We have to show that the materials are relevant to a potential cause of action of the United States... of the state attorney general, and that the reasons for secrecy are no longer viable."
1982.81-1114,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,617.265,623.544,"Is this to save you the time, save the state the time of calling its own grand jury, calling in the same witnesses?"
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,623.544,635.288,"That is the exact purpose of the statute, to... Congress did more than simply confer standing on state attorneys general."
1982.81-1114,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,683.907,700.184,"On the need for secrecy inquiry of the court, I suppose some of the people most concerned, who might want to oppose the disclosure, would be people who may have been questioned before the grand jury but weren't indicted, for example."
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,709.898,713.115,"Justice O'Connor, in this case they were notified."
1982.81-1114,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,729.045,731.622,Certainly there's nothing in the statute about that--
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,731.622,733.887,I believe that--
1982.81-1114,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,733.887,735.311,--and we don't really address that problem.
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,735.311,751.896,"--There's nothing in the statute, but I think the common procedure under Rule 6(e) is to, at least in my experience, is to contact all interested parties, which would include not only witnesses but also defendants in a particular case in which the materials are sought to be used."
1982.81-1114,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,787.179,802.437,"Mr. Genovese, would you mind addressing how you think that the particularized need standard would require the state to do more than inquire into relevance and the need for secrecy?"
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,808.169,819.774,"As a practical matter, 4F(b) was designed to disclose to the Attorney General before he filed a case whether he had a case and to assist him in bringing the action."
1982.81-1114,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,823.725,826.068,"No existing judicial proceeding, in other words?"
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,826.068,826.552,Right.
1982.81-1114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,927.856,939.259,"Mr. Genovese, in respect to Section (b) of Section 15f, which is the one we're talking about, I take it."
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,959.216,973.727,"Well, I think it entitles the United States Attorney General to raise within the context of Rule 6(e) remaining interests in secrecy which he may have or may want to assert--"
1982.81-1114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,973.727,987.817,"Supposing that what you're seeking isn't grand jury testimony, but notes of an interview that the Government took, not under a subpoena but just with a witness, and the Attorney General says, I just want to protect this witness, I'm not going to turn it over to you."
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,990.752,993.938,--If the law permits it he could.
1982.81-1114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,993.938,996.968,"Well, what law do you turn to to decide whether it permits it?"
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,996.968,1007.06,"In a situation where, for example, a proffer, the Government is apparently unsure whether that is covered by Rule 6(e)."
1982.81-1114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1042.026,1053.21,"Well, there you leave open the possibility that the Attorney General and the state attorney general would be almost adversaries, I suppose, and the Attorney General would raise the question of work product, and then what, some court would have to decide that?"
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,1053.21,1060.849,It could happen that on occasion the state attorney general and the United States Attorney General could be adversaries with respect to a particular matter.
1982.81-1114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1060.849,1063.692,What sort of a court proceeding would you have to resolve that?
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,1063.692,1071.909,I think that in a situation where materials have not been disclosed it could be a mandamus action.
1982.81-1114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1143.519,1152.344,"Well, it would certainly leave you with access to the Attorney General's files that weren't submitted to the grand jury, that he wouldn't otherwise have to give you."
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,1152.344,1157.527,"Well, I would believe that that may very well be disclosable to a private party."
1982.81-1114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1164.042,1168.398,"Well, but I think the Attorney General has had a policy of not disclosing to anybody, hasn't he?"
1982.81-1114,0,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,1168.398,1174.708,"No, I don't believe that's... I'm not sure if the Attorney General has a policy with respect to that."
1982.81-1114,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1174.708,1178.786,"We'll resume there at 1:00 o'clock, counsel."
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1203.197,1206.43,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-1114,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1293.661,1297.471,"That assumes, of course, that they're in the possession of the Attorney General."
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1297.471,1298.204,--Exactly.
1982.81-1114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1312.902,1314.997,"Where is that cited in the briefs, Mr. Wilkins?"
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1314.997,1319.134,I'm not aware that that is cited in the briefs.
1982.81-1114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1319.134,1320.417,"It's Rule 6(c), in any event?"
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1320.417,1321.18,Rule 6(e).
1982.81-1114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1321.18,1321.93,6(e).
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1321.93,1324.444,"It's Rule 6(e)(1) under ""Recording of Proceedings""."
1982.81-1114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1334.689,1342.324,But the Attorney General isn't free to deal with these materials like he might some other materials.
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1342.324,1344.34,"No, he isn't."
1982.81-1114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1344.34,1346.04,He's the custodian.
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1346.04,1347.807,"Exactly, he is the custodian."
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1378.044,1388.088,"Mr. Wilkins, on that point, do you agree that there... what is your position on my question as to whether the statute amended the standards under Rule 6(e)?"
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1388.088,1399.175,"--Justice Stevens, we do not believe that the statute necessarily amended or, as Respondents state, repealed Rule 6(e)."
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1401.191,1403.675,Does it modify the standard?
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1403.675,1407.657,--It modifies the standard as applied to state attorney generals.
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1411.392,1416.341,"Would you agree, then, that before the statute was passed the state attorney general had to meet the particularized need showing?"
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1416.341,1421.637,"--I'm not certain, because I don't know whether that test would apply to private... would apply to a public official."
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1421.637,1431.162,In part of your brief you argue that Congress in effect adopted pre-existing law; they legislated with knowledge of what the law was with respect to the state attorney generals' right of access.
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1434.114,1440.253,"No, I'm stating that the compelling and particularized need test had been developed and applied only to private parties."
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1456.919,1464.386,"Well, if he doesn't have to meet that test, then he doesn't need the statute."
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1464.386,1482.519,"No, we believe, whatever the standard would be appropriate without the statute, we believe that Section 4F(b) is a weighty Congressional policy in favor of disclosure that a court should properly consider in the Rule 6(e) balance, and because of that weighty consideration the compelling and particularized need test is not a proper standard."
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1482.519,1488.61,"Then you say it does amend... you say it does amend, it silently amends the 6(e) standard with respect to state attorney generals?"
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1488.61,1491.359,"In a way, although it doesn't really amend the standard."
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.461,1507.913,You think the words
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1527.593,1531.482,Congress was clearly aware that Rule 6(e) existed.
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1560.798,1567.532,"You don't think it's a fair summary of the legislative history to say that Congress felt, well, whatever 6(e) requires, it still requires?"
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1567.532,1583.259,"No, I don't think that that's a clear... that's a fair... The court below threw out, as we said, Rule... or Section 4F(b) and failed to take it in consideration in its balancing test under Rule 6(e)."
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1638.956,1644.138,"Mr. Wilkins, is that true after the passage of this statute would authorize the civil investigative demands?"
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1644.138,1644.688,Yes.
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1649.387,1658.679,"But is it not true that if you accumulated a lot of information pursuant to a CID and you got the consent of the people from whom you got the information, that would be voluminous material in your files that you--"
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1658.679,1660.259,"That would be voluminous, yes."
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1673.315,1676.703,--But the statute is not limited to criminal material.
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1679.783,1680.313,Right.
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.228,1691.602,With the consent of the party providing the material.
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1695.288,1695.807,Exactly.
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1695.807,1697.055,That could be a lot of material.
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1697.055,1698.649,It could be a lot of material.
1982.81-1114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1827.048,1830.907,How about the possibility the Government might want to bring civil action?
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1830.907,1834.827,--Which government would want to bring a civil action?
1982.81-1114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1834.827,1835.919,The United States.
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1835.919,1843.402,"The United States could use the grand jury materials in a civil action, in this Court's prior decision in--"
1982.81-1114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1843.402,1851.506,"No, but would that be a reason that the Attorney General might not want to turn over as of that point to state attorneys general the transcript of the grand jury?"
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1851.506,1869.373,"--It's possible that would be a consideration, but our current position is that we would fully cooperate and turn over materials after the conclusion of the criminal proceeding, notwithstanding that we had a parallel civil action."
1982.81-1114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.373,1876.95,"Under the Act, when the Attorney General turns something over like grand jury materials, is there any stricture on its use?"
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1876.95,1883.306,There can be strictures on their use imposed and protective orders imposed by the court.
1982.81-1114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1889.615,1890.571,Does he have to give them back?
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1890.571,1894.787,"--Yes, that's commonly a requirement, that it has to be returned."
1982.81-1114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1894.787,1896.319,To whom they may disclose it?
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1896.319,1899.879,"To who, who within his own office he may disclose it to."
1982.81-1114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1904.659,1906.984,Can they be used for taking depositions?
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1906.984,1909.701,"Yes, they could be used for taking depositions."
1982.81-1114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1909.701,1910.641,"Well, that makes it pretty public, doesn't it?"
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1910.641,1912.373,Not necessarily.
1982.81-1114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.373,1919.84,"Well, if you ask... if you're going to ask somebody a question and then you say, well, did you really answer, answer the same way before the grand jury."
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1919.84,1921.166,It would become public at that point.
1982.81-1114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1936.597,1939.596,You mean that's all it takes to show particularized need for a private plaintiff?
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1939.596,1943.58,Many of the cases demonstrate that that is sufficient.
1982.81-1114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1943.58,1944.704,No case from this Court.
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1944.704,1958.059,"Cases from this Court indicate... for example, this case in... this Court in Douglas Petrol Stops cited with approval the Seventh Circuit's decision in Sarbaugh, State of Illinois v. Sarbaugh."
1982.81-1114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1959.307,1967.243,Procter & Gamble and the leading cases from this Court addressing that inquiry certainly don't suggest that that result should obtain.
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1967.243,1979.176,"--No, but if you read the decisions of this Court, the continuing line and progression... for example, the Dennis case is only factually distinguishable, for example, from Pittsburg Plate & Glass--"
1982.81-1114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.176,1981.753,"Well, what's the big hassle about, then?"
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1981.753,1982.564,--Because the state--
1982.81-1114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.564,1984.548,It doesn't sound like much of a hurdle anyway.
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1984.548,1989.7,"--Now, it is a hassle to this extent: The state needs this information."
1982.81-1114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.713,1999.277,"If you're going to have to go to court, you're going to have to go to court anyway."
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2001.274,2003.118,"--No, we don't."
1982.81-1114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2003.118,2005.617,So you're going to have to go to court and get him to rule on it.
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2009.272,2014.942,"Yes, but it does frustrate Congress' determination that the state should have this material at the very outset."
1982.81-1114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.942,2015.566,What does?
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2015.566,2018.518,Requiring the state to meet a compelling and particularized need test.
1982.81-1114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2018.518,2027.545,"Well, why not if it... it isn't very compelling and particularized if all you have to do is say, we need it for a deposition, we need it to impeach or--"
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2027.545,2038.214,"You nevertheless have to have already brought a legal proceeding, and Section 4F(b) proceeds on the assumption that the states will have that information before they bring that proceeding."
1982.81-1114,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2038.214,2050.927,"--Could the Federal Government put limits such as this, that you may use the substance of this testimony but you may not disclose the name of the person who gave it?"
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2056.783,2060.094,"You mean, could we make that and then turn it over?"
1982.81-1114,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2062.266,2072.198,Suppose they made a claim and some showing to the district judge in camera that the life of the witness might be jeopardized.
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2077.259,2088.331,"--Certainly we could, pursuant to a court order, we could certainly make those kinds of... we could make those kinds of deletions to preserve interests in grand jury secrecy, certainly."
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.735,2095.237,May I ask one other question?
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2102.575,2105.214,Who gets notice of--
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2105.214,2105.885,Yes.
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2111.041,2119.241,"--My understanding is that the common practice under Rule 6(e) is to notify other parties involved, who are implicated or involved before the grand jury."
1982.81-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2119.241,2122.209,"Grand jury witnesses and defendants in the criminal case, that sort of thing."
1982.81-1114,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2122.209,2123.129,Yes.
1982.81-1114,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2124.88,2130.297,Mr. Nash.
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2130.297,2131.908,May it please the Court:
1982.81-1114,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2211.047,2213.095,Does it require a pending lawsuit?
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2221.355,2222.278,No.
1982.81-1114,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2231.259,2244.595,"Well, the response that was given this morning was that the particularized need standard did require, in the cases that have applied it, a pending suit, not just the application to the court under Rule 6(e)."
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2244.595,2257.967,"--In 6(e), 6(e), the disclosure provisions are subject to there being a current judicial proceeding or preliminary to a judicial proceeding."
1982.81-1114,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2274.831,2279.472,"Under the Rules of Civil Procedure, I don't suppose it's any superhuman feat to file a lawsuit."
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2279.472,2280.611,None.
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.597,2404.573,"You think, then, that 4F(b) just wasn't intended to work any change with respect to grand jury minutes?"
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2404.573,2405.153,Exactly.
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.585,2417.461,"Well, what did it do?"
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2422.601,2430.86,"--It affects... well, the Antitrust Division manual spells out other types of information which the Government has available."
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.978,2454.256,"They gather an awful lot of information just outside the grand jury, I suppose."
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2454.256,2462.364,"--There's a great deal of information available, and we should not consider the fact that only 19 pages exist in this case--"
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.364,2465.737,What did Congress think it was doing in 4F(b)?
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2469.251,2470.284,--Yes.
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.284,2472.514,"--available before the Act was passed, or wasn't it?"
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2472.514,2472.845,No.
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.845,2474.936,The Attorney General would just withhold it?
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2474.936,2480.591,"Well, the Attorney General had it within his discretion to make it available or not to make it available."
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2480.591,2482.075,So 4F(b) removed that discretion.
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2482.075,2482.777,Absolutely.
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.993,2507.22,"Well, what would you think if the Attorney General had a series of regulations that dealt with the availability of his investigative files aside from grand jury, and everybody agrees those regulations were within his authority to issue under the controlling statutes."
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2523.292,2529.493,"I'm not sure to recognize those regulations, but it mandated the availability of those materials to a state attorney general."
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2529.493,2530.912,Despite the regulations?
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2530.912,2533.116,Despite the regulations.
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.116,2534.801,Which had the force of law.
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2534.801,2535.444,Pardon me?
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.444,2536.879,Which had the force of law.
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2536.879,2540.818,"Well, I don't know that those regulations existed beforehand."
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.095,2556.81,"No, but you have to, in order to reach those non-jury files that the Attorney General used to refuse to turn over pursuant to a regulation, you would have to get rid of the regulation."
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2561.478,2562.121,--It does.
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2562.823,2564.604,Why doesn't it override 6(b)?
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2564.604,2565.759,--Pardon me?
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.759,2567.509,Why didn't it override 6(b)?
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2567.509,2571.631,"Well, there's no reference to 6(e) in the--"
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2571.631,2572.598,"6(e), yes."
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2572.598,2573.585,--in the efforts.
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.903,2686.6,"I take it the submission of your colleagues on the other side is that 4F(b) amended, in effect amended 6(e)--"
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2686.6,2687.63,I think--
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2687.63,2689.818,"--which is the statute, which is the statute."
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2689.818,2690.645,"--Yes, yes."
1982.81-1114,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2701.641,2711.324,"Well, that may be, but their submission is that 6(e) wasn't the same animal after this, after 4F(b), as it was before."
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2711.324,2712.307,--That's correct.
1982.81-1114,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2895.154,2915.662,"Well, if you concede that Congress meant to give some help to state attorneys general by the provisions of 4(b) and you say that the phrase ""investigative files or other materials"" doesn't include grand jury testimony, is there some way of telling from this record just how much help that would be?"
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,2923.409,2928.296,The only ones that know what the Government possesses is the Government.
1982.81-1114,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3010.591,3014.779,Was that manual statement made after the enactment of 4(b)?
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,3014.779,3015.871,Yes.
1982.81-1114,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3022.134,3041.299,"So then you understand the Government, the United States Government, to take the position that saying that the Attorney General shall make available to the state attorney general to the extent permitted by law allows the United States Attorney General some discretion, even though it's not grand jury?"
1982.81-1114,2,36421,michael_b_nash,,3041.299,3049.937,"They may allow them certainly some discretion, and there are areas that readily come to mind... the confidential informant, this Court's decision in Roviaro."
1982.81-1114,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3261.676,3266.067,You have a minute and a half remaining.
1982.81-1114,3,42710,thomas_m_genovese,,3266.067,3276.203,"Very quickly, I think there's a tremendous gap between what Congress was attempting to accomplish when it passed Section 4F(b) and how Respondents interpret the statute."
1982.81-1114,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3341.456,3342.657,"Thank you, gentlemen."
