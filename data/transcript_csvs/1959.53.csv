1959.53,0,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,43.204,66.793,"Mr. Chief Justice and honorable associate Justices, the petitioner in this case is a railroad employee, a yard conductor, who was injured while attempting to carry out his duties incident to a switching movement at the Ford Assembly Plant in North of Virginia."
1959.53,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,442.328,454.432,"Just before you leave the haste waste -- haste makes waste point, was there any evidence of the record that he was -- that he was hurrying unduly or hurrying in -- in descending that ladder?"
1959.53,0,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,454.432,461.938,Yes sir there -- there is.
1959.53,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,480.396,482.128,"Where in -- where in the record is that, fifty --"
1959.53,0,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,482.128,494.378,That in the -- in the record is page 51 if I'm not mistaken.
1959.53,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,629.953,635.181,Well what was the evidence that heading to that condition caused or contributed to cause of the --
1959.53,0,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,635.181,674.522,"Dr. Thiemeyer, if the Court pleases testify that -- just -- on page 31, force exerted on an obliquity -- obliquity usually offers more stress, more force."
1959.53,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,734.066,735.94,FELA?
1959.53,0,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,735.94,748.996,"Federal Employees Liability Act, I apologize for the abbreviation F-E-L-A, the FELA Act, Federal Employees Liability Act if Your Honor please."
1959.53,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,777.178,782.28,He would have fallen on a part that before he hit the ground if the surface had been flat?
1959.53,0,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,782.28,785.541,By about 6 inches if Your Honor please.
1959.53,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,803.593,804.415,Mr. Howell.
1959.53,0,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,804.415,807.658,Yes sir?
1959.53,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,807.658,819.202,Did he happen to announce that -- are you like -- that the railroad must under the doctrine that forced the ability so cushioned its right of away against the possibility that someone might fall off this car and get hurt.
1959.53,0,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,819.978,822.172,They do not have to cushion it if Your Honor please --
1959.53,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,822.172,822.789,What do they do?
1959.53,0,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,822.789,826.56,-- but they do have to make it level because a --
1959.53,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,826.56,828.083,In all places?
1959.53,0,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,828.083,840.78,At all places in a -- where a shifting operation and a switching yard for a man who is going to have to descend -- the braking and coupling was many times during a shifting operation into an assembly plant.
1959.53,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,863.42,869.652,"So that if a man should by accident fall off a car, he'll have smooth surface at least."
1959.53,0,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,869.652,870.763,That's where I'm going.
1959.53,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,871.85,873.032,I know.
1959.53,0,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,873.032,877.195,Now I want to proceed to the point that I think is much more intriguing.
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1263.106,1312.701,"Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Associate Justices; before I get too involved and forget it I would like to point out in reply to the question just put forth by Mr. Justice Harlan that in the record on page 47, Mr. Goodwin, a claims agent for the Virginian Railway Company was asked whether there was any obligation on the employees to go to this particular doctor or whether that was a matter of choice with them and his reply was, they have the privilege of going to the company doctors that we supply up and down the railroad."
1959.53,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1390.02,1393.732,What page is that?
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1393.732,1398.8,"At the top of page 51 in the record, rule 732."
1959.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1398.8,1403.019,And what is the one that Mr. Howell referred us to?
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1403.019,1416.822,"It was the rule 731, the one immediately in order of sequence in the rule book before this one I have just read and that is found at the bottom of page 47 in the record."
1959.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1416.822,1417.787,47?
1959.53,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1417.787,1436.03,"(Inaudible) I gather that the railroad made available to injured employees a surgeon in which in this sequence, was he a resident surgeon or a company surgeon?"
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1436.03,1439.587,He's a private practitioner in the city of Norfolk.
1959.53,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1454.373,1461.136,"No -- no what I'm trying to get is, is he a company surgeon?"
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1461.136,1465.642,In that sense if you use that term company surgeon I suppose --
1959.53,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1465.642,1466.476,Who pays him?
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1466.476,1467.1,-- he might be.
1959.53,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1474.163,1485.754,And that do I take it that employees are told that -- that is at least employees with the injury this petitioner had that they may consult him in respect to that injury?
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1485.754,1491.951,There was no expense to them if they choose and if they don't want to go to him they can go to their own doctor and pay their own way.
1959.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1494.38,1496.424,"But there's a little problem to that, isn't it?"
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1513.939,1517.264,Yes I don't deny of course the wording of the rule.
1959.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1548.195,1559.67,"I suppose the jury will hole that -- as opposed to what -- to give what effect it wanted to that rule, but only you wouldn't be bound by which -- what the doctor said."
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1561.881,1573.597,What if the construction of the rule -- I'll say this Your Honor I don't want to spend too much time on this particular point which I think is -- is pretty minute but --
1959.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1573.597,1581.575,But if -- if the jury found by the interpretation put on this rule by the doctor?
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1581.575,1582.335,By the doctor?
1959.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1582.335,1584.289,The doctor.
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1584.289,1585.039,There is no --
1959.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1585.039,1585.753,(Inaudible) by claims that --
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1585.753,1586.504,By the claim agent.
1959.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1586.504,1586.844,Yes.
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1586.844,1595.804,Now the claim agent is a man who enforces the rule and his was the only testimony as to how in practice it is followed.
1959.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1601.872,1603.353,Except insofar as the rule --
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1603.353,1618.595,Except insofar as the wording of this rule goes but then that's immediately followed in the same book by the next rule which provides for that -- their going to their own physicians if they so choose at their own expense.
1959.53,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1652.686,1659.554,Can they return to duty without a slip of the company surgeon?
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1659.554,1661.591,That's not in the record Your Honor.
1959.53,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1663.247,1667.045,You -- you referred I think the rule 48 and that's -- that's what I have here.
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1667.045,1667.694,Rule 48?
1959.53,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1667.694,1668.647,It's on page 48.
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1668.647,1669.391,Page 48?
1959.53,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1669.391,1671.459,Rule 733.
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1671.459,1680.435,"Rule 733, employees injured on duty who has received medical treatment must obtain a return to duty slip from the surgeon."
1959.53,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1715.639,1719.417,"May I ask you please sir, just before you go into that, one quick question."
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1726.228,1727.273,No sir.
1959.53,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1727.273,1728.846,It is not contributory at any way?
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1728.846,1729.34,No sir.
1959.53,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1729.34,1733.6,Alright.
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1733.6,1741.499,There is no substantial dispute as to the law applicable to this action as between these two parties.
1959.53,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1838.989,1840.449,Did they write an opinion on it?
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1840.449,1841.407,No Your Honor.
1959.53,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1847.946,1849.676,Did the District Court write an opinion?
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1849.676,1853.667,"No, no there has been no opinion in -- at all Your Honor."
1959.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1853.667,1857.612,How would you say that was the basis on which they did the --
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1857.612,1865.221,That was the argument set forth in the briefs and -- you mean the Supreme Court of Virginia?
1959.53,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1865.221,1865.801,Yes.
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1865.801,1877.158,That was the argument set forth in the briefs and that was the grounds upon which the trial court struck the plaintiff's evidence.
1959.53,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1894.075,1894.932,Where is that?
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1896.57,1898.156,No there was no written opinion in either --
1959.53,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1898.156,1902.636,I mean that orally has been directed as that what --
1959.53,1,43125,thomas_r_mcnamara,,1902.636,1907.293,No it has no -- no oral statement in the record that I know of.
1959.53,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3548.132,3555.522,If the Court pleases I think that the confusion of counsel in interpreting the record shows that it's uniquely a jury trial here.
1959.53,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3634.297,3637.899,Where in that page 35 did you say?
1959.53,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3637.899,3668.176,"35 yes if Your Honor please the yardmaster's testifying to that there that it is two ways of looking at this thing, two ways of answering it in order to try to satisfy the Ford – at Ford Plant they do a little rushing and that he goes on his last remark he said, puts the conductor in the middle and that's just where this poor fellow wound up, in the middle because the dilemma here if the railroad attorney says, did you violate a safety rule he has lost his job."
