1996.95-7452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.658,"The Court will hear argument now in Number 95-7452, Kenneth Lynce v. Hamilton Mathis."
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,9.747,17.922,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-7452,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,82.754,84.937,"Mr. Remland, may I interrupt you for a moment?"
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,113.935,114.816,"--Yes, sir, Justice Souter."
1996.95-7452,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,120.28,120.551,Okay.
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,139.402,159.694,"--It's hard to say, because the actual statute in effect in 1985, which was 944-598, had not been triggered at that point, and the credits did not start to issue until a successor statute administrative gain time supplanting provisional... supplanting the emergency gain time statute kicked in--"
1996.95-7452,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,159.694,160.585,So you--
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,160.585,168.44,"--and the actual credits could be used, I believe, according to the statutes in effect when the credits were granted, and I would submit to the Court--"
1996.95-7452,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,168.44,171.253,"--Yes, but that may not support an Ex Post Facto argument."
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,197.101,200.503,"--I believe the number would have been the same, for two reasons."
1996.95-7452,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,226.549,226.93,Mr. Remland--
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,234.113,235.144,That is correct.
1996.95-7452,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,239.326,248.012,When we took this case we thought we were dealing with a situation which involved a change of the punishment that existed at the time the crime was committed.
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,248.012,260.701,"--Justice Scalia, you did, as a matter of fact, because in 1985, when the offense was committed, the offense formula was basically the same as it was in '83 earlier under the statute."
1996.95-7452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,260.701,268.387,"Well, does that mean we should decide this case on a factually erroneous premise, the fact that it wasn't raised in the brief in opposition?"
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,268.387,284.326,"I think that the actual issue was presented squarely under the statute in effect at the time of the offense under the emergency gain time statute which Mr. Lynce was eligible for under 98 percent of population cap, and he was offense-eligible according to law."
1996.95-7452,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,284.326,286.938,"That statute was applied to no one, ever, right?"
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,288.57,295.176,"That statute, although it wasn't triggered in 1986, the cap was reached and the Governor declared a special emergency."
1996.95-7452,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,300.699,309.684,"That was all later, but the statute that was on the books at the time the offense was committed is a statute that was never applied to anyone."
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,318.35,341.746,"--It's our position that the statute that was in effect in 1985 was essentially the same statute that was in effect in 1988 when the credits were being granted, and moreover there's no question that the effect of the change substantially increased the petitioner's punishment, and that would constitute a violation of the ex post facto law, the Ex Post Facto Clause."
1996.95-7452,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,354.631,359.997,"But Mr. Remland, what about... the statute that was in place was an emergency statute."
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,384.562,395.059,"Justice Ginsburg, the formula was adopted in 1983 under the Sentencing Reform Act, and that formula was the sentence of the Court minus the gain time equals the actual sentence."
1996.95-7452,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,438.708,443.009,"But may... on that point, may I ask you a variant of Justice Ginsburg's question?"
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,518.119,525.613,"Justice Souter, the focus of the inquiry for ex post facto purposes should be the effect of the '92 law."
1996.95-7452,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,533.09,562.869,"But I think what I'm trying to get at is that the effect of the '92 law depends on what he might have been entitled to under the law that was changed and if, in fact, under the law that was changed, under the '83 act if that's what we're going to consider, it is not even clear that he would have been entitled to retain his credit beyond the termination of the emergency during which it was granted, then I can't say that the later statute took away anything."
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,573.585,582.862,"Justice Souter, the statutes in this case that provided the overcrowding gain time had no provisions which allowed revocation or forfeiture."
1996.95-7452,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,584.992,592.608,"But my difficulty is, they don't have any provision that clearly says that the gain time under the emergency statutes survives the emergency."
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,595.721,595.931,--Yes.
1996.95-7452,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,595.931,596.669,--that you could point to--
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,596.669,596.89,Yes.
1996.95-7452,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,596.89,599.083,"--that says, this becomes permanently vested?"
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,599.083,599.514,Yes.
1996.95-7452,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,611.372,613.953,Where's the irrevocable language in the statute?
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,613.953,614.682,The irrevocable language--
1996.95-7452,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,614.682,615.684,Have you got it in front of you?
1996.95-7452,0,32642,joel_t_remland,,616.916,619.446,"--Not immediately in front of me, but we've--"
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,1692.036,1697.39,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-7452,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1796.128,1828.77,"Well, Mr. Thomson, assume that under the law in effect in 1985 the defendant would have been entitled to certain gain time credits based on good behavior and other things, and he went along earning those credits until all of a sudden the State passes a retroactive law that takes away gain time credits already accumulated for him."
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,1832.092,1834.493,The Weaver case tells us that there is.
1996.95-7452,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1882.895,1884.167,"All right, but you're losing me a little bit."
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,1892.102,1894.245,"--I'm sorry, I didn't understand your--"
1996.95-7452,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1894.245,1896.676,Until 1992--
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,1896.676,1897.207,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-7452,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1897.207,1900.718,--had this defendant accumulated some gain time credits?
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,1900.718,1901.098,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-7452,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1901.098,1908.353,And the law passed in 1992 made him ineligible for that retroactively.
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,1908.353,1915.678,It made him... the law passed in 1992 made him ineligible for provisional credits.
1996.95-7452,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1922.662,1927.354,And he also had some gain time based on overcrowding.
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,1927.354,1933.138,"He had gain time based on overcrowding broken into two components, one under--"
1996.95-7452,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1933.138,1934.019,But he had some.
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,1934.019,1934.911,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-7452,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1934.911,1939.423,And then the State passes a new law and makes it retroactive.
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,1939.423,1939.973,Right.
1996.95-7452,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1939.973,1944.778,And you say that the ex post facto doctrine does not apply to that.
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,1944.778,1945.787,"Correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-7452,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1977.448,1980.9,"Well, but they certainly affected the time the inmate would serve."
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,1980.9,1989.326,There are lots of things that affect the time that an inmate will serve that have nothing to do with the fact of whether punishment is being imposed on him.
1996.95-7452,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2021.057,2044.182,"I might understand your argument better if it applied across the board, but it as I understand it the statute took away the provisional gain time from a class of offenders, dangerous people, including an attempted murderer, and I'm not sure how to square that with your assertion that this was not to punish."
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,2044.182,2056.831,"--Justice Kennedy, it was no more to punish than the Moralis case, which applied a different rule to a certain class of prisoners, in that case double murderers."
1996.95-7452,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2059.433,2063.664,"Well, but the rationale in that case was that it was unlikely that there would be really any difference."
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,2065.905,2068.84,--The overcrowding was not by itself.
1996.95-7452,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2091.533,2100.349,"But why isn't that a judgment that one crime is more culpable or more dangerous than another, and therefore more deserving of incarceration?"
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,2101.801,2109.916,Indirectly it has... it makes a judgment of who are more likely to cause a problem by early release.
1996.95-7452,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2117.292,2123.186,"I take it that deterrence is one of the central rationales for punishment, and you're saying that--"
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,2123.186,2125.256,Retribution and deterrence are the two classes.
1996.95-7452,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2125.256,2131.551,"--And that you're saying that deterrence or prevention, I suppose, is the rationale here."
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,2131.551,2133.131,You're not trying to prevent a crime.
1996.95-7452,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2157.828,2167.986,"Well, may be that's a good argument for a prospective law to that effect, but how does that justify a retrospective law that affects people who've already been awarded credits and are out?"
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,2167.986,2182.624,"Insofar as the ex post facto clause goes, it seems to me that it is not... the ex post facto clause is not involved because we are going to go and take a look back at 1985."
1996.95-7452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2194.102,2208.571,"Well, why isn't it an ex post facto problem if there was a 1983 statute on the books that authorized the gain time when the prison population exceeded 98 percent, the same formula that you used under the labor statutes?"
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,2212.074,2218.299,"--The 1983 statute is interesting, because in the first place it was entitled Early Release of Prisoners."
1996.95-7452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2218.299,2221.42,Titled Emergency--
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,2221.42,2223.21,It was not classified... excuse me?
1996.95-7452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2223.21,2225.051,--Entitled Emergency Release of Prisoners.
1996.95-7452,1,38382,parker_d_thomson,,2225.051,2226.373,Emergency Release of Prisoners.
