1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,0.0,13.267,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court?"
1957.23,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,710.568,721.272,May I ask you what way of acquiesce -- just by asking for a continuance of that is what you mean or do it express acquiescence (Inaudible) --
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,721.272,724.656,I use the word ‘acquiescence' to describe what I think is the effect of it.
1957.23,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,820.42,826.219,May I ask -- may I ask how it lost the -- lost that right?
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,826.219,846.166,Its right to review under California law was conditioned upon its having applied to the commission for a rehearing of this decision on or before the effective date of the decision.
1957.23,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,910.826,914.954,From what date to what date?
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,914.954,922.644,That was about 10 days Your Honor before the December 5th that was November 27 as I recall it.
1957.23,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,922.644,939.769,"Now as I understand I am just trying to get the sequence Mr. Phelps in my mind, the order was originally to take effect on the 7th of September and at that time the government asked to have it continued for a certain length of time."
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,939.769,940.265,That's correct Your Honor.
1957.23,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,940.265,942.893,"And that was done, is that right?"
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,942.893,943.709,That's correct.
1957.23,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,943.709,952.875,And that request was you say in the form of an acquiescence in the jurisdiction of the commission?
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,952.875,954.23,I believe that's a fair interpretation Your Honor.
1957.23,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,954.23,974.002,"Yes, now you said a moment ago that that under state law they, the government lost the right to review the order of the court by not having appealed from the September 7th date."
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,974.002,975.039,Yes.
1957.23,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,975.039,988.186,Well now is -- did not the continuance that they gave until some time in December detract from the finality of that judgments?
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,988.186,991.28,Well yes Your Honor I should have made that more clear.
1957.23,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1020.967,1027.277,Then it did have in the end of December it did have a right to have that California order reviewed?
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1027.277,1033.734,"Yes, yes Your Honor, it did."
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1309.409,1312.673,What it is this portion of your argument Mr. Phelps?
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1312.673,1313.577,I beg your pardon?
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1313.577,1317.678,To what end are you directing your present argument?
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1317.678,1320.175,There are two ends Mr. Justice Frankfurter.
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1348.752,1364.304,"You mean – the conclusion I draw from what you've just said that if your -- the inference of your argument is accepted it would have been needless to go in to all these far -- more far reaching issues, is that it?"
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1364.304,1365.45,You mean on the ultimate question Your Honor?
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1365.45,1366.035,Yes.
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1366.035,1366.8,Yes.
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1384.315,1393.785,And what would the consequence of that be regarding government shipments?
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1393.785,1396.101,This is the present state of affairs Your Honor on that.
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1421.094,1429.096,"If your remedy, if I follow you and the suit would be dismissed then that restraining order would fall too, would it not?"
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1429.096,1429.732,Yes Your Honor.
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1429.732,1435.049,"So everything, so one must assume that the slate is wiped clean?"
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1435.049,1436.123,Yes Your Honor.
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1436.123,1443.685,And on that assumption I have asked you what would be the consequence regarding government shipment or armed service shipment?
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1443.685,1461.867,"So far as the traffic of the permit carriers for the armed forces is concerned, there would be no immediate effect because of this indefinite postponement of this Item 20, that is to say Item 20 would still be in effect, giving to permit carriers this unlimited right to charge the armed forces whatever rates they chose."
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1476.174,1479.121,"But if they didn't, assume, make your assumption."
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1479.121,1479.929,Yes.
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1479.929,1482.781,That the suit in order dismissed.
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1482.781,1484.095,Yes.
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1528.044,1538.787,"On the shipments made the armed force, what proportion roughly indicated to be, is what you call general traffic and what is not?"
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1542.545,1544.009,I'm afraid I can't answer that Your Honor.
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1545.082,1545.939,Sizable?
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1545.939,1547.476,"There is sizable Your Honor, yes."
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1547.476,1548.328,Very sizable?
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1548.328,1553.896,"Yes, that's my understanding, although there are no concrete figures in the record."
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1553.896,1569.86,So that the upshot is that the armed service shipments would be subject to -- would be dependent on the traffics filed with your commission?
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1569.86,1571.318,No Your Honor.
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1571.318,1578.475,Under these -- as to the area that you just would be very sizable.
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1578.475,1590.007,"Now with respect to that sizable, armed forces traffic Your Honor, this cancellation of the Item 20 provision having been postponed by the commission is still outstanding and would remain outstanding --"
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1590.007,1590.669,I see.
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1609.073,1618.301,"I would assume yes Your Honor, although there are no figures, but for example petroleum, now I would assume that the armed forces transports petroleum in very large quantities in California."
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1618.301,1628.906,"So that as to that body of traffic, armed service traffic, the traffic would have to move subject to California rates?"
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1628.906,1642.796,"That's right, unless and until the commission took action to arrest it which it could do Your Honors, and I should say that's where I close, that the commission is prepared to stipulate through its --"
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1642.796,1644.92,"Well that's not on the record, isn't it?"
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1651.939,1655.789,"There was a stipulation Mr. Justice Frankfurter, but not of the kind I'm about to describe."
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1655.789,1656.391,Alright.
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1656.391,1694.891,"The one I'm about to describe is one whereby Judge McKeage as the attorney for the commission authorized by a statute to exercise all of its legal function, is fair to stipulate that if this Court should require the dissolution of that restraining order that injunction, and so that these conditions which we've described might otherwise become effective or might become effective in the absence of the commission's action, we would stipulate that the commission would take such action promptly in order to avoid having this immediate impact of tariff rates fall upon United States government traffic."
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1694.891,1698.774,Is Judge McKeage appointee of the Governor of the state?
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1698.774,1700.694,No Your Honor.
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1700.694,1702.077,Appointee of the commission?
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1702.077,1702.747,Yes Your Honor.
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1702.747,1709.58,"Does the commission survive, if I read correctly the papers, you are to have a new Governor before very long."
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1713.219,1714.146,Yes it does Your Honor.
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1714.146,1714.703,It does?
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1714.703,1715.204,Yes.
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1715.204,1719.941,"So this, he can give an assurance that outlives the Governor and the commission."
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1719.941,1723.422,"That is our view of it Your Honor, yes."
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1723.422,1729.276,"I think you're fortunate to have this kind of a commission, that's non political."
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1729.276,1729.667,Now my time --
1957.23,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1729.667,1731.366,It's not relevant to the argument.
1957.23,0,32389,j_thomason_phelps,,1733.273,1749.824,"The time I'm allotted to myself Your Honor has ended and I shall be glad to give way to the government, thank you."
1957.23,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1749.824,1751.299,Mr. Davis
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1751.299,1758.027,Mr. Chief justice and the Court please?
1957.23,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1800.865,1802.011,(Inaudible)
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1802.011,1814.023,And I say and the states made no attempt to impose rates upon the United States for intrastate traffic until very recently.
1957.23,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1814.537,1815.433,Interstate rates or --
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1815.433,1821.162,"Intra -- and interstate ICC, the Interstate Commerce Act made the exemption."
1957.23,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1822.435,1825.653,"Prior to that, the interstate rates --"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1825.653,1831.392,No the United States was not governed by any rates on intrastate or interstate.
1957.23,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1831.392,1833.079,It was subject to negotiation in each case?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1833.079,1834.132,In each case.
1957.23,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1846.085,1848.659,How long ago the picture changed?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1848.659,1849.587,That this picture changed?
1957.23,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1849.587,1851.776,"Not only in California, in general?"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1851.776,1864.047,"In California yeah the change in the law was made in 1955, generally these changes occurred within the last five to six years Mr. Justice Brennan."
1957.23,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1866.039,1868.587,The Commerce Commission had no --
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1868.587,1870.044,"Pardon, the Interstate Commerce Commission?"
1957.23,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1870.044,1870.832,(Inaudible)
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,1870.832,1879.466,"No but I would mention this, there has been considerable discussion as to the general government transportation policies."
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2068.246,2079.54,Could the California Commission on petition of the United States give you everything you want?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2094.748,2099.013,I believe not Your Honor.
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2105.931,2108.509,Is that in the record during the briefs --?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2108.509,2110.81,"The law that I'm reading, yes, this is the section of law."
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2110.81,2111.911,"Yes, where is it?"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2111.911,2122.113,"It's quoted down in our brief at page 2, under 530 of the California Public Utility Commission."
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2154.913,2168.159,"But this involved the desire of the government to ship gasoline or whatever the commodities are, my imagination (Inaudible) at certain rates or free of charge."
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2168.159,2169.401,That's right.
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2169.401,2208.931,"Now what I want to know is whether could you file a petition with the California commission saying the governments desires to ship so many tons, or so many barrels, or so many caskets of this, that or the other commodity at the following rate or free of charge, I suppose government doesn't want it for nothing at this kind of a rate, is the California Commission empowered to grant such a petition physically seeking, leaving Uncle Sam out of pocket by not one cent more than you want to be left out of the pocket?"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2208.931,2218.865,It may not do it with respect to transportation free because the word ‘free' was dropped out of the statute with respect to transportation of property.
1957.23,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2224.865,2228.38,That isn't -- not only not the essence not in the case.
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2228.38,2229.253,It's in the case --
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2229.253,2236.903,Whether as the matter of dollar and cents you could get the kind of transportation charge that the United States wants?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2236.903,2237.333,That's right.
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2243.731,2249.771,Are you going to say a word as to why it is necessary for you to go through what might be merely idle form if you don't know.
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2249.771,2252.101,Yes I will indeed go into that.
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2276.679,2283.046,"Well, I don't understand why you say partial as to what you want in dollars and cents in full?"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2283.046,2284.332,Not well in these --
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2284.332,2287.331,"That's my question, that's the question of fact."
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2293.541,2302.838,It can but I've said -- in the proceeding which Mr. Phelps was talking about they were dealing only with part of the relief that was involved.
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2311.803,2313.572,(Inaudible) that proceeding --
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2313.572,2314.378,That's right.
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2314.378,2317.075,Can it start an independent proceeding for that --
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2317.075,2339.358,"That is the problem -- that is the procedural problem which is before this Court, and before they reach the merits and that is and it's stated in various ways the exhaustion of administrative remedies, stated as the ground -- whether this is a matter of comity, stated on whether there is a case or controversy before that court, and that's specifically the first question which this Court must face up to."
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2340.039,2342.78,Whether you just pulled out that particular proceeding?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2342.78,2346.009,Whether this is ripe for decision.
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2391.74,2404.493,"I don't get the disclosure -- I don't get the disclosure point at all because I assume that when you make a private arrangement with a trucker, you have to tell him what he has to carry, don't you?"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2404.493,2409.131,"Now as a matter of fact, very frequently the actual carriers don't know what they are carrying."
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2409.131,2416.894,"That is you say we're going to present you with so many cases and we're ready to pay not more than X dollars per ton, is that it?"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2416.894,2440.23,In the high security cases there is a single representative of the truckers who has been cleared for confidential information and the armed service involved negotiates directly with him and tells him as much information as is necessary in order for him to -- and only as much information as is necessary for him to perform the transportation.
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2440.23,2445.617,"And to push you on that specific point, you couldn't make such an arrangement with the commission?"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2445.617,2452.703,Well I think it is entirely possible we could make such a condition with the commission.
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2473.728,2475.667,They way to keep a secret is to keep it.
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2475.667,2476.366,That's right.
1957.23,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2476.366,2483.736,(Inaudible)
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2483.736,2484.419,That is right.
1957.23,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2484.419,2513.556,(Inaudible)
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2513.556,2531.719,"I think not Your Honor because this is in the nature of an injunctive proceeding and that proper persons that we wanted to get the injunction against are the persons who we're going to enforce this statute against the United States, which I believe clearly is the Public Utilities Commission in California."
1957.23,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2538.5,2540.345,(Inaudible)
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2540.345,2541.43,It's not -- the commission --
1957.23,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2541.43,2543.059,(Inaudible)
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2543.059,2543.482,That's right.
1957.23,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2548.0,2560.699,(Inaudible)
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2560.699,2568.341,"As I say since the form of this procedure is the injunctive procedure, I do not believe the state is a necessary party."
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2774.967,2779.119,"And that would be, that exception would be prospective and not retrospective?"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2779.119,2785.778,"It might be retrospective, I do not know Your Honor, I think they might be able to make it retrospective, but in any event --"
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2785.778,2802.311,"Well if they have power to make it retrospective, then so far as money is concerned Uncle Sam isn't got a pocket and you have to evoke some other non-monitory consideration of potential harm to the United States, is that correct?"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2802.311,2803.75,We might not be out of pocket.
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2831.09,2847.526,"But, on the other hand if this patriotic vow by the representatives of California, that they want to be just as helpful, just as respectful of the needs of United States as the government (Inaudible)"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2847.526,2862.868,"That recurs throughout this case, that whenever the commission is pushed to the point where it appears that their authority might damage the defense effort."
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2916.102,2919.695,But they actually did impose tax.
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2919.695,2921.342,They imposed --
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2921.342,2925.066,"That was the issue, this isn't speculated."
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,2936.498,2949.302,"Well, it was stated that they could -- that was the argument made to this Court that we can use this taxing power so that it will not hinder the government in carrying out its function."
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3006.955,3022.4,"Are you saying this, that if ultimately California has no power to determine what Uncle Sam arranged between himself and the truckers, he doesn't have to get that position by leave, by the grace of California."
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3022.4,3025.25,"That is right, that is exactly what I am saying."
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3025.25,3040.638,Well Mr. Davis doesn't the fact that this statute is self executing make it more imperative that the state be a party defendant as Maryland was as a defendant in the McCulloch versus Maryland?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3040.638,3047.497,"Well excuse me Your Honor, Maryland was the plaintiff in McCulloch against Maryland as I think, they brought the action."
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3047.497,3050.684,"Yes, that's right."
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3050.684,3075.934,"I do not see Your Honor why it is essential that the state as a state be made a party, if we make a party in this case the arm of the state which is responsible for this particular function of the state and as I understand from Mr. McKeage they have full authority, criminal and everything else with respect to the execution of the statute."
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3075.934,3092.151,"Well in any case then, where the state has an arm of its government to enforce its laws, is it sufficient to sue just the officer, if it's a constable, if it's a constable who has the power to do --"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3092.151,3092.453,I think --
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3092.453,3102.52,-- to enforce a law can you sue the constable and not the state and not declare the act unconstitutional?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3102.52,3113.23,"I don't know in enough about the California practice nor the powers, but generally speaking, of course it isn't enough to just pick anybody down the line and make him the defendant in the case."
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3113.653,3125.452,"The peace officer and peace officers have certain rights, the powers of enforcement to whether constables, sheriffs or highway patrolmen or whoever they might be."
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3131.31,3152.156,"I would think if acted directly under authority of the statute and he was the man responsible to the legislature in effect, because the legislature gave him this authority to act, to perform without direction from others that he would be the first -- there are many suits involving governments where you do sue the arm."
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3157.675,3163.99,"Is this the corporate -- is this the corporate body Mr. Davis under California law, Public Utilities Commission?"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3163.99,3165.15,I would have to pass that.
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3167.496,3169.868,But I mean it's the interstate commerce.
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3169.868,3170.934,"I would think so, except --"
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3170.934,3173.732,(Inaudible)
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3173.732,3175.092,Well I assumed so.
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3175.092,3177.152,You don't know about California?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3177.152,3188.648,It just -- it occurs to me that Mr. Justice Whittaker and the Chief Justice are entirely right that the State of California has an interest in this and would have been a property party.
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3214.598,3217.336,But only because the act is unconstitutional?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3217.336,3220.225,"That's right, if the act is constitutional why then --"
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3220.225,3221.77,Then their conduct is --
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3221.77,3240.14,"But that's the historic way that you test the Constitution, particularly with respect to the United States where you can't sue the United States without permission, why they have suits against the Secretary or Interior or and the other cabinet offices on the ground that you're suing them because they have no authority to act."
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3240.14,3264.755,But what line of cases do you rely on to substantiate that point that you can sue only the enforcing agency in order to establish the unconstitutionality of the act when they have done nothing to go beyond a fair interpretation of the act?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3264.755,3268.095,Mr. Chief Justice I may have misspoken myself.
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3281.848,3284.66,"Well let's say enough, what cases --"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3284.66,3293.987,"The line of cases that I would rely on would be the -- I'm sorry that none of them come to my mind at this moment during the argument, but the line of cases --"
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3293.987,3295.184,Are they in your brief?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3295.184,3300.524,"No, this point is not raised, in their there has been no question."
1957.23,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3311.967,3314.435,Do you think ex parte Young has an influence?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3314.435,3320.035,I would think it certainly would have -- it would be -- would influence on.
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3320.035,3347.734,"Are you saying that, although the legislature of California has empowered this commission to do something or to make certain demands, you say that the legislature of California went beyond its constitutional power, therefore the officials are not close with authority, and therefore you enjoin them from doing what the legislature of California authorized them to do but has to now power to authorize."
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3347.734,3364.22,"Yes Your Honor, this is the basic theory on which many suites against federal officials are brought, and they are done in that way in the case of the federal government because of lack of power to sue the government of course, but the whole theory of them is that the person being unauthorized is subject to sue."
1957.23,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3364.745,3381.474,(Inaudible)
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3381.474,3396.637,"Mr. McKeage in his reply brief argued that the commission does have judicial power and I think it's entirely consistent with the powers of California and to give it judicial power if it wishes to, I don't know."

1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3407.524,3408.399,Does it make a difference?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3408.399,3413.414,"I say -- I cannot see that it makes a difference to this case, whether they have judicial powers or not."

1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3435.54,3443.143,"That's right, but may I make a little correction Mr. Justice Whittaker, it comes not from an order of the California Commission."
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3461.166,3467.928,And further there's been no final acts of any kind by the commission?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3467.928,3468.383,No.
1957.23,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3598.236,3602.379,Well would your constitutional argument be different if those findings had not been made?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3602.379,3605.343,I think that these finding help.
1957.23,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3697.799,3699.889,Not in any economic sense?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3699.889,3705.21,Well both in an economic and in an operational sense if you want to put it in that way.
1957.23,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3705.21,3706.754,Delay was one.
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3706.754,3714.452,Delay and disclosure of security information and third was economic matter of expense.
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3714.452,3725.63,"In other words, the truckers testified that you couldn't disclose to the commission what the government had closed to them without endangering the security of the nation?"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3728.396,3732.247,No there was testimony by the truckers to that effect.
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3732.496,3738.496,"I thought you said that was the – that was one of the three things that they had testified to them, these –"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3738.496,3768.125,"No, I'm again speaking of the transportation officials of the armed services who have made this – gave the testimony and what they testified was that with respect to security shipment present time, they're handled through a single representative of the carriers who is given, who is examined and found to be cleared and then he is given, I think the term is ‘such information as is necessary in order to make the shipment.'"

1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3805.02,3816.718,Well it is under the -- under the present code you couldn't get intrastate rates without making these disclosures.
1957.23,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3868.196,3881.615,"Well, Mr. Davis if there's an area of control (Inaudible) state would increase expense consideration, standing alone inhibit the exercise of state power?"
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3881.615,3907.394,"Well, many of the cases dealing with governmental immunities, the conflict between the two sovereigns have said that where the imposition of the control is not direct and where the result is only an increased cost, then the state shall have the power to do it."
1957.23,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3940.977,3949.528,(Inaudible) the difference between Uncle Sam saying higher freight rates and an agency (Inaudible) saying freight –
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3949.528,3967.831,"Well, by an agency if it is a commission, but if it's a contracting party and if it is nondiscriminatory then this Court has said that kind of economic burden is what we have to pay for living in a country where we have two branches of government."
1957.23,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3981.129,3990.644,"Well, on that, on that argument, would that make any difference, the amount of increase merely because it is something that Uncle Sam had to pay directly."
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,3992.997,3995.659,That's certainly the theory of McCulloch against Maryland.

1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,4154.013,4161.461,There are about four of these cases we might have in mind along this line and maybe it will be worthwhile to look them just briefly.
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4230.983,4233.259,What was that last case Mr. --
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,4233.259,4235.801,Johnson against Maryland was the license case--
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4235.801,4237.79,Maryland was a party to that action?
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,4237.79,4242.171,"Maryland was a party to that action, yes."
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4262.947,4268.948,It seems to me the most trivial of the laws [Attempt to laughter] using Oleomargarine.
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,4268.948,4269.142,Well that --
1957.23,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4269.142,4272.684,I can't see the foundation of this country shaking it if that's required.
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,4272.684,4289.99,Then there was the case of the Forest Rangers out in the Grand Canyon National Park who found that the deer were eating up the foliage and they first tried to transport them out of the park and to limit them in various ways.
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4512.909,4526.956,"Well possibly if you just give us the list of your authorities and do it quickly so we could counsel while he is here so they have an opportunity to reply, and then we can have for a conference on it right."
1957.23,1,30073,john_f_davis,,4526.956,4531.56,"Well I will be glad to get it done in time, so he can reply and so that it can be ready for the conference."
1957.23,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4531.56,4536.318,Yes thank you.
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,4538.389,4554.63,I believe that I have about 29 minutes Mr. Chief Justice and I shall attempt if I can to answer some of the question propounded by the members of the Court.
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4587.109,4589.005,But there are other states --

1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5063.366,5067.672,I was just going to reach that point Mr. Justice Black.
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5133.412,5157.044,"May I ask you Mr. McKeage whether under your law, a plaintiff can go into a California court and seek to enjoin the commission from doing something on the theory that it has exceeded the statutory or constitutional speed limit?"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5157.044,5159.92,No.
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5160.727,5164.746,Every action has to go through the commission and then to the Supreme Court of your state?
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5164.746,5165.695,That is right.
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5192.51,5199.336,And your Supreme Court can issue prohibition against their taking hold of something.
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5199.336,5200.321,I didn't understand that.

1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5212.736,5214.861,It could issue prohibition.
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5214.861,5217.19,It can issue orders to the commission.

1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5238.273,5241.153,I would have to answer that in this way.

1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5330.313,5343.482,"And it did not -- and that in the case that you've just given me, you're good enough to give me, the proceeding was not a review of, an ordinary appellate review of what the commission declined to do?"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5343.482,5356.945,"No, it was by a writ of mandate, there is no -- they didn't seek out a review at all."
1957.23,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5357.783,5377.094,(Inaudible)
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5377.094,5378.109,That's right Your Honor.
1957.23,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5378.109,5388.646,(Inaudible) whatsoever?
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5388.646,5397.857,"Well, the commission was of the opinion that it didn't have jurisdiction and had just not undertaken to regulate these people."
1957.23,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5397.857,5399.56,(Inaudible)
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5399.56,5404.136,"And the Supreme Court disagreed, said you do have authority and you should exercise it."
1957.23,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5404.136,5410.419,(Inaudible)
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5410.419,5412.406,That was its decision.
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5412.406,5434.879,"And I gather if I did gather correctly, I gather that you said the other way around as also occur namely that the commission has exercised the authority and you went to the Supreme Court of your state and got an order of mandate telling it to seek (Inaudible)"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5434.879,5444.507,"Well the way that is always done, I have never known it to be done otherwise and I have been there 14 years is by the writ of review."
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5444.507,5445.215,Writ of review?
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5445.215,5473.336,"Yes I think that the court would dismiss any petition unless it were a petition for writ of review because that is the exclusive way that a decision of the commission is reviewed, but the court has held that in a peculiar situation as I have stated that a writ of mandate could issue not withstanding the fact there was no review proceeding involved."
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5473.336,5487.502,"You are urging, you are urging this as I follow you both of the matter of high (Inaudible) between two governments what is usually called comity, is that it?"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5487.502,5489.264,Comity.
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5489.264,5502.348,"That it originated on that ground that it makes for the smooth workings of this two geared governments, these two governments of ours, the government of United States go through this regular process?"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5502.348,5537.273,"We certainly urge that and while these things get so close Mr. Justice Frankfurter that it's very difficult to decide whether it's comity whether it should be as an absolute matter of constitutional law, but I think that it's fair to say that the -- a fashion shall I use that expression is more and more getting to the point where these matters are looked at in a conciliatory sort of way."
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5726.452,5737.626,"In your own state, if review is a sought of an order of your commission, by an interested party how is that suit entitled in the Supreme Court?"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5737.626,5748.685,"Well the suit against the commission, if it were an original action of course would be so and so petitioner against Public Utilities Commission, State of California respondent."
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5750.392,5756.623,You mean the state is always joined if a shipper or a railroad objects to some order?
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5756.623,5758.396,No not at all.
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5758.396,5759.192,Not at all?
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5759.192,5759.964,No.
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5760.951,5766.642,"Well the public -- I see California was not the state, but (Inaudible) of the commission."
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5766.642,5767.425,Well the --
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5767.425,5768.049,Alright.
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5768.049,5784.13,"In all review proceedings at the commission and the commission alone is made the respondent, whatever maybe the law that's what we have all assumed that, that is sufficient and the state is never joined in those --"
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5784.13,5796.735,"And there must have been or have you been fortunate enough, never to have had a suit against the commission in which some constitutional claim was made, you had such things, haven't you?"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5796.735,5808.677,"Well, there could not be a suit against the commission in a state court save in except, in that exceptional case before the Supreme Court of our state."
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5808.677,5829.736,"Yes, if it's in the Supreme Court, if your commission takes jurisdiction and a shipper or a railroad claims that the basis of jurisdiction is unconstitutional, and on that seeks review in your Supreme Court, the state as I understand you would not be joined."
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5829.736,5830.713,"No, there the state is --"
1957.23,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5830.713,5836.302,"You don't urge the point to the necessary party, the state being a necessary party."
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5836.302,5837.541,Have we urged it?
1957.23,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5837.541,5839.907,I say you do not urge it now?
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5839.907,5843.393,In the good conscience I could not urge it Mr. Chief Justice.
1957.23,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5843.393,5843.795,Yes.
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5843.795,5867.804,"We have pointed out in our brief the fact that the state has not been joined, but it is with relation to the factual situation as to whether it was right that the injunction should be against the Public Utilities Commission, whether we had done something that justified some injunction."
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5867.804,5875.557,"But it couldn't be against the state as such, it might be against the government or the legislature, I don't know who --"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5875.557,5876.284,Well --
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5876.284,5881.42,"It couldn't be against – if you couldn't enjoin the state as such, whom would you enjoin?"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5881.42,5934.776,"Well, surely the various precedents for suing public officials charged with the execution of a statute and the enjoining them and now of course it may or may not be that this question, that a question was raised as to whether the Federal Government or the state as the case maybe should be joined as a party, but as far as the relief is concerned, getting down to the ultimate, the end result, as far as the relief is concerned, the United States has secured all possible relief that I know that it could secure, by paralyzing the arm of the commission, there is nobody else in California that can do anything except the commission, so it has all the relief it could get there."
1957.23,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5934.776,5944.99,"But Judge McKeage, in light of what you just said, I think there is no reason for me to trouble Mr. Davis or you further about a point, as far as I am concerned."
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5951.223,5956.469,"Well I -- It's certainly about your wish Mr. Chief Justice, I --"
1957.23,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5956.469,5957.497,It's not necessary.
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,5957.497,5976.289,"I do think that all we would get would be a sometime probably variety of decisions which -- but we have in good faith, I mean in good conscience say that there is a fatal defect here because the State of California is not joined."
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5990.787,6017.831,"What do you say in addition to what you have said, these considerations of practical incidence, practical -- all of inconvenience or difficulty or embarrassment, putting financial consideration to one side, what do you say to these practicalities, the arguments of really inconvenience --"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6017.831,6019.215,Yes well I would --
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6019.215,6023.665,"-- disturbance or call them what you will, embarrassment that Mr. Davis urged?"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6023.665,6036.188,"I would say this, Your Honor, those in claimed embarrassment and inconveniences are the historical objections to all regulation."
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6127.05,6151.822,"You haven't any or do you, am I right in assuming you do not question that Congress could tomorrow in organizing things, pass a statute saying it's the policy of the United States in view of the intermittent help that it is giving to railroads of one sort or another that all governmental property be carried without cost."
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6161.913,6162.76,No I --
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6162.76,6195.307,"So that then we get on to the narrower question as Mr. Davis puts it, whether you haven't got here not a conflict with an explicit statute, but a sufficient practical and conflict with what the government wants to do or is doing particularly in view of California's very sizable relation to these Armed Service Shipments."
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6195.307,6219.611,"I would say this that reasonable men could differ on that and I am quite sure that the view, that view could be taken, but we maintain that another view could be taken and when you approach the rule of testing constitutionality of the statute the -- you must choose the one that will save the statute as this Court pointed out in the national --"
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6219.611,6225.941,"If it -- where would you at all if California can do this, New York can do it, really."
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6225.941,6226.961,That is of course --
1957.23,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6226.961,6228.334,Florida et cetera?
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6228.334,6235.858,"-- express here, Pennsylvania has already done it and so I, I assume that would that is a fear."
1957.23,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6248.438,6259.165,Your statute says that the commission may permit railroads to carry (Inaudible) the word may permit.
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6259.165,6259.75,That is right.
1957.23,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6259.75,6279.628,"Suppose your commission does – has not permitted the government (Inaudible) tomorrow, the railroad will need to give them a reduced rate, below (Inaudible) would anybody be suggested to punishment of violating this law, the law that's giving you these rates?"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6279.628,6294.835,Well the carrier if assuming that we had issued an order directed to the carrier that it must charge a certain rate and if it didn't charge that rate it would be subject of course to punishment under the Public Utilities Act.
1957.23,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6308.43,6314.144,"Well, I though that would be in effect (Inaudible)"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6314.144,6319.399,Well there is no question about it if the order had been issued which hasn't been issued.
1957.23,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6331.123,6338.051,Does the act have any other purpose except to decide what rate the railroad must charge --
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6338.051,6338.375,Well --
1957.23,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6338.375,6341.901,-- disposition of the act have any purpose but that?
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6341.901,6346.283,Well it is directed to that Mr. Justice Black.
1957.23,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6346.283,6350.15,Have any other purpose except that?
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6350.15,6351.839,It has no other purpose that I know of.
1957.23,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6371.868,6389.799,"(Inaudible) but if you are right what you are saying is that a state, not the federal government, has the power to fix the rates federal government must pay for its transportation within in the state --?"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6389.799,6391.055,We take that position Your Honor.
1957.23,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6391.055,6393.588,That's the premise on which the statute is based?
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6393.588,6402.965,That -- well we certainly take that that position as the ultimate thing under the 10th Amendment of the federal constitution that the State of California does have that right.
1957.23,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6402.965,6417.007,"Are you asserting here that the statute could be construed in a way, which would simply say that the agency had the power to negotiate with the government recognizing the government's superior authority?"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6417.007,6422.949,It lies within the commission's power Mr. Justice Black to exempt all of this traffic --
1957.23,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6422.949,6424.819,Lies within its power?
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6424.819,6425.741,Yes that is right.
1957.23,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6425.741,6427.466,And not the government power?
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6427.466,6428.829,Well it lies within the power of the --
1957.23,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6428.829,6432.103,"It gets down to a conflict on that basis, does it not?"
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6432.103,6433.988,Well as I said before Your Honor --
1957.23,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6433.988,6435.367,Well you are right on that --
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6435.367,6437.781,"You could, you could draw that conclusion."
1957.23,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6441.022,6449.446,Do you think exclusion could be drawn and maybe they would fix rates on such a standard that the government would be willing to face them and there would be no conflict?
1957.23,2,22813,everett_c_mckeage,,6449.446,6467.586,"Well that is our feeling and that is what we thought when we started out on this thing but the government, well shall I say abandoned that program and went into the federal court."
