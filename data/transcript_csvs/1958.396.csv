1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,20.228,23.249,If the Court please.
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,513.212,537.692,"Mr. Previant, may I ask whether one is to infer from the opinion of Mr. Justice Currie that if the County were out of the case, if this -- or merely private employer and the union that -- that the Court, your court, would have found preemption."
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,537.692,538.158,I believe so.
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,540.217,557.735,"I should think so true but at the core of your statement a little while ago, the opinion indicate that constitutionally they couldn't preempt in the case of a county, I did -- can you correct the statement, is there not?"
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,557.735,560.647,"Yes, I -- I did see that."
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,560.647,598.333,"Tell me what the sentence on page 24 mean, the proposing of the open paragraph, we would have an entirely different problem if Congress have legislated that all peaceful picket -- picketing of an employer would engage in a business affecting interstate commerce is a valid activity, not subject to being enjoined by any thought if the -- if the activity is of a nature to call for preemption of state law then one has that situation in this case."
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,598.333,604.321,"Well, I believe that is the basic inconsistency in Mr. Justice Currie's concurring opinion."
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,611.102,612.696,I'm reading from your -- I beg your pardon.
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,615.833,618.591,"Oh, I was looking at the --"
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,618.591,619.083,I'm sorry -- I --
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,619.083,624.399,-- at the record before the Court which Justice Currie's opinion starts at page 34.
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,624.399,625.355,"Yes, alright."
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,625.355,641.25,"But he does say expressly at page 35 after acknowledging that the County could be a person that under our federal system of government, it is implied in the United States Constitution --"
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,641.25,641.944,"Yes, he does --"
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,641.944,648.774,-- that the national government in the exercise of the powers may not prevent the State or any agency thereof from discharging some ordinary functions of government.
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,678.917,683.6,Because they don't know whether it's one or the other until the National Labor Board decides subject to court review.
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,683.6,684.98,That so.
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,750.53,759.502,Do you know whether -- can you tell me whether sovereign immunity so-called applies to municipality?
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,760.873,764.004,I -- I don't believe that it does and --
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,764.004,768.591,Justice Currie said state or agency.
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,777.294,781.087,"There is no distinction, at least -- certainly in Wisconsin law, there's no distinction."
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,877.854,878.316,Am I wrong?
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,885.211,885.71,That's right.
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,885.71,903.34,"-- so that the sole question is, is it not when the construction of the word ""person"" and its adaptability or allocation to include a county of -- a county of the State."
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,903.34,904.859,I -- I think so.
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,905.112,906.3,There is to it.
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,908.013,912.201,"Yes, it's -- it's -- the very -- the very expression of what did the Congress intend."
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,912.201,918.538,"Whether this is a violation of your state law or the federal law is beside the point, isn't it?"
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,918.538,920.8,We -- we believe it is entirely beside the point.
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,942.554,958.575,"But it wouldn't necessarily control a construction and application of the word person, not to exclude the railroad that that word also does not include a state or any branches of the State."
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,958.575,960.379,I -- I think that you're right.
1958.396,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,979.103,983.864,You don't -- you don't argue that a county is a person.
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,983.864,984.244,Yes.
1958.396,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,996.339,1002.793,Definition of a person doesn't seem to fit a county Section 2 (1).
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,1002.793,1006.239,It -- it neither -- it neither includes nor it doesn't exclude.
1958.396,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1006.239,1019.765,"It doesn't exclude, but it -- it's hard to find a -- include it in individuals, labor organizations, partnership, association, corporation, legal represent -- trustee, banks (Voice Overlap) --"
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,1019.765,1023.567,"I would suggest, Mr. Justice Douglas, that it is a municipal corporation."
1958.396,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1023.567,1025.5,"Well, a county is a municipal corporation?"
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,1025.5,1027.789,Yes.
1958.396,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1027.789,1030.173,That's a form of govern -- another Wisconsin law?
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,1030.173,1030.845,"Yes, it is."
1958.396,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1035.952,1037.171,Corporation.
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,1037.171,1047.651,But all the political subdivisions of the State of Wisconsin are referred to as municipal corporations.
1958.396,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1064.947,1069.845,Yes.
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,1069.845,1101.013,"The -- the Court by its questions has drawn out virtually the heart of our argument, the National Labor Relations Board has filed a brief amicus in which it has discussed the meaning of the word “person” as applied to municipal corporation and in support of the case which it had earlier decided and which the Wisconsin Board -- Court thought was bad law."
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1281.762,1282.656,Billion did you say?
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,1282.656,1285.165,"Billion, yes."
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1411.634,1419.834,"If you're right, all construction work by the United States Government directly of it, is it?A person would --"
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,1419.834,1420.617,No.
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1427.068,1435.562,"I don't mean as an employer, if public construction done by outside contractors for Uncle Sam would be covered."
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,1435.562,1439.507,"Yes, yes, and -- and there had been cases before this Court."

1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,1453.588,1454.051,No.
1958.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1467.989,1468.515,Most --
1958.396,0,21378,david_previant,,1468.515,1469.321,"-- was one of them, incidentally."

1958.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1707.477,1709.29,Did the courthouse get built?
1958.396,1,21031,donald_j_howe,,1709.29,1713.774,"Yes sir, it was finished in like October, yes Your Honor."
1958.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1879.249,1882.954,What is the present controversy between you and the union?

1958.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1888.618,1891.857,Did the County give a bond?
1958.396,1,21031,donald_j_howe,,1891.857,1899.51,"No, that isn't the controversy, Your Honor, the courthouse is completed the -- everything is done."
1958.396,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1901.515,1903.262,There was an injunction issue.
1958.396,1,21031,donald_j_howe,,1903.262,1904.859,"Yes, Your Honor."

1958.396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1960.376,1966.958,"The injunction restrains conduct only at that particular courthouse site, does it not?"
1958.396,1,21031,donald_j_howe,,1966.958,1972.789,"I would say that that's right, Your Honor, and it would be an additional work upon that particular courthouse."
1958.396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1973.403,1976.741,That's what you have -- have before that restraint could be applicable.
1958.396,1,21031,donald_j_howe,,1976.741,1978.203,"That's right, Your Honor."
1958.396,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1985.132,1999.668,(Inaudible) what does it operate?
1958.396,1,21031,donald_j_howe,,1999.668,2013.88,"I don't believe it operates on anything, Your Honor."

1958.396,2,21378,david_previant,,2562.109,2565.045,I just address myself to the whole question I believe I have a minute or so.
1958.396,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2565.045,2566.817,"Yes, yes, you may."
