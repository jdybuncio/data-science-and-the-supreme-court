2014.13-894,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.354,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-894, the Department of Homeland Security v. Robert MacLean."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,9.189,11.572,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-894,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,54.401,65.023,At what point was -- was MacLean told that this qualified an -- as SSI?
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,83.501,86.955,"Your Honor, I think that's not quite correct, and let me see if I can work it through."
2014.13-894,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,101.965,102.982,But when was he first told?
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,102.982,109.736,"He was told that air marshal deployment information was SSI in the training, and it's in the regs."
2014.13-894,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,167.49,171.209,"But it -- it certainly is -- will, in many cases, be a close question."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,193.142,193.825,"So, Your Honor--"
2014.13-894,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,193.825,200.895,"And could he say, there will -- air marshals have been cut 50 percent from, you know, transcontinental flights?"
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,200.895,202.763,"--So, Your Honor, there may be close cases."
2014.13-894,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,208.067,208.601,Heard what contention?
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,208.601,212.203,"--That he did not know that this was SSI, that the Federal air marshal deployment--"
2014.13-894,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,212.203,212.569,Okay.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,219.273,224.677,"--Your Honor, I think that -- that without specifying -- I don't know the answer to that."
2014.13-894,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,227.896,229.415,So how was Mr. MacLean supposed to know?
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,229.415,239.02,"--Because Mr. MacLean -- Mr. MacLean is -- was trained to know, was trained in SSI, received training on that -- on that."
2014.13-894,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,246.24,246.676,I'm a little confused.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,263.152,263.686,--That would be marked SSI.
2014.13-894,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,263.686,266.021,--that the -- that this was SSI.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,272.158,273.944,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-894,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,279.997,280.43,You want it before it's going out.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,280.43,281.363,--Correct.
2014.13-894,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,299.844,307.515,"If there were no regulations, just the statutes on the books, at that point, are there any prohibitions on disclosure?"
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,313.235,314.437,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.71,356.512,"No, it wasn't prohibited by the statute until there were regulations, right?"
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,356.512,357.895,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.947,359.964,So it is prohibited by regulations.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,361.066,369.069,"--So, Your Honor, I don't -- I -- I think we would prevail even under that interpretation because it's prohibited by regulations that the statute mandated to be disclosed."
2014.13-894,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,400.458,401.291,"Well, your reasoning is--"
2014.13-894,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,401.291,401.591,What--
2014.13-894,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,401.591,407.211,--would -- it apparently came as a surprise to the government lawyer in the court of appeals.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,413.181,415.133,"So, Your Honor, I--"
2014.13-894,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,415.133,419.852,"Again, the MacLean is supposed to know something that the lawyer -- government lawyer and the court of appeals doesn't know."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,419.852,422.387,"--So, Your Honor, I think that that statement -- the lawyer did say that."
2014.13-894,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,429.71,435.447,--But now you think -- you seem to be arguing that it's not simply mandated by statute.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,459.179,460.762,So let me be as clear as I can.
2014.13-894,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,483.026,484.11,"Excuse me, I must have misunderstood."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,495.25,498.385,Because there would be no SSI designated.
2014.13-894,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,498.385,498.802,All right.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,499.471,499.721,But once there's -- sorry.
2014.13-894,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,499.721,503.939,--So then -- so then the statute alone does not carry the day.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,503.939,526.122,"So, Your Honor, I don't think that's the way the Court looked at it in Robertson and the way the Court looked at it in Sims, because in both of those cases, there had been no determination not to disclose until the administrator made the determination, and yet the Court found that those were specifically -- that they were specifically -- nondisclosure was specifically authorized by statute."
2014.13-894,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,544.766,546.066,"I'm sorry, what was that quoted from?"
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,546.066,549.404,--That was from the Federal Circuit's decision at 15a.
2014.13-894,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,561.628,568.466,"Counsel, would you qualify, assuming -- because Congress disagreed with Robertson and -- didn't it?"
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,570.584,572.034,"Congress amended FOIA, yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-894,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,572.034,572.434,All right.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,580.273,580.789,Okay.
2014.13-894,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,580.789,581.789,--the amended FOIA.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,584.927,585.76,"We do, Your Honor."
2014.13-894,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,585.76,586.193,All right.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,588.279,602.203,"We meet the -- first of all, I would just like to say that the Senate legislative history expressly considered this very question and said that if that -- that we -- I'm sorry."
2014.13-894,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,611.995,614.429,It seems to be eminently reasonable despite Robertson.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,614.429,617.381,"--It seems -- Your Honor, once this Court--"
2014.13-894,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,617.381,621.516,"I mean, but that's basically what you're arguing, is that -- one of the two FOIA exceptions."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,622.25,631.206,"--So it's the FOIA exception, Your Honor, that -- that establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters withheld."
2014.13-894,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,656.439,659.208,"Yours is, I think, a little bit more specific than that."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,659.208,660.425,--Then perhaps more specific.
2014.13-894,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,670.433,670.849,"Well, my goodness."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,682.491,684.091,"--Your Honor, it says, “ The director of ”--"
2014.13-894,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,684.091,687.459,"Sources and methods, intelligence sources and methods."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,763.958,765.81,"--So, Your Honor, a couple of points on that."
2014.13-894,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,787.674,788.291,"Now, that's the one before."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,788.291,790.526,But that's the one this Court found sufficient.
2014.13-894,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.526,791.693,That may be what this Court did.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,800.315,801.067,"But if I may, Your Honor."
2014.13-894,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,809.589,810.306,Okay.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,854.468,857.837,"--Your Honor, the President could do that."
2014.13-894,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,857.837,858.12,All right.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,895.628,897.662,"Yes, because there's an executive order--"
2014.13-894,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,897.662,897.912,Yes.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,899.88,900.414,--Your Honor--
2014.13-894,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,900.414,903.449,"Because if this -- am I right, there is no worry?"
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,903.449,904.134,"--No, Your Honor."
2014.13-894,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,904.134,910.638,"Because if, in fact, this is going to lead to blowing up airplanes, all he has to do is use that second prong."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,912.588,924.213,"You're not right, Your Honor, because that is fundamentally inconsistent with the judgment that Congress made that the SSI system should coexist with the classified information and with executive orders."
2014.13-894,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,937.205,938.372,I'm not saying anything like that.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,971.945,987.372,"--So, Your Honor, I think such a system could be devised, but I think it would be a very odd construction of the statutes the Court has before it to -- to say that we are going to undermine and eviscerate the SSI system that Congress by statute--"
2014.13-894,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,987.372,987.938,"No, no."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1029.465,1037.571,--I think it is possible that the President could entirely duplicate the SSI system that Congress set up to help to prevent that practical problem.
2014.13-894,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1037.571,1048.426,"To follow up on that, if the President proceeded along that path, what would be the consequences with respect to the people, the class of people who would be able to have access to this information?"
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1054.08,1057.968,"So the system could not work, Your Honor, if it was a classified information system."
2014.13-894,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1057.968,1058.301,No.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1059.717,1063.019,"So Justice Breyer's system, the answer is we would be in uncharted territory."
2014.13-894,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1083.516,1084.699,Yes.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1102.061,1108.481,"--So, Your Honor, I -- I just -- I -- I think that that would work, but I have to say I'm not sure of the ins and outs."
2014.13-894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1109.897,1130.578,"It would have one good effect and that is, it would make sure that the matter is important enough to occupy the President's attention and is not so insignificant that an agency that just doesn't want any whistleblower, doesn't want any criticism of what it's doing, can pump out these regulations."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1133.699,1138.251,"--Your Honor, it might have that effect, but I think that that's the judgment that Congress made."
2014.13-894,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1168.703,1187.416,"Mr. Gershengorn, if I could, before you get away from this, and I understand you have a statutory argument to make, but the way that the President would do this, if he wanted to do it, would be by a new executive order or, in fact, would this old Executive Order 13556, which deals with controlled unclassified information, is that what the President would use?"
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1187.416,1190.718,"--Your Honor, I'm not sure of the ins and outs of what the President would have to do."
2014.13-894,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1199.357,1199.657,Right.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1221.071,1226.475,"--So, Your Honor, I just don't know the answer to that, whether that order would -- would satisfy."
2014.13-894,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1246.288,1250.757,"Well, about -- you talked about what Congress meant and set up."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1266.619,1268.219,"So, Your Honor, I don't think that's right."
2014.13-894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1298.821,1299.207,Yes.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1308.445,1308.928,--It does.
2014.13-894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.928,1310.428,"Here, it just said “ by law ”."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1318.318,1326.072,"So I think what you need to conclude from that, Your Honor, is that the term “ by law ” has to exclude at least some rules and regulations, and we think that it does."
2014.13-894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1334.928,1335.361,How do we know that?
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1335.361,1338.982,Because that is the presumption that this Court set up in Chrysler.
2014.13-894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.338,1381.992,"If -- if that is true and if that is so obvious, Congress would not have -- have to have said"
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1389.165,1389.915,"No, Your Honor."
2014.13-894,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1439.378,1442.847,"But the place -- Mr. Gershengorn, Chrysler was -- it just said “ law ”."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1457.94,1474.551,"--So, Your Honor, the reason I don't think it does is because it is equally consistent with precisely the distinction that Chrysler drew between regulation -- rules, regulations with the force and effect of law on the one hand and internal rules and reg -- and rules of agency--"
2014.13-894,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.551,1475.751,"Boy, that is subtle."
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1499.767,1503.988,"--So, Your Honor, the reason why I don't think you should find that hard to believe is the following."
2014.13-894,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1521.882,1532.155,One -- there was one view that by going to “ law ” rather than “ statute ” what was meant was to include judicial decisions.
2014.13-894,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1532.155,1539.059,"--Your Honor, it does say that in the -- in the legislative history, but that's precisely why I think this Court should view that with some skepticism."
2014.13-894,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1554.004,1554.787,"Thank you, counsel."
