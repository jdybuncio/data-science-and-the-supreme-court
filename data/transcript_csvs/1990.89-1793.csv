1990.89-1793,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.513,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-1793, United States v. Thomas Gaubert."
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,9.7,12.62,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1793,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,86.278,89.511,"Well, Mr. Gerson, you say there are two questions presented."
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,97.196,97.976,"Yes, they are, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1793,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,251.087,254.898,What is the case authority for this two-part test?
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,254.898,256.13,"--Berkovitz, Your Honor."
1990.89-1793,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.13,256.286,Berkovitz?
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,256.286,259.599,I think that that bifurcation is set forth clearly.
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.856,345.017,"Mr. Gerson, what if the Federal officials undertook to actually supervise the granting of particular loans, deciding loan by loan whether this particular real estate is likely to be valuable enough to be sound collateral, and so forth?"
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,346.562,346.922,It might.
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,346.922,348.842,I know it might.
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,351.967,354.403,I don't think one can say as an absolute.
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,378.799,380.861,That is what makes it a policy decision?
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,380.861,383.047,I think there are two things that make it a policy decision.
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,415.925,416.847,Let me get those two.
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,421.829,422.719,--Judgmental.
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,427.826,429.06,And secondly?
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,429.06,433.777,"And second, it has to be derived from what is a unique Federal interest."
1990.89-1793,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,433.777,436.714,Does that answer the loan example?
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,437.478,462.422,"Well, under the regulations in effect at the time, and indeed in a different place today but still in effect, the supervisory regulators were responsible for going into the institution, and rather than exercising ultimate authority, putting it into receivership, their goal was to work very closely with management, making a number of suggestions, to see whether management could eliminate unsafe or unsound practices."
1990.89-1793,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,462.422,464.717,"I don't mean to interrupt you, but just to focus on Justice Scalia's hypothetical."
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,481.118,481.897,It might.
1990.89-1793,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,482.741,484.912,"You say it might, but what other facts do you need?"
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,484.912,490.692,"--Well, what is the unsafe or unsound practice that the regulators are looking at and attempting to remedy?"
1990.89-1793,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,496.766,504.764,"No, they decide what the standards are for all the loans, and then they're applying those standards in a particular application, to a particular loan application."
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,512.01,519.321,"--Well, the way that that would be done under this regime is to suggest it to the board that was in place."
1990.89-1793,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,539.374,548.589,"--Well, here you have an allegation that the defendants arranged for the hiring of a particular consultant on operational and financial matters."
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,562.381,564.006,"Yes, I suggest that it would be."
1990.89-1793,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,605.271,613.564,"Suppose the advisor was absolutely unqualified, had no experience in banking whatsoever?"
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,613.564,617.53,"Again, the discretionary function exception ought to protect that."
1990.89-1793,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,617.53,622.513,"How is that any different than, say, in the Varig case?"
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,648.394,650.798,"I would, because there there would be no discretion."
1990.89-1793,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,660.435,665.307,"You say there's discretion to hire a totally unqualified, incompetent consultant?"
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,665.307,668.572,--The issue is whether or not there is discretion to hire a consultant.
1990.89-1793,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,671.555,672.977,"Well, then it depends on how you phrase the issue."
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,676.226,683.926,"Well, I agree, there is no regulation that requires a particular method of hiring or a particular evaluation."
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,733.483,733.952,Excuse me.
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,740.887,741.121,No.
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.885,743.791,What is the test of whether it relates to policy?
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,743.791,755.615,"The... as I suggested earlier, is it... under Berkovitz the Court reflected on the activity being part of the judgmental process of enforcing the regulatory program."
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.894,765.689,I don't care what all the cases say.
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,768.703,770.999,--That it's part of the judgmental process--
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,770.999,772.593,--Part of the judgmental process--
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,772.593,773.656,--of enforcing the regulatory program.
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,773.656,775.483,--of enforcing the regulatory program.
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,775.483,793.741,"I suggest also in this case that there is involved a uniquely Federal interest, and that that is useful language derived from the statute to describe the applicability or not of the discretionary function exception."
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,793.741,821.666,"So, so I assume that if one of the problems with these banks was they were getting sued too often for automobile accidents by negligent... because of their negligent employees driving the bank's cars, and if the Federal examiners should prescribe how to drive the car, you know, don't take a left turn, or something like that, and if that should cause an accident, that would be a policy judgment then?"
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,826.446,838.613,"Well, I would suggest that that did not involve a uniquely Federal interest, given the legislative history which preserves almost above anything else the automobile accident as the common law tort--"
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,838.613,838.971,"Oh, I see."
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,838.971,839.268,--reserved.
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.106,934.325,Even if that was done to save money?
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,934.325,934.809,Yes.
1990.89-1793,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,935.934,950.427,"Well, you're saying, for example, that the Federal policy to have the institution not make any bad loans would be enough to justify discretion on selecting which loans are acceptable and which are not."
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,950.427,952.426,"Well, it could, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1793,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,982.008,988.662,"And if there's a Federal policy to favor good management, then hiring the consultant, of course, you get discretion on which managers to pick."
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,988.662,991.176,I don't disagree with that.
1990.89-1793,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.645,993.02,"I mean, that would be... I think that's your position."
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,1003.312,1004.468,--I don't disagree with that.
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1055.869,1068.144,"Mr. Gerson, I... it doesn't seem to me that it's fair play to simply make an automobile-driving exception to your principle because the legislative history makes that clear."
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,1102.179,1104.193,"I respectfully disagree, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1133.963,1135.727,"Well, the post office doesn't regulate."
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,1143.443,1147.425,"No, I'm saying that the discretionary function exception doesn't apply to the driver."
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1157.469,1158.828,Regulatory discretion.
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,1158.828,1159.124,Yes.
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1166.2,1181.241,"So, if it's a Federal Government that does not regulate, but that just provides Federal services, there is no regulation of private activity involved, it gives out money or it does things of that sort, there is no possibility of having a discretionary function exception at all?"
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,1181.241,1190.893,--I think there's a possibility in as much as in Berkovitz the Court described the second fork of the test as being in furtherance of policy.
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.704,1193.563,So it doesn't have to be regulatory policy.
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,1193.563,1202.638,"--I am sure that some... I think it's most likely to come up in a regulatory sense, but one can envision activities that are not purely regulatory but that further policy."
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1202.638,1203.216,A whole lot of activities.
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,1203.216,1213.399,"Of course, the individual who commits the particular act in question has got to be charged with carrying out that particular policy or creating it, or doing something along those lines."
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.399,1216.32,0 [inaudible].
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,1216.32,1223.177,Except that that is an activity which I think is likely spelled out in regulations as to how one performs it and what one does.
1990.89-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.204,1233.187,That depends on how you define policy.
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,1233.187,1248.494,"I think that that is correct, and I'm trying to define it in terms of what this Court has had to say in cases on the subject, and what the Congress had to say when it created the exception and the limitation to the exception with particular reference to automobile accidents."
1990.89-1793,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1261.849,1270.61,"Does your exception apply whenever policy considerations might influence the judgment, or when they do influence the judgment?"
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,1270.61,1274.374,I think that the answer has to be the former rather than the latter.
1990.89-1793,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1324.167,1329.931,"Well, it seems to me your test necessarily is fact specific in many cases."
1990.89-1793,0,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,1329.931,1339.582,"I agree that it's fact specific in many, if not most cases, because you need to look at the facts to see whether there is an activity that requires the exercise of discretion."
1990.89-1793,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1354.029,1355.264,"Very well, Mr. Gerson."
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1357.044,1369.009,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1443.541,1448.758,"Did the district court dispose of this as a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment, Mr. Lowell?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1448.758,1461.673,"Justice Rehnquist, as a motion to dismiss on the pleadings, excepting, theoretically, the respondent's allegations as being true, but developing such a broad exception under the Federal Tort Claims Act that no balancing, no policy, nothing was considered."
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.989,1505.875,"But, Mr. Lowell, the Fifth Circuit opinion, as I read it, did rely on some sort of distinction which I don't find in our cases between operational on the one hand as the counterpart of discretionary."
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1505.875,1507.764,"Justice Rehnquist, I think the Fifth Circuit followed--"
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1507.764,1508.748,I'm the Chief Justice.
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1508.748,1509.233,--your precedents to a letter.
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1510.981,1513.075,I'm the Chief Justice.
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1513.075,1513.356,--Sorry.
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1522.212,1525.055,"Which, which was not a discretionary function case."
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1525.055,1526.382,Only because the Government conceded it.
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1526.82,1535.644,"Mr. Lowell, the Court said in Indian function, we're not dealing with discretionary function because the Government didn't make that argument."
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1535.644,1542.61,--But what the Fifth Circuit did was not... look at the appendix to the Government's petition for cert. at 7a.
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1565.96,1575.098,"So, if... your answer to the question where does the word operational come from in our discretionary function cases, you say it comes from Indian Towing."
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1575.098,1575.379,No.
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1576.393,1579.845,"Well, where does... what case does the word operational come from?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1579.845,1588.169,"--Go back to this Court's holding in Dalehite, where the Court said that the negligence in that case was on the planning rather than the operational level."
1990.89-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1642.586,1646.506,"Excuse me, if you go on to that second step anyway, what's the use of the first step?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1649.738,1662.764,"--I think it is an aid, and only an aid, to look back at some antecedent policy to determine whether or not the act, as later this Court determined in Berkovitz or in Dalehite, is the kind of act that is so governed by regulation... for example, in Dalehite."
1990.89-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1679.21,1681.929,What's the use of characterizing it is what I want to know.
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1689.3,1690.628,"--Justice Scalia, I think it's--"
1990.89-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1690.628,1691.159,So why take that first step?
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1691.159,1693.861,--I think it just helps in determining the scrutiny a court gives.
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1779.08,1788.058,"Mr. Lowell, does the fact that the things the Government did in a particular case were extraordinary, does that bear on operational versus policy?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1788.058,1789.246,"--No, not necessarily at all."
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.964,1798.602,"Well, but... you say it doesn't make any difference?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1798.602,1801.319,--I think it's... it's not outcome determinative.
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1802.35,1806.428,"Well, why does the Fifth Circuit mention it, then, if it has nothing to do with it?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1806.428,1811.394,--I think when you can label something... because it points out that there was no antecedent policy.
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1823.78,1830.948,"Does the fact that it was extraordinary, you think that militates against the exercise of the discretionary exemption or for it?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1830.948,1835.181,--I think the fact that it's extraordinary means that there is no policy that is implicated--
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1835.181,1836.197,Can you answer my question?
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1844.537,1848.161,"--I think, in the way you've asked it, the fact that it's extraordinary militates against the--"
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.161,1848.552,Against it?
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,1848.552,1851.035,--application of the discretionary function exemption.
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2078.598,2085.141,"When you say took over, Mr. Lowell, do you mean against, without the consent of the respondent or with the consent?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2085.141,2086.985,"--With the consent, Justice Rehnquist... Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1793,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2089.266,2089.531,And their action--

1990.89-1793,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2092.936,2096.263,--Their actions constituted more than simply giving advice?
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2096.263,2097.793,Yes.

1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2122.33,2124.049,--I don't think that there was a predicate.
1990.89-1793,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2141.353,2147.679,"Well, are there any specific acts that they took in the name of the savings and loan on their own initiative?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2147.679,2150.444,"Oh, yes, they took many acts in the names of the savings and loan."
1990.89-1793,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2156.66,2158.752,I thought that was... was that mediation or did they set the salary?
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2159.58,2163.439,"They... not only did they set the salary, the man who got the money was the man who set the salary."

1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2189.569,2201.58,"I mean that this man, who was an employee of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and was moved from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas into Independent American, set his own salary, and did so in this mode of--"
1990.89-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2201.58,2203.422,What do you mean by he set his own salary?
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2210.811,2213.512,--He went to the place where--
1990.89-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.512,2213.731,The latter.
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2213.731,2218.744,"--checks are written in Independent American, and he said write me $108,000 check as a signing bonus."
1990.89-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.882,2231.286,The person to whom he said that was the person who had the authority to pay that amount or not.
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2231.286,2231.864,Some person in the bursar's--
1990.89-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2231.864,2232.13,Correct?
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2233.145,2234.301,--That person could have said no.
1990.89-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2245.562,2249.296,"I just want to know what you mean by the fact that he set his salary, and that he did it."
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2249.296,2251.171,--I mean that he... I don't mean that in the dead of night he came and wrote himself a check.
1990.89-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2251.171,2254.527,"Somebody else had the power to do it, and he had power over that person."
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2254.527,2254.762,Correct.
1990.89-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2254.762,2255.277,Okay.
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2255.277,2256.184,That's exactly what happened.
1990.89-1793,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2260.199,2262.182,"Well, what power did he have over that person?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2262.182,2265.399,--He was put into Independent American as the chief operating officer.
1990.89-1793,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2270.367,2272.101,Where is this alleged in the complaint?
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2272.101,2273.397,--This is not alleged in the complaint.
1990.89-1793,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2280.378,2291.234,"Well, what is there in the complaint that indicates that the Government and its regulators took active control as opposed to simply offering advice?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2291.234,2296.184,--I think that the paragraphs of the complaint to set out the appendix say that they actually set the salaries.
1990.89-1793,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2296.184,2300.823,"No, it says it mediated the salary dispute, if that's the one you're referring to."
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2302.541,2302.823,On 15.
1990.89-1793,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2302.823,2305.508,That's all that it says.
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2305.508,2317.817,"That reference covers the fact that we are talking about, Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1793,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2370.734,2373.077,May I go back to your salary example for a minute?
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2392.974,2394.271,--In the way you asked me the question--
1990.89-1793,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2394.271,2394.754,--Yeah.
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2394.754,2398.191,"--yes, it would be, because you started your question by saying let's say they had a policy of setting--"
1990.89-1793,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2398.191,2398.379,Right.
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2398.379,2400.473,"--the Government, the salary with the prevailing rate."
1990.89-1793,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2412.124,2420.402,So we should read your complaint as saying that they did these things without any policy preceding the specific acts that would have called for these things being done?
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2420.402,2421.509,"--That's right, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1793,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2421.509,2422.306,I see.
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2422.306,2435.192,The last fact was that these actions taken when the Federal Home Loan Bank Board was making decisions caused Independent American to lose what they estimate at some $400 million when the respondent left his thrift in a positive net worth situation.
1990.89-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2437.019,2445.172,"Mr. Lowell, you know, just as agencies sometimes make policy by regulation, they sometimes make it by adjudication on a case-by-case basis."
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2453.887,2455.778,--That is--
1990.89-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2455.778,2459.589,The mere fact that there's no regulation governing it does not mean it's not a policy decision.
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2463.164,2471.629,--Your question would assume that these people at the time actually... it depends on whether policy is the result of any action taken by a regulator or the motive of the regulator.
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2602.967,2608.668,"Mr. Lowell, does the board have authority in some circumstances to appoint a conservator?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2608.668,2609.762,"Yes, it does."
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2609.762,2613.291,"Well, what if it had gone ahead and appointed a conservator."
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2623.647,2623.928,No.
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2623.928,2624.803,Why not?
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2624.803,2636.001,"I think that their decision of who to put into the thrift would be protected as a discretionary function... as the Fifth Circuit, by the way, held that we had no cause of action left as to who was sent to Independent American."
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2653.65,2656.915,Against the conservator or against the Government?
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2656.915,2659.023,"--Against the United States, whoever put in the conservator."
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2678.452,2684.497,"And then the question that would be, what was the Government's policy with respect to what kind of a conservator to appoint?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2684.497,2686.684,"No, not what kind of a conservator to appoint."
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2700.897,2704.803,"Then what is the... what is the genesis, the nature of the claim against the Government in this case, in that--"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2704.803,2706.832,"--They did not appoint a conservator, number one--"
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2706.832,2709.081,--I mean in the hypothetical case.
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2711.565,2716.173,"--If the conservator is an employee, official of the United States, acting under the authority of the regulations."
1990.89-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2761.262,2768.275,"Mr. Lowell, in your response to the Chief Justice you insisted that there had to be... that there must have been an antecedent policy."
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2771.493,2777.225,"I mean antecedent, not counting out the possibility that you stated, that policy is made at that time."
1990.89-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2779.474,2782.566,"Oh, so there has to be antecedent, not excluding the possibility that it doesn't have to be antecedent?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2782.566,2790.564,"--No, it has to be antecedent either already existing, or the act has to take place on the basis of some policy-oriented decision being made right then and there."
1990.89-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2795.406,2798.013,"Well, but isn't it in a sense?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2818.161,2825.332,"This Court has stated that in order to be protected there has to be economic, social, or political policy considerations."
1990.89-1793,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2931.664,2933.445,"Mr. Lowell, can I ask you one question?"
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2947.424,2957.514,"They say that it does state a cause of action for a tort and leaves the question of whether or not Mr. Gaubert, the respondent, has standing to bring them under Texas law."
1990.89-1793,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2966.667,2967.399,Thank you.
1990.89-1793,1,16476,abbe_david_lowell,,2967.399,2978.551,There can be no policy threatened here unless the Court accepts the Government's proposition that anything taken in a Government context by a regulatory agency is policy laden.
1990.89-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3087.993,3090.381,"Thank you, Mr. Lowell."
1990.89-1793,2,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,3091.74,3093.099,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1793,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3228.403,3247.567,"Mr. Gerson, could you give us an example of an act that these regulators could have taken that they thought was in furtherance of their mission to salvage these S&L's, which would not come within the discretionary function exemption?"
1990.89-1793,2,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,3249.926,3252.91,I suppose that they... I set forth more than just driving the car.
1990.89-1793,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3302.639,3314.697,"Just, just tell me again why failure to maintain the machines or closing down the lights, the other example that you gave, why that would not come within the discretion... I mean, it's all done to save money to this institution that is losing money."
1990.89-1793,2,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,3314.697,3315.275,"Well, I would--"
1990.89-1793,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3315.275,3317.008,Why would it not come within the exemption?
1990.89-1793,2,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,3317.008,3328.379,--I think it's unlikely that such activities would involve directly the Federal regulatory policy interest here and the exercise of judgment with respect to those things.
1990.89-1793,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3355.336,3356.399,"Well, I would suppose--"
1990.89-1793,2,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,3375.455,3379.405,"No, I don't think that it... I don't think that... I mean, if we're saying that, we shouldn't be saying that."
1990.89-1793,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3379.405,3380.343,"Well, the Government--"
1990.89-1793,2,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,3380.343,3380.906,That's not our--
1990.89-1793,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.906,3397.587,"--So, just giving advice can, which happens to be followed, could impose liability on the Government, even though this is a private corporation that has no... is not compelled to follow the advice?"
1990.89-1793,2,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,3397.587,3415.236,"--Well, the issue of suasion and the fact that the advice could be avoided relates to what I suggest is a different point, which is that what the respondent here, we suggest, is trying to litigate is what he calls in his brief the extra-regulatory takeover of the institution."
1990.89-1793,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3451.97,3452.142,Moral suasion?
1990.89-1793,2,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,3453.626,3455.094,"--Well, economic suasion I guess you would call it."
1990.89-1793,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3455.094,3455.313,--I guess so.
1990.89-1793,2,41377,stuart_m_gerson,,3455.313,3457.265,That's a fair point.
1990.89-1793,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3465.903,3466.59,"Thank you, Mr. Gerson."
