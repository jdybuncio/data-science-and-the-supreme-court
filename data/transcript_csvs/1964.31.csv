1964.31,0,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,56.578,59.023,"Highsaw, emphasis on the H-I."
1964.31,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,59.023,64.271,"Well it -- when it spelt that way, I should have pronounced it that way."
1964.31,0,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,64.271,73.222,The basic question presented to the Court by this case is one of jurisdiction.
1964.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,346.711,351.922,Did that provision put them in the collective bargaining agreement for the first time in 1959?
1964.31,0,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,351.922,352.752,That's right Your Honor.
1964.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,367.833,370.327,And is there anything in the record that shows that?
1964.31,0,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,370.327,373.216,"No, that type was not a fair merger."
1964.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,377.133,378.796,Nothing in the record to show the reason why it was permitted.
1964.31,0,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,378.796,379.131,No.
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,1806.454,1810.128,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.31,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1950.011,1958.189,"Federal District Court decided that if it survives at all, is that a need to question?"
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,1958.189,1968.985,"Well, I take if the question whether the contract survives at all, is a question of substantive law that the District Court could decide."
1964.31,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.475,1974.297,You don't think that's --
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,1974.297,1974.701,Not --
1964.31,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1974.701,1975.576,-- could be arbitrary?
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,1975.576,1976.261,What?
1964.31,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1976.261,1977.384,You don't think that the question --
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,1977.384,1987.145,"Well, I'd -- when I said was the contract survived at all, I perhaps should have drawn a dis -- should not have spoken so broadly."
1964.31,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.678,1998.128,"Let's assume that that is so, that the --"
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,1998.128,2001.705,"Then I read the Wiley, you -- assume the Court decides that."
1964.31,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2001.705,2002.222,"Yes, but the argument --"
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2002.222,2023.412,"Then I read the Wiley case as indicating that it is open to the arbitrator to consider whether the merger has resulted in such changes in circumstances and so other practice, that some are all of the substantive obligations under the contract have expired."
1964.31,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2036.805,2040.852,The -- this -- this collect -- this agreement setup a system adjustment board?
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2040.852,2043.677,This agreement setup the equivalent of a system adjustment board.
1964.31,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2045.605,2045.755,On the Capital?
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2045.755,2058.284,"It appears on -- begins on page 31 Justice Stewart, sets up in Article 31, a method for the adjustment of grievances."
1964.31,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2367.979,2373.101,"This -- by statute, this was of general without regard to the laws of (Voice Overlap)."
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2373.101,2379.321,"The statute, I didn't mean to imply that the statute says anything about, without regard to the laws of representation."
1964.31,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2387.25,2390.751,That -- is this problem ever been --
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2390.751,2391.753,It's not been litigated.
1964.31,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2420.501,2431.696,"You stated on page 8 of your brief, this brief was filed in August that the election that is -- that's ordered by the Board has not yet taken into place."
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2434.0,2440.427,Only that the litigation that's held it up has now reached this Court because certiorari has been granted.
1964.31,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2440.427,2441.578,But that is the one?
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2441.578,2443.168,That's the same one.
1964.31,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2460.587,2468.575,But you do maintain that once that election was held then this -- this case becomes moot so to speak.
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2468.575,2470.744,Once -- not quite there.
1964.31,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2553.197,2556.939,That's been done in (Inaudible)
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2556.939,2558.071,I don't know of any decision.
1964.31,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2558.891,2564.117,Or whether it's practiced?
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2564.117,2565.55,No one has ever raised it.
1964.31,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2592.399,2594.203,"That was a contract, wasn't it?"
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2594.203,2597.988,That was a contract but that's what's being sued to enforce here as a contract.
1964.31,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2616.708,2627.488,We'll recess.
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2630.137,2633.503,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.31,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2753.033,2758.353,(Inaudible)
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2758.353,2763.598,"Well, I was -- oh, you mean whether they by joining specifically did give."
1964.31,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2788.691,2790.744,(Inaudible)
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2790.744,2793.645,"In the Machinist agreement there is, yes."
1964.31,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.138,2875.408,(Inaudible)
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2875.408,2884.083,"That was what I tried -- that was what I tried to suggest when I said that it would be to allow the tail to wag the dog, that the bigger part of the case would not be involved in this problem."
1964.31,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2884.083,2891.411,(Inaudible) that the case here does involve both -- whether both of the parties (Inaudible) the other.
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2891.411,2891.877,Yes.
1964.31,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2891.877,2897.25,(Inaudible)
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2897.25,2899.289,You might -- you might.
1964.31,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.963,2917.283,Does it mean here (Inaudible)
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2917.283,2919.681,I don't think they claim it in this case.
1964.31,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.842,2935.589,That the contract does -- does continue (Inaudible)?
1964.31,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2935.589,2939.685,Well it's -- I guess they've put it in both ways.
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,3636.855,3637.759,May it please the Court.
1964.31,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3637.759,3641.225,Mr. Bernstein?
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,3641.225,3649.823,This case was tried in the District Court by cross motions for summary judgments supported affidavits of both parties.
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4311.098,4315.362,(Inaudible)
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4315.362,4316.179,To impose such --
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4316.179,4316.645,Yes.
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4316.645,4317.51,-- to do this.
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4321.053,4338.759,"Let's assume that it had said or we agree with the Union that -- let's say, in the case of these 533 people, we agree, we're going to impose this condition of the merger that the 530 people will be represented by the Union."
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4338.759,4339.666,Yes sir.
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4339.666,4343.993,Even though there's another union in the picture for the balance of those machinists.
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4343.993,4350.662,I think sir that we would have had to assume that as a condition of the merger or have had the alternative of not going at with the merger.
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4350.662,4358.821,So that CAB could make that sort of a provision or could have said expressly that the -- this collective bargaining contract --
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4358.821,4359.213,Survives.
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4359.213,4361.009,-- expires in its entirety?
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4361.009,4362.551,"Yes sir, it could have done that."
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4368.202,4372.025,You ever heard of CAB terminating collective bargaining contract?
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4372.025,4372.506,Yes sir.
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4420.478,4426.362,CAB then needn't all consider the jurisdiction of the National Mediation Board?
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4426.362,4427.846,"Oh, I do not say that sir."
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4432.247,4433.883,Then there is a representation of dispute here?
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4433.883,4435.235,"Yes sir, I do."
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4435.98,4439.773,"Well if there is, there was before the Board."
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4439.773,4444.888,"Well, this is -- the difficulty here is placing labels on this kind of litigation."
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4446.446,4449.937,"No, but it's enough of a label for you to claim that the District Court didn't have jurisdiction."
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4449.937,4450.932,That's correct.
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4451.194,4453.821,"And if it didn't, why would the CAB?"
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4453.821,4473.176,"If you view this as simply a matter of does this contract survived for the period of time between the merger and the time a new representative is selected, if any, through a collect -- through a bargaining -- the representation election by the NMB, if it's viewed that narrowly, then it is a contract question and the CAB could have decided it."
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4473.176,4474.971,"Well then, and so for the District Court?"
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4474.971,4475.789,No sir.
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4475.789,4477.519,Why?
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4477.519,4484.514,"Because the question is really not that limited before the District Court because there, you do have the representation questions which come to bearing."
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4488.275,4495.097,Would you agree essentially -- you agree with the -- would you agree with the Solicitor General there as to the --
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4495.097,4496.535,With respect to what?
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4499.292,4504.626,It says that you should view it as effective this interim period.
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4513.512,4526.29,"Well, if Your Honor please, this is the difficulty with the -- perhaps stating the facts, so the piecemeal of the fact was that these employees became -- this union became a minority union, a unit for only a minority of the craft or class."
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4921.056,4934.768,"It might have written the claim and not on the -- as to particularly wrong to particular employee but there is a claim that -- that (a), the arbitration clause survived and (b), some other provisions of the contract survived."
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4934.768,4938.871,"Well, if Your Honor please, these have not been identified in the complaint."
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4939.88,4940.921,If you're saying that --
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4940.921,4941.084,-- the entire thing survives.
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4941.084,4944.236,What you're saying is that there's no case of controversy here.
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4944.236,4954.899,"Well, I say that when you compel arbitration, this Court has always said that the Court not only finds that the obligation to arbitrate is present but also that the issues are arbitrable."
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4956.824,4960.085,"Well, the survival of the other terms in the contract."
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4960.085,4968.086,"But you see sir, the difficulty I have with that is, for example what terms will the Union suggest that the vacation clause of the Brotherhood agreement survived, when it's inferior to the vacation --"
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4968.086,4971.624,What if it says the entire contract?
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4971.624,4972.852,"Again, I have -- this is my problem."
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4972.852,4974.272,(Voice Overlap) explain this?
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,4974.272,4980.223,There are an infinite number of kinds of things one could conjure up that you should say should be arbitrated under this.
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5084.326,5106.656,"Now what if the Union goes into the -- to the surviving employer like the Union -- the Capital union goes to United's -- the United personnel manager or president right after the merger, it says I want to sit down and talk to you about the situation of these 500 fellows -- these 500 in Phoenix and their status under this contract."
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5106.656,5106.748,Well --
1964.31,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5106.748,5108.037,"The United says, “Now, go on."
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5162.894,5163.425,I'm sorry.
1964.31,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5294.146,5297.515,You mean once the election tells them what?
1964.31,2,41074,stuart_bernstein,,5297.515,5305.009,"Well, if they didn't win, I suppose that somebody else might have a say about the matter."
1964.31,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5436.083,5439.684,Mr. Highsaw.
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5439.684,5441.397,May it please the Court.
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5471.18,5472.211,Who's brief is that?
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5472.211,5487.706,"This is the brief of the United Airlines to the Civil Aeronautics Board in the United-Capital merger case, Docket Number 11699, dated January 23, 1961 signed by counsel for the law firm from which counsel is a member."
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5557.377,5560.215,You do then say that the Board could have dispose that matter.
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5560.215,5560.894,I think they --
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5560.894,5561.898,That they did have the power to be --
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5561.898,5562.566,"Yes, that's right."
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5570.54,5575.454,And do you think it was a -- do you think it was right that they didn't?
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5578.371,5581.778,"I think it was permissible if they did not dispose, yes Your Honor."
1964.31,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5581.778,5590.703,"Well then, how do you answer Mr. Bernstein's argument because that involves -- he probably dealt within the Panagra case."
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5590.703,5600.132,"Well, I don't think that the Panagra case and the Kent -- in the Kent case which he -- which he also say that it involved anything there to the same problem."
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5637.761,5652.391,"Yes, but you're saying, you don't -- you say the Board could leave this matter unresolved although it had the power to get a hold of it, then you don't rest your argument that they didn't or shouldn't deal with it on the jurisdiction of the National Mediation Board at all."
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5652.391,5653.605,No.
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5653.605,5659.92,"I mean, if they had -- they shouldn't have just left it alone just out of deference to the National Mediation Board."
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5659.92,5660.422,No.
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5706.616,5710.073,Well what do you want the -- what do you think the arbitrator under the --
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5710.073,5710.286,"Well, I don't think --"
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5710.286,5711.866,-- (Voice Overlap) issue before the arbitrator?
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5711.866,5723.347,"I don't -- well the only issue I think that ought to be submitted to an arbitrator, Your Honor, is the question of whether or not the particular employee has agreements because United violated the contract."
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5729.278,5729.997,Alright --
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5729.997,5731.446,-- I think the Court should decide that.
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5731.446,5731.959,"Yes, I know."
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5736.543,5739.496,"Well, if the Court says that we won't decide that --"
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5739.496,5746.455,"Then all we decide is the -- is that the arbitration clause survives, then what are you going to do?"
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5746.455,5769.503,"Well if they -- if that's what the Court decides, then I think that the Court also ought to make clear to United, that United should sit down with the Brotherhood in good faith under this last clause of Article 1(b) of the collective bargaining agreement to negotiate in good faith about the procedure to be followed and they --"
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5769.503,5780.934,"What if the Court doesn't say it, all they've decided is this, that the arbitration clause survives and the Court and the court below has jurisdiction to order arbitration about something."
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5780.934,5787.511,"Well, if that is all that the Court says and then I think that the rights of the employees in this situation will be defeated."
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5800.223,5805.026,But what else do you want except to protect the rights of employees?
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5805.026,5815.721,"Well, we be -- because of the fact Your -- because of the uncertainty of this agreement and the whole situation that has prevailed for three years, it's not been a normal situation."
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5826.595,5827.385,I know but at --
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5827.385,5828.664,You don't have that kind of a situation --
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5828.664,5831.799,But if the Court determined that the arbitration clause survives --
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5831.799,5832.435,Yes.
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5832.435,5835.728,-- and that grievances were arbitrable under this --
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5835.728,5836.272,"Yes, sir."
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5836.272,5837.119,-- if there were any --
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5837.119,5837.983,Yes.
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5837.983,5841.277,"-- then all -- you wait towards grievance, don't you?"
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5841.277,5843.518,"Well as to the future, that's right, Your Honor."
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5846.813,5848.383,What else can you do then?
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5848.383,5873.8,"With respect, well we think that the -- we think that the Court can declare that the contract survived and that then the individuals who have already filed grievances -- and there are some grievances on the file, it can then go in and submit these grievances only on the question of whether or not the carrier took the action which violated the contract."
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5887.506,5896.163,I know but if the grievances -- you've got some grievances in that -- that are filed and you wanted to bring them up why you bring them up.
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5904.85,5905.683,Well --
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5905.683,5906.807,"Now, what's wrong with that?"
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,5906.807,5910.06,"Well, counts are number of things."
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6076.804,6097.406,"What do you have to say about Mr. Bernstein's suggestion that the -- you really don't have anything concrete to any rights of employees that you're worried about or to object too or to try to protect but that you -- this is really a representation question that you've let -- this litigation as part of your “it might represent 13,000”."
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,6097.406,6104.995,What I have to say about that Your Honor is that the record shows Mr. Dennis' affidavit that there has been injury to the employees.
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6109.569,6111.41,What rights?
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,6111.41,6118.861,Rights under almost every provision of the contract which have been violated by this carrier.
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6118.861,6119.765,-- give me an example.
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,6119.765,6130.041,"Well, the -- one is an automatic pay to the type of arrangement, which the carrier has not provided."
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6130.041,6131.331,Automatic pay?
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,6131.331,6133.075,Automatic pay provision.
1964.31,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6133.075,6134.052,Bidding rights.
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,6134.052,6142.543,"And bidding rights of these people, seniority rights to be handled."
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6155.388,6159.603,Have you asked United ever to -- to bargain about any of these --
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,6159.603,6159.651,Yes.
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6159.651,6160.716,-- on this matter?
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,6160.716,6168.311,"We've asked them to sit down and bargain about all of these matters from August 11, 1960 until we filed this complaint."
1964.31,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6175.818,6183.141,That's why wouldn't this be just a -- just dandy subjects than normal subjects for an arbitrator.
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,6183.141,6200.032,"Well the question of whether or not they violated the contract is but the question of whether or not the contract survived, I don't think it is for the reason which I've been trying to give, Your Honor."
1964.31,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6263.692,6265.985,On whose behalf that you'd be bargaining?
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,6265.985,6279.179,"On behalf of the employees that are covered by this contract and the 2700, 2170 employees are still unrepresented on --"
1964.31,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6279.179,6282.265,Why not the 530 who --
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,6282.265,6296.307,"And if there were any problems, Your Honor, we would on behalf of the -- if any, if there weren't any problems between June 1 and June 23, 1961 and I don't know of any at the moment, on those employees."
1964.31,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6306.478,6309.989,"Well, they're covered by this agreement, aren't they?"
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,6309.989,6311.092,"Not now, no."
1964.31,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6311.092,6311.363,Why not?
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,6311.363,6321.207,"They were taken out from under this agreement by the agreement between the -- between the IAM and United on June 23, 1961."
1964.31,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6321.207,6325.057,"Well, if you're writing a basic provision that was a violation of this agreement, wasn't it?"
1964.31,3,30840,james_l_highsaw_jr,,6325.057,6336.412,"No, Your Honor, because you can always terminate the obligations under a collective bargaining agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act."
