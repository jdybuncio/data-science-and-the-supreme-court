2010.09-1403,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.356,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1403, Erica P. John Fund v. Halliburton Company."
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,11.139,14.141,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1403,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,53.885,55.268,I just stop you there.
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,55.268,55.701,--Certainly.
2010.09-1403,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,55.701,57.17,"Mr. Boies, if could What if that had been disputed?"
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,60.372,61.755,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1403,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,63.588,64.754,"Mr. Boies, what's the difference then?"
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,69.825,89.886,"--Because the issue of efficient market goes to the presumption of reliance, and if the court holds at the certification stage that there is no efficient market, then the basis for presuming class-wide reliance is impacted."
2010.09-1403,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,106.248,109.283,"Well, how about materiality?"
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,113.169,119.239,"No, Your Honor, we don't think you can rebut materiality at the -- at the certification stage."
2010.09-1403,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,125.661,137.886,"Well, now I'm a little confused, because the efficient market and materiality are all part of the prima facie case triggering the Basic presumption."
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,142.088,148.158,Because the issue of materiality is something that goes to a class-wide common issue.
2010.09-1403,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,167.87,169.071,But common reliance--
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,169.071,169.454,--under Rule 23--
2010.09-1403,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,169.454,174.891,--can be rebutted at the -- common reliance can be rebutted at the certification stage?
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,174.891,176.708,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2010.09-1403,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,176.708,182.462,The Basic presumption can be -- can the Basic presumption be rebutted at the certification stage?
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,182.462,184.164,"The Basic presumption of reliance, yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-1403,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,199.174,206.328,Can it be rebutted by proof other than proof generally disproving the efficiency of the market?
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,206.328,213.266,"We believe under the Court's decision in Basic that that is something that is reserved for trial, that -- that rebuttal."
2010.09-1403,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,213.266,215.8,"And what is that based on, the footnote in Basic?"
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,215.8,216.135,Yes.
2010.09-1403,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,216.452,217.735,"Well, that's pretty thin, isn't it?"
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,228.443,229.876,"I don't from this Court, Your Honor."
2010.09-1403,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,229.876,232.562,Do you have anything in the rule to support that?
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,232.562,233.678,Anything in the rule?
2010.09-1403,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,233.678,234.23,Yes.
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,234.23,243.303,"Well, I think the -- I think what the rule does is it talks about whether issues of common issue predominate over individualized issue."
2010.09-1403,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,255.927,258.51,"Mr. Boies, how would it work in your view of the case?"
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,292.433,324.322,"As -- as this Court indicated in Dura, in order to prove loss causation, you must demonstrate that you had either an increase in the prices, and this -- this assumes that you are concealing negative information; the reverse would be true if you were concealing positive information -- an increase at the time that the concealment took place or a decline when the actual facts were revealed."
2010.09-1403,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,350.02,362.863,"Counsel, doesn't a lack of response to a disclosure -- couldn't it be in some situations reflective of an inefficient market?"
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,362.863,365.149,"Yes, Your Honor, I think it could."
2010.09-1403,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,380.924,381.841,Why is it?
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,398.453,412.361,"--The -- the problem is, as the Fifth Circuit noted at page 335 of the F. 3d report, efficiency of this market was conceded below."
2010.09-1403,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,422.401,426.436,"Mr. -- Mr. Boies, you talked about loss causation."
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,481.44,488.344,"Well, it depends on how the Fifth Circuit then construes reliance."
2010.09-1403,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.344,491.879,"Well, they -- they would construe it the way Respondents say they have already construed it."
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,491.879,501.853,"Your Honor, I think that if they simply changed the wording and called loss causation reliance, obviously it wouldn't make any difference."
2010.09-1403,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,550.584,561.142,I think what you've said is that there's really no difference between loss causation and what Respondents assert that the Fifth Circuit found.
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,561.142,561.975,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-1403,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,582.138,582.588,Right.
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,582.588,595.53,"There's also a difference between what Respondents say and what this Court has said in Basic and Matrixx and the other cases, in terms of what is required to prove for class certification."
2010.09-1403,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,617.062,621.598,"Okay, but -- but you -- you would want us to say that and not just say that loss causation--"
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,621.598,622.298,Yes.
2010.09-1403,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,622.799,635.273,How do you see or what difference do you see between their loss causation evidence and an inefficient market?
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,659.556,686.206,"I don't believe under this Court's decision in Basic that, given the actual objective facts that have been admitted -- it's a very public market, very widespread distribution of information, a lot of analysts are reporting on it -- I don't believe that as a objective factual matter they would be able ever to demonstrate that this was not an efficient market."
2010.09-1403,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,721.629,779.335,"What do you say to -- to the following argument, that there are some economists who say that, even in a market that is generally efficient, there can be instances in which the market does not incorporate certain statements into the price of a stock; and therefore even when it is demonstrated that the market meets the test for efficiency that the lower courts have settled upon in the wake of Basic, the defendant in a -- in a class action where there is reliance on the Basic presumption should be permitted at the class certification stage to prove that the allegedly fraudulent statements had no impact on price, and by doing that destroy the theory that the class relied on the statements, because they relied on the price which incorporated the statements?"
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,779.335,797.796,"I -- I think, Your Honor, that if you have a situation in which the proof is class-wide, it is something that goes only to summary judgment or trial."
2010.09-1403,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,856.335,862.406,"Well, whether there's an efficient market is also common to all members of the class, so why would you make an exception for that?"
2010.09-1403,0,20629,david_boies,,862.406,869.642,"Because if there's no efficient market, then individualized issues are going to predominate."
2010.09-1403,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,918.206,918.873,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1403,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,939.037,942.405,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1403,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.464,1043.889,"But you acknowledged that if the cause was the fact that the market was not efficient, that could be raised at the certification stage."
2010.09-1403,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1043.889,1056.78,"--Well, that's certainly what the Court suggested in Basic and what the courts of appeals have done, is to say that that's a threshold showing that is sufficiently collateral to the merits that it needs to be made, so that the presumption can be invoked in the first instance."
2010.09-1403,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1080.312,1088.918,"The rule isn't, I take it -- or correct me if I'm wrong -- that simply because the issue is on a class-wide basis, it can't be challenged at the certification stage."
2010.09-1403,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1093.453,1101.976,"Well, that's what Rule 23, 23(b)(3), which is the one at issue here -- the question is do common issues predominate over individual ones."
2010.09-1403,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1107.88,1112.116,But suppose there's no demonstrated basis that that common issue exists?
2010.09-1403,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1112.116,1121.056,"Then I think the plaintiff should lose at the 12(b)(6) stage, and that is a stage that has real bite after this Court's decision in Dura and after the PSLRA."
2010.09-1403,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1154.877,1161.883,Class certification is not a merits determination except with respect to reliance?
2010.09-1403,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1172.155,1176.809,"And except, just to add to the Chief Justice's question, an efficient market theory?"
2010.09-1403,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1176.809,1177.993,--That's right.
2010.09-1403,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1212.547,1226.724,"You seem to -- maybe I don't understand your argument, but you and Mr. Boies seem to be arguing that whether there is a common question -- that it is a common question whether there is a common question, and therefore that has to wait until the merits stage."
2010.09-1403,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1228.09,1230.159,"No, that's not what we're saying."
2010.09-1403,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1253.957,1279.323,"And if they show that the statement was not incorporated in the price, in the price, and they're not claiming that they relied, that every member of the class actually relied on the statement, they're all claiming they relied on the price -- if they show that the statement wasn't incorporated in the price, then why doesn't reliance cease to be a common issue and become a question of an individual issue that would have to be proved by each, each member of the class?"
2010.09-1403,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1279.323,1284.142,"Well, in that circumstance reliance ceases to be and the case cannot be established on the merits."
2010.09-1403,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1288.278,1293.082,"Yeah, but the fact that they would lose on the merits doesn't necessarily mean that they are entitled to class certification."
2010.09-1403,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1293.082,1294.532,Right.
2010.09-1403,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1354.171,1355.703,Can you -- can you do this in reverse?
2010.09-1403,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1394.196,1394.898,--Right.
2010.09-1403,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1394.898,1400.365,So they can certify under Rule 23 by using the back end.
2010.09-1403,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1411.74,1412.34,No.
2010.09-1403,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1412.859,1413.359,Why not?
2010.09-1403,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1417.061,1425.298,"--This Court said in Basic that in order to establish the presumption that you need to show the efficiency of the market, the trading during the relevant time period."
2010.09-1403,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1426.333,1428.117,They're not relying on that assumption.
2010.09-1403,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1448.163,1456.852,"--Well, with respect, just alleging that the market went down would not be enough to show that there was an initial price distortion because of the company's material misstatement."
2010.09-1403,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1464.589,1465.456,"Well, but they assert that."
2010.09-1403,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1468.66,1472.695,"Certainly in the courts of appeals now, that's not the way the plaintiffs proceed."
2010.09-1403,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.195,1474.647,I understand that.
2010.09-1403,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1479.265,1480.55,I don't think that that's--
2010.09-1403,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1480.55,1490.073,"If you can allege what's upfront, you can allege what's -- what's in the back, and what's upfront becomes a common question, so you certify the whole class."
2010.09-1403,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1490.073,1496.393,"--With respect, Your Honor, I mean, if you -- if you would like to -- if you would like to expand even beyond Basic and allow class certification."
2010.09-1403,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1554.08,1554.547,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,1559.968,1562.335,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1403,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1588.403,1601.127,I -- I -- when -- what in the Fifth Circuit's decision puts this inquiry into the reliance prong and where did you argue it this way below?
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,1601.127,1612.434,We argued it below based upon the premise in Basic that the presumption is rebutted when there is proof--
2010.09-1403,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1612.434,1612.701,Could you--
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,1612.701,1613.868,--that the market price did not distort--
2010.09-1403,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1613.868,1630.813,"--Could you give me a place in the record where you actually said that, as opposed to relying on Oscar to argue that the Fifth Circuit was right in addressing as a merits question whether the plaintiff had proven loss causation?"
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,1630.813,1633.598,"--It was not addressed as a merits question, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-1403,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1640.086,1642.454,So you're not defending the rationale of the Fifth Circuit now?
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,1646.405,1670.271,"We are not defending all of the language in Oscar, clearly, but the basic test in the Fifth Circuit, as our case made clear on pages 116a and 119a of the petition appendix, is not loss causation; it's price impact, because Basic says at page 248 any showing that severs the link between the misrepresentation and the stock price defeats the presumption."
2010.09-1403,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1678.627,1691.101,"But, Mr. Sterling, if I think -- if I disagree with you and I think that Oscar said that loss causation needs to be shown at the certification stage, you agree that that is not a correct statement of the law; is that correct?"
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,1691.101,1692.553,"We do agree with that, Justice Kagan."
2010.09-1403,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1759.163,1762.567,"Mr. Sterling, I wasn't sure what argument you were making in your brief."
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,1787.348,1791.467,"If we suggested the first, Justice Kagan, I apologize because we did not intend to."
2010.09-1403,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.082,1813.415,But -- but why do you--
2010.09-1403,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1813.415,1832.461,"The way the Fifth Circuit wrote the decision, the Fifth Circuit seems to be saying: Plaintiffs, you didn't show an initially false representation; and you, you plaintiff, didn't show a -- a corrective statement that caused a price drop."
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,1853.707,1859.944,"We agree, Your Honor, that the Fifth Circuit put the initial burden of production on the plaintiff and that's contrary to Basic."
2010.09-1403,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1900.069,1903.188,Can I -- I'm trying this question out.
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,1990.662,1995.232,"Justice Breyer, the -- the problem is, we're back to reliance."
2010.09-1403,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2039.344,2040.761,--Which means you would lose.
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2060.342,2063.96,"But Justice Scalia, Basic sets forth a special rule."
2010.09-1403,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2183.704,2197.131,"Well, could you explain to me why in this case it's not reasonable to believe, meaning assuming the truth, that there was falsity in the statements made, those alleged--"
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2197.131,2198.447,Because -- I'm sorry.
2010.09-1403,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2198.447,2207.521,"--Assuming truth to those statements, why wouldn't a market react to corrective measures?"
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2230.352,2241.742,"Well, again, general market efficiency is just a proxy or a surrogate for whether it's reasonable to think the conditions exist for the stock price to be affected by a misrepresentation."
2010.09-1403,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2241.742,2253.8,"So tell me why on its face, with the false statements alleged here, why would it be unreasonable to conclude that the market wouldn't respond to them?"
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2253.8,2262.073,"One reason is because the market deemed the information to be immaterial, the market didn't care about it, the market didn't react to it."
2010.09-1403,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2269.929,2275.047,"Well, but you conceded efficiency below, so you've sort of given up that argument."
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2275.047,2283.569,"--We conceded efficiency below because, candidly, their own proof showed that none of the misrepresentations moved the market."
2010.09-1403,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2376.881,2389.522,"But your -- your argument seems to say, to -- to get a class certified you have to virtually prove your case on the merits."
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2412.554,2415.339,"Justice Ginsburg, that -- that is not our position."
2010.09-1403,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2471.926,2477.045,"Mr. Sterling, maybe this is just to repeat Justice Ginsburg's question, but what else is there?"
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2483.483,2488.435,"Falsity, scienter, actual proof of loss causation, and damages."
2010.09-1403,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2488.435,2494.339,The Fifth Circuit suggested that scienter could come in at the -- at the certification stage.
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2495.541,2500.41,Footnote 35 of the Fifth Circuit opinion makes clear that it is not requiring scienter.
2010.09-1403,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2554.961,2564.833,The only requirement we're talking about is (b)(3) because it's -- it's not argued and the district court found that all of the 23(a) requirements were satisfied.
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2566.602,2567.268,Correct Your Honor.
2010.09-1403,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2611.464,2621.486,"On your rebuttal proof point, you said just now that all you had to do was come forward with some evidence, but that the burden remains on the plaintiff."
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2627.14,2641.399,"Well, under Basic, it's any showing that severs the link, and here it was proof -- we had our own expert that demonstrated that, again kind of harping on their expert -- none of the misrepresentations inflated the stock price--"
2010.09-1403,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2641.399,2657.909,"So you're saying you can put an expert on the stand and the expert will say there was no price impact, and then the plaintiffs have to make the case that there, in fact, was a -- a price impact at the certification stage, that the plaintiffs have to prove that by a preponderance?"
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2657.909,2658.909,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1403,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2658.909,2660.175,Once you put a expert on the -- on the stand.
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2660.175,2664.21,"Under Rule 301, the presumption does not shift the ultimate burden of proof."
2010.09-1403,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2673.148,2676.683,"Well, that does suggest that the Basic presumption isn't worth much in your world."
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2687.539,2692.276,"We agree, Your Honor, that they have to show price impact, but that's not a hard burden to show."
2010.09-1403,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2725.163,2745.411,"Counsel, I suppose if you prevail and a defendant tries to establish at the certification stage that there's no loss causation and loses, then that's law of the case and you've missed the three opportunities that Mr. Boies was willing to give you at the pleading stage, summary judgment, and the merits."
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2747.477,2754.932,"No, Your Honor, because the finding at the class certification stage is not binding upon the ultimate fact finder."
2010.09-1403,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2771.776,2776.43,What if there's no -- no new evidence?
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2785.052,2794.392,"It's possible that the jury would agree with the judge who made the determination at the class certification hearing, it's possible that the judge -- that the jury might not."
2010.09-1403,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2839.872,2865.504,"I thought that the whole reason you -- you say that the class certification stage is so significant is precisely because once the class is certified, there will be immense discovery on the merits of the case, which will be so expensive for defendants that they're inclined to throw in the towel."
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2871.075,2877.628,"Justice Scalia, that was not my point, and I apologize if -- if it came out that way."
2010.09-1403,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2877.628,2879.747,"I -- I -- I'm sure it wasn't your point, but--"
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2880.147,2899.827,"All -- all -- all I was -- all I suggesting that if a plaintiff were to say, you know, Your Honor, to the district court, we think we -- we can't -- we should not have the class certification hearing yet because we need some discovery on point A, B, C, which did not happen here, the district court can say fine or can say I don't think you need it."
2010.09-1403,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2911.219,2912.019,"No, no, no."
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,2933.132,2957.248,"Just when -- that's assuming that the defendant has the wherewithal to stick it out through it all, but the sheer grant of class certification which aggregates hundreds, tens, thousands -- tens of thousands of these claims together in one big case makes every one of these cases, in effect, a company case, and it puts huge settlement pressure on the defendant."
2010.09-1403,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2972.423,2975.827,Does your rule apply in all fraud cases?
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,3007.346,3010.548,Basic is really an exception that applies only--
2010.09-1403,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3010.548,3014.286,--So you're saying in the case that I just gave you reliance is for the merits?
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,3014.286,3015.569,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1403,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3015.569,3020.023,"Whether he really relied or didn't rely, the common agent is for the merits?"
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,3020.023,3020.773,But you couldn't have--
2010.09-1403,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3020.773,3021.973,Is that -- is that your answer is?
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,3021.973,3022.473,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.09-1403,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3027.258,3027.708,No.
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,3049.956,3051.492,"Yes, Your Honor, because--"
2010.09-1403,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3051.492,3051.775,Yes.
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,3051.775,3055.277,--you still have everybody having to say Mr. Jackson is my agent.
2010.09-1403,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3055.927,3057.729,And they also have to prove there is a lie?
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,3057.729,3057.962,--Right.
2010.09-1403,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3068.168,3070.787,Okay.
2010.09-1403,2,21509,david_sterling,,3070.787,3073.422,"If there are no further questions, we would ask that the judgment below be affirmed."
2010.09-1403,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3074.106,3075.691,"Thank you, Mr. Sterling."

2010.09-1403,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3140.966,3146.62,"So you win, so you win at the certification stage or at the pleading stage, whatever."
2010.09-1403,3,20629,david_boies,,3149.156,3162.797,"--Because under the -- the Fifth Circuit rule, I understand that counsel disavows the actual language of the Fifth Circuit rule, but it was that language that the district court relied on in failing to certify the class."
2010.09-1403,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3367.646,3369.396,"Thank you, counsel, counsel."
