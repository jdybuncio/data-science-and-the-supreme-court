1965.30,1,18775,charles_donahue,,2144.479,2159.096,They repaired and maintained potato processing equipment which in turn was used to dehydrate or prepare potatoes for shipment in interstate commerce.
1965.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2159.096,2162.721,Did they not manufacture the articles too?
1965.30,1,18775,charles_donahue,,2162.721,2172.874,"They fabricated the articles, as I understand it, in the shop or on the job depending upon the needs of the particular situation."
1965.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2172.874,2175.131,But it was a manufacturing process?
1965.30,1,18775,charles_donahue,,2175.131,2179.168,It was a manufacturing process as found by the Court of Appeals.

1965.30,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2348.11,2348.954,What do you think?
1965.30,1,18775,charles_donahue,,2348.954,2353.554,"-- a part of the Roland Electric case, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1965.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2402.343,2414.396,Is it material to our case here where the materials came from that went into these manufacturing products?
1965.30,1,18775,charles_donahue,,2414.396,2431.405,I would not regard it as material here that the sheet metal for example which was used in the fabricating plant of the petitioner came from either inside of Idaho or outside of Idaho.
1965.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2440.826,2442.866,Is that the sole thing on which you rely?
1965.30,1,18775,charles_donahue,,2442.866,2443.49,Sir?
1965.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2443.49,2447.068,Is that the sole transaction that type of transaction in which you rely?
1965.30,1,18775,charles_donahue,,2447.068,2460.74,"In this case, it is that type of transaction constituting approximately about 86% of the business during this three-year period we're talking about."

1965.30,3,34200,lucius_e_burch_jr,,5524.161,5526.769,I believe it's 33 at the bottom.
1965.30,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5526.769,5531.194,Whereas the record here as to Senator Holland --
1965.30,3,34200,lucius_e_burch_jr,,5531.194,5532.027,Senator?

1965.30,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5538.396,5541.604,Perhaps I'm misreading it.
1965.30,3,34200,lucius_e_burch_jr,,5541.604,5542.69,I believe it's --
1965.30,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5542.69,5545.638,"You're referring to the footnote on page 33, I think."
1965.30,3,34200,lucius_e_burch_jr,,5545.638,5547.564,I'm ashamed to say I haven't got the brief.
1965.30,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5654.396,5657.946,Who was the chairman of the committee?
1965.30,3,34200,lucius_e_burch_jr,,5657.946,5666.193,"The House committee, I believe, if Your Honor please is Losinski, I believe is --"
1965.30,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5666.193,5669.106,That's in your brief.
1965.30,3,34200,lucius_e_burch_jr,,5669.106,5671.937,That's correct sir.
1965.30,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5853.489,5858.23,"You don't disagree -- you don't disagree with the Kentucky Finance, I take it, do you?"
1965.30,3,34200,lucius_e_burch_jr,,5858.23,5870.637,I was just about to say effective from (Voice Overlap) please and I do not disagree with Kentucky Finance.Here is what the Kentucky Finance held.
1965.30,4,17850,bessie_margolin,,6417.071,6421.999,I just like to make some comments on these last two questions.
1965.30,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6519.805,6522.098,"Yes, yes you may."
1965.30,4,17850,bessie_margolin,,6522.098,6540.706,"Marsh, who was the Executive Director of the Trade Association testified at length about the recognized scale of discounts which got larger as the potential or actual purchase of tires for the quantity group."
1965.30,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6576.77,6589.126,"Ms. Margolin, aside from the specific reference to the legislative history, do you really see any difference between this case and the Sheet Metal case?"
1965.30,4,17850,bessie_margolin,,6590.122,6597.407,"Well, this case has the additional aspect that some -- we have some sales and it really overlaps."
1965.30,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6603.727,6604.733,Yes.
1965.30,4,17850,bessie_margolin,,6604.733,6613.553,But there's a large -- there's a large area in here where their sales to fleet accounts that's there -- as they recognized this --
1965.30,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6613.553,6615.731,But in that -- isn't that part of the business?
1965.30,4,17850,bessie_margolin,,6619.088,6624.667,"In the first part of the business insofar as the retail concept applies no, I would say no."
1965.30,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6624.667,6627.612,One -- one case ought to be decided like the other.
1965.30,4,17850,bessie_margolin,,6627.612,6649.795,"I would say this certainly has been our position that the retail concept, the traditional statutory retail concept should be applied in determining whether sales transactions are -- can be recognized as retail are eligible as much so as determining whether a whole business."
1965.30,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6681.141,6685.836,What is the -- what's the division in the amount?
1965.30,4,17850,bessie_margolin,,6685.836,6687.054,What is -- I beg your pardon Mr. --
1965.30,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6687.054,6688.505,The percentages.
1965.30,4,17850,bessie_margolin,,6688.505,6697.496,The percentages here were not as precisely true because of the sleeping position our opponents -- the respondent took in this case.
