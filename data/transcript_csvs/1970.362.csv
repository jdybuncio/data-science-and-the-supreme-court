1970.362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,16.072,"We'll hear arguments next in Number 544, Commissioner of Internal Revenue against Lincoln Savings and Loan."
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,37.327,40.63,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,232.917,239.102,Was he convicted of some criminal act in connection with that draft card?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,239.102,243.954,It was not nor was he indicted in indictments under review here.
1970.362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,254.447,256.173,And that question isn't before us at all?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,256.173,258.652,It is not Your Honor.
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,316.254,324.914,"Now, that CO application that you just characterized as pending is one that been filed when he was student at University of Rochester?"
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,324.914,327.318,That's right in March of 1966.
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,327.801,329.351,Three years or three-and-a-half years earlier?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,329.351,329.926,No.
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,332.854,334.081,That's year-and-a-half?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,334.081,334.352,Right.
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,334.352,335.155,Okay.
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,344.694,346.345,In March of 1966.
1970.362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,372.248,376.366,But why did this happen against the (Inaudible)?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,376.366,383.055,Presumably because they were aware from his earlier request for II-S that he was going to graduate in June of 1967.
1970.362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,383.055,391.3,"He has his father with that form, there would have been place on to talk about his current status?"
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,391.3,392.708,It was a current information form.
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,392.708,394.871,It was a current information form and --
1970.362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,394.871,398.188,And what status he was claiming or?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,398.188,402.031,"Well, the board had before his claim as to conscientious objection."
1970.362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,402.031,403.094,(Inaudible)
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,403.094,406.766,It was a year and a couple of months before that that's correct Your Honor.
1970.362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,406.766,412.802,"If he had answered it, he would have been automatically claim a CO?"
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,412.802,427.109,"Well, if he had told the board at that time that he was no longer entitled to II-S, presumably in the course of normal procedures, the board would have considered his CO application at that time."
1970.362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,469.005,470.309,And rejected.
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,470.309,471.285,Pardon?
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,490.474,499.204,And he did -- he received his I-A classification i.e. he did not send it back unopened?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,499.204,502.031,"He did send it back unopened, Your Honor."
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,502.031,505.363,"So, he didn't even know that he have been classified I-A, is that -- before that?"
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,505.363,510.003,"Presumably, he did not."
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,538.487,540.497,So he did open that envelop?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,540.497,541.372,Pardon?
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,541.372,543.287,So he did open that envelop --
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,543.287,545.279,He did open that envelop.
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,560.013,568.238,"Now, that was a physical examination given at the -- by Selective Service or by the Military?"
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,568.238,571.34,It's given by the military for selective service.
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,574.324,578.262,But at the time of induction or quite awhile before?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,578.262,582.254,"No, this was at the time of induction."
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,597.208,607.32,Is there any indication why he changed his mind regarding how he would deal with mail address to him by his draft board?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,607.32,608.446,Why he opened the --
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,608.446,627.063,"He sent several of them back including his I-A classification, you said back unopened and then when there arrived other communication, one asking him -- one directing him to report for a physical examination he not only opened the communication, but complied with it in part."
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,628.53,631.181,"Not from the record, Your Honor."
1970.362,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,666.504,681.767,"Incidentally, these notices of classification and to report for a physical, are they sealed envelops or are they post envelops?"
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,681.767,687.288,"They are generally envelops, I believe Your Honor."
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,809.982,824.985,"The Court of Appeals' theory that concession as you call it that your plan have been erroneously classified was based on his conscientious objector claim or other than on his attendance at a Theological school as I understand, right?"
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,824.985,837.354,"That is correct, they deal with that claim and I will touch on it briefly, but the major issue and the issue upon which Judge Feinberg relied in dissent was the conscientious objector issue."
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,837.354,845.266,"What then -- well, I suppose -- there's some question I suppose about whether his mere attendance in the Union Theological Seminary was sufficient."
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,851.577,861.903,"Well, let me say briefly, Your Honor, that the congressional mandate for ministerial deferments under 6-G is I say --"
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,861.903,863.557,The school deferments?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,863.557,866.018,"That's right, is mandatory."
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,875.164,878.331,And studying to become a priest.
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,878.331,879.729,That is correct.
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,910.717,911.759,"Well, not for mere attendance though."
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,939.732,941.055,"Absolutely, not Your Honor."
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,941.055,950.588,"And so far as the record shows that was the purpose of this fellow and your client excuse me in attending -- I mean so far as the record shows, we don't know that this was his purpose."
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,950.588,961.146,"Well, the trial court found that he was in full time attendance and that he was pursuing a degree leading to study for the priesthood."
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,979.977,981.604,And that's the statutory requirement?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,981.604,982.494,That is a statutory requirement.
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,982.494,984.967,That's a statutory exemption that's necessary.
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,984.967,985.493,That's right.
1970.362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1065.056,1069.73,You would take the same position I take it if he had never presented his CO claim at all?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,1069.73,1073.503,"No, we do not and we make a distinction in our brief --"
1970.362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1073.503,1073.856,Why?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,1074.737,1081.567,Because I believe the Act requires minimally primary jurisdiction of the local board.
1970.362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1117.862,1121.563,But you do say that he had prove to his draft board too?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,1121.563,1125.437,That's correct and we suggest here that he did prove that to them.
1970.362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.437,1128.716,But he didn't have to prove to some appellate board?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,1128.716,1134.518,That's right that he is entitled in court to judicial review of his classification.
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1341.538,1344.94,The Form 150 is the conscientious objectors form?
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,1344.94,1347.338,"It is Your Honor, right."
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1387.129,1401.195,"I am just thinking in your hypothetical case there will be plenty of bases of in fact to support a I-A classification, if the man had not submitted anything to support a conscientious objector --"
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,1401.195,1411.607,"Well, the Government's thesis is that he would simply submit a Form 150 perhaps with supporting letters if they could be obtained."
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1425.457,1442.856,"Then that wouldn't, if the submission was at that minimal materials submitted with it, there would be plenty of basis in fact for I-A classification, wouldn't he, if there wasn't enough to support a conscientious objector classification?"
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,1442.856,1461.771,"I submit there would be and we submit in our brief that there would be substantial basis, in fact, for denying his claim and if the Form 150 was considered by the board to be inadequate, it left them in doubt, we have a pretty well stated claim here but we want to see him to test his sincerity."
1970.362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1507.271,1517.372,"Well, are you suggesting board has an obligation to call him in, before they rule if he has submitted all the material which he wishes to submit?"
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,1517.372,1538.599,"No, we suggest that under current Selective Service procedures, the board has put it self or the system has put itself in the position of classifying without a personal appearance. The sequence is that you submit your claim, you are classified, then you have your right to personal appearance."
1970.362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1579.362,1591.266,I lost Mr. Levine to understand the point that I thought you were going at but a well counseled registrant could play games with the board.
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,1591.266,1593.236,That's the Government's point.
1970.362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1593.236,1595.781,"Oh, you are merely referring to the Government's point?"
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,1595.781,1597.609,I'm sorry Your Honor.
1970.362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1638.768,1640.293,We'll resume after lunch counsel.
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,1640.293,1646.655,Thank you.
1970.362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1646.655,1653.894,"Mr. Levine, you have three minutes remaining, you wish to use it now?"
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,1653.894,1659.201,I will try to be brief in saving a minute or two for rebuttal if I may.
1970.362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1693.853,1711.094,"Where does the statute says that court trying a criminal case, is it entitled to consider whether a man is a conscientious objector --"
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,1711.094,1722.82,The statute only said -- the statute says that the court shall only review a basis in fact and presumably that is the limitation on this Court's review or on any court's review.
1970.362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1730.612,1735.368,You apply for that -- it can only review the board --
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,1735.368,1738.321,"That's right, Your Honor."
1970.362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1781.993,1832.762,"Of course, the points you just made, if the Selective Service System in its administrative review should deny his claim for conscientious objector status then that finding, that denial would have to be accepted by the Court, if there were a basis in fact for that denial, whereas if somebody proceeded along the lines that your client did and somebody well counseled to use your phrase, then, he would get up in brand new judicial de novo determination if you're right as to the validity of his conscientious objector claim which might be more beneficial than the very, very limited review that the court would be confined to if the claim had been denied, the Selective Service Administrative procedure?"
1970.362,0,16401,alan_h_levine,,1832.762,1847.044,I did not mean to suggest that there would be a different standard of judicial review applicable to McGee's claim and there would be to a claim where in fact the classification was appealed.
1970.362,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1859.479,1862.775,That consumes all of your time Mr. Levine.
1970.362,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1866.14,1870.072,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1967.129,1972.787,"Do you mean by violating the law, you mean refuse to submit for induction?"
1970.362,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1972.787,1973.801,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1973.801,1979.743,"Because his claim is, he is not violating the law because he is entitled to conscientious objector?"
1970.362,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1979.743,1987.434,"That's correct, Your Honor, assuming the -- if a criminal prosecution filed and he did (Inaudible)."
1970.362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2655.51,2659.485,Did he send to the local board a copy of this letter to the President?
1970.362,1,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2659.485,2665.285,"He did not send himself a copy, but it was routed to the local board, Your Honor, yes."
