2008.07-665,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.004,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 07-665, Pleasant Grove City v. Summum."
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,9.022,22.163,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Tenth Circuit erred when it held that the First Amendment Free Speech Clause forces Pleasant Grove City to accept and erect on its property a private party's donated, unattended, permanent monument."
2008.07-665,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,55.468,58.67,"Mr. Sekulow, you're really just picking your poison, aren't you?"
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,79.868,87.606,"Well, the Ten Commandments here was displayed in Pioneer Park, as the mayor said, Mayor Cook, in 1971, to show the pioneer heritage of the community."
2008.07-665,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,100.782,101.099,Well--
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,101.099,102.599,"And I think that -- yes, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-665,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,102.599,107.852,"--And I don't want to interrupt your answer to the Chief Justice because I think it's critical, critical to your argument."
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,116.458,118.743,"Well, there was no Federal Establishment Clause complaint at all."
2008.07-665,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,119.743,120.927,It was under the State?
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,120.927,123.343,--It was under the State of Utah's Establishment Clause.
2008.07-665,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,129.164,132.818,"If you prevail, the action should be dismissed, as far as you're concerned?"
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,132.818,133.185,Yes.
2008.07-665,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,133.185,134.001,All right.
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,134.001,134.968,Just let me--
2008.07-665,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,134.968,149.594,"Then getting back to the Chief Justice's point, it does seem to me that if you say it's Government speech that in later cases, including the case of the existing monument, you're going to say it's Government speech and you have an Establishment Clause problem."
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,154.414,155.564,"--Well, I think from an--"
2008.07-665,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,155.564,156.6,--an Establishment Clause problem.
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,156.6,160.802,"--If there was an Establishment Clause claim, Justice Kennedy, which is not here, Van Orden forecloses it."
2008.07-665,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.693,180.716,"I suppose it depends on what the Government speech consists of, what it is the Government is saying about the Ten Commandments."
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,192.439,201.795,"--That's -- and precisely, Justice Scalia, that's exactly what Mayor Cook in fact, at the unveiling ceremony, stated that this will serve to remind citizens of their pioneer heritage and the founding of--"
2008.07-665,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.795,202.362,Do you have to--
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,202.362,202.912,--their community--
2008.07-665,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,202.912,207.447,"--Did the NEA -- Finley v. NEA, the Court didn't treat that as Government speech."
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,207.447,207.964,--Right.
2008.07-665,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,207.964,208.982,Or am I -- is that the--
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,208.982,209.449,No.
2008.07-665,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,221.074,233.181,"Before we get -- before we get away from the Government, the Establishment Clause, you said, well, Van Orden answered that, but did it?"
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,242.12,243.953,--There is a 36-year history here.
2008.07-665,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.774,251.426,I think 38 is the cut-off point.
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,251.426,252.076,--Is that the cut-off?
2008.07-665,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,256.13,258.047,Mr. Sekulow--
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,258.047,258.763,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-665,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,258.763,265.153,"--when you come upon this, if somebody comes upon this monument in the park, how are they supposed to tell whether it's Government speech or private speech?"
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,265.153,273.656,"Well, of course the face of it, Mr. Chief Justice, states on the face of the monument that it's presented to Pleasant Grove City in Utah County by the Fraternal Order of Eagles."
2008.07-665,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,309.83,314.614,In the context of all other lawgivers.
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,327.391,331.593,"No, the words on the Court's frieze are ""steal"", ""murder"", ""adultery"" in Hebrew."
2008.07-665,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,331.593,332.343,Yes.
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,332.343,333.361,Very different in that context.
2008.07-665,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.467,345.169,Is this a challenge to the Ten Commandments monument?
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,345.169,345.653,--It's not.
2008.07-665,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,347.136,349.788,I thought this case did not involve an Establishment Clause challenge.
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,350.205,350.907,There is no Establishment Clause.
2008.07-665,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,356.291,362.464,"Mr. Sekulow, can I just ask: At what point in the litigation did you first raise the Government speech argument?"
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,362.464,363.73,At the Tenth Circuit.
2008.07-665,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,402.903,408.307,Isn't the tough -- isn't the tough issue here not so much whether there is Government speech.
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,435.608,451.652,"Well, I think the fact that it originated, that the monument originated by the Eagles as a third party, doesn't in any way take away from the fact that in this particular case, and in most cases involving donated monuments, which, as the United States would point to, most of the monuments in parks are donated by or originated with third parties--"
2008.07-665,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,451.652,455.938,"They probably are, but most of them -- and you correct me if I'm wrong here."
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,473.583,476.518,"--Most of them, Justice Souter, do actually have statements."
2008.07-665,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,487.575,489.775,We may have more cases coming.
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,489.775,491.311,--I hope not.
2008.07-665,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,491.311,500.3,"But tell me, what is the criterion that we should use to decide what the significance of the private identification is?"
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,500.3,506.62,"I think the key should be, as this Court alluded to in Johanns, the issue of control, who controls the message ultimately here."
2008.07-665,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,515.31,529.819,"If that -- if we accept that there is Government speech, I think Justice Souter's question is isn't this really the Government endorsement of the Eagles' message?"
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,558.47,559.589,Right.
2008.07-665,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,568.444,575.864,"Well, if it does, it changes it, as I understand your answer, by eliminating the private aspect of the speech."
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,579.416,579.749,It's not.
2008.07-665,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,579.749,582.434,And there ceases to be a mixture the moment the Government accepts it.
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,582.434,590.188,"Once -- right, title, and interest vest under Utah law in the Pleasant Grove City upon acceptance and at that point it is owned and controlled by the city."
2008.07-665,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,611.584,613.803,Can I ask you question that's kind of in the background of the case?
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,613.803,614.469,Sure.
2008.07-665,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,614.469,625.159,"Assume you didn't have the policy that you do have, but it was perfectly clear that the city decided not to put up this monument because it disagreed with the message of the monument."
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,628.979,631.279,It wouldn't be a First Amendment free speech claim.
2008.07-665,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,648.524,653.344,"--But, Justice Stevens's question is important, maybe not for your case but for other cases."
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,664.652,670.12,"Because if the Government is speaking, if it's the Government's message, they're of course allowed to engage in content-based statements."
2008.07-665,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,675.808,676.96,I understand that.
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,676.96,677.86,That's what they did.
2008.07-665,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,677.86,683.864,But it doesn't seem to me that you have to make the Government speech argument for you to make the argument that you just made.
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,683.864,693.052,"No, not necessarily, because even under the speech selection cases -- I mean, that's correct -- Governments make determinations of what they are going to put in their parks to communicate a message."
2008.07-665,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,723.072,737.248,"So the city, in effect, if the city says, we are going to have a designated ten-acre field in which anybody can put up a monument, but you can't because we don't like your message, there's a First Amendment problem."
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,764.166,775.706,"--Justice Souter, there is a fundamental difference between opening up a forum, taking acres of a park and saying everybody gets to go in, and another situation where the Government is clearly controlling it not for a subversive reason."
2008.07-665,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,807.427,808.844,"--It goes to the same thing, doesn't it?"
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,824.62,831.257,"Well, it depends on -- if it's a limited public forum, certainly limited public forums can be based on subject matter and speaker identity."
2008.07-665,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,870.446,872.882,Let me ask you a question to make sure I understand your position.
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,883.571,884.856,If the policy is--
2008.07-665,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,884.856,886.423,If that's a policy.
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,886.423,891.677,"--If the policy is that we're only going -- that the Government's controlling those messages, it's not individual private expression, of course."
2008.07-665,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,894.478,902.401,"But really, in this case sort of the debate as to whether the policy justifications for the monument are a sham are not are really irrelevant?"
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,902.401,905.853,"--From a legal standpoint on Government speech, it's irrelevant."
2008.07-665,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.253,911.923,"Even if it's a Government forum for private speech, I think it's the same thing."
2008.07-665,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,920.779,927.016,"And the same question Justice Stevens had, just to tack onto his question here, your answer was: Oh, well, the Government owns it."
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,936.304,938.656,"--It's not ownership, Justice Kennedy, in and of itself."
2008.07-665,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,949.745,961.22,"Nothing could be a more obvious control of the message than the criterion that says we will decide in -- in determining to accept it or not, we will decide on the basis of whether we agree with the message."
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,963.02,969.991,--The difference is -- the difference between each of those cases and the case here is the Fraternal Order of Eagles surrendered control of their message and their speech.
2008.07-665,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,971.941,976.062,"Well, they -- they do in the example Justice Kennedy just raised and the example that I just raised."
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,980.447,981.114,Which happened here.
2008.07-665,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,981.114,984.918,"And the -- the Government says: Okay, we'll take the Eagles monument."
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1001.428,1010.015,"It's not a First Amendment violation because the Government takes ownership and control at the time it's displayed, and there is no dispute at the time it's displayed that the Government is conveying a message."
2008.07-665,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1010.015,1014.586,But we've got -- we've got to shut our eyes to the period prior to the moment title passes.
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1014.586,1020.556,"Absolutely not, because discovery in this case proves the fact that this has been a policy in existence for three decades."
2008.07-665,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1022.556,1027.709,"Does that mean if we engage in viewpoint discrimination for three decades, we are home free?"
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1027.709,1030.244,"--If the Government is the speaker, they are certainly entitled to do that."
2008.07-665,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1031.477,1034.279,It wouldn't be a speaker on your view until it takes control of the monument.
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1034.279,1041.699,"But the Government -- the speech selection itself is an independent basis under Forbes, Finley, and American Library Association to bring these kind of--"
2008.07-665,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1041.699,1051.205,"But those are cases in which, to begin with, the Government is engaging in -- a process of, in effect, sponsoring speech."
2008.07-665,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1063.096,1069.968,"--I think, when it comes to the issue of selecting monuments for its park, it's very similar to a museum curator or the arts."
2008.07-665,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1072.002,1073.737,"Thank you, Mr. Sekulow."
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1086.962,1096.234,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Of course the Government can select the content and viewpoint of monuments on the National Mall and in other public parks across the country."
2008.07-665,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1107.189,1114.195,Can't there be a situation where the Government does create a monument that is a -- a limited public forum?
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1133.924,1142.096,"Well, if -- when it is Government speech -- for example, we can have a -- a Washington Monument and a Jefferson Memorial without an Adams one."
2008.07-665,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1164.859,1168.078,What's the answer to Justice Alito's question?
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1168.078,1169.763,"I mean, if we wanted--"
2008.07-665,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1169.763,1176.953,"Well, supposing the Government in the Vietnam Memorial decided not to put up the names of any homosexual soldiers."
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1179.319,1179.987,--Yes.
2008.07-665,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1183.105,1184.322,That seems to be the problem here.
2008.07-665,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1234.888,1235.888,I didn't get the answer.
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1236.557,1240.192,"--Yes, the Government can choose to memorialize who it wants on the mall."
2008.07-665,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1243.144,1246.613,So what is the answer to the -- what is the answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetical?
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1250.182,1250.748,The only question--
2008.07-665,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1250.748,1252.084,Because that tests the theory.
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1252.084,1256.202,"--Well, as a matter of the Free Speech Clause, there are no limits on the Government's ability to speak freely."
2008.07-665,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.99,1280.15,"It seems to me the Government could disfavor homosexuality just as it could disfavor abortion, just as it can disfavor a number of other things that in -- in many States people are free to do."
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1282.2,1287.637,The Government would be powerless to do anything if it cannot first formulate and then express its own viewpoints.
2008.07-665,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1287.637,1290.756,Why is that the answer to the -- the question?
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1323.476,1326.428,When the -- when the Government -- and this is a point I started on earlier.
2008.07-665,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1388.632,1395.821,"But suppose they only accept Democrats who are sculptors, and they reject all the Republicans?"
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1395.821,1396.155,--Right.
2008.07-665,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1396.721,1402.159,"Now, what in the First Amendment -- are you saying the First Amendment would not stop that?"
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1402.159,1406.277,--The Free Speech Clause on its own force does not prevent the Government from speaking freely.
2008.07-665,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1421.973,1427.959,"Well, under the Equal Protection Clause would -- if you wrote an Equal Protection Clause opinion, you would end up saying it's content-based."
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1428.809,1431.828,"If it's Government speech, though--"
2008.07-665,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1431.828,1439.85,"I -- I don't think that can you avoid the hard part by saying, oh, other amendments of the Constitution might apply."
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1446.354,1456.294,"--But when the Government is speaking or when the Government is acting as a curator as with a museum or a sculpture garden or a library or here, the Government is absolutely entitled to make both content and viewpoint-based distinctions."
2008.07-665,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.479,1459.112,"It's not only absolutely entitled, it has to do so."
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1461.264,1461.664,--Right.
2008.07-665,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1468.851,1471.953,"You can't run a museum if you have to accept everything, right?"
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1471.953,1472.438,Yes.
2008.07-665,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1487.331,1491.133,Does the law always require us to adopt an all-or-nothing position?
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1501.925,1505.627,"--Of course, the Court could put limits on its holding if it so desired."
2008.07-665,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1536.044,1536.577,It would be -- the trouble--
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1536.577,1537.377,--in a Government museum.
2008.07-665,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1537.377,1546.066,"--I see your point, but the trouble with that as an argument here is the private part of the speech is just as much chiseled in stone as the public part."
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1560.575,1562.294,But if the Government -- take a museum.
2008.07-665,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1581.775,1603.354,"What you are, in effect, saying -- and this may be -- I don't mean I think this is necessarily the wrong answer -- but you're, in effect, saying, yes, you can find instances of Government speech in which there is clearly a -- a private identification consistent with it, but the only appropriate analysis is the analysis for government speech."
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1612.044,1612.344,--Yes.
2008.07-665,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1626.518,1629.753,"There is nothing unusual about it, but we haven't had this kind of a challenge before."
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1640.295,1646.031,"--It's simply that once the Government is speaking, it is the one -- it turns on control, right?"
2008.07-665,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1651.835,1653.537,"Well, maybe they can't do it in museums, either."
2008.07-665,1,21060,daryl_joseffer,,1662.81,1668.38,"--And frankly, public parks are no less absurd, because we've been doing it in public parks for probably at least as long as well."
2008.07-665,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1706.253,1711.291,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,1712.107,1723.181,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: The city here gave the Eagles access to its public park for s display about the Ten Commandments and it denied Summum access for a display about the tenets of its faith."
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1736.191,1737.708,You say in a public forum.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,1766.459,1775.648,"Justice Scalia, there is a very serious factual question in this case about whether the city ever had a bona fide selection policy for this park."
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1784.17,1786.039,It's a public forum for some things.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,1799.68,1809.303,"--If you look at the question that way, Justice Scalia, it might be said that a public park is not a forum for sound trucks, it's not a forum for sleep-ins, it's not a forum for news racks."
2008.07-665,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1815.642,1819.611,"Those are time, place, and manner regulations, with which we are all familiar."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,1845.759,1854.832,"--And that is exactly why, Justice Kennedy, the city, any city, is permitted to make a decision that it will close its public parks to all unattended displays."
2008.07-665,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1858.569,1859.702,How far do you push that?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,1871.626,1875.345,"--Of course not, is how I answer that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1893.639,1894.325,How do they do that?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,1902.229,1905.447,"Governments can do it different ways, Justice Souter."
2008.07-665,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1922.389,1922.922,"So, it's frozen into time."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,1927.943,1929.062,I'm not sure I understand.
2008.07-665,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1929.062,1933.764,"Well, I thought you said the Government can accept what's there and say that's our speech."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,1937.918,1939.284,No.
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.775,1959.346,"The other side says that some of these monuments, especially in the Civil War battlegrounds, do indeed show who the donors are."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,1959.346,1959.896,I'm sorry?
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.896,1969.403,"What -- Mr. Sekulow says that some of these monuments, notably those in the Civil War battlefields, do show who the donors are."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,1972.303,1981.211,"It depends if they were privately formulated and handed off to the Government as a completed object, they are only Government speech if the Government has since then converted them--"
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.211,1981.911,So they have to go?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,1981.911,1982.711,--by adopting them.
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.844,1986.694,"Now that the Government converted them, it passes a law saying, what, we -- we adopt this?"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,1986.694,1987.829,That has happened.
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1987.829,1993.631,Isn't it enough that the Government accepts ownership of it and places it on the Government's property?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,1997.851,2000.303,"Let me answer both of your questions, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2009.692,2017.598,So this case -- your claim would disappear if this town in Utah had passed an ordinance saying we adopt the Ten Commandments Monument?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2017.598,2018.998,"--It would, Justice Souter."
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2021.383,2030.406,"But that's -- I mean, if that's all that's involved here, we're engaging in kind of a -- almost a silly exercise in formality."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2030.406,2032.191,"--Absolutely not, Justice Souter."
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2039.345,2043.713,"If we tell them you have got to take the monument down if they don't do it, don't you think they are going to pass that pretty quick?"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2043.713,2045.013,"--I don't think they are, Justice Souter."
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2073.249,2075.351,It depends on what you mean by adopting one version.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2089.694,2091.061,I think that those are--
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2091.061,2093.73,I wouldn't care what version it was if that's all they're doing.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2093.73,2094.496,--Those are very different--
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2094.496,2096.764,"Nor would the Mormons in Utah, I think."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2096.764,2101.501,"--Well, those are very different for establishment clause purposes, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-665,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2120.447,2121.497,Let me give you this example.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2159.838,2161.89,"--No, Your Honor, and really for three separate reasons."
2008.07-665,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2176.3,2185.405,"Well what if the situation is a neighborhood association prepared this; they said we'd like to display it in the park; and the county or the town says fine, go ahead and do it?"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2185.405,2190.457,Even under those more usual circumstances there would be two things the city could do to keep you out of their park.
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.248,2205.383,"Ms. Harris, we -- we need a clear rule here."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2231.434,2244.86,"I agree that we need a clear rule, and if clarity is important here the easiest way for the Government to make clear that it has adopted a privately formulated message as its own is to adopt it clearly and publicly."
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2246.694,2248.562,"Is there an historical basis for that, or you just made it up?"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2269.807,2270.307,I--
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2270.307,2276.627,It may be a very nice world but it happens not to be the world under which our Constitution has subjected this country.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2276.627,2287.019,"--If this is uncommon, that is because usually the Government does reserve monuments for governmental speech, monuments that it helps to create or monuments that it is happy to endorse after the fact."
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2324.692,2328.762,"So that's all right, the first 95 monuments, whoever -- whoever put them up, okay?"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2334.916,2335.35,--Sure.
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.633,2339.118,This is a practical solution to the problem?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2339.118,2344.772,"--Absolutely, because any city confronting this problem now can look at its park and say we have four monuments--"
2008.07-665,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2344.772,2348.308,You're saying the last generation had much more freedom than the present one?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2348.308,2363.852,"--I'm saying that as long as it does it on a content-neutral basis, because it is genuinely concerned about aesthetics, space constraints, clutter in its parks, a city can enact a ban or a limit on the number of displays; and if that has the effect of grandfathering in existing displays--"
2008.07-665,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2363.852,2385.683,"Can we go back to -- your basic premise is this is a public forum, in any and all instances; and we do have, certainly in the speech area, demonstration area, from time immemorial public parks have been places where people can speak their minds."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2414.1,2415.452,"--No, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2432.045,2437.615,"If that -- it that is so, what is the point of using the public forum analysis at all?"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2437.615,2439.65,--Because here the city has not done that.
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2444.769,2449.173,That -- that may mean that you have the foundation for a -- a speech discrimination argument--
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2449.173,2449.906,That--
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2449.906,2459.129,--but that would not be the answer if we were dealing with a -- a traditional public forum in -- in the sense that the Court's cases have used the term.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2459.129,2459.814,"--Oh, I think--"
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2459.814,2470.337,"So it seems to me that your use of public forum is just by kind of remote analogy here, and I -- I'm not sure that it's helping you or would help us if we used it as criterion for decision."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2470.337,2479.458,"--Oh, I think it may be helpful, Justice Souter, because once we know that we are talking about a public forum, we know that access cannot be limited on a content basis."
2008.07-665,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2479.458,2497.237,"Well, your -- you can stick with it as long as you want; that's what the -- the Tenth Circuit did, but suppose that we were to say that we were unconvinced by the comparison between speeches and parades on the one hand and monuments on the other, so we did not apply the public forum analogy."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2499.106,2500.239,"Oh, no, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-665,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2519.102,2520.219,"Well, but it does all the time."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2532.327,2547.92,"--When the Government is speaking for itself, then the Government does have a right to prefer certain viewpoints over others, but here the city has consistently refused to adopt the content of this monument as its own, and it is still disclaiming endorsement of that monument."
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2561.712,2568.85,You will say just the opposite when you come back here to challenge the Ten Commandments monument on -- on Establishment Clause grounds.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2582.693,2583.076,Um--
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.076,2586.211,"Now why would it be true there, but it's not true here?"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2593.049,2607.624,"--Justice Scalia, for one thing, if this case were being litigated under the Establishment Clause, it wouldn't be critical whether the monument were actually Government speech, because the Establishment Clause can be implicated by the Government's interaction with private speech as well."
2008.07-665,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2639.096,2647.285,Isn't merely allowing the monument to be built on public property sufficient acceptance?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2659.009,2672.401,"Your Honor, my front yard is different from a public park, and that matters because when all the Government has done is said sure, go ahead, put your monument in our park, that's all the Government ever does when it administers access to a public forum."
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2675.805,2685.244,"No, but it doesn't -- it doesn't have to do that, say, for time place and manner restrictions for access to a public forum if it really is a public forum."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2704.805,2715.244,"--Again, I think because it's a public park and because public forums are always used for the expression of -- of ideas that the Government does not necessarily agree with--"
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2715.244,2716.261,"Sure, but when you get the monument--"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2716.261,2716.863,--the perceptions will not be clear.
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2716.863,2731.623,"--We do not -- there is no pervasive understanding or non-pervasive one, I would have thought, in the United States that anyone who wants to display a message in granite in a public park can put it there."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2741.978,2744.93,"The city in this case -- everybody may assume that, and they would be right."
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2755.302,2764.908,"It may create the First Amendment problem, but it seems to me, going back to Justice Alito's question, that the City's decision is a clear adoption of the monument."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2764.908,2784.488,"--If all we have, I think, Justice Souter, is that the city has permitted one private speaker to erect a monument, there is no constitutional or judicially manageable line between that and just the ordinary thing the Government always does when it grants preferred access to a public forum, which is to say you're in, you're out."
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2790.809,2803.6,"Yes, but even on your own criterion, if the city passes a resolution saying we adopt this, you're still -- you're going to be faced with precisely the content discrimination problem that you're arguing about here."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2803.6,2809.604,"But because it's adopted it as its own message, then we think the Government is speaking."
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2819.061,2822.43,You're basically just arguing for a clear statement rule.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2853.383,2863.59,"I would formulate it only slightly differently, which is not so much a clear statement but that those are really two different things, approving it for access and adopting the message as the Government's own."
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2864.773,2865.49,"Well, you can--"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2865.49,2866.209,--that would--
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2866.209,2867.575,--You can make that distinction.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2889.039,2908.516,"--If what matters is the public perception, then, yes, we do think that to clarify an unclear situation like this, where have you a monument that says it's presented by the Eagles, it has the Eagles emblem, the Eagles are continuing to maintain it in the park, and that's a fact we should assume a reasonable observer would know, then, yes, be clear."
2008.07-665,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2912.051,2917.622,"And when Government adopts it, can it at that time specify what it understands the statement to be?"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2917.622,2919.422,"I think it can, Justice Alito."
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2940.919,2945.221,"Suppose the resolution of adoption by the City Council just says,"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2955.928,2956.828,I think the--
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2956.828,2957.361,Is that enough?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2957.361,2958.247,--No.
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2971.938,2974.74,You want a signing statement as well as a signature?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,2975.34,2975.925,Like that.
2008.07-665,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2975.925,2982.829,"Does it depend on -- given the focus on public perception, does it depend on the content of the speech?"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3008.11,3013.848,"Well, I think it's actually trickier than that, more complicated than that, Your Honor."
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3046.069,3050.121,What if it's just a statue of George Washington?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3058.727,3059.027,No.
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.014,3065.414,"Well, if--"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3065.414,3065.764,--city memorial.
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.764,3068.097,"--That's right, and I think they would adopt a resolution that says,"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3075.286,3076.603,And so long as that is--
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3076.603,3080.138,"If it could say that, why couldn't it say the same thing about the Ten Commandments?"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3091.427,3092.879,--So long as--
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3092.879,3093.779,Would that be enough?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3093.779,3099.85,"--So long as it is preceded by a statement that the city actually adopts the memorial as its own, that this is--"
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3099.85,3100.635,I don't know what that means.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3100.635,3101.968,--a Pleasant Grove memorial or a Pleasant Grove monument.
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3101.968,3105.087,It has acquired the memorial.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3130.954,3140.176,"It may be that if the Government goes on long enough, it will have connoted what is very important here, which is that it is prepared to adopt the content of that monument as its own."
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3140.176,3141.11,I don't know what that means.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3143.395,3144.012,It means--
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3144.012,3157.887,I would have thought adopting what I said shows that it is adopting the content of the monument insofar as the monument says the Ten Commandments should be respected by the citizens of Pleasant Grove.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3158.404,3159.237,--If the City says--
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3159.237,3159.673,"Or it has to say,"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3161.123,3161.523,--No.
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3171.731,3180.753,You don't think that's fairly implied by the mere fact that it is there in Pleasant Grove's park and that Pleasant Grove City Council has allowed it to be constructed there?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3182.003,3182.986,"No, I don't, Your Honor."
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3206.434,3207.767,Maybe the City doesn't know--
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3207.767,3208.467,--but the City doesn't want to cross it.
2008.07-665,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3208.467,3212.504,"--know what you mean by ""We adopt"", just as I don't know what you mean by ""We adopt""."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3212.504,3225.146,"Well, whether or not the City knows what we mean, what we know from the City's brief is that what it's saying is -- and this is on page 33 of its brief -- the Government speech here is only in the act of selection."
2008.07-665,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3233.667,3239.571,What do we do -- is this monument suspiciously similar to the one in Texas?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3264.019,3265.704,--This is part of the same Eagles project--
2008.07-665,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3265.704,3266.154,Okay.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3266.154,3266.987,--that was--
2008.07-665,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3266.987,3270.239,"So -- so if that's the history of it, what does that mean?"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3282.998,3290.586,"--It's all a private message, and it may be a private message that has many different elements, but nothing about that suggests Government speech."
2008.07-665,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3301.344,3301.927,Why not?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3306.162,3307.031,Uh-huh.
2008.07-665,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3307.031,3321.79,"--and so they say -- you know, whatever those are; and then somebody comes along with a totally different content, ""ride the roller coaster"", and they say this part of the park is designed to get healthy children, not put children at risk."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3331.313,3335.098,"The problem is that it's a public park, and content--"
2008.07-665,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3335.098,3335.881,"So in other words, they -- the--"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3335.881,3337.583,--Eating vitamins and roller coasters are not--
2008.07-665,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3337.583,3338.767,--They can't do either.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3338.767,3339.252,--No.
2008.07-665,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3339.252,3342.87,Is there any case that says -- can they have playgrounds in the park?
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3342.87,3343.887,"They can have playgrounds, yes."
2008.07-665,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3343.887,3348.941,"Okay, so we have right in the playground, we have ""eat vitamins"","
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3355.045,3356.228,Those are private messages.
2008.07-665,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3356.228,3357.047,"--Yes, all private."
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3357.047,3357.364,Uh-huh.
2008.07-665,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3357.747,3364.783,"Because there are various groups that feel that's important; the city says yes, it is; and we don't want things like pull the dog's tail, or ----"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3381.995,3383.864,It's all the cases that say the Government can't do it.
2008.07-665,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3383.864,3384.631,Give one and I'll read it.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3386.397,3389.851,I'll give you Pinette.
2008.07-665,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3395.589,3398.54,But the children's playground isn't the public forum.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3398.54,3401.908,"--Oh, but the Government -- a public park is a public forum."
2008.07-665,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3426.522,3427.408,I see where you're going.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3427.941,3428.841,--Okay.
2008.07-665,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3428.841,3441.55,"Are you taking this line because you say if the city council votes for it, then the voters can know those people voted to put up the Ten Commandments; we don't like that; so we are going to vote them out?"
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3451.073,3460.012,"What underlies it is that the Government speech -- the Government speech doctrine is an exception to normal First Amendment, and very important First Amendment constraints."
2008.07-665,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3486.329,3488.012,But it's not disclaiming it here.
2008.07-665,2,37954,pamela_harris,,3516.116,3522.919,"Well, I do think that the -- the city is a bit on the horns of a dilemma because it wants to have it both ways."
2008.07-665,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3536.679,3538.662,"Thank you, counsel."
