2003.03-724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,37.126,"We'll hear argument next in No. 03-724, Hoffman-LaRoche v. Empagran S.A.--"
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,68.552,72.025,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,139.698,146.374,Did... did the court of appeals explain how that issue would be litigated or decided whether someone else had a claim?
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,146.374,168.827,"It really had... had no explanation of that, Your Honor, and it's quite an extraordinary assumption that you would inquire into the bona fides of some unknown person whether they have a claim or not, and indeed, there is a case pending before this Court, the Sniado case, where the litigants have no idea whether there's another person who has such a claim in the United States, and yet discovery has to take place on that... that issue."
2003.03-724,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,168.827,182.728,"The... the respondent says in... in its brief without much detail, just makes the allegation, well, it's the single market, this is the nation, this is a global market, so there's nothing you can do."
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,202.77,210.574,"Well, in our opinion, the characterization of the market and the scope of the conspiracy is irrelevant to the reach of the antitrust laws."
2003.03-724,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,233.13,238.374,"I... I guess my point is, is it... is it all that clear in the real world that these are discrete concepts?"
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,238.374,263.66,"Yes, Congress had in mind that... that this would be a bright line test whether or not our commerce was injured, defined as commerce that's domestic or import or export, and it distinguished that from wholly foreign transactions, wholly foreign commerce, and it wanted to draw that line so that these cases would be allocated to the correct judicial system in the world community and they would not all be--"
2003.03-724,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,263.66,298.424,"The... the claim here is that because of the... because of the worldwide nature of the market, our foreign commerce is necessarily injured, because the market being worldwide, if a lower charge had been assessed in the United States, which would have been the case absent the alleged violations of the antitrust laws, there would have been arbitrage, and we would have exported some of these drugs abroad by reason of the fact that they had been purchased at lower prices in the United States."
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,302.756,306.018,--It... it makes out an injury to wholly foreign commerce.
2003.03-724,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.896,320.687,"No, but there... there was an overcharge in the United States."
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,321.659,322.437,Right.
2003.03-724,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.437,323.308,--contesting that... that--
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,323.308,324.14,At all--
2003.03-724,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.14,326.321,--that the conspiracy included the United States?
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,326.321,333.516,--All of the people who were overcharged in the United States have been compensated in the settlement and our fines here have been geared to the overcharge--
2003.03-724,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.516,334.966,"Yes, but I'm talking about the effect on foreign commerce."
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,350.377,366.368,"--Well, Your Honor, if... if the FTAIA was interpreted to permit that argument, the consequences, all of the foreign claimants could come to our courts, our courts would be flooded, other nations would be antagonized, because they believe that they should be able to apply their law to those foreign transactions."
2003.03-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,376.596,376.786,"Mr. Shapiro, can I ask you a question--"
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,376.786,378.779,"--and effects, purely foreign commerce."
2003.03-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,378.779,380.189,"--about your theory, about your theory?"
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,392.948,398.08,"Only for injury in the United States, and the House report talks about that, companies that are involved in jurisdictions--"
2003.03-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,398.08,400.481,"And it... would that have been the case before this statute was passed, do you think?"
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,400.481,416.573,"--Yes, I... I do, because the... the Clayton Act limits the private treble damage action to injuries stemming from a restraint on U.S. commerce, commerce among the states, and with foreign nations, not foreign commerce that is wholly in foreign nations or between foreign nations."
2003.03-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,421.385,422.006,No.
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,431.253,441.85,"That's correct, because if... if the... if the United States claimant has participated overseas in purely foreign commerce, Congress expected that that plaintiff would invoke the laws of the other nation."
2003.03-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,459.67,464.205,Do you think that... do you think maintaining that position is necessary for you to prevail in this case?
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,464.205,482.035,"Well... well, of course not, Your Honor, because the plaintiffs here... we're talking about the Winddridge Pig Farm in... in... as one of the plaintiffs in Australia that's claiming it paid too much for vitamins in Australia, and the other countries wonder why... why are they complaining about the price of vitamins in the United States court?"
2003.03-724,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,484.758,500.579,"Suppose they... suppose these foreign buyers had alleged, well, they heard that the United States is a good place to buy things and they tried to buy the vitamins in the United States and found the same rigged prices?"
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,500.579,506.563,"--Well, Your Honor, first, the complaint does not allege any attempt to deal in the United States."
2003.03-724,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,506.563,509.576,I'm asking you if that would do under your theory.
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,513.917,516.648,There... there is one case that I would refer Your Honor to.
2003.03-724,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,529.997,536.893,Suppose they show that they in fact attempted to buy drugs here and they found... vitamins here... and they found that the price was the same.
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,536.893,547.028,"Well, the Tenth Circuit held that there had to be an interrupted course of trading before a plaintiff could make that allegation, and that's very similar to what this Court held in Holmes v. SIPC--"
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,547.028,548.3,"Mr. Shapiro, I--"
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,548.3,550.13,--that you have to have an actual transaction that's been interrupted.
2003.03-724,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,550.13,561.71,"--I would think your defense against that is... is... is not to assert that there's no effect on... on foreign commerce, on our exports, because I think... I think there is."
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,602.745,619.728,"Well, yes, we do rely on the second prong of the FTAIA, which requires that the particular claim derive from an anti-competitive effect in the U.S. And here it doesn't, it derives from an effect overseas, and of course, these plaintiffs don't allege that they purchased some export coming from the United States."
2003.03-724,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.728,626.842,"No, they... they're alleging that they would have purchased from... from Americans."
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,629.313,641.732,"It certainly would be, and it would be extremely speculative, and it's the sort of claim this Court has always rejected under Holmes against SIPC, under Blue Chip Stamps, in the securities context, which has been followed the antitrust case law."
2003.03-724,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,676.446,683.629,Let's... let's assume that... that we find the textual argument in... in effect a... a draw.
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,691.576,720.405,"Well, there is a kind of comity that Justice Scalia referred to in the Hartford case that we think is raised here, and that is comity bearing... comity among nations, not judicial comity where the judges weigh various and sundry factors, but it's a rule of interpretation that... that discourages interpretations of law, where you have two interpretations that are available, you pick the interpretation that is most consistent with international law and which avoids antagonizing our allies and our trading partners."
2003.03-724,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,741.408,747.692,"Well, if we... if we accept that and textually the statute is a draw, we... we wouldn't have to get to this interpretative principle."
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,759.31,764.243,"--Well, yes, we... we think the literal language and the structure of the statute are sufficient to reverse here."
2003.03-724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,782.625,785.067,"Well, how... but how... how do we know those two factors?"
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,791.781,798.394,"Well, on the latter, we have amicus briefs from seven of our... our most significant trading partners, of allies--"
2003.03-724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,798.394,801.148,But surely there... there are other partners who have not been heard from.
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,801.148,810.732,"--That's true, but all of the foreign nations that have spoken up here agree with the United States that this is contrary to their ability to regulate commerce in their own nations."
2003.03-724,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,811.694,817.457,These are nations with... with fairly effective antitrust laws and antitrust enforcement.
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,817.457,818.308,--Absolutely.
2003.03-724,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.308,827.185,"What about the majorities of nations in the world that don't have effective antitrust enforcement, if indeed they have any antitrust laws?"
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,830.655,846.196,"Well, there are 100 nations now that do have aggressive antitrust enforcement programs, and Congress' view in 1982 was that we should draw back in our attempt to police the world because we want all these other nations to adopt these rules."
2003.03-724,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,862.968,871.554,"Well, their argument is that these cases simply come together anyway, these cases will piggyback their way in or at least come hand in hand with the domestic cases."
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,871.554,897.229,"Well, Your Honor, it... these cases are difficult to administer under the best of circumstances, but consider global plaintiffs from 192 countries coming to the United States and asking a single district court judge to decide how much they've been overcharged, how much competition there was locally, what trade barriers there were that might have prevented competition, calculate the damages for every man, woman, and child on the face of the Earth that perhaps is... has an antitrust claim."
2003.03-724,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,897.229,900.912,"Of course, I suppose that's the penalty for engaging in worldwide conspiracy."
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,900.912,903.784,But that penalty is imposed on our district court judges.
2003.03-724,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,927.29,937.166,"Could you just deny class action certification if that's... if you have that kind of problem, but no... nobody, none of these plaintiffs are trying to sue on behalf of the whole world."
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,937.166,949.976,"Well, the plaintiffs here are... are alleging a class action of all the purchasers around the world outside of the United States, and every one of the cases that's been filed under this theory has been a class action, so that's... that's what we're seeing."
2003.03-724,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,959.461,965.487,"Has any Federal court ever certified a class that size, that all purchases around the globe?"
2003.03-724,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,965.487,970.429,"--I don't think the class issue has been reached in any of these cases, but they... they are being filed."
2003.03-724,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1001.339,1002.691,"Very well, Mr. Shapiro."
2003.03-724,1,40150,r_hewitt_pate_iii,,1004.25,1014.818,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-724,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1069.294,1073.726,Can you tell us how... how it would jeopardize your... your efforts?
2003.03-724,1,40150,r_hewitt_pate_iii,,1091.278,1098.533,"The... the important point, Justice Kennedy, is that under these amnesty programs, there is no amnesty given for civil liability."
2003.03-724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1152.75,1161.656,"Mr. Pate, do you agree with Mr. Shapiro's answer to my question about a plaintiff, an American plaintiff who has business both in this country and abroad and suffers... and both are hurt by the conspiracy?"
2003.03-724,1,40150,r_hewitt_pate_iii,,1161.656,1170.822,"--Yes, Justice Stevens, I do, because under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, the plaintiff must show that his own injury is, by reason of--"
2003.03-724,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1170.822,1174.905,"Well, in my hypothetical it is his injury, he does business both in the United States and in Europe."
2003.03-724,1,40150,r_hewitt_pate_iii,,1174.905,1175.783,--Exactly.
2003.03-724,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1199.151,1200.391,I don't follow the--
2003.03-724,1,40150,r_hewitt_pate_iii,,1202.224,1203.292,Hartford--
2003.03-724,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1203.292,1216.562,"I mean, Hartford specifically addressed the export, but it... it... my recollection is, in the footnote, it expressly left any... any further effect of the statute in open question."
2003.03-724,1,40150,r_hewitt_pate_iii,,1216.562,1217.313,"--That's correct, Justice Souter."
2003.03-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1252.075,1254.908,"The FTAIA was passed in 1982, is that right?"
2003.03-724,1,40150,r_hewitt_pate_iii,,1254.908,1256.237,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
2003.03-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1256.237,1272.358,"The division keeps track, I guess, but is there any instance, or what instances are there, I'd like to write them down unless there are dozens, in which a foreign cartel injures the United States and also separately injures people abroad."
2003.03-724,1,40150,r_hewitt_pate_iii,,1284.827,1287.731,We're aware of no instance of such a case and it--
2003.03-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1287.731,1288.37,No such instance.
2003.03-724,1,40150,r_hewitt_pate_iii,,1289.542,1300.668,"--It was clear and it is accepted as a commonplace that a plaintiff who did not participate in U.S. commerce, in trading in U.S. commerce, simply would not have had the same--"
2003.03-724,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1300.668,1305.052,So you've looked it up and you can find nothing in your opinion that counts as such an instance?
2003.03-724,1,40150,r_hewitt_pate_iii,,1305.052,1306.711,--We're aware of no such case.
2003.03-724,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1584.301,1584.73,"Thank you, Mr. Pate."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1585.751,1592.487,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-724,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1605.433,1620.433,"Mr. Goldstein, do you agree with the position of your opponents that the FTAIA was a limiting statute and that if there was no claim before FTAIA, that there certainly is none afterwards for your case?"
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1620.433,1624.908,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but not because the FTAIA applies."
2003.03-724,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1713.726,1738.092,"No, no, I mean, their argument I take it is simply, of course, there... the quinine cartel, which I had heard of, I'd not heard, the quinine cartel sets in Holland and raises the price of quinine that's sold all over the world, and of course it violates our law and we're out there and they're lobbing these shells at us in a sense, and so of course we can bring a claim against them, it hurts us."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1794.93,1801.545,"Justice Breyer, I'm going to answer it in three parts that will explain why it is that you can't separate the civil and the criminal liability."
2003.03-724,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1828.954,1830.226,"It says it's illegal, period."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1830.226,1832.406,"--It's illegal, including the sales in Ecuador and in Holland."
2003.03-724,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1892.614,1896.287,"Well, but Pfizer was doing business in this country."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1896.287,1899.228,"--Mr. Chief Justice, we accept that as correct, but--"
2003.03-724,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.228,1901.96,"Well, you have... you not only accept it, it's a fact, so you're--"
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1902.35,1907.056,--And it... and we accept it.
2003.03-724,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1915.849,1922.234,"But I... if you're on a... it sounds to me like you're a verbal point, which I'm not against."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1981.712,1982.423,--Yes.
2003.03-724,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1982.423,1983.853,"Okay, what's the answer?"
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1983.853,1993.3,"The answer is that the... let me take you to the text of Section 4 of the Clayton Act, which I know you know, but it can't hurt to come to it, and that's at the page 1a of the red brief."
2003.03-724,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2015.165,2015.706,Correct.
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2024.141,2024.882,"Okay, but--"
2003.03-724,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2024.882,2028.024,I'm... I'm not... I got off the train even earlier.
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2072.602,2083.19,"--Justice Scalia, let me tell you why I think that is contrary to settled precedents, and Mr. Chief Justice, these are precedents just like Rose v. Lundy that Congress would have had in mind in the 1982 act."
2003.03-724,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2157.321,2164.447,But all of that is true and it does not necessarily follow that we do or should permit a cause of action.
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2164.447,2165.937,"Absolutely, Justice Souter."
2003.03-724,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2212.493,2213.875,You're... you're talking about FTAIA?
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2213.875,2214.864,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-724,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2214.864,2217.756,"Well, but the court of appeals relied very heavily on the act."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2217.756,2220.51,It did in the sense of saying--
2003.03-724,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2220.51,2221.779,"Well, it just did."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2223.201,2224.912,"--It did in a particular sense, yes."
2003.03-724,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2228.684,2229.654,--Good to know.
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2230.094,2235.567,"--It said that the FTAIA, the '82 Act didn't bar our claim."
2003.03-724,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2357.689,2374.292,"But the... I... the court of appeals, I thought, said the language, give rise to a claim, meant that you didn't have to show the claim of any particular person."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2377.484,2380.276,"We do, Mr. Chief Justice, in its bottom line."
2003.03-724,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2454.948,2460.412,"I... I just want... don't want you to lose part 3, and let... let you focus on that, the comity."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2460.412,2461.103,Yes.
2003.03-724,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2461.103,2490.92,"One possibility floating through my mind is that there are international quinine or maybe this, international vitamin cartels, where it's pure price-fixing, and in such instances, prices in one country may be interdependent on another, and in such instances if you lose this case here, now, you may still have a claim, because it flows in part, the injury, from effects in the United States."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2539.146,2540.555,Thank you.
2003.03-724,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2585.195,2591.309,"But how... how is it, in... in the hypothetical that Justice Breyer posed, that comity is built in?"
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2596.304,2597.443,--I understand.
2003.03-724,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2673.976,2694.989,"Mr. Goldstein, may I stop you there, because you are dividing the universe up in to claims that everybody agrees and more controversial applications of U.S. antitrust law, but one of the principal objections, as I understand it, from other nations is to the treble damages feature."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2702.393,2703.124,--Yes.
2003.03-724,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2744.18,2756.268,"What about a forum non conveniens policy that says, you're a foreign purchaser, you purchased abroad, you have a nice forum abroad to go to, don't burden the U.S. courts."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2756.268,2757.1,Absolutely.
2003.03-724,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2846.77,2848.322,I don't really see what it's doing on the table.
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2870.507,2880.433,"--It... it's the judgment that Congress made, Justice Breyer, in the worldwide markets that Justice Kennedy referenced in the first half hour, and that is that we will be hurt, unless we go after them."
2003.03-724,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2930.688,2936.892,"But... but I'm... I'm not sure that the rule you're advocating... you say that don't... don't worry about the other case, because your case is okay."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2938.513,2940.673,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy, I... I think that's right."
2003.03-724,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2950.38,2951.321,And I'm waiting for that rule.
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2951.321,2952.052,--Okay.
2003.03-724,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2952.052,2953.191,It's still on the table.
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2953.191,2971.035,"The rule, Justice Kennedy, is that the Sherman Act applies, but unless there is a worldwide market, so that we can say that the injury to the person abroad is inextricably intertwined with the injury to the person here, that claim lacks antitrust standing because it will not directly advance U.S. interests."
2003.03-724,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2974.416,2975.768,So you have flushed them all out that way.
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3002.005,3005.127,"--No, we're... Justice Kennedy, let me relate this to your question."
2003.03-724,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3085.329,3111.838,"If you think that the forum non conveniens point would work, let's say, for our trading partners who have told us they don't like treble damages in any case, so are we going to make a distinction then and accept the complaint of customers, purchasers of vitamins in countries that don't have any antitrust laws, but we would reject claims coming from, say, the U.K. or Canada?"
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3111.838,3117.199,"--We would reject claims from places like Australia and Canada and the like, that's right."
2003.03-724,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3126.917,3132.1,"Well, but that... that in itself is a rather elaborate inquiry that you find nowhere in the statute."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3132.1,3140.996,"--Well, Justice... Mr. Chief Justice, the reason is that forum non conveniens is a principle that's generally applicable to the law and--"
2003.03-724,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3140.996,3148.842,"Yeah, but forum non conveniens is ordinarily not that you have different law, but there are other factors that make it inconvenient to try the case."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3148.842,3151.114,"--Mr. Chief Justice, that's right."
2003.03-724,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3153.564,3156.155,"Well, she's perfectly capable of speaking her own view."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3158.397,3160.279,"--Mr. Chief Justice, those factors are relevant."
2003.03-724,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3171.196,3178.692,But... but the people from Canada cannot go somewhere else and vindicate their claim because the Canadian law is different.
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3178.692,3181.423,"Mr. Chief Justice, they do have a competition law."
2003.03-724,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3189.509,3195.772,"But I... I thought your answer was that the ones that don't can sue here, and the ones that do can't sue here."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3195.772,3197.172,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-724,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3197.172,3205.209,"But then you said a moment ago, I thought, that the Canadians could sue here, but I... now you're saying they'd be turned away."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3205.209,3207.249,"I then misspoke, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3207.249,3207.8,"Well, you sure did."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3207.8,3208.361,Yes.
2003.03-724,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3231.547,3234.979,But would you get to my Illinois Brick question before your time runs out.
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3234.979,3235.731,Yes.
2003.03-724,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3235.731,3262.248,"And just so I put the question as... as clearly as possible, it seems extraordinary to me that if this... if a foreign company had been injured by buying drugs from an American company that bought them from the conspirators at an excessively high price, that foreign company would not have a cause of action."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3297.911,3299.772,"There are three answers, Justice Scalia."
2003.03-724,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3359.201,3377.263,"As far as your first point is concerned, I understand the other side to concede that if you could demonstrate that you would have bought from one of these American companies that manufactured in connection with this conspiracy and sold at the conspiratorial price, you would... you would have a cause of action."
2003.03-724,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3380.656,3382.068,"Two answers, Justice Scalia."
2003.03-724,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3396.537,3397.617,"Thank you, Mr. Goldstein."
2003.03-724,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3400.177,3401.709,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-724,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3643.482,3644.201,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
