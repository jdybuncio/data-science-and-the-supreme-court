1998.96-1793,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.818,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-1793, Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garrett F.."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,53.415,63.062,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.96-1793,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,107.881,140.644,"Ms. Seitz, I follow what you're saying, but we do have the Tatro case, and I would have said in one sense the CIC is a medical service, so it seems to me, at least from your brief, that you're not resting on the character of the care that's rendered...  is it a catheter, or what it is...  but the volume of it and the cost, so it's...  the nature of the service seems to be not part of your calculus."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,153.132,161.329,"Justice Ginsburg, catheterization, even clean intermittent catheterization, is also commonly thought of as a medical service."
1998.96-1793,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,191.737,205.368,"But my question to you is, are you saying every one of these services on the list fits within the medical service exception, or they do cumulatively but not individually?"
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,205.368,215.122,"Justice Ginsburg, we're saying they do cumulatively, because obviously the Cedar Rapids Community School District does provide clean intermittent catheterization to other students."
1998.96-1793,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,229.424,240.891,"Well, so you stipulate that the tracheotomy procedure is...  can be a nursing service?"
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,240.891,242.721,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.96-1793,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,269.893,277.416,"It's not because the nurse lacks the competence, I take it, but just because she's charged with a number of other responsibilities as school nurse."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,277.416,279.707,"Mr. Chief Justice, that would be correct."
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,279.707,280.688,"Well, isn't it also..."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,280.688,281.94,I'm sorry.
1998.96-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.94,284.382,It just depends on how many school nurses you have.
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,286.923,288.893,"Actually, Your Honor, you would have..."
1998.96-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.893,293.567,"It's sort of hard to think that, you know, that that makes a difference in the nature of the service."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,293.567,296.47,"Your Honor, I don't believe it makes a difference in the nature of the service."
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,308.818,318.324,"Well, but you...  it seems to me you, even on that assumption you've got a problem, because the testimony in the case was, as I understand it, that you don't even need a nurse to do this."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,361.912,368.087,"Your Honor, first, you're correct that the Iowa Board of Nursing did rule his care needed to be provided by a nurse."
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,376.612,376.922,Okay.
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,389.191,392.423,"We're proposing a multi-factored test, Your Honor, that would be both..."
1998.96-1793,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,392.423,426.056,"And then you...  you seem to be going back on what I thought was very candid and clear of you earlier when you said, if we took each one of these, the tracheotomy, each one separately, it would be a related service that wasn't within the medical exception, but when you cumulate them altogether, it's the all-day, continuous, that makes it medical service, so it seems to me you were not...  your line depends upon duration and expense, and not the character of the individual services..."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,426.056,426.486,Your Honor...
1998.96-1793,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,426.486,426.627,in the package.
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,426.627,427.067,I'm sorry.
1998.96-1793,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,434.094,438.224,"But I thought you told me there was not medical in the event of, say, the tracheotomy."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,438.224,439.626,No...  excuse me?
1998.96-1793,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,440.928,444.699,"The tracheotomy is not medical, I thought, because nurses routinely do this."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,444.699,445.731,Excuse me.
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,472.899,492.514,"Well, that's right, but because on the assumption of the bright line test, what the bright line is drawn between is what, I presume, in fact doctors do and what, in fact, nurses do, but it seems to me that that doesn't necessarily implicate the point that I was trying to make earlier."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,492.514,502.03,"Your Honor, if, in fact, it were physician-nonphysician bright line, it's difficult to comprehend how there would be any meaning given to the statutory exclusion."
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,503.521,505.571,"Well, I don't understand that."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,513.148,521.352,"But what physician services would be necessary during a school day, at school, to enable a child to benefit from education."
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,531.78,543.488,"Well, it would mean that if there is some procedure that can only be performed by a doctor, and a doctor would have to come in once a day to do it, and it was not diagnostic, et cetera, then it would be excluded."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,549.952,556.375,"Your Honor, we cannot conceive of any procedure that a physician would have to come in and perform for a student during..."
1998.96-1793,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,556.375,562.329,Then what gave Chief Justice Burger the misimpression which he evidently had on your argument?
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,580.691,589.026,Justice Burger in the Tatro case indicated that CIC could be done by a school nurse or a lay person.
1998.96-1793,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,589.026,597.904,"Yes, but when he talked about where the line is drawn, he said, doctors cost a lot of money and hospitals cost a lot of money."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,612.284,612.662,No.
1998.96-1793,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,630.656,640.293,But you're recognizing that he wasn't dealing with an imaginary case when he thought that doctors and hospitals could have been part of this picture.
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,640.293,646.577,"That doctors and hospitals could be part of the included services, or..."
1998.96-1793,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,646.577,650.84,"If but for this exception, because he mentioned them in his opinion."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,656.044,673.255,"I believe Justice Burger said that the agency definition of included services which made a distinction between physicians and nonphysicians, and then went on to say in Tatro that they have carved out physician's services because it added additional expense to districts."
1998.96-1793,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,761.505,771.47,"Well, if you are saying that the act imposes just a reasonable burden but not an extensive burden on the States, we could argue on that."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,781.366,784.579,"Whether one-on-one nursing is a medical service, Your Honor?"
1998.96-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,804.532,806.425,"Oh, I would assume nonprivate duty nursing as well."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,840.425,846.78,"Justice Scalia, actually I don't think there's any question that CIC is a medical service in common understanding."
1998.96-1793,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,847.481,854.247,"Well, but we had the Tatro decision, and it said that was not a medical service."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,861.19,863.293,"Justice O'Connor, we're in agreement..."
1998.96-1793,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,863.293,863.991,overrule Tatro?
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,863.991,866.284,We're in agreement with the result of Tatro.
1998.96-1793,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,880.715,882.877,But that isn't what the Department has said.
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,893.081,893.412,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.96-1793,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,893.412,903.299,"But broken down and doing it intermittently they're not, and that's a very hard line to draw, as Justice Scalia has pointed out."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,905.632,923.164,"Your Honor, we believe that if we allow a multi-factor test to be used, where you can determine whether school nurses who traditionally serve hundreds...  in fact, the ratio is 1 to 3,000 students...  can do the services, that it would be treated as a school health service under the regulations."
1998.96-1793,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,945.37,954.506,"You keep saying multi-factor test, but it seems to me in all candor that your argument comes down to, all day is too much, and we have brackets on this target."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,987.555,989.448,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1011.4,1019.147,"Well, I thought the simple requirement to have an attendant of any sort would be a continuous care requirement."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1019.147,1019.448,That's correct.
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1019.448,1021.337,But it wouldn't...  it certainly wouldn't be medical.
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1021.337,1024.05,They'd still be performing medical functions.
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1031.243,1045.303,"No, but I thought your statement was merely that any continuous care that might occur in a situation like this would be medical, and in fact he's getting continuous care right now, isn't he?"
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1045.303,1050.728,"I'm sorry, that's because the continuous care that he's getting...  you're referring to the educational associate the district's providing..."
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1050.728,1050.886,Yes.
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1050.886,1053.6,"that helps him move about the building, manipulate materials."
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1058.893,1062.486,"But if it were being provided under this section, that would be medical, too."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1062.486,1064.687,If it were being provided as a related service.
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1065.488,1068.42,"Well, it would be provided as a related service, wouldn't it?"
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1068.42,1073.182,"You mean now the educational continuous care, or the nursing continuous care?"
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1073.543,1080.819,"The...  I'm not sure that I have the proper term, but I thought there was some individual who attended this student at all times..."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1080.819,1081.067,There are actually two...
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1081.067,1082.289,"to move around, and so on."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1082.289,1086.151,There are actually two individuals who attend this child all the time.
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1089.123,1089.291,Okay.
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1089.291,1092.183,"helps him with his materials, raise his hand, move him about the building."
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1092.183,1098.23,"If that were provided under this section, would you call that medical service because it was continuous?"
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1098.23,1103.783,"I don't know how to answer that, because it's purely an educational..."
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1103.783,1116.22,"Well, I thought you had said earlier that if in fact the service is continuous, you really couldn't conceive of a service that would not therefore be medical, and I'm saying, if it were provided under this section it would be medical, then, on your test, wouldn't it?"
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1116.22,1128.437,"Actually, no, Your Honor, because you first have to make the initial determination of what the nature of the care is, and if he's helping him move materials, raise his hand, manipulate the computer, nobody's arguing that's a medical service."
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1128.437,1137.724,"Okay, then continuity is not itself a criterion, and the only thing that continuity goes to, I guess, is the likelihood of the expense which is going to follow the continuity, is that about it?"
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1137.724,1138.084,Your Honor...
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1138.084,1139.036,It's a bottom line test.
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1139.036,1140.195,"No, I don't think that's it."
1998.96-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1143.828,1157.408,"But you're not really willing to do that, because you're not willing to say that all services involving the physical well-being of a student that are provided by nurses or anyone else, you're not willing to say that they're medical services."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1157.408,1163.392,"Actually I think they are medical services for determining the nature, but we also need to look at the school health service..."
1998.96-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.392,1165.515,"Yes, but I'm talking about medical services within the meaning of the statute."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1166.775,1176.052,"Actually, the easiest argument would be that all medical services that are traditionally thought of are medical, are medical and are excluded and the school health service goes too far."
1998.96-1793,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1237.19,1250.851,"On that, in your response to Justice Scalia are you saying that we should overrule the Tatro case, because that's what you seem to be saying if you say that all of these are really medical service."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1250.851,1251.672,They are.
1998.96-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1276.206,1286.324,"You're saying we went as far as we did in Tatro only because there was a regulation that pushed us that far, and that the regulation doesn't push us any further."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1286.324,1287.846,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1311.331,1314.403,May I go back to your assertion about the regulations?
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1349.249,1361.666,"Actually the 1996 letter, one of which is attached to our petition for certiorari, were the only times that the Department was asked whether one-on-one continuous nursing, or in fact nursing services at all, were required."
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1369.851,1372.793,So they didn't have to get to the bright line versus multi-factored...
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1372.793,1381.619,"They really didn't, and in fact they applied what looked like a bright line on the included psychotherapy services, because you have the psychologist, the medical service distinction."
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1381.619,1409.727,"Well, assuming, then, that's the...  sort of the state of the administrative record, don't we have to confront Tatro in this way: Tatro seems to involve a recognition, an endorsement of the...  what the Court then understood to be the Department's bright line approach to interpreting the statute"
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1426.71,1428.48,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1998.96-1793,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1428.48,1430.059,"Well, it hasn't done it here, has it?"
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1448.552,1461.07,"Your Honor, first I think the Tatro case actually approved the included definition of medical services as services by a physician for purposes of evaluation and diagnosis."
1998.96-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1482.245,1490.45,"You know, even if I don't accept...  even if we reject what is the nice bright line test that's expressed in Tatro..."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1490.45,1490.73,Yes.
1998.96-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1490.73,1493.282,"It certainly is expressed there, hospitals and doctors."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1499.726,1501.176,"No, we don't think you do have to..."
1998.96-1793,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1501.176,1503.92,Can we...  can you give us any other clearer line?
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1508.582,1520.02,"Actually, we would be happy to give that line, and a line that particularly was drawn at continuous one-on-one which, other than physician services, is the most intensive medical services you can get."
1998.96-1793,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1528.204,1529.375,I'd like to ask one question.
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1529.375,1529.726,Yes.
1998.96-1793,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1529.726,1530.828,You deal with this area quite a lot.
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1530.828,1532.13,Of special education?
1998.96-1793,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1532.13,1532.818,Yes.
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1532.818,1532.958,"Yes, I do."
1998.96-1793,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1532.958,1533.659,Good.
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1542.486,1542.686,Uh-huh.
1998.96-1793,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1542.686,1544.516,Do you view that as coming within the act?
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1544.516,1549.851,"Yes, and in fact the law requires multidisciplinary assessments as well."
1998.96-1793,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1552.061,1552.822,"Very well, Ms. Seitz."
1998.96-1793,0,42088,susan_l_seitz,,1552.822,1553.552,Thank you.
1998.96-1793,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.552,1555.024,Mr. Oelschlaeger.
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1555.024,1570.455,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1605.057,1618.256,"But I guess these services are acknowledged in this instance to be of a continuous nature, as the petitioner's lawyer described, that a nurse would have to be there full-time."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1618.256,1622.7,"Justice O'Connor, the petitioner has categorized these services as continuous."
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1663.817,1665.738,There is an educational aide...
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1665.738,1666.479,Yes.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1666.479,1668.74,with the child at all times?
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1668.74,1669.03,Right.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1670.382,1673.885,And can that person do any of the listening or the positioning?
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1673.885,1677.127,They certainly could with minimal training and that was the record.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1689.396,1696.821,So you say the record in this case shows that such a person could do these more continuous things.
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1696.821,1696.969,Yes.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1696.969,1700.532,And that the rest of it is intermittent need.
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1700.532,1700.833,Yes.
1998.96-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1710.55,1720.645,"If most of this is just listening to see whether he needs assistance, why doesn't that come under the diagnostic exception to the medical exception?"
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1720.645,1740.799,"Well, we believe Congress, Justice Scalia, in 1401(a)(17), when it defined related services broadly and included supportive services and listed some, didn't list all, we believe they defined it to include a service to assist a child with a disability..."
1998.96-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1740.799,1745.612,"I think you're mistaking my question, because it is not a hostile question."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1745.612,1745.813,Okay.
1998.96-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1746.674,1768.546,"Even if these were medical services, since you say most of the time they're not doing anything except listening to see whether he needs medical assistance, now, I would take listening to see if he needs medical assistance to be diagnostic, and diagnostic services are excepted from the exception for medical services."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1768.546,1780.695,"Except in this case they're not provided by a physician, so I suppose if a physician sat there and listened all day to see if there was some difficulty in breathing, then that expressly would be an included service."
1998.96-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.695,1782.656,So it's not diagnostic unless it's done by a physician.
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1782.656,1786.358,"That seems to be the statutory definition, yes."
1998.96-1793,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1786.358,1787.94,"I don't follow that, because..."
1998.96-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.94,1788.161,"I don't, either."
1998.96-1793,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1788.161,1791.223,"diagnostic is covered, even if it's a physician."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1808.504,1809.295,That is so.
1998.96-1793,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1811.358,1816.611,"Yes, so if it's diagnostic, whoever does it it comes...  it's covered."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1816.611,1816.891,Right.
1998.96-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1819.773,1832.492,"But there's also...  you know, if a parent sat up at night with a kid who had whooping cough waiting for him to get into a spasm you wouldn't say the parent was diagnosing whooping cough."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1837.083,1837.294,Right.
1998.96-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1838.235,1838.796,Yes.
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1838.796,1841.119,"Treatment modality at that point, yes, Your Honor."
1998.96-1793,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1879.065,1886.8,Do you think that the agency has the power to define diagnostic...  to define medical services one way or the other?
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1886.8,1887.571,Yes.
1998.96-1793,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1889.151,1889.561,All right.
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1914.138,1914.388,Okay.
1998.96-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1935.084,1937.865,"Where is the letter in the record, Mr. Oelschlaeger?"
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1937.865,1944.938,I think the letter is Exhibit D to the petition for certiorari.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1951.023,1951.915,Page what?
1998.96-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1951.915,1954.396,Appendix D of 64a.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1954.396,1954.676,64a?
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,1954.676,1979.773,"64a, and the letter starts out and talks about the case-by-case analysis, which is what is required under the IEP, or individualized education plan procedures of the statute, and then proceeds to explain how various district courts, the Detsel court, various circuit courts have interpreted those provisions."
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2011.654,2026.844,"Well, if the facts were different than you say they are in this case and if, in fact, continuous care by a registered nurse were necessary 24 hours a day, would your answer be any different?"
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2026.844,2030.107,"Well, the 24 hours a day might be different."
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2050.601,2059.896,"So if an ambulance has to stand by for every hour the child is at school, it's not a physician..."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2059.896,2060.496,That's true.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2060.496,2061.839,and the school has to do it.
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2061.839,2068.702,"Although again, given the facts of this case, an ambulance could be summoned by a 911 call."
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2068.702,2071.143,"No, I'm asking some hypotheticals, obviously."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2071.143,2071.382,I understand.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2071.382,2079.741,"Because you told me that the facts of this case are different, but I want to know how far your argument takes us, and would it be different..."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2079.741,2080.121,The...
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2080.121,2086.623,if a nurse had to be there full-time and the ambulance had to be outside the school all the time.
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2086.623,2087.576,Okay.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2094.139,2094.797,I'm asking you...
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2094.797,2095.228,Okay.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2095.228,2098.221,"what you see are the limitations, if any."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2098.221,2102.975,"The limitations in Tatro were expressed to be, the child is handicapped so as to require special education."
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2127.951,2129.213,But while the child is at school...
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2129.213,2129.622,Yes.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2129.622,2135.146,"full-time nursing care required and, if necessary, an ambulance right there in the driveway."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2135.146,2138.429,Again you'd have to get into the IEP procedure.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2151.218,2154.651,"Well, because of the high risk of autonomic hyperreflexia, for example."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2154.651,2159.106,"Right, and again that's a virtually nonexistent risk in this case on the record, but yes."
1998.96-1793,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2159.106,2163.948,"All right, so I think if I were in Congress I might have thought the agency will resolve this."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2171.514,2175.297,"Well, I think this case is merely an extension of the Tatro case."
1998.96-1793,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2207.188,2225.41,"I can't find a regulation...  I can find a regulation that says that diagnostic services, when given by a doctor, do get covered, but I didn't find any other regulation that defined whether or not a medical service was or wasn't a medical service."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2227.591,2228.041,Right.
1998.96-1793,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2235.407,2244.223,"That's the one that says, when you diagnose a child, if a doctor diagnoses a child, that is a covered medical service."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2244.223,2245.783,"Right, and that was the one that the Tatro..."
1998.96-1793,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2245.783,2248.665,I take it here we're not dealing with diagnostic services.
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2248.665,2250.357,"Not by a physician, anyhow."
1998.96-1793,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2250.357,2253.609,"So therefore, what regulation covers this case?"
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2253.609,2258.842,"Then you have to look at the regulation (b)(11), 300.16 (b)(11)."
1998.96-1793,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2260.032,2261.254,School health services?
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2261.254,2263.234,"Right, and it's our position..."
1998.96-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2263.234,2264.366,What page are you on?
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2264.366,2269.329,That would be page 8a of the appendix to the United States' brief on the merits.
1998.96-1793,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2269.329,2282.838,"Is it fair to say that the petitioner's position reads, school health services means services usually or traditionally provided by a qualified school nurse?"
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2286.481,2297.4,"I think there's an element of that, Your Honor, and of course we believe that to be directly refuted by the statute, particularly in regards to the 1997 amendments."
1998.96-1793,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2305.084,2318.321,"Well, on the other hand, if you say school health service means services provided by a qualified school nurse and that they're provided by the nurse in this case, therefore they're automatically covered, that, it seems to me to be a somewhat circular definition on your part."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2318.321,2326.058,"Well, there is also the second half of the definition, Your Honor, qualified school nurse or other qualified person."
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2326.058,2338.427,"Well, I guess the statute that we look to first is probably 20 U.S. Code section 1401(a)(17)."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2338.427,2338.687,Yes.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2339.839,2358.57,"And it defines the term related services, and it says that that means transportation and such developmental, corrective, and other supportive services, including speech pathology, audiology, psychological services, physical and occupational therapy and so forth."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2394.305,2395.864,"Justice O'Connor, I think that's a fair comment."
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2418.1,2419.301,Where is the statute...
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2419.301,2446.858,"They're both in 20 U.S.C. section 1412(2)(C), all children residing in the State who are disabled, regardless of the severity of their disability, and then subsection (3) of that same 1412, the State has to have a plan first to address children who got no education, which was the problem discussed in Rowley, and then children with the most severe disabilities."
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2446.858,2452.572,It's unfortunate that these weren't reproduced to help us analyze it.
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2452.572,2452.962,I understand that.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2488.127,2490.408,Has any State refused to go along...
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2490.408,2491.149,No.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2491.149,2492.017,with this program?
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2494.661,2501.056,"It's my understanding that initially New Mexico didn't get involved, but now all 50 States are involved in the program."
1998.96-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2501.056,2527.034,"You know, actually I suppose we really don't begin with the definition of related services, but we probably begin with a provision that uses related services, and that reads, the term free appropriate public education means special education and related services, and I suppose in attacking this problem we should regard that whole phrase, special education and related services."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2527.034,2530.094,"Right, and there is...  there's statutory definitions for your help, Your Honor."
1998.96-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2530.094,2545.265,"Okay, and then it defines related services to mean transportation and such developmental, corrective, and other supportive services, including blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, as may be required to assist a child with disability to benefit from special education."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2556.822,2567.37,"No, and again I think the limitation in the Tatro case relates to services provided during the school day to get the child in the front door, to keep them there for the school day, and then to get them home."
1998.96-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.37,2569.41,And what's necessary to enable him to benefit.
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2582.561,2583.259,"Oh, I think..."
1998.96-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.259,2587.293,"is a related service, it seems to me a great stretch."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2587.293,2589.927,It is a broad definition.
1998.96-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.45,2597.882,"Oh, I don't think it's a broad definition."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2610.53,2612.17,"Right, to benefit from the education."
1998.96-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2612.17,2621.026,"Now, that would include enabling him to move around the room, enabling him to use books and so forth, but to say keeping him alive is part of it, I mean, that just expands related services..."
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2621.026,2621.207,Well...
1998.96-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2621.207,2622.766,beyond any limitation.
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2622.766,2625.798,Except if the child dies obviously there's no benefit from education.
1998.96-1793,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2625.798,2626.049,"Well, of course."

1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2671.71,2672.221,Right.
1998.96-1793,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2672.221,2676.204,the school district is required to provide that institutional care?
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2676.204,2680.638,"In some circumstances, yes, in the institutional placement, and there are reported decisions on that, Your Honor."
1998.96-1793,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2688.763,2722.746,"And that's what this case at this stage turns on, because as I understand it this child was in school with these services being...  the tab being picked up by something other than the school district's funds, and now the...  one of the answers that we have from the school district is, oh, don't worry, there'll be other funds to keep this child in school, but if you have to use our funds, then the alternative is home instruction, and how would that...  what would...  how would the home instruction work?"
1998.96-1793,1,21323,douglas_r_oelschlaeger,,2722.746,2737.756,"Well, home-based instruction, Your Honor, and there's materials in the brief on this, is typically an hour or two a...  per week of instruction for the child at home, and that we would submit is not in keeping with the intent of the IDEA..."

1998.96-1793,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2739.028,2739.769,Mr. Oelschlaeger.
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2742.02,2748.354,Thank you...
1998.96-1793,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2748.354,2762.823,"Ms. Brinkmann, I notice that the letter to which Justice Breyer referred, it appears that it was...  the date of the inquiry was October 1, 1993, and the date of response was February 22, 1996."
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2767.958,2771.689,"Your Honor, I'm not aware of the circumstances surrounding that delay."
1998.96-1793,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2785.03,2788.153,It certainly shouldn't have taken 2-1/2 years to write such an unhelpful letter.
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2788.153,2788.323,I would...
1998.96-1793,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2850.174,2850.202,"Well, is there no..."
1998.96-1793,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.202,2850.823,What's the date of Tatro?
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2854.065,2856.867,"It came before Tatro, Your Honor, in fact, the year before."
1998.96-1793,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2861.792,2871.287,"Is there no limit, in your view, to the extent of nursing care services that may have to be provided to a child?"
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2871.287,2873.53,"There are limits in other aspects of the act, Your Honor."
1998.96-1793,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2916.397,2922.552,"alternative, placing the child in an institutional facility, is that required?"
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2922.552,2923.403,"Yes, it is."
1998.96-1793,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2982.872,2988.175,But we didn't know at that time that what those regulations meant was Tatro.
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2988.175,3016.295,"We did, Your Honor, because on page 22 in the Federal Register at the last sentence of our second full paragraph on page 22 we quote from that Federal Register proposal, quote: The existing regulations define medical services as services provided by a licensed physician, and the proposed changes, the Secretary is very explicit that he wanted to broaden that medical exclusion to consider factors precisely what petitioner is urging, such as cost"
1998.96-1793,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3016.976,3019.026,"All right, so that isn't what they provided."

1998.96-1793,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3035.949,3037.219,Did I...  the one we read before?
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3039.041,3039.452,Yes.
1998.96-1793,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3039.452,3040.42,The one on page 8a...  all right.
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3059.044,3059.464,Uh-huh.
1998.96-1793,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3059.464,3064.687,"comments, et cetera, and second, your brief, so if I were to go on those two things I'd say yes, that is what the agency's..."
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3064.687,3065.028,"No, Your Honor."
1998.96-1793,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3066.398,3067.279,All right.
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3067.279,3072.885,"There is that statement in the notice of proposed rule-making in 1982, and that's fully consistent with earlier letters."
1998.96-1793,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3134.624,3138.436,"Ms. Brinkmann, I find it difficult to accept that, for this simple reason."
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3153.466,3154.628,I'd like to explain that letter.
1998.96-1793,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3181.077,3183.348,Where does it say there's a bright line between physician and nonphysician?
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3183.348,3184.278,"No, it doesn't say bright line, Your Honor, not at all."
1998.96-1793,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3198.519,3205.902,"Well, Ms. Brinkmann, a whole...  a majority of the courts of appeals have rejected your bright line approach."
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3205.902,3206.102,Yes.
1998.96-1793,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3206.102,3213.448,"I mean, if we affirm here we certainly will be going against a majority of the Federal appellate courts."
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3213.448,3227.145,"Your Honor, I think to rule otherwise would clearly be inconsistent with the Court's ruling in Tatro, and Congress' positive statutory enactment that we cite at page 8a that adopts as a floor these regulations."
1998.96-1793,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3245.288,3257.147,"What are we supposed to do if I think, look, this is a question that cries out for agency interpretation, but the agency doesn't interpret it, so instead you have seven courts who know little about it going in 15 different directions."
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3257.147,3257.757,"Again, Your Honor..."
1998.96-1793,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3257.757,3260.529,What is the...  what is our ability to cure that problem?
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3260.529,3269.895,"Well, again Your Honor, I would urge you to look at this letter in the context, if you...  you realize that what the agency was explaining is that yes, this is an eligible school health service."
1998.96-1793,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3295.86,3299.573,Your position is clear in your brief.
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3308.79,3329.704,"Your Honor, I would point out in addition to the proposed rule-making that we cite on page 22, which I think is the unequivocal statement in those earlier letters about the psychotherapy and the optometrist, that also at the time of this proposed change in the regulation, and Congress' adoption, incorporation, codification, ratification of this regulation, the lower courts actually agreed with that bright line."
1998.96-1793,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3331.644,3332.055,No.
1998.96-1793,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3333.898,3334.566,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1998.96-1793,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3334.566,3336.629,"Ms. Seitz, you have 4 minutes remaining."
1998.96-1793,3,42088,susan_l_seitz,,3336.629,3339.511,Thank you.
1998.96-1793,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3473.428,3474.858,It doesn't mean that Congress knew what those rights were.
1998.96-1793,3,42088,susan_l_seitz,,3477.26,3483.103,"That's correct, and there were six areas, not just related services that were being proposed, amendments."
1998.96-1793,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3487.897,3495.163,"Why isn't a...  why isn't a sort of vague rule, unclear, et cetera, now interpreted, better than nothing?"
1998.96-1793,3,42088,susan_l_seitz,,3495.163,3497.484,That would be helpful.
1998.96-1793,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3517.546,3527.083,"Is there any information in the population that's covered by this statute, how many children, or what percentage would require the continuous care?"
1998.96-1793,3,42088,susan_l_seitz,,3527.083,3528.705,"Unfortunately, there really isn't."
1998.96-1793,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3545.849,3559.566,"Well, Ms. Seitz, if the fact is that if a child needs so much care that the school district thinks that it can't do it on site, it may cost the school district a lot more money to place the child in institutional care."
1998.96-1793,3,42088,susan_l_seitz,,3559.566,3564.02,"Okay, I'm glad you brought that up, because I wanted to respond to your question on that, Justice O'Connor."
1998.96-1793,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3569.744,3570.335,"Yes, surely."
1998.96-1793,3,42088,susan_l_seitz,,3570.335,3570.513,Okay.
1998.96-1793,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3581.432,3581.592,Okay.
1998.96-1793,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3581.592,3582.001,Thank you.
1998.96-1793,3,42088,susan_l_seitz,,3582.001,3582.834,Thank you.
1998.96-1793,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3582.834,3589.921,The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at ten o'clock.
