1996.96-318,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.036,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-318, Daryll Richardson and John Walker v. McKnight."
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,72.188,75.721,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-318,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,142.734,169.812,"Mr. Ray, would you put together the theory and the fact for me, because just looking at what is alleged here, what would... how would it not be clearly established that it's a violation to take someone who was over 300 pounds and put them in these tight restraints that are bound to cause extreme pain?"
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,182.131,185.763,"Justice Ginsburg, we never got to that point, and that's the issue."
1996.96-318,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,185.763,187.232,What would be the defense?
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,189.514,200.791,"Well, perhaps under Woods v. Strickland, if Mr. McKnight can establish that the acts of our officers that he alleges were not objectively reasonable, then we don't have benefit of qualified immunity."
1996.96-318,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,202.804,204.534,"Well, maybe it's an academic question, that--"
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,204.534,212.02,"--Oh, that question is not academic, in that there are literally hundreds of vexatious and frivolous lawsuits filed--"
1996.96-318,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,212.02,214.382,"--Oh, but I'm talking about in the context of this case."
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,214.382,226.399,"--In the context of this case, Mr. McKnight may well establish, if this Court should extend qualified immunity to correctional officers who are employed by private concerns, that our two officers don't have the benefit."
1996.96-318,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,226.399,232.443,The Sixth Circuit decided this case on the basis that qualified immunity wasn't available to private contractors.
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,232.443,233.652,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.96-318,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,233.652,234.423,So that's why we've got it here.
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,234.423,235.114,That's why it's here.
1996.96-318,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,237.616,242.709,"My question I asked you is, what good would qualified immunity do them if they had it?"
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,242.709,248.935,"--Well, in cases on down the road where their actions were objectively reasonable the litigation--"
1996.96-318,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,248.935,249.354,But not cases on down the road.
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,259.661,271.428,"--I would submit, Justice Ginsburg, that this case would still have to be remanded to the district court for that specific finding, that their actions were not objectively reasonable and they don't have the benefit of qualified immunity."
1996.96-318,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,271.428,286.857,"Well, you make the argument for them when you're saying, now I have the benefit of this qualified immunity defense, so, district court, they are qualified immune, and so the district court goes, tell me what wasn't clearly established in relation to these facts."
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,286.857,290.58,"Well, the specific issue before this Court is, we didn't get to that point."
1996.96-318,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,303.309,306.621,"Yes, but I'd just like you to tell me, suppose he had qualified immunity."
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,312.745,343.434,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and again, we may fail on that issue, Justice Ginsburg, but the issue before this Court and what we want decided is the fact that qualified immunity should be extended to these individuals who act under the color of State law for 1983 purposes, are subjected to suit on a day-by-day basis, and they perform traditional historical police powers that this Court has extended qualified immunity to their public counterparts in Navarette."
1996.96-318,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,355.582,362.517,The Sixth Circuit suggested that there might be another standard short of qualified immunity and said maybe good faith--
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,362.517,363.319,--The good faith defense.
1996.96-318,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,448.815,457.18,"--Mr. Ray, they do historically provide a... provide what was historically a governmental function, but have they historically had such immunity?"
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,482.468,489.203,"Justice Scalia, if I could address prison guards historically in the State of Tennessee--"
1996.96-318,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.203,497.207,"Anybody historically, even if you could come up with a medical officer who was privately contracted for who somehow was given immunity, or a private policeman."
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,504.683,520.522,"--I would submit that historically the Attorney General of the United States at one time was allowed to have a private law practice, and when acting in his official function for the Government that I'm sure that immunity would attach to him in any official acts."
1996.96-318,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.268,543.197,It's a good one.
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,543.197,554.346,"--Pierson v. Ray, this Court started out talking about a good faith immunity, which ultimately developed over the course of this Court's jurisprudence to the qualified immunity doctrine."
1996.96-318,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,615.404,616.624,What about ordinary tort law?
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,625.951,626.672,That's correct.
1996.96-318,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,627.423,637.237,"And there must be their... State officials, some kind of State law tort immunity that gives a degree of leeway to a State officer who commits the battery where he does it in good faith."
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,646.744,655.901,"The... if I may answer it this way, Justice Breyer, the public correctional officer, sovereign immunity would suffice there."
1996.96-318,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,655.901,658.054,Not a suit individually against the officer.
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,658.054,658.071,Right.
1996.96-318,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,659.683,675.613,"You sue the officer individually, there will be some kind of public-based, not immunity, but it will be a defense, and for good faith, et cetera, and I just wonder if there's any case that you've come across... it seems to me by now it should have come across somewhere... ordinary, garden variety tort law."
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,675.613,676.723,The answer to that is no.
1996.96-318,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,676.723,678.886,The answer to what is no--
1996.96-318,0,19907,charles_r_ray,,678.886,680.105,"The answer is no, there's no--"
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1441.958,1448.492,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-318,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1508.462,1521.98,"But isn't it also true that we've often said that the scope of the immunity is measured by the function being performed by the defendant in the office he held, and the function being performed by these private companies is precisely the same as a public function."
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1521.98,1529.165,"Yes, though the Court has, even in cases that post date Harlow, always looked at the historical basis."
1996.96-318,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1529.685,1534.218,"Yes, but the history is that this function is one that has been entitled to... has generated immunity."
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1534.218,1543.644,"--That is correct, Your Honor, but this function, performed by State officials subject to the constraints that normally apply to State actors, and--"
1996.96-318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1543.644,1552.28,"Mr. Vladeck, can you say for sure that immunity was never extended to nonemployees of the State?"
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1573.835,1592.566,"--The only case of this Court that addresses that issue is Tower v. Glover, which involved not a prosecutor but a public defendant, and this Court, relying both on history and public policy grounds, held that that... that person was not entitled to the immunity that was sought in that case."
1996.96-318,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1592.566,1596.92,"So if we have a lay magistrate system in this country the judges will lose their immunity, too."
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1596.92,1617.522,"Well, Your Honor, judicial immunity is a different branch of sovereign immunity than the immunity that we're speaking of here today, and that gets back to my fundamental point, which is that there is no historical antecedent for immunity at common law for nongovernmental actors, particularly in torts involving the abuse of Government power."
1996.96-318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.522,1620.304,You say for sure that... you know for sure--
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1620.304,1620.535,Well--
1996.96-318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1620.535,1626.579,"--that prosecutors at common law, private barristers who prosecuted on behalf of the Crown, had no immunity?"
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1626.579,1627.818,--I do not know that for sure.
1996.96-318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.818,1630.48,"I don't, either, but I would be surprised if they didn't."
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1630.48,1634.714,"Well, Your Honor, the only discussion of that issue I've seen in this Court's case is in Tower v. Glover."
1996.96-318,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.714,1647.903,"In fact, even in England, isn't it true that the hue and cry that was raised to chase the fleeing felon often enlisted the help of all sorts of private citizens in performing police functions in apprehending fleeing felons?"
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1647.903,1650.204,I think that is very different.
1996.96-318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1676.873,1681.665,"This is... you're not talking about 1983 cases, I take it, but just State tort law cases."
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1681.665,1684.146,"Your Honor, some are State tort law cases."
1996.96-318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1696.234,1697.456,Could have been diversity?
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1697.456,1699.038,"I suppose so, Your Honor."
1996.96-318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1699.038,1709.754,"Well, was there any question about whether, in any of those cases about... I mean, weren't they the most outrageous violations of law, that there wouldn't be any question of whether the law was clear or not?"
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1709.754,1711.264,"Well, I--"
1996.96-318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1711.264,1717.458,"I mean, you know, if the immunity question wasn't even involved in the case they're not very good authority."
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1719.802,1721.051,--Well--
1996.96-318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1721.051,1722.783,So the existence of suits doesn't prove anything.
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1722.783,1724.003,--No.
1996.96-318,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1763.55,1763.8,Sure they have.
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1785.535,1814.885,"--Well, it is true that in common law Government prison guards had immunity, or had a defense that is now called an immunity, but there were... there was quite an extensive experience with private prisons, and there is no evidence that any of those actors were ever accorded immunity either in our jurisprudence or in the English jurisprudence."
1996.96-318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1887.09,1892.193,"Well, don't they also have a very strong motive to avoid paying a lot of damages?"
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1892.193,1897.687,"Well, they have a motive to avoid paying damages if there's something in place to keep that motivation present."
1996.96-318,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1903.01,1905.622,"Well, why is it... I don't see any difference."
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1916.879,1917.921,"Well, the easiest way--"
1996.96-318,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1917.921,1920.923,--and therefore they will really hew the line.
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1941.006,1943.917,--It is for two reasons.
1996.96-318,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1943.917,1944.979,I'm not saying it is less likely.
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1945.878,1965.252,"Well, my first answer, Justice Breyer, is, if we don't know the answer to that question, then the decision should be made by Congress, not this Court, because unless it is clear that the risks of conferring qualified immunity are not substantial and will not do violence to the policies in 1983, this Court has always said we ought not to proceed."
1996.96-318,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1965.252,1966.592,Why doesn't it... look.
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,1992.337,2005.467,"Because the Court has said, in cases like Harlow, that in addition to whatever economic incentives that you're basing your question on, there are other constraints that operate on public officials that certainly are absent here."
1996.96-318,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2005.467,2005.918,Like what?
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2005.918,2008.88,"In Harlow, of course... excuse me."
1996.96-318,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2019.346,2020.287,So that's the problem.
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2023.39,2024.909,I think money is a restraint.
1996.96-318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2024.909,2031.113,What kind of public accountability do State-paid prison guards have?
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2031.113,2035.217,"Well, they are... they work in a very hierarchical, Civil Service system."
1996.96-318,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2038.269,2048.214,"There are intimations in your brief that the public employees kind of do it as a labor of love, and that may be true at some levels, but certainly not at the prison guard level."
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2048.214,2057.0,"--No, Your Honor, I agree with that, but our point is not solely that the motivations of prison guards... here, of course, they're not simply prison guards."
1996.96-318,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2066.777,2074.183,"If the head of the operation were a State official... let's take a volunteer fire department, where the fire chief is a public employee."
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2079.565,2100.82,"--I still think... I think there's a continuum along which greater State control may be an element, but as long as there's a divided loyalty problem like you have here, where the correctional officers serve two masters, not one... they serve the shareholders as well as the State... you have problems of constitutional violations."
1996.96-318,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2100.82,2101.8,"Well, I take--"
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2128.427,2135.813,"There is supervision, biennial supervision by certain of the committees of the Tennessee legislature."
1996.96-318,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2170.445,2175.998,"Well, we're stuck with the contract for the contract period, but all contracts are going to be renewed at some point."
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2175.998,2185.725,"That is correct, and there is some oversight, but that is very different than the day-to-day public accountability that we presume constrains the activities of our public officials."
1996.96-318,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2187.495,2199.393,"Well, I take it the Solicitor General doesn't quite take your approach here, because as I read the brief, would advocate that qualified immunity be recognized for some private contractors."
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2199.393,2212.183,"--I think that is correct, Justice O'Connor, but to the extent that a clear line could be discerned in the Government's brief, I think they point to the same two factors that we do."
1996.96-318,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2244.604,2261.975,"Well, does your argument, then, across the board depend on the proposition that making money for shareholders or losing money, or the threat of losing money, is a less powerful motivating factor to keep people behaving properly than responsibility to voters, or general considerations of patriotism?"
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2265.497,2269.27,"Well, Your Honor, in part I'm relying on what this Court has said in its prior immunity cases."
1996.96-318,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2271.41,2275.114,But is that a necessary proposition?
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2278.404,2289.854,"Well, I think if you look at the economic incentives, the provision of qualified immunity is the wrong way to go about enforcing compliance with the civil rights laws."
1996.96-318,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2304.364,2312.307,"Well, it still costs money to come all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court and fight some issue on qualified immunity."
1996.96-318,1,21650,david_c_vladeck,,2332.381,2336.264,"--Well, that... that may be so, Justice O'Connor--"
1996.96-318,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2572.459,2583.746,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-318,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2661.387,2663.788,Do we know that that isn't one of those situations?
1996.96-318,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2692.736,2707.636,"I think there are really two questions, and that is whether the private corporation would be able to attract employees to serve as their guards, but then beyond that the question would be whether the State could accomplish the function of housing prisoners if that weren't so."
1996.96-318,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2721.166,2740.869,"--If that's true, then... you're not going to know the answer to this either, I bet, because I bet there is no answer, but try it, but my impression, the qualified immunity thing, it's a creation by this Court interpreting a statute that rests upon common law tort law, and the kinds of immunity that under common law tort law went with public officials."
1996.96-318,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2771.889,2778.793,"No, my understanding is that that is, that that distinction does exist in tort law."
1996.96-318,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2778.793,2779.053,All right.
1996.96-318,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2779.734,2790.21,"For Government officials... and this is really the issue in this Court's decision in Westfall, which dealt with the qualified immunity of Federal employees from State common law torts."
1996.96-318,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2808.132,2809.614,"No, but now what happens when... exactly right--"
1996.96-318,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2809.614,2810.623,--for private persons.
1996.96-318,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2871.594,2873.094,"--Mr. Kneedler, you've confused me now."
1996.96-318,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2883.412,2884.441,--Right.
1996.96-318,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2884.441,2889.186,Now you're just... I thought you're just saying now that there aren't any instances.
1996.96-318,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2889.186,2889.726,"No, no."
1996.96-318,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2899.682,2900.924,"We're talking about qualified immunity here, though."
1996.96-318,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2902.183,2917.995,"--No, but I think that there is some parallel as Justice Breyer was suggesting in the tort law to support a distinction between people who are public employees and people who are employees of private corporations, but even under contracts, I do want to make one important point."
1996.96-318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2992.023,2995.516,"--When you say political accountability you mean the electorate, I suppose."
1996.96-318,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2995.516,3002.74,"--The electorate and public attention, public scrutiny on the acts of public officials."
1996.96-318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3004.06,3016.65,"Well, does that... do you think there would be less, say, media attention on a prison riot if the... if prison officials and the workers were contract prisoners than if they were Government employees?"
1996.96-318,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3016.65,3026.765,"--No, there wouldn't be less media attention, but I believe it may be that the public would hold the public warden or correctional superintendent more directly responsible for what happened, and perhaps properly so."
1996.96-318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3026.765,3027.707,Why on earth would that be?
1996.96-318,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3027.707,3038.763,"Because the direct supervision of the guards on a day-to-day basis, anyway, is not the responsibility of the head of the correctional department."
1996.96-318,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3061.957,3063.8,"Well, you'd better be very careful in picking the contractor."
1996.96-318,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3075.138,3075.308,--Right.
1996.96-318,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3147.764,3148.795,"--Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1996.96-318,3,19907,charles_r_ray,,3151.267,3152.028,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1996.96-318,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3178.074,3186.61,"Mr. Ray, it wasn't quite that way, because they said the person who is helping out in the U.S. Marshalls Service, they have to get temporary people in the Marshalls Service."
1996.96-318,3,19907,charles_r_ray,,3190.343,3202.031,"--Well, again I would submit that if we're going to have qualified immunity for these types of people, the people who utilize the most discretion on a day-to-day basis and need it the most are correctional officials."
1996.96-318,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3202.031,3203.063,Let me ask you this.
1996.96-318,3,19907,charles_r_ray,,3247.24,3248.321,No question about it.
1996.96-318,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3248.321,3274.669,"And if we're going into this different world when people have insurance, like the private companies all must under contract, then that defendant is somewhat less in need of that protection, and that... though no one's made this, so maybe there's some obvious answer to this, but the... if they don't need the protection because we're now in a new world, does that sort of hurt the whole idea of qualified immunity, at least as applied to a field where they have to have insurance?"
1996.96-318,3,19907,charles_r_ray,,3274.669,3281.392,In the case that was argued yesterday it was quite apparent that insurance played a great role in that particular case.
1996.96-318,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3330.955,3332.777,"Well, I don't know if that's the ultimate goal."
1996.96-318,3,19907,charles_r_ray,,3344.814,3346.945,"No, Mr. Justice Stevens, that's not our policy at all."
1996.96-318,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3346.945,3349.106,You don't need the defense unless there's a constitutional violation.
1996.96-318,3,19907,charles_r_ray,,3349.106,3357.882,"Well, if our actions were objectively reasonable under the standard established by this Court, then qualified immunity attaches to it."
1996.96-318,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3357.882,3361.986,Qualified immunity attaches even though there was a constitutional violation.
1996.96-318,3,19907,charles_r_ray,,3361.986,3378.525,"But again, as I understand it, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Walker did not know or should not have known about their constitutional deprivation of Mr. McKnight's rights in order for them to have the benefit."
1996.96-318,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3381.848,3386.202,"I thought you said that was just down the road, when we opened this discussion."
1996.96-318,3,19907,charles_r_ray,,3386.202,3387.792,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.96-318,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3427.939,3433.082,"The contract says that in so many words, don't violate the constitutional rights of any prisoners, or just... it says that?"
1996.96-318,3,19907,charles_r_ray,,3433.082,3434.864,"That's one of the provisions, Your Honor."
1996.96-318,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3434.864,3440.148,So that you could be declared in violation of your contract during its term.
1996.96-318,3,19907,charles_r_ray,,3442.398,3443.26,That's correct.
1996.96-318,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3449.585,3451.715,Is that clause subject to the qualified immunity defense?
1996.96-318,3,19907,charles_r_ray,,3461.64,3469.397,"I'm assuming... I've been known to put myself in such a box at 2:00 a.m. in the morning when I come in, Mr. Justice Scalia, but--"
1996.96-318,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3469.397,3470.688,"Thank you, Mr. Ray."
