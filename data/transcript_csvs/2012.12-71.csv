2012.12-71,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.82,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-71, Arizona v. the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,8.856,13.308,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,75.648,82.385,If I see the purpose of the NVRA to simplify registration--
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,82.385,83.754,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,83.754,89.224,--how is Arizona's provisions consistent with that objective and purpose--
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,89.224,90.458,Your Honor--
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,90.458,98.997,--given that some of the amici explain that many people don't have the documents that Arizona requires?
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,98.997,100.014,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,107.519,111.137,"Well, but why does one take precedence over another?"
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,111.137,114.523,"--I would say, Your Honor, that neither takes precedence over the other."
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,117.075,124.397,"So if something you do conflicts with one of those purposes, why isn't it preempted by the Federal law?"
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,124.397,136.039,"--Your Honor, I think the question is, if you take the two purposes together, does -- does the Proposition 200 strongly fulfill one and have a minimal burden on the other?"
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,149.112,161.504,"Why would you think that Congress, in doing the short form registration, didn't consider the issue of fraud, and decide that it had arrived at the balance it wanted?"
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,161.504,167.158,"Because, Your Honor, the -- the Congress did not specify what the States could or could not do."
2012.12-71,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,167.158,172.978,But it did -- but Congress did specify how citizenship was to be handled.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,241.039,241.889,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,289.789,300.061,"But, General Horne, wouldn't it contradict it if instead of saying well, we'd like you to offer identification, saying, well, we'd like you also to have a paper ticket."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,300.061,301.894,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,302.394,306.631,"That would be inconsistent with the accept and use language, isn't that right?"
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,306.631,307.115,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,320.724,327.628,"Well, you have done something to the Federal form, and that essentially creates a new set of requirements and a new form."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,327.628,331.33,"--Your Honor, we -- we accept and use the Federal form."
2012.12-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,345.09,352.077,"Do you -- do you think that you could have said, you know, we have our own State form which we're allowed to have under the statute."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,359.183,364.567,"I think not, Your Honor, because I think that would have been contrary to the purposes and objectives of the Act."
2012.12-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,367.853,368.955,"Well, how do we draw the line?"
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,377.727,384.631,--Because the statute contemplates that it -- that it is the burden of the States to determine the eligibility of the voters.
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.754,400.158,So that form should have included the eligibility requirements that your State demands.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,438.683,446.121,"Your Honor, under Section 6(a)(1) of the statute, the burden of determining whether the citizen is eligible rests with the State."
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.155,447.657,Sure.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,447.657,449.807,--The form belongs to the EAC.
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.654,487.365,"Well, you're -- you're simply denying then that the Federal Government can, so long as it protects the requirements that your State imposes, you're -- you're saying the Federal Government cannot prescribe a single form for -- for voter registration."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,487.365,493.269,"Your Honor, the Federal Government can prescribe the form, but the form is not exclusive."
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,496.054,497.038,Why -- why can't it make it exclusive?
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,504.16,504.71,--Accept and use.
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,504.71,508.612,--suppose -- suppose I think that that does mean that it's supposed to be exclusive.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,524.222,530.644,"Well, Your Honor, the -- the form is -- cannot be exclusive."
2012.12-71,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,548.523,556.01,"General Horne, there -- there are a whole list of State-specific requirements that get appended to the form."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,574.84,577.625,"--We did, Your Honor, and the Commission itself took no action."
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,590.366,591.8,And you did nothing more about that?
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,591.8,592.302,"Yes, sir."
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,592.302,598.956,You -- you didn't go to court to say you have to include this as one of the State-specific requirements.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,599.456,603.741,"Your Honor, that -- that was under a predecessor of mine, so I don't know the reason."
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,603.741,604.36,Oh.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,607.644,611.929,"I'm -- I'm not sure I would be competent to answer for him, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,624.537,634.645,"I have a -- I have a hugely great difficulty, which is, the NVRA says that people can mail in this form."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,634.645,635.129,--Yes.
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,635.129,648.804,"I don't know how your rejection of the mail-in, how you're accepting and using it when you're refusing to register someone when they do exactly what the Federal law permits them to do: Mail it in."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,661.546,662.462,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,702.939,708.677,"Could you also ask for an address, for proof of the address or proof of date of birth?"
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,708.677,712.979,"If that were consistent with the purposes and objectives of the Act we could, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,718.533,724.103,"But then again, it seems to me the Federal form, as some of my colleagues have indicated, is not worth very much."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,724.103,731.625,"--Your Honor, the Federal form sets forth certain minimum requirements that -- that have to be met."
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.677,796.568,"How could you establish citizenship without having something mailed in, in addition to the form?"
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,823.218,827.687,"Well, some States require the Social Security number--"
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,827.687,828.204,Okay.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,828.204,831.056,--which is not -- which is not provided for in the statute.
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,831.056,831.824,Right.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,831.824,833.391,But the -- but it's not prohibited.
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,867.464,874.318,"Yes, that's the kind of thing you should have had and that your predecessor should have asked for to be included in the Federal form."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,874.318,876.37,"--Your Honor, the Federal form is not exclusive."
2012.12-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,876.37,885.459,"But -- but, General, doesn't the -- the statute make the EAC the decisionmaker with respect to what can be added to the Federal form?"
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,908.741,909.891,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,917.764,920.216,"Well, I don't think they're driving the bus as to the form."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,954.203,956.055,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,957.605,958.341,Now--
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,958.341,966.245,"--The -- the duty of the States, Your Honor, to determine whether or not a voter is eligible, that is a duty that rests with the State, not with the EAC."
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,966.245,966.845,--That's true.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,966.845,967.947,The EAC can only--
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,967.947,971.149,But the form has to enable the State to do that.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1003.37,1004.703,"--That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1004.703,1013.159,So I think you should -- you should have challenged the commission's refusal to -- to place that evidence in the Federal form.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1013.159,1028.002,"Your Honor, the Federal form is -- is a tool that we have to use to determine the eligibility of the voter, but the ultimate responsibility under -- under Section 6(a)(1) of -- of this very Act is with the States to determine the eligibility of the voter."
2012.12-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1073.198,1075.232,I'm a little bit confused.
2012.12-71,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1075.232,1083.386,"Well, I take it -- I take it that -- that counsel on -- on -- on the other side will disagree with that and they say, well, this is -- this is the line to be drawn."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1101.181,1113.941,"Your Honor, there -- there is nothing in the statute to draw a distinction between our having other extrinsic evidence, which they agree we can use outside of the form and our asking people to say, write down--"
2012.12-71,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1113.941,1117.309,Other than the statutory words that authorize the use of the form.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1117.309,1119.778,"--Yes, but -- but they don't make the form exclusive."
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1136.938,1140.925,Some of us have -- do believe in legislative history.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1142.375,1143.044,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1143.044,1143.627,All right.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1190.941,1191.758,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1191.758,1193.227,How do you get around that?
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1193.227,1199.796,"Your Honor, if the -- if the legislative history were consistent, I would -- I would say that was an argument that could be made."
2012.12-71,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.3,1260.519,"Gee, if I believed -- if I believed in legislative history, I would find that very persuasive."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1262.804,1264.323,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1264.323,1265.256,Could I ask a different -- can I ask--
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1266.606,1281.415,"Could I just add one quick point, and that is that the sponsor of the bill was opposed to that amendment in conference committee, saying it wasn't necessary, that the States could already verify applicants under the existing law as it was written before that amendment."
2012.12-71,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1281.415,1291.99,"There's probably a perfectly good answer to this, but I -- I notice that in this Federal law in 7(b), it says what the registration form shall contain."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1291.99,1292.49,Yes.
2012.12-71,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1292.49,1302.012,"Now, there are four subsections and only one of those refers to a particular thing, and that is, identifying information."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1310.018,1310.702,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1310.702,1311.97,And under perjury.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1311.97,1312.47,Yes.
2012.12-71,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1312.47,1313.12,It says that.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1328.496,1330.681,"Yes, those are very unusual."
2012.12-71,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1332.883,1333.283,"Yes, okay."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1334.25,1335.252,"Okay, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1335.252,1338.371,I'm saying given these five or six specific things--
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1338.371,1339.054,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1339.054,1340.554,--that show you're a citizen--
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1340.554,1341.156,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1341.156,1348.393,--what use does Arizona make of that attestation under perjury?
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1348.393,1353.547,"Well, there have been -- actually, there have been prosecutions for perjury, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1358.7,1360.4,I didn't say it wasn't.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1374.977,1377.912,"--Well, Your Honor, we are making use of it and I just mentioned--"
2012.12-71,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1377.912,1380.448,"Well, I know -- I'm sure you are and then my question is how?"
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1380.448,1387.535,--By prosecuting -- there have been ten prosecutions in one year alone of people who swore falsely.
2012.12-71,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1393.089,1393.672,By?
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1393.672,1411.669,"But that -- but that is not a -- that is not a sufficient use or that is not a sufficient measure of determining eligibility, because literally hundreds have been caught swearing jury -- jury commissioner forms swearing they are not citizens after they had already registered to vote."
2012.12-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1449.942,1452.744,"General, could I take you back to this distinction that you're making."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1462.018,1462.518,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1462.518,1468.756,So how do -- what's the difference between requiring additional information and requiring an additional form?
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1475.51,1477.445,"No, Your Honor, it's not a form."
2012.12-71,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1526.192,1537.233,"Well, what is the -- what would be the purpose of requiring a Federal form if you could just say, and in addition to that, you have to give ten more items of information?"
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1540.685,1542.137,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1647.738,1648.321,General--
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1648.321,1650.173,"--Could I reserve time for rebuttal, Your Honor?"
2012.12-71,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1650.173,1650.657,Yes.
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1650.657,1651.723,--I'm still having a problem.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1651.723,1652.292,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1652.292,1658.512,Both the Federal law and the State law require an individual to be a citizen.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1658.512,1659.045,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1659.045,1660.88,That's the basic qualification.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1660.88,1661.38,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1661.38,1663.13,Both agree that that's essential.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1663.13,1663.749,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1663.749,1674.522,How do you fit in the question of what documents you use to prove that with establishing the qualification?
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1681.378,1681.911,Yes.
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1681.911,1688.032,So there's -- that qualification has been set by Arizona and the Federal system.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1688.032,1702.707,"The qualification has, but our -- our objection to the Ninth Circuit decision preempting Proposition 200 is that it leaves us unable to enforce our qualification requirement, which under the Constitution clearly is a State function."
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1702.707,1712.08,"Counsel, you have proof, there are people that you have rejected even without these forms?"
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1712.08,1713.497,"It's extremely inadequate, Your Honor."
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1716.365,1721.086,"Well, that's what the Federal system decided was enough."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1721.086,1726.59,"That's what they decided as a minimum in the Federal form, but they did not say that we could not ask for additional information."
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1731.811,1734.461,"Well, you admit that it doesn't let you add things."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1736.113,1742.766,"We have to accept and use the form and we can't change the form, but we can ask for additional evidence to perform our function of determining that citizens--"
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1742.766,1744.201,I go back to Justice Kagan.
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1747.486,1747.953,--Yes.
2012.12-71,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1747.953,1756.259,"--this list of things says you have to append to the form other items: A copy of your birth certificate, a copy of your naturalization certificate."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1759.211,1762.58,"Your Honor, incidentally, there have been references to a postcard."
2012.12-71,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1786.795,1787.278,"Yes, you may."
2012.12-71,0,42779,thomas_c_horne,,1787.278,1787.813,Thank you.
2012.12-71,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1787.813,1794.717,Ms. Millett?
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1794.717,1797.336,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1828.788,1833.442,"And enclosing your driver's license number is that immense barrier, right?"
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1833.442,1834.059,First--
2012.12-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.059,1837.711,That's what's keeping 40 percent of eligible voters away?
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1837.711,1849.988,"--First of all, with -- with respect to the driver's license, it's only driver's licenses issued after 1996, October 1996, and those that were not -- that someone did not obtain when they became naturalized."
2012.12-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1860.677,1868.865,"I still think that's a relatively few number, and -- and if you don't have the driver's license, then you can use your naturalization certificate."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1868.865,1877.788,"Mr. Gonzalez did that as well and the naturalization certificate got bounced because the naturalization certificate, when put into the computer, does not produce records."
2012.12-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1881.123,1887.394,"Well, you can say that about any certification procedure that, now and then there will be a mistake."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1900.92,1911.628,"--Joint appendix page 263, the district court found that 31,550 people were rejected from voting because of Proposition 200."
2012.12-71,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1930.756,1931.34,The statute--
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1931.34,1932.375,--of the United States.
2012.12-71,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1932.375,1937.51,--The statute says that Arizona must accept and use the Federal form.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1963.561,1976.469,"We interpret “ accept and use ”, it's mainly the latter, your second one, and that is that it is a limitation on what can be asked of the individual and that's not just from the Section 4 language where accept and use comes from."
2012.12-71,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2016.529,2017.898,"Well, let me give you this example--"
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2017.898,2019.331,--as the registration form.
2012.12-71,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2019.331,2028.186,--A person rides up to a place to register on a bicycle and gets out and hands in the Federal form.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2049.5,2063.942,"They may not require anything else from the applicant but they can certainly apply their own evidence that they obtain, whether it's from their own eyeballs or whether it is through records or databases that they run these through which is the more common one, and make a decision."
2012.12-71,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2068.496,2076.15,"His point is, he keeps making the point, your colleague, and he says, no, that isn't what it says."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2130.571,2136.475,My answer is when you look at 26H it's talking about the form.
2012.12-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.462,2144.645,Is that conclusive or can that be challenged?
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2144.645,2146.996,--It can certainly be challenged under the Administrative Procedure Act.
2012.12-71,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2162.875,2163.892,On the form.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2163.892,2164.525,"--On the form, exactly."
2012.12-71,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2172.664,2176.766,But his problem is how do you get to that conclusion?
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2208.654,2214.308,"--The Commission, let me just -- if we turn to 26H at the very top line--"
2012.12-71,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2214.308,2215.175,26H.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2215.175,2219.795,"--26H, where it has a number 1, let's insert the Commission before I get to the word “ may ”."
2012.12-71,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2230.167,2230.869,Yes.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2230.869,2236.423,That's all the Commission is allowed to require from the applicant.
2012.12-71,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2236.423,2236.956,Correct.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2236.956,2240.542,And then the burden shifts to the State to do it.
2012.12-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2254.218,2256.202,"Excuse me, they may require it."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2273.996,2276.465,--I don't think that's a fair reading of what Congress would have assigned to them.
2012.12-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.131,2278.417,May means may.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2278.417,2281.385,--that's something to be challenged through the Administrative Procedure Act--
2012.12-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2281.385,2290.475,"No, no, no, we're talking about -- right now we are talking about the consequences of that language, not -- and the consequence of the may is may."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2312.988,2318.558,"--The relevant phraseology is may require only, and that is not your normal permissive language."
2012.12-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2332.385,2334.754,It says what you only may require.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2338.139,2340.741,--But you may require what is necessary to enable.
2012.12-71,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2351.363,2364.439,"Where you're going is this, as I heard you before: It is true that there is no specific language saying the State can't do this, can't add things."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2419.526,2434.469,"I would just like to add to that, Justice Breyer, two points, and that is with respect to citizenship in particular, not only does the statute, the NVRA flag it, but the Help America Vote Act in 2002."
2012.12-71,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2454.347,2455.533,"Ms. Millett, I want to give up--"
2012.12-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2455.533,2462.437,"Ms. Millett, is there -- I take it under your theory what the EAC allowed Louisiana to do was wrong."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2462.437,2464.389,It's unclear.
2012.12-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2470.959,2471.625,"Yes, I know."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2473.41,2473.877,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2012.12-71,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2501.645,2502.264,And those are--
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2502.264,2502.947,But I think it's--
2012.12-71,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2502.947,2503.764,--What are they?
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2503.764,2504.597,--That is the--
2012.12-71,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2504.597,2514.071,"What are the additional -- the question here is, is proof of citizenship an additional thing the State can ask."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2516.939,2518.656,"--No, it's not proof of citizenship."
2012.12-71,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2526.129,2529.164,Can you -- can you explain -- it's puzzling.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2551.845,2552.529,Okay.
2012.12-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.943,2602.31,Is all that stuff required by the Vote America Act?
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2603.645,2604.195,"--No, no--"
2012.12-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2604.195,2605.914,Just the first thing you mentioned for us.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2605.914,2606.864,--Just the identification number.
2012.12-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.864,2608.366,And the rest is -- is what?
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2608.366,2613.751,"Well, there's two -- those are things that are in the State -- when you look at those State-specific instructions, they are not add-ons."
2012.12-71,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2615.77,2621.591,"Ms. Millett, I mean, suppose it were true that the EAC has been inconsistent in this respect."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2623.543,2626.345,That would be a very different lawsuit that was never brought in this case.
2012.12-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2629.03,2643.087,"You've got a great deal of reliance on what the EAC has done, and I'm saying if it's not doing a very good job, I'd be -- I'd question whether or not the fact that the EAC is going to implement it is sufficient assurance that the Act reads the way you say it does."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2643.087,2650.276,"--But the Act, I think, by -- by its own plain language and by its normal -- it can't have no -- there is only two ways to look at this statute."
2012.12-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2670.69,2672.407,Not anything else that they want.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2701.293,2702.995,This is -- statements--
2012.12-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2702.995,2703.861,This is not proof at all.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2703.861,2707.697,"--Statements under oath, statements under oath in a criminal case--"
2012.12-71,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2707.697,2708.899,Under oath is not proof at all.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2710.015,2715.218,--Statements under oath in a criminal case are proof beyond a reasonable doubt by which we execute them.
2012.12-71,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2715.218,2716.352,What do you make of the fact that--
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2716.352,2718.337,It's a very serious oath -- I'm sorry.
2012.12-71,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2718.337,2720.872,--I didn't mean to interrupt your sentence.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2761.514,2762.866,"Well, there is two responses."
2012.12-71,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2771.222,2773.422,What statutory provision would you challenge that under?
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2787.832,2790.017,--I think -- I think it's actually a very complicated question.
2012.12-71,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2821.822,2823.94,"Well, I've read all those provisions and -- all right."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2830.011,2830.594,--Correct.
2012.12-71,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2830.594,2832.478,This seems to me like a crazy system.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2846.037,2848.055,"No, not -- not in this sense."
2012.12-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2878.591,2879.808,It's not just different forms.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2883.145,2883.595,--No.
2012.12-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2883.595,2883.878,No?
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2883.878,2884.378,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2012.12-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2884.378,2892.501,"I would have thought since you allow -- contemplate a State form that has different requirements than the Federal form, you would then end up with two different voter rolls."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2892.501,2893.118,No--
2012.12-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2893.118,2896.62,"Some people that registered under the State form, some people that registered under the Federal form."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2896.62,2900.524,"--As -- as of now, Arizona is doing it as a unitary system."
2012.12-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2905.242,2906.109,"Yeah, but it doesn't work the other way."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2906.109,2906.678,It doesn't work the other way.
2012.12-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2906.678,2912.582,"You can satisfy the Federal form, so you're on the Federal list, but not satisfy the State form, so you're not on the State list."
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2912.582,2914.398,It doesn't work the other way at least for State elections.
2012.12-71,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2932.293,2943.517,The Court of Appeals said that there's a different preemption test under -- for this law under this Constitutional provision than there is under the Supremacy Clause.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2965.882,2969.501,"Well, first of all, the Ninth Circuit's test came out of this Court's language in Siebold."
2012.12-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2999.287,2999.67,Please.
2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2999.67,3013.797,"It -- it has no reserve power that's being protected there, and by the very nature of the Election Clause is that Congress only acts when it means to displace or change what the States are doing."

2012.12-71,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3028.19,3028.69,Thank you.
2012.12-71,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3028.69,3045.066,Mr. Srinivasan?
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3045.066,3048.12,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it Please the Court:"
2012.12-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3113.979,3140.13,"Mr. Srinivasan, the problem that I have with that is that the provision you're alluding to says that -- not that the State shall -- not that the commission “ shall ” require the information necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess eligibility, but it simply says that it “ may ” require only that information."
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3160.794,3164.578,"I don't think it is, Justice Scalia, but I think the problem with that is in the premise."
2012.12-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3175.719,3178.921,You think “ may require only ” means shall require only?
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3184.409,3191.979,"--It “ may require only ” in effect means shall require information that's necessary, but may only require that information."
2012.12-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3207.774,3210.29,It would not be a problem if the State could require it.
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3220.365,3229.938,"--But I think the whole point of this, Justice Scalia -- and this is where I started, with all due respect -- is to come forward with a Federal form that streamlines the process of registration for applicants."
2012.12-71,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3244.13,3249.101,And that's the grand -- to go back to your -- I see that as your grand purpose.

2012.12-71,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3292.361,3298.748,And it's the word “ necessary ” that you thought -- that that would be dependent upon?
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3298.748,3309.14,"Coupled with the statutory objective, because what this provision says is that the EAC, in consultation with the States, is supposed to create a form that imposes the following burden on individuals, on individuals."
2012.12-71,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3309.656,3315.71,"Well, I know I'm not -- I'm just not quite -- the last step of what I wanted you to think of was this--"
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3315.71,3316.227,Sure.
2012.12-71,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3316.227,3318.262,--It does say “ may require only ”--
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3318.262,3318.729,Correct.
2012.12-71,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3318.729,3320.281,--“ that which is necessary ”.
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3341.777,3368.511,"I do think that that's what Congress contemplated was necessary, but not to the exclusion of this, which is that if a State comes forward to the EAC, which is a body that's charged with responsibility for defining the contents of the Federal form, and says we think something more is necessary, take a look at what we want to submit to you, and you should amend the Federal form, or you should at least amend our State-specific portion of the Federal form to include this requirement in it, the EAC could make that determination."
2012.12-71,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3370.046,3380.336,"Mr. Srinivasan, I think General Horne told us that -- that the State did ask the Commission, but the Commission had only two members; the Commission didn't act on it."
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3388.592,3400.733,"--No, Justice Ginsburg, to be clear, I don't -- I don't think General Horne would disagree with this -- the executive director initially responded to the request by rejecting it, but it did go to the full Commission, and at that point, there was a fully-constituted Commission."
2012.12-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3414.057,3415.409,Yes.
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3434.637,3435.406,"--Well, that--"
2012.12-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3435.406,3438.791,And the district court here certainly thought that was necessary.
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3448.963,3450.932,"--I mean, obviously, I'd respectfully disagree with that."
2012.12-71,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3470.412,3472.096,As -- as Louisiana has done.
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3472.096,3476.9,"Well, Louisiana is not -- is not situation-specific here, Your Honor, as Ms. Millett was pointing out--"
2012.12-71,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3476.9,3479.352,But it's certainly things that were not required in the Federal form.
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3479.352,3480.085,--That's correct.
2012.12-71,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3484.354,3488.957,How is that consistent with the statutory purpose to streamline registration?
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3488.957,3495.694,"Because the statute -- the statute seeks to streamline registration, but it's not directed to the exclusion of all other objectives."
2012.12-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3517.977,3520.227,You got to stop saying the Commission approved of it.
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3525.047,3527.349,"Well, I think we are talking about two different things, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-71,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3530.717,3531.434,I'm sorry.
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3531.434,3533.236,I was trying to answer the Chief Justice's question.
2012.12-71,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3608.801,3611.586,May I ask you a question that I asked Ms. Millett?
2012.12-71,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3627.198,3639.089,"Here is the sense it would make -- even if -- if Arizona had the authority to add to the Federal requirements on its own State form, the sense it would make is this: That the Federal form always operates as a form."
2012.12-71,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3667.672,3668.858,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-71,3,42779,thomas_c_horne,,3670.274,3674.762,"Thank you, Your Honor, and I'll apologize in advance for talking really quickly."
2012.12-71,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3832.847,3833.23,"Thank you, counsel."
