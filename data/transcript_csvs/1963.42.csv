1963.42,0,20824,david_ferber,,24.935,29.835,"Mr. Chief Justice, Court please?"
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2011.563,2015.573,"Mr. Justice Warren, Justices of the Court."
1963.42,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2186.203,2192.807,"Well, isn't real problem (Inaudible)"
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2192.807,2220.032,"Well Justice Goldberg it would seem to me that where a man studies, and these are the facts of this case, where he studies his stock and decides to ride on it because he buys some shares, it does not change his -- make him interested instead of disinterested."
1963.42,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2225.544,2236.425,(Inaudible)
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2236.425,2249.517,I think that's true and I do not think that because he buys a share and follows his own advice that he alters his disinterestedness because the --
1963.42,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2249.517,2259.183,(Inaudible)
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2259.183,2260.558,Do I say nominal?
1963.42,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2260.558,2261.283,Dominant.
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2261.283,2262.999,"Dominant position, no."
1963.42,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2306.602,2311.696,(Inaudible)
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2311.696,2314.486,"Well, I would think not Your Honor."
1963.42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2348.901,2365.57,"(Inaudible) this case to assume that he does have this intent, are you attacking the findings here that there was an attempt to sell as many times?"
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2365.57,2370.707,"I don't think there is any such finding Your Honor, I think those are facts, that what happened that he did."
1963.42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2370.707,2389.05,"All right let's assume that there is intent to sell at an early time and without any questions, if he buys them, plans to sell at an early date, let's accept that for the moment, do you think that is a matter that should be explored?"
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2389.05,2392.627,"No, I would not think so."
1963.42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.667,2437.39,"You don't think the facts that they are going to be early selling operations in the recommended stock, in matter especially by the one advising (Inaudible), would be a subsequent (Inaudible)?"
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2437.39,2442.927,"It would -- in the facts of this case, it would have done no harm."
1963.42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.17,2444.543,Then they might not have harmed.
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2444.543,2448.511,"It was -- then they would, they would have been harmed by not buying."
1963.42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.11,2547.69,As a matter of fact it might have an effect of market I suppose to a fellow who recommended the stock and --
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2547.69,2548.782,Your Honor these --
1963.42,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.782,2550.99,-- starts selling what he owns?
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2550.99,2567.329,"Your Honor the shares, these involve -- millions of shares there was only one instance where you have less than a million shares out that was Hart, Schaffner & Marx where they was an issue of some 800,000 shares."
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2679.479,2690.841,"Mr. Fennelly before you sit down, is there any indication in this case what if any other securities the respondent was buying or selling during this period?"
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2690.841,2708.822,"No, Your Honor there is a 11-month period set out in the complaint and they have alleged that in six instances both went out every month and that is all that is in the complaint and moving papers."
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2708.822,2723.835,"But this is man, this Capital Gains Research Bureau Incorporated was the -- obviously in the business of, as an investment advisor, it was wholly owned by Mr. Schwarzmann I guess, or wholly owned --"
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2723.835,2725.024,It was wholly owned.
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2725.024,2752.844,"Mr. Schwarzmann also an investor on his own behalf in another, in other words I think it's possible, it occurs to me that we might have one case if these were the only securities he bought and sold and perhaps conceivably quite a different case if he brought and sold a 100 others during over this period of a year which, that the securities which could did figure in any of his investment advice."
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2756.448,2768.003,Yes the affidavit alleges that on certain instances wholly apart in bulletin he had purchased and sold some of the same stock.
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2770.715,2773.942,Then shall what -- how many other stocks he bought or sold?
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2773.942,2775.821,"No, no it doesn't do that."
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2791.151,2792.586,There is some mentioned in the brief --
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2792.586,2794.139,Prior to that term.
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2794.139,2806.396,"That other, other investment advisory services were also recommending some or all of these securities in the same period, are those facts developed or just --"
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2806.396,2811.449,They are developed slightly in our papers.
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2832.357,2839.362,"That, that recommendation, recommendation had been made before the respondent purchased Union Pacific?"
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2839.362,2842.146,"Yes, Your Honor it was 10 days before --"
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2842.146,2844.069,The purchase.
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2844.069,2849.512,That was 10 days before Capital Gain issued its bulletin recommending it.
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2849.512,2853.584,"And did Capital, and was that one of those which was purchased and later sold?"
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2853.584,2853.91,"Yes, yes."
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2853.91,2854.522,By Capital Gains?
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2854.522,2855.061,Yes.
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2855.061,2862.162,Well when did the purchase come with reference to the other advisory services' recommendation?
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2862.162,2864.515,I would say five days.
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2879.258,2905.448,"So assuming that there is a short-term immediate rise in a security after a large advisory service recommended that rise presumably would have already occurred at the time that the respondent bought -- that rise is attributable to the other advisory services recommendation would have already occurred at the time the respondent bought Union Pacific is that right, that's your point?"
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2905.448,2939.856,"Well my view, I am certain that I understand your question, my view is that that if his advice was correct that the market should raise, I mean over a period of time, I mean not necessarily today, now the record show that Union Pacific did raise, maybe pointed to him and gradually went up, so that ultimately what he had recommended to his people was completely correct."
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2939.856,2945.87,This service did not purport to advise before when to sell I suppose did it or not?
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2945.87,2964.833,"No, there is nothing in the record on here as to these stocks in the moving papers, this happened in a short period of time in a complaint application for injunction our answering papers, so there is nothing in the record about that whatsoever."
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2964.833,2971.257,"But basically it was a, it was a service covering a recommend purchases for long-term appreciation?"
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2971.257,2972.229,That's right.
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2972.229,2981.596,"And it didn't, didn't make sell recommendations, the acceptance of (Inaudible) comparing one purchase with another purchase."
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,2981.596,2989.326,There is nothing in this record whatsoever about any selling recommendation.
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2999.734,3020.381,"Let me ask you this from a tax point of view, would it have made any difference to this respondent, whether he held a security from six months or longer or less than six months would he have been taxed, would this not -- any profits on this have been taxable and is ordinary income in any event or doesn't that show in the record?"
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,3020.381,3021.452,It does not show in the record.
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3024.859,3036.268,"So to him it was a kind of him own point of view of -- his own tax consequences as the taxpayers, it didn't make any difference whether he is on the security for six months or longer, for less than six months."
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,3036.268,3059.988,"Well as to him personally I would think not, perhaps the corporation although it is -- I don't think I should be so certain about that, because the business of Capital Gains actually is an advisory service and this was incidental business to it and the Bureau could well hold -- it would not in the course of their business and therefore tax --"
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3059.988,3061.912,Well I don't ask you to make a confession.
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,3071.783,3072.094,There is no evidence.
1963.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3072.094,3073.62,"-- or any of that sort in the record, alright."
1963.42,1,34441,leo_c_fennelly,,3073.62,3078.965,No evidence on that.
