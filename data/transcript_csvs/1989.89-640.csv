1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.07,"We will hear argument now in 89-460, Manuel Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation."
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,10.272,12.224,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-640,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,84.254,89.224,"But she also claimed about lack of access to information, didn't she?"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,89.224,96.862,"That claim was in the Greenwalt declaration, one of the other of the three original affidavits that were submitted by Respondent."
1989.89-640,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,103.567,105.383,"Well, it's in your case?"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,105.383,106.352,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-640,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,119.993,122.462,But the court of appeals thought otherwise?
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,122.462,126.933,"With respect, Your Honor, no, it did not reach the Greenwalt declaration."
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,271.475,284.099,"Mr. Roberts, does the term South Pass/Green Mountains area have some connotation in the BLM's undertaking or was that just an area designated by Ms. Peterson?"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,284.099,284.801,No.
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,290.153,298.943,"Well, I know that, but is it anything more than just a geographical designation selected by the... by Ms. Peterson?"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,298.943,300.145,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1989.89-640,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,476.158,486.199,"Mr. Roberts, do we have to know exactly what's challenged by the plaintiffs below in order to answer the question of standing?"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,486.199,487.049,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-640,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,497.174,508.046,"Well, I suppose one of the allegations, for example, is that the reclassification requires the preparation of environmental impact statements."
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,508.046,509.314,"That is one of their claims, yes."
1989.89-640,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,509.314,524.491,"And, of course, if the... if Ms. Peterson did have standing and was able to argue that point, then it would have an effect nationwide, I assume."
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,524.491,530.745,"Your Honor, the failure to prepare an environmental impact statement is not final agency action."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.186,585.213,"Well, Mr. Roberts, it... it would have an effect nationwide, however, if all of the... if all of the actions taken nationwide were subject to this court of appeals rule of law."
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,610.43,614.299,"Certainly true, Your Honor, but the key is the second predicate to your question."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.299,615.251,I understand that.
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,615.251,620.203,If the District of Columbia Circuit had jurisdiction nationwide over all of these land orders.
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,620.203,632.26,"And if it doesn't, then... then presumably those that are challenged in the... in the District of Columbia Circuit will be governed by that rule, but the government can feel free to use its view of the law elsewhere?"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,632.26,634.628,"Absolutely, and that's... that's not an unusual result."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.078,665.434,"It's not really harmless error for the court of appeals to say, well, we really only have this one case before us but, nonetheless, it applies to all cases?"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,665.434,669.902,"Well, the court of appeals can say it, but it doesn't apply to all cases."
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,758.376,760.395,May I just interrupt for a second?
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,770.767,771.551,"--Oh, no, Your Honor."
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.04,781.075,Or if there's some other record basis for standing.
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,781.075,782.375,--Or any other record basis.
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,782.375,785.944,Then... then you lose on the only issue that's before us here.
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,792.148,793.167,"I think it does, Your Honor."
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.57,806.424,But if it gets... your... your position doesn't get her one inch into the 180 million acres.
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,806.424,806.824,--That's right.
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.376,810.078,"Well, then why do we have to talk about anything but that one inch?"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,810.078,814.296,"--Well, if... if... if the Court agrees with us that Peterson has no standing--"
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,814.296,814.68,Right.
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,814.68,824.569,"--and the Court agrees with us further that the supplemental affidavits were properly excluded and the Greenwalt declaration that was discussed earlier also doesn't establish standing, then you are correct."
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,826.671,833.408,"And if we disagree with you on any one of those three theories, then we reverse... we affirm?"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,833.408,834.526,"--I think not, Your Honor."
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.261,862.894,And we have to sort through all of them and decide which ones--
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,862.894,867.998,"--Well, that's certainly what the trial court would have to do if the case were sent back on that basis."
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,867.998,870.533,--That's the difference between being a trial judge and sitting here.
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,872.752,883.34,"But the fact of the matter is, understanding doctrine, the plaintiff has to show that he has been injured by each agency action as to which he seeks relief."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1026.002,1042.511,"Respondent says, Mr. Roberts, that it had had no reason to believe it would need anything further until the... until the court at the last minute suddenly decided to take seriously the... the challenges to standing which hadn't previously been... been even barely acknowledged by it."
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1042.511,1047.315,"Well, Your Honor, it had our motion on summary judgment specifically directed to standing."
1989.89-640,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1086.607,1091.594,"Well, suppose we disagree with you and think that there was an abuse of discretion."
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1098.431,1102.485,"Well, we don't know, Your Honor, because we've never had an opportunity to take discovery on them."
1989.89-640,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1107.904,1110.973,"Well, so you... you don't say that on their face they were deficient?"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1110.973,1112.375,"--Not on their face, no, Your Honor."
1989.89-640,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.375,1123.148,"So... but you would say that, nevertheless, if... even if they are sufficient they relate only to the specific area that they mention?"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1123.148,1123.948,"Oh, absolutely."
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1127.95,1133.104,Was there an effort to depose the plaintiffs in the first part of the case?
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1133.104,1133.671,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-640,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1164.959,1173.681,"Did the... did the court sua sponte reject the supplemental affidavits, or did you interpose an objection?"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1173.681,1176.45,"--We... if... I'm not quite certain, Your Honor."
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1308.002,1311.47,Would you just help me out... get one fact straight in my mind again?
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1315.691,1316.241,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1330.783,1331.5,It added these affidavits?
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1331.5,1332.383,--It added these affidavits.
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1332.383,1335.937,What if the respondent had submitted these affidavits at the oral hearing?
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1335.937,1338.271,That also would have been too late.
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1349.162,1352.697,"If they'd come in a week before the hearing, they would have been timely?"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1352.697,1357.268,"There would be no problem if they had come in the day before the hearing, putting aside questions--"
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1357.268,1362.255,"I had the impression they were several years late, but really they were only about six or eight weeks late."
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1362.255,1366.29,"--Well, they had the opportunity, in responding to our summary judgment motion."
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1366.29,1370.242,"During which time they apparently thought it wasn't necessary, because they'd been winning on standing up to that point."
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1370.242,1371.444,That's right.
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1379.966,1381.166,When they realized they were in trouble.
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1381.166,1394.643,"When they realized they were in trouble, and the principle that the court of appeals endorsed and which Respondents argue for here is just that, the principle that you can come forward with additional facts whenever you think you're in trouble."
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1399.628,1407.533,"Let me ask... maybe this is a stupid question, but if there's no standing and you throw the whole case out as of now, is that with prejudice or without prejudice?"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1411.835,1416.306,--I think there would be a serious question of whether they're estopped res judicata.
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1416.306,1417.073,What would they be estopped for?
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1418.591,1428.364,"But there was a determination as to their standing, and I don't think they get a second chance to come in and try again after a determination on the merits of the standing question."
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.816,1433.768,What if the individual affiants were to file a case?
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1433.768,1440.005,"--It would be an entirely new case, and the... and the... except perhaps maybe not with respect to Peterson."
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.129,1474.345,"The thing that's running through my mind, if we take a look at these other affidavits... I know you say we shouldn't look at them... and we should conclude... say, we should conclude that it's perfectly clear these people have standing, are we perhaps generating a new series of lawsuits by saying well, we'll throw this case out and let these other people start all over again, as class action or some... with a different... not the National Wildlife Federation, but--"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1474.345,1481.249,"--Well, certainly a different organization could come in with different complaints and we'd have to deal with that in that situation."
1989.89-640,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1510.351,1523.093,"--I assume you are being logical and saying that standing is res judicata only as to this particular order of the agency, and not nationwide?"
1989.89-640,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1523.093,1527.396,"To be consistent, we'd have to agree with that, yes."
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1529.829,1531.181,"Very well, Mr. Roberts."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1535.65,1538.185,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1559.599,1562.618,Did you raise that point in your memorandum in opposition?
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1562.618,1563.82,"--No, sir."
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1563.82,1578.662,"You're aware of the rule of Oklahoma City against Tuttle, as codified in our new rules, that any point that is not... does not go to our jurisdiction that should counsel against the grant of certiorari must be raised in the memorandum in opposition?"
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1578.662,1580.881,"I'm indeed familiar with that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1595.291,1595.674,Well--
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1595.674,1596.841,--in this fashion.
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1596.841,1603.628,--Presumably the best time for the Court to have made that decision would have been at the stage were certiorari was being granted.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1617.47,1639.57,"Well, the point was made about the five supplemental memoranda, and I'm merely suggesting to you that when you... when you hear the situation that you're in at the moment, I think that it would be a case that it's not worth this Court's time to hear, because what you're doing is, you're passing in effect on the discretion of the court of appeals to rule that the district court abused its discretion in a matter of local practice."
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1643.938,1645.89,"I thought they were affidavits, Mr. Prettyman--"
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1645.89,1646.374,--Affidavits.
1989.89-640,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1646.99,1648.941,--Accompanying a memorandum?
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1648.941,1649.941,Did I misstate?
1989.89-640,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1649.941,1651.877,You said five supplemental memoranda.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1651.877,1652.393,I apologize.
1989.89-640,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1652.393,1653.46,You mean the affidavits--
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1653.46,1653.927,Of course I do--
1989.89-640,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1653.927,1655.162,--that accompanied the memoranda.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1655.162,1656.095,--Absolutely.
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.489,1700.708,That was several years... when was their affidavit?
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1703.976,1704.678,Exactly.
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1706.228,1709.13,How... how much before the time that they were updating it?
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1709.13,1716.736,"Well, the Williams affidavit was filed... September 5, 1986."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1716.736,1720.022,And the hearing was when?
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1720.022,1722.224,"July 22nd, 1988."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.224,1724.707,'76 to '88?
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1724.707,1725.426,'86.
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1725.426,1729.894,"'86 to '88, so you were using figures for two years earlier?"
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1729.894,1732.779,We were using the last figures that they submitted.
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.779,1733.512,"Well, and--"
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1733.512,1741.268,"And all of a sudden they arrive at the hearing and they begin updating, and then they produce this piece of paper which they say back up these new figures."
1989.89-640,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1743.803,1751.541,"--Well, Mr. Prettyman, I don't see what that has to do with whether the Peterson affidavit gives adequate standing to the plaintiff."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1767.586,1784.714,"Well, Your Honor, if we are correct that the district court abused its discretion in not allowing in the five affidavits and the government has just told you that at least looking at the affidavits they would concede that they are sufficient to establish standing, then we never have to reach--"
1989.89-640,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1784.714,1797.855,"Well, what if we disagree with you and think that since the rules don't permit post-hearing affidavits, therefore there was no abuse of discretion and we're left with the Peterson affidavit?"
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1797.855,1799.974,"--Well, I will move to the Peterson affidavit."
1989.89-640,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.268,1818.635,"And so if they did, you did, too."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1819.435,1823.755,--What I'm saying is it comes with little grace for them to argue that we did--
1989.89-640,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1823.755,1824.222,"Well, it may."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1826.541,1827.924,"--Well, it may be, Your Honor."

1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1836.063,1843.151,"No, because we thought we were going to have a chance to respond to them in supplemental affidavits."
1989.89-640,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1844.136,1848.221,Did you advise the court at the time of the hearing that you wished to file supplemental affidavits?
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1848.221,1851.423,--He had told us that we could file supplemental memoranda.
1989.89-640,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1853.474,1857.326,And so you did not advise the court at the time of hearing that there would be new factual matters?
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1857.326,1857.926,That's correct.
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1874.488,1876.49,"Well, the government's point had nothing to do with the standing."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1881.292,1885.246,"Oh, Your Honor, but it had very much to do with RMPs, which the district court--"
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1885.246,1885.696,With the case.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1888.282,1895.768,"--Well, but in ruling on standing, on throwing this out, the district court ruled on the merits on RMPs."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1912.063,1914.099,How can you rule on the merits in ruling on standing?
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1914.399,1919.401,"That's exactly one of my points, Your Honor, is that he should not have been ruling on the merits, but he did."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.003,1920.519,"--Well, no, he didn't."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1926.923,1934.477,"Well, Your Honor, all I can do is read his opinion, and his opinion passed on a number of points that... that would appear to be on the merits."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.477,1940.666,"Well, yes, but we... we don't review dicta, and if this case was dismissed on standing, you know that that's no precedent."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1940.666,1957.276,"But Your Honor, if he sets forth right here in the opinion as part of his reason for dismissing on standing certain facts that really go to the merits, it seems to me that we are entitled to say he should never have done that, that that's part of the problem here."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1957.276,1959.211,So to rebut those affidavits.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1979.273,1979.573,No.
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1980.023,1984.76,"Or you are sanctioned and reprimanded for letting... and then the inequity would be eliminated, I assume?"
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1984.76,1985.177,--No.
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2000.888,2006.007,The District of Columbia doesn't practice under the Federal Rules?
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2006.007,2018.6,"Of course, it does, Your Honor, but the Federal Rule does not mean that you have to file it at the hearing, because if that were true a district judge could not even have given us permission to file those affidavits afterwards, and that's--"
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2018.6,2021.45,"Well, but he gave you permission to file memoranda, not affidavits."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2021.45,2025.42,--But suppose he had said you can file affidavits with your memoranda?
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.806,2031.324,"Well, maybe he couldn't."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2031.324,2034.626,"Well, Your Honor, that isn't what the lower courts have said."
1989.89-640,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2042.381,2044.165,But that isn't before us here.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2061.927,2071.049,The status of the case before you is that the court of appeals has ruled that it was an abuse of discretion of the district court under all of the circumstances here.
1989.89-640,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2071.049,2072.585,And that question is before us?
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2072.585,2074.687,"That question is definitely before you, and you have to--"
1989.89-640,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2074.687,2074.987,Right.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2081.255,2082.239,"--And consider all the equities, which it did."
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2096.866,2098.635,Why do we have to face it?
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2098.635,2101.77,"--Because if we had standing on our own, there is standing."
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2101.77,2106.972,"Yes, but if... we don't ordinarily pass on questions that the court of appeals hasn't passed on."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2120.299,2121.549,I agree with you 100 percent.
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2136.241,2136.574,Yes.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2140.395,2141.028,Right.
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.51,2167.462,What you're talking... I don't know what you're talking about.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2176.751,2178.351,--Correct.
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2178.351,2188.126,"But what's relevant is what greater parcel were those lands contained in that were described in the affidavits, isn't that right?"
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2188.126,2188.492,No.
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2195.03,2197.315,"And... and that describes those 4,400--"
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2197.315,2197.865,--Exactly.
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2201.934,2204.551,--And how many acres is the South Pass and Green Mountain area?
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2204.551,2207.353,"--It's a total of approximately 150,000."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.353,2207.903,Okay.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2207.903,2210.072,"Green Mountain is about 126,000, and the rest--"
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2210.072,2214.626,"So it's 4,400 acres that are somewhere in 156,000 acres?"
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2214.626,2215.009,--Right.
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2215.009,2216.776,"Well, it's in the vicinity of."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2219.745,2221.53,I was going to address that in just a moment.
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2326.832,2330.151,"In the whole 150,000 acres, Mr. Prettyman, or just--"
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2330.151,2330.901,--They're talking about--
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2330.901,2336.305,"--in whatever particular one of the 4,400 acres that these activities were going... going on in?"
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2336.305,2342.709,"--What they are talking about, Your Honor, is the mining in the 4,455 that's in South Pass and Green Mountain."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.709,2343.059,Right.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2344.661,2345.611,Of course we know where it is.
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.611,2349.28,"--We know that it's somewhere in those, you say, 150,000 acres."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2349.28,2350.232,"Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2351.065,2355.886,In the vicinity of which this... this affiant said she recreated.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2355.886,2357.036,"--Well, I'm sorry."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2364.04,2368.976,What's relevant is not whether we can tell from the Federal Register but whether we can tell from her affidavit.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2385.821,2386.138,--No.
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2390.023,2396.277,"Well, I thought... go ahead and finish your answer to Justice Scalia."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2396.277,2409.103,"The government is talking about the harm that will come to aesthetics and wildlife from the opening of the mining and where the opening of the... opening to mining occurred was in the 4,455 which she says she's in the vicinity of."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2409.103,2411.972,"It doesn't say she's in the vicinity of the 4,400 acres."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2416.59,2417.14,She said--
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2417.14,2418.959,Read the portion of her affidavit that indicates that.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2420.492,2420.828,--Sure.
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2426.38,2432.017,191a.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2434.302,2435.402,"No, of the petition appendix."
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2435.402,2438.238,--the petition appendix.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2443.606,2450.343,"191a and let's take, for example, paragraph 6."
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2450.343,2457.33,"Well, let's... before we take paragraph 6 take paragraph 3."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2465.785,2466.319,Right.
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2466.319,2473.291,"And you say that the... the Federal lands that would be embraced within that area are no more than 150,000 acres?"
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2473.291,2479.029,"I'm saying that the... yes, that the South Pass/Green Mountain area... you take the resource areas that encompass those."
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2481.179,2483.897,Those are the Federal lands that are included within that area?
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2483.897,2485.183,"Yes, that's right."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2528.093,2535.282,Suppose I said the... the Bureau is allowing mining in the United States.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2548.923,2549.639,Of course not.
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2553.577,2555.945,"But it's... you're saying it's the other side of 150,000 acres?"
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2555.945,2556.329,--No.
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2613.632,2615.984,SCRAP... SCRAP was on a motion to dismiss.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2615.984,2624.257,"--Well, nevertheless you said that it was sufficient that the people were in the area of the... Wildlife Federation."
1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2624.257,2626.14,"Well, SCRAP was a five... five to four opinion."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2631.41,2655.859,"Well, what about Japan Whaling, Your Honor, that Justice White wrote, where you'll recall that the... the... the... they said just because the conservation group's members enjoyed watching whaling and studying whaling that that was enough to give them standing to challenge the Secretary of Commerce's refusal to condemn Japan for whaling."
1989.89-640,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2773.203,2797.485,"Yes, but all the one person would have to say... I mean, all... all that would have been necessary is that paragraph 3 of the affidavit instead of saying generally I use the Federal lands, including those in the vicinity... in the vicinity of the South Pass/Green Mountain area, she could say I use the Federal land adjacent to and then just name one of the sites in this 150,000 acres that... that has been opened for mining."
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2801.539,2806.091,"--Well, I must say I don't see the... the difference between ""in the vicinity of"" and ""adjacent to""."

1989.89-640,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2833.843,2844.966,"But it... it's... vaguer than that, I think, Mr. Prettyman, because the... the distance between South Pass and the Green Mountains in Wyoming is many... you know, what, 50 miles, something like that?"
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2844.966,2845.401,Well.
1989.89-640,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2933.49,2939.077,"Well, are you defending the court of appeals' rationale in finding standing or not?"
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2939.077,2945.731,--The only thing that I... that I part company with on the court of appeals is that I don't think they had to rely on any presumption because they--
1989.89-640,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2945.731,2947.433,But they did.
1989.89-640,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,2947.433,2949.635,--They did because they didn't look at the government's evidence.
1989.89-640,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2949.635,2956.289,"Well, they did, though, so... so they... on that basis you're saying you concede that they were in error--"
