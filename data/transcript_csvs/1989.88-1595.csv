1989.88-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.028,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-1595, Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical v. Joseph A. Bonjorno, and vice versa."
1989.88-1595,0,40030,richard_p_mcelroy,,20.767,23.808,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1595,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,327.171,333.222,I would think the language of the statute might be the first inquiry.
1989.88-1595,0,40030,richard_p_mcelroy,,333.222,339.228,"Precisely, in determining legislative intent, Your Honor, the first question is what the statute says."
1989.88-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,468.833,471.354,What is the effect of the appeal?
1989.88-1595,0,40030,richard_p_mcelroy,,478.979,486.024,The right to post-judgment interest vests as of the date of the entry of judgment.
1989.88-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.024,488.796,Regardless of the appeal?
1989.88-1595,0,40030,richard_p_mcelroy,,488.796,498.122,"Well, it is... it is no doubt true that if the judgment is overturned there is no obligation on the part of the defendant to pay the judgment."
1989.88-1595,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,553.778,565.626,"Do you, do you think it is applying the statute retroactively to apply it to the period of time after the statute becomes effective?"
1989.88-1595,0,40030,richard_p_mcelroy,,565.626,570.379,"Yes, Your Honor, because of the way the statute is set up."
1989.88-1595,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,572.71,577.333,"Well, there's... after the... the post-judgment interest ran after the date of the statute."
1989.88-1595,0,40030,richard_p_mcelroy,,577.333,581.214,--The post-judgment interest indeed ran after the date.
1989.88-1595,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,581.214,584.697,"And why shouldn't it run at the T-bill rate, for that period at least?"
1989.88-1595,0,40030,richard_p_mcelroy,,584.697,597.696,Because it frustrates the reliance interests of defendants in knowing what their financial obligation is going to be once they embark on the process of seeking to overturn the judgment against them.
1989.88-1595,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,597.696,608.343,"But you say... you say that Congress specifically made a, made the effective date, they postponed the effective date of the statute to October 1, '82."
1989.88-1595,0,40030,richard_p_mcelroy,,608.343,609.245,That is correct.
1989.88-1595,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,609.245,615.158,And you argue from that that they certainly therefore didn't intend the T-bill rate to apply before that date.
1989.88-1595,0,40030,richard_p_mcelroy,,615.158,616.729,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1595,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,616.729,617.629,"Well, what about after that date?"
1989.88-1595,0,40030,richard_p_mcelroy,,617.629,627.266,"Well, they did in fact intend that the T-bill rate would apply after that date, but only to judgments entered after that date."
1989.88-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,649.389,655.874,"Well, maybe Congress meant that it would apply to judgments becoming final after that date."
1989.88-1595,0,40030,richard_p_mcelroy,,665.911,674.397,"If the statute said that interest runs from the date of a final judgment, I agree that we don't have a question of retroactivity here--"
1989.88-1595,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,674.397,674.647,"No, no."
1989.88-1595,0,40030,richard_p_mcelroy,,690.346,696.499,"--Oh, I don't... I think that is clearly contrary to the express language of the statute, Your Honor."
1989.88-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,780.425,784.559,"You are not asserting that the Administrative Office of the U.S. Court is entitled to deference on this, are you?"
1989.88-1595,0,40030,richard_p_mcelroy,,784.559,803.8,"--I am arguing that it is entitled to be given weight, because of the fact, under the circumstances of this case, Congress has set up a system pursuant to which it, the Administrative Office, has an obligation to inform the judiciary of what the rates of interest are on judgments."
1989.88-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.011,826.655,"Is that in this statute, that it is the Administrative Office who will notify all of the courts what the T-bill rate is?"
1989.88-1595,0,40030,richard_p_mcelroy,,826.655,828.558,It is the last sentence of the statute.
1989.88-1595,1,27879,henry_t_reath,,1647.927,1652.019,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1745.311,1746.333,May I interrupt just there?
1989.88-1595,1,27879,henry_t_reath,,1746.333,1747.354,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1747.354,1753.726,"My notes, maybe I mis-show that the 1979 judgment was for $5,445,000."
1989.88-1595,1,27879,henry_t_reath,,1753.726,1754.417,That is correct.
1989.88-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1754.417,1759.559,And that was changed to the extent that you got it increased a couple of years later to $9.5 million.
1989.88-1595,1,27879,henry_t_reath,,1759.559,1759.98,"Yes, sir."
1989.88-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1759.98,1765.534,"So that it is not correct that you are asking for interest on the $5.4 million, are you?"
1989.88-1595,1,27879,henry_t_reath,,1765.534,1766.205,Absolutely not.
1989.88-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1823.874,1827.366,But we're talking about a fairly technical statute.
1989.88-1595,1,27879,henry_t_reath,,1841.004,1862.807,"--Your Honor, if I may, and what I would like to take my time to do... I want to answer any questions the Court has about Mr. McElroy's presentation, but, as you know, there are cross-petitions here, and it is our position that the statute, the 1961 statute, does not apply in this case."
1989.88-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.56,1885.392,Did you argue that in the court of appeals?
1989.88-1595,1,27879,henry_t_reath,,1885.392,1886.583,"Absolutely, we did."
1989.88-1595,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1886.583,1888.315,The court of appeals doesn't even mention it.
1989.88-1595,1,27879,henry_t_reath,,1888.315,1889.985,"I know that, Your Honor."
1989.88-1595,2,40030,richard_p_mcelroy,,3504.498,3523.611,"Chief Justice Rehnquist noted that this was complicated, and if there is any area that should be uncomplicated, it is the interest that judgment should carry, so that we avoid prolonging litigation that is prolonged already forever."
1989.88-1595,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3575.437,3579.437,"Thank you, Mr. McElroy. The case is submitted."
