2004.02-1192,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.885,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-1192, Cooper Industries v. Aviall Services."
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,65.099,70.672,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.02-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,154.43,158.229,"It's... it's Aviall's complaint, not yours, so I can ask them."
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,169.867,178.678,"Well, Your Honor, the original complaint that they filed had a 107 action and a 113 action."
2004.02-1192,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,182.461,183.676,But why?
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,183.676,184.213,I believe they--
2004.02-1192,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,184.213,184.773,"I mean, what's going on?"
2004.02-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,184.773,185.616,Can you tell me why they did that?
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,185.616,185.971,--Yes.
2004.02-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,218.831,234.89,"But I had thought that the district court all but invited them to... to state a 107 cause of action, and they didn't accept the district judge's invitation, as... as I read the record."
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,234.89,252.639,"I... I think what the district court did is invited them to clarify whether they were proceeding under 107 or 113, and in the course of the colloquy at the district court, they made it clear that they were proceeding under 113 and that they believed that 107 was unavailable to them as a contributor to the contaminated property."
2004.02-1192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,252.639,255.528,They... they said that as a matter of Fifth Circuit law.
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,270.017,278.728,"Well, I... I think what the Fifth Circuit has said is that if you have a... an action for contribution as one who has contaminated the property, then you must proceed under 113."
2004.02-1192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,278.728,280.669,So they were doing what the Fifth Circuit--
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,280.669,281.207,You can't proceed under 107.
2004.02-1192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,281.207,283.353,--They were doing what the Fifth Circuit told them to do.
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,283.353,283.807,Right.
2004.02-1192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,283.807,285.499,And you can't fault a litigant for that.
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,285.499,289.668,"Well, I... I don't believe would I fault a litigant for that, Your Honor."
2004.02-1192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,311.838,327.192,"As I understand it, this cleanup was initiated because the State agency said you've got a contamination problem and if you don't do something about it, we're going to enforce our law against you."
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,332.865,339.741,I think that actually the cleanup of the property was initiated before the State got involved in... in conversations.
2004.02-1192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,348.857,354.313,"Was one... was one of those communications you're going to do it, otherwise we're going to enforce our law against you?"
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,354.313,359.06,--I don't... I don't think that the State compelled the cleanup.
2004.02-1192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,367.771,368.309,If--
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,368.309,371.919,But it was not... there was no compulsory action by the State.
2004.02-1192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,371.919,395.967,"--If it's true that the State said you've got a contamination problem, cure it, why would we want to construe Federal law as saying don't clean up sooner, wait until, say, EPA goes after you?"
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,408.971,413.634,I... I think you can construe this... the law to say clean up sooner.
2004.02-1192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.924,475.473,But you might be sitting... EPA has got a lot of things on its agenda.
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,479.726,492.441,"Well, there is a process that's available to everybody to enter into negotiations with EPA to clean up these sites and to... and to engage in settlements that would allow for contribution."
2004.02-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,580.408,586.435,Do you... do you think there's a 107 action by one PRP against another?
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,586.435,601.174,"I... I believe that there's... there is a 107 action by a PRP who is what they have... the courts have termed an innocent PRP, one who was not involved in contributing to the... to the contaminated condition."
2004.02-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,601.174,602.493,What about in... what about in this case?
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,602.493,626.438,"I do not think that there... well, I think that in this case the Fifth Circuit and most of the other circuits that have addressed it have said that if you are a contributor to the pollution, your remedy to go after other PRP's is to avail yourself of the contribution provision and that you don't have a right of action for cost recovery under 107 separate and apart from that."
2004.02-1192,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,626.438,629.903,"Well, that question is open, is it not?"
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,642.989,648.745,"Justice O'Connor, I... I think you're... you are correct that that has not been decided by this Court."
2004.02-1192,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,648.745,649.488,Right.
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,649.488,654.401,"And there are... there are different courts, lower courts, that have spoken to it."
2004.02-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,667.487,667.653,"Well, but--"
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,667.653,667.903,But--
2004.02-1192,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,667.903,677.107,"--if you're... if you're going to take the position below that a PRP can't sue, then maybe that would have some bearing on how we'd interpret 113."
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,677.107,692.795,"--Well, I... I think that it is clear, if you read 113, that there's nothing in 113 that would suggest that this particular PRP would have an ability to sue under 107."
2004.02-1192,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.968,711.454,"Yes, but Mr. Reynolds, there's a savings clause, and... and conceivably one could read the savings clause as saying whatever Federal remedy was available between 1980 and 1986 is still available."
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,721.773,723.593,My answer... I have two answers to that question.
2004.02-1192,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,736.596,737.172,Right.
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,737.172,746.088,That implied right of contribution was recognized in every case in circumstances where there had been an enforcement action under 107 and--
2004.02-1192,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,746.088,746.304,Right.
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,755.105,762.807,--There... there are no cases that we've been able to find that would have allowed for this particular action under 107.
2004.02-1192,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,768.917,769.123,No.
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,775.976,777.069,--I--
2004.02-1192,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,777.069,778.577,There was... a contribution was implied.
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,778.577,786.833,"--Contribution... the contribution is available in common law, but common law of contribution does not recognize contribution among joint tortfeasors."
2004.02-1192,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,832.241,850.917,"Well, it's certainly true that cases that they labeled contribution cases was exactly as you define it, but I'm just wondering if there were not in fact some cases with facts just like this one which, without specific statutory authorization, the judge found an implied basis for allowing recovery."
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,850.917,859.901,"The only one where there was a suggestion that we could find, Your Honor, was in a district court in Florida that got dismissed because there hadn't been enough government action in the cleanup."
2004.02-1192,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,939.367,948.694,"My understanding is... is right... is that 113 says that if there is a civil action under 107, then you get the contribution."
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,948.694,950.718,--If there is a civil action--
2004.02-1192,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,950.718,973.297,"Well, and so then... and... and there might be because I was interested in... you said that it's true that the common law rule was no contribution among tortfeasors, but almost everywhere that's been changed, is my impression, either by statute or... or perhaps by judicial decision, so that now you can read the Restatement of Torts, and it seems to say that in most instances, for example, this one... nuisances, say."
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,983.7,984.793,"--Well, I think if--"
2004.02-1192,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,984.793,985.415,Is that right?
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,985.991,987.931,"--I'm not aware of that, Your Honor."
2004.02-1192,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1005.642,1006.264,"--Oh, I see. I see."
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1006.264,1011.548,--it would only be in terms of whether you could bring it during the 107 action or following.
2004.02-1192,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1039.701,1056.752,"One of your... I think it was yours, rather an amicus argument for... for reading 113 is you say it would have a bearing on reading 107, and that was that Congress didn't want to permit suits prior to some definitive resolution of a claim, whether it be by settlement or whatnot."
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1069.877,1070.97,Correct.
2004.02-1192,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1070.97,1073.304,--or even yet a third joint tortfeasor.
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1091.054,1105.914,"I think, Your Honor, that where EPA is involved... and the reason that it's important it's involved is it... EPA assures that the cleanup that we're talking about is comprehensive, and when it gets involved and it--"
2004.02-1192,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1105.914,1109.88,So you're really disputing the... the fact of... of their response?
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1117.31,1128.949,"--My... my understanding is that EPA does, indeed, require that the cleanup be done in accordance with the National Contingency Plan and the other requirements that they have in their... in their regulations."
2004.02-1192,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1128.949,1136.629,"So that if... so that if it is done, there won't be further EPA action against yet another polluter for that site."
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1136.629,1143.066,"Well, unless it's outside of or even in the... in the provision of the statute."
2004.02-1192,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1155.948,1172.21,"Well, if that's the... if that's the case then, whether... whether... even... even in a... in a case of contribution brought under 113, the person against whom contribution is obtained might still be liable to EPA if EPA later proceeds against that person."
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1172.21,1182.902,--But... but the point here that we were making in our brief and I think is... is a response to... to what you're asking... the... the point here wouldn't be inconsistent liability and it wouldn't be duplicative liability.
2004.02-1192,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1197.929,1198.506,"I see, yes."
2004.02-1192,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1198.506,1230.335,"Do I understand your... your position correctly that a State or a Federal administrative order won't do or a State or Federal threat of enforcement won't do, that the only thing that will count is a settlement... a signed settlement agreement, whether it's between the State administrator or the Federal administrator, but just the... the mere order that you clean up, threat that we will enforce if you don't, that that doesn't count?"
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1230.335,1235.498,"--Your Honor, certainly for purposes of this case, I'm not sure that needs to be resolved."
2004.02-1192,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1254.278,1255.559,"Thank you, Mr. Reynolds."
2004.02-1192,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1255.559,1257.333,And there have been different views that have been addressed on that.
2004.02-1192,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1257.333,1261.048,"Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you."
2004.02-1192,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1261.048,1272.732,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.02-1192,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.031,1299.853,"Mr. Minear, the... I think the respondent accuses the Government of changing its position in this case."
2004.02-1192,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1308.11,1308.603,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.02-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1319.877,1320.082,Wholly a volunteer?
2004.02-1192,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1323.692,1331.394,"Yes, there was, but in this case there was no action that we understand that actually compelled the... Aviall to clean up the site."
2004.02-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1336.807,1339.286,"There was a threat of enforcement if they didn't clean up, as I understand."
2004.02-1192,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1339.286,1339.491,--Yes.
2004.02-1192,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1375.035,1376.521,There has been no change in position.
2004.02-1192,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1376.521,1380.153,"--On that point, there's been no change, and in fact we repeated it to this Court--"
2004.02-1192,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1380.153,1383.391,--whether there was any change of position and what was it and would you explain--
2004.02-1192,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1383.391,1383.474,--Well--
2004.02-1192,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1383.474,1384.672,--what it was and why?
2004.02-1192,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1384.672,1385.265,"--Yes, exactly."
2004.02-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1466.151,1472.161,"Mr. Minear, I was just reading from this Government brief, which you said is consistent with your current position on that point."
2004.02-1192,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1493.172,1493.559,Yes.
2004.02-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1665.351,1669.688,"Mr. Minear... Minear, I have a practical question."
2004.02-1192,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1710.488,1721.988,"Well, we assume... this is the... the warnings about this site were originally brought by the State officials, and we assume that the State officials would have happily entered into a settlement agreement that would have obligated Aviall to clean up the site."
2004.02-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1745.494,1749.769,But as far as... I just want to know if it's a realistic choice.
2004.02-1192,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1749.769,1753.362,"--Well, we think that in the case... that obviously, EPA has many things on its plate."
2004.02-1192,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1780.483,1789.028,"But you say the whole... this whole thing could have been cured if Aviall had followed up with the State enforcer and said, give me a settlement agreement."
2004.02-1192,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1789.028,1790.264,"--Yes, that's absolutely right."
2004.02-1192,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1865.788,1868.017,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,1869.542,1874.638,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.02-1192,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1948.676,1963.331,"It doesn't... what it says... in the complaint here that I have, it says pursuant to CERCLA... then you cite 113... Aviall is entitled to seek contribution from Cooper as a person liable or potentially liable under CERCLA 107."
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,1981.081,1986.365,"I'm asserting a consolidated claim under section 107 and 113, exactly as the Fifth Circuit--"
2004.02-1192,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1986.365,1988.306,--You say they are a person who's liable under 107.
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,1992.681,1996.358,"--Well, Your... Your Honor, I... I would just respectfully disagree with the way--"
2004.02-1192,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1996.358,1996.768,"All right, I see."
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,1999.701,2005.479,"--I... I would suggest that's important, and it's also important to review the colloquy that we had with the district court when the district court--"
2004.02-1192,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2005.479,2009.278,"I just... I just reviewed that colloquy, and there you said you did not draft the complaint."
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2009.278,2012.129,"--Well, I... I drafted the amended complaint, Your Honor."
2004.02-1192,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2012.129,2013.205,"Oh, okay."
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2013.205,2014.98,The original complaint was not the one I originally drafted.
2004.02-1192,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2085.362,2094.938,"Well, in this case, has the court below directly ruled on whether there's a 107 cause of action here?"
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2094.938,2098.654,"No, Your Honor, I do not believe there has been a specific ruling."
2004.02-1192,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2098.654,2099.648,So that's still open.
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2099.648,2111.991,"Your Honor, and we have... we have asserted that if this Court finds that, in fact, we're not entitled to recovery under 113, we should be entitled to a remand to have the issue of the 107 issue resolved."
2004.02-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2151.865,2159.212,"Did... did you object to the question presented in the petition on that ground, that the word voluntarily in it was... was inaccurate?"
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2159.212,2161.32,"No, Your Honor, we did not object to it."
2004.02-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2161.32,2165.778,"Well, I mean, we take the questions that are presented when the parties don't... don't object to it."
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2179.153,2180.367,"I understand, Your Honor."
2004.02-1192,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2180.672,2186.599,"I guess you do admit, though, that no civil action had been brought against Aviall."
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2186.599,2187.614,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2004.02-1192,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2188.274,2189.305,So that much is clear.
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2202.558,2202.724,"--That is what the first sentence says, Your Honor."
2004.02-1192,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2202.724,2206.728,So how do you fit yourself within that provision?
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2206.728,2209.245,We fit ourself not within the first sentence--
2004.02-1192,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2209.245,2209.717,No.
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2209.717,2229.679,"--of that provision at all, Your Honor, but we fall within the last sentence of that provision because the... the last sentence of that provision specifically provides that we can pursue the right... not any right, not multiple rights, but the singular right of contribution, which is specified in that... in... in section 107."
2004.02-1192,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2247.39,2248.505,Where does the right come from?
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2248.505,2252.592,"--The right is derived from section 107 in the first place, Your Honor."
2004.02-1192,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2252.592,2264.192,"It says, nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a section... in the absence."
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2266.504,2268.074,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
2004.02-1192,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2276.369,2286.855,Your argument is that the first sentence says that you or anybody can get contribution following or during a civil action under 107.
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2294.081,2294.907,"--Well, the last--"
2004.02-1192,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2294.907,2295.733,This isn't much of a section.
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2298.622,2303.989,"--Your... Your Honor, I... I cannot... I cannot explain the oddity of the section, as... as I have heard in some quarters."
2004.02-1192,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2306.879,2307.25,"No, no."
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2319.965,2322.444,"I know what you're driving at, and if I may, I'd like to reply to it."
2004.02-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.273,2369.793,Why... why isn't a perfectly adequate explanation of the last sentence that it was referring to the State causes of action?
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2373.425,2386.428,"--Well, one... one reason, Your Honor, is that there are already two savings clauses specifically inserted in CERCLA dealing with State causes of action and the rights of parties to pursue State causes of action."
2004.02-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2386.428,2389.279,"But this would be a very logical place to... to repeat it, even if it is somewhere else."
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2416.316,2427.174,However admirably drafted... and I... I respect Your Honor's opinion... the limitation of that to State causes of action is entirely inappropriate given the language of the statute.
2004.02-1192,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2436.545,2437.91,"Well, there's... there's one argument, isn't there?"
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2467.464,2469.489,"I... I don't agree, Your Honor."
2004.02-1192,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2480.467,2483.81,"That may be what it means, and... and maybe that's the way it ought to be construed."
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2484.925,2487.98,"--I... I think... to... to me, Your Honor, it's very clear."
2004.02-1192,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2505.858,2512.295,"Well, it... it says... it says, the right of any person to bring an action."
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2515.35,2532.153,"--Well, it depends, Your Honor, how we... how we... if we have to go back to Key Tronic, which I... I suspect we do, the question of whether any person is the person entitled to bring a cause of action under 107, and I think this Court has held that that is implied under section 107."
2004.02-1192,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2532.153,2533.722,Have you got any other statute like this?
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2556.877,2561.503,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, I will... I will say that there is absolutely no statute anywhere like CERCLA."
2004.02-1192,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2633.949,2653.518,"What... what is your answer to their response to the loophole argument that, in point of fact, you can... if you want to undertake this cleanup, all you've got to do basically is go to EPA and say, look, we want to get into circumstances in which we can have a settlement with you so that during or after it, we can... we can go for contribution?"
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2656.778,2670.153,"--My answer, Your Honor, is that the very purpose of CERCLA, from its inception, was to arm the Federal Government and private parties with powers sufficient that would motivate voluntary cleanup action without Federal involvement."
2004.02-1192,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2672.837,2678.492,"Well, that may... how about the answer to the practical question that Justice Ginsburg raised with your friend on the other side?"
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2682.745,2685.141,"In my experience, Your Honor, it is not easy to do."
2004.02-1192,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2700.412,2701.981,What about the State agency?
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2713.293,2724.522,"--Your... Your Honor, the question of both Federal and State agency assumes the resources and ability and timing and staffing of the agencies to get to the point, and... and get it done in an expedited way."
2004.02-1192,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2745.121,2747.45,"Well, perhaps Congress should have used different language."
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2749.579,2756.184,"--Your Honor, I think the language that Congress used clearly serves the same purposes and goals within its plain language."
2004.02-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2779.385,2791.024,"No, but you're... you're effectively reading out of it the... the limitation, during or following any civil action under section 9606--"
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2791.024,2792.154,I would--
2004.02-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2792.154,2800.206,--because you're saying any person may seek contribution during or after and they may also seek contribution any other time.
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2804.77,2806.627,"--Your Honor, I'm not reading anything out."
2004.02-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2807.62,2808.363,Okay.
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2808.363,2810.387,And I think there's a very big difference.
2004.02-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2810.387,2817.279,What... what function does during or following any civil action under section 9606 of this statute serve--
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2817.279,2818.105,As... as the--
2004.02-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2818.105,2824.05,--given... given that you believe the last sentence means there's a cause of action even when it's not during or following any civil action?
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2824.05,2851.459,"--As the amicus briefs explained, Your Honor, in the Arco brief at page 20 and in the DuPont brief at page 15, the... at the time this statute was being enacted, the purpose of adding during into the statute was to preclude the Government from forcing people to wait until after judgment was rendered to get contribution in enforcement actions because it was the Government's position... and this... and the... and the actual document from the Government is... is available in the brief."
2004.02-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2860.087,2860.642,During.
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2862.233,2866.653,"Or follow... or following, Your Honor, was... was something that was in the bill to begin with."
2004.02-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2867.972,2868.444,--But why?
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2868.444,2870.118,--Or following was in the bill.
2004.02-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2875.857,2876.805,Why... why do you need it?
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2880.232,2880.687,--I--
2004.02-1192,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.687,2881.718,--that says there's a right of contribution?
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2883.554,2886.836,"--Your Honor, I have to take the words of Congress as they are, as... as we all do."
2004.02-1192,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2890.513,2892.409,So your point is it's emphasis.
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2910.697,2911.728,Well--
2004.02-1192,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2911.728,2912.843,Is... is that basically the point?
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2919.53,2921.266,--If I... if I can elaborate.
2004.02-1192,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2940.047,2948.387,"Well, but it... the part about during or following, certainly following any civil action means after that action is concluded."
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,2948.387,2949.789,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.02-1192,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3026.118,3030.538,"Where does it say that, that you deal with in... in an evolving basis?"
2004.02-1192,2,39195,richard_o_faulk,,3030.538,3042.343,"--There... there is a section of the statute, and if it comes to me in a moment... it's in my brief and it's cited, Your Honor, that you deal not only with the common law at the time, but at the time as it evolves."
2004.02-1192,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3202.428,3203.46,"Thank you, Mr. Faulk."
