1980.80-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.556,We'll hear arguments next Jones v. Helms.
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,58.203,62.673,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,100.08,113.956,Does it make any difference under this statute whether the particular person left the state three hours after the commission of the act or three years?
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,113.956,120.31,"--No, sir, there is no time element specified on the face of the statute."
1980.80-850,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,241.953,249.659,"Ms. Cosgrove, I have some difficulty interpreting the 5th Circuit's opinion, perhaps because of its shortness."
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,278.645,288.484,"Your Honor, I believe the 5th Circuit saw our statute as not having the requisite specific intent which would make it pass muster."
1980.80-850,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,288.484,293.288,But why would it have to have requisite... why does it have to have any specific intent?
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,293.288,301.578,It was the 5th Circuit's opinion that without the specific intent the statute would be overly broad.
1980.80-850,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,309.848,314.135,"Well, unless you're talking about free speech you don't have an overbreadth challenge here, do you?"
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,314.135,315.635,That's correct.
1980.80-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.369,610.175,"Or intend to in the course of leaving the state, or intend to abandon the child later?"
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,610.175,611.244,There is--
1980.80-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,611.244,616.679,This applies whether you abandon after you've left the state or before?
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,616.679,618.848,"--On the face of the statute it does, Your Honor."
1980.80-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,626.004,626.887,I understand.
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,626.887,629.973,"--of the statute since in the facts in this case, he pled guilty."
1980.80-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,629.973,633.541,I understand.
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,633.541,659.992,"Secondly, I might mention that, unlike some of the cases, for example Maricopa County and Shapiro, where this Court was concerned with provisions which addressed themselves primarily to indigents, that this statute does not impact on those persons who are in the blameless but unfortunate situation of poverty."
1980.80-850,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,688.261,696.181,"Of course, this whole problem could be solved, I suppose, if the Georgia Legislature simply made child abandonment a felony."
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,696.181,721.899,"Well, Your Honor, of course the Georgia Legislature certainly could have done that and many states have, but I think that in not doing so they have recognized the difference in the type of crime, in that the impact upon the child is greater because the likelihood of ever recovering any support is much less when the parent--"
1980.80-850,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,721.899,725.45,This is not a support statute; this is a criminal statute.
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,725.45,729.904,"--Well, sir, there are two elements in child abandonment."
1980.80-850,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,732.273,733.523,"Yes, but this is a criminal statute."
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,740.394,741.229,For not supporting.
1980.80-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,843.527,852.316,"Do you have a general statute that makes it a crime to flee from justice, or to abscond, or to leave the state?"
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,856.87,859.306,"Not to my understanding, Your Honor."
1980.80-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,859.306,864.274,"But isn't that... that's not unheard of, though, around the country, is it?"
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,864.274,867.193,"There are many statutes, including federal statutes that--"
1980.80-850,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,867.193,870.178,"It could be a breach of a bail condition, I suppose."
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,870.178,871.447,"--Yes, sir, I think it could be."
1980.80-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,871.447,877.018,"How about... is that a crime in your state, to violate your bail?"
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,877.018,884.354,"I'm not at all sure, Your Honor."
1980.80-850,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,913.624,920.628,"Of course, if Georgia made this a felony across the board, all these problems would disappear, wouldn't they?"
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,920.628,924.764,"Perhaps our problems with extradition would disappear, Your Honor."
1980.80-850,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,927.45,930.152,As would this case disappear.
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,930.152,930.768,"--Yes, sir."
1980.80-850,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1005.467,1014.739,"May I ask, Ms. Cosgrove, if we agree with the argument to this point with you, we don't have to reach this question, do we?"
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1014.739,1015.758,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
1980.80-850,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1015.758,1028.082,"If we agree with what you have said up to date, supporting the constitutionality of the statute as not violative of the right to travel, then we don't have to reach this alternative?"
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1028.082,1029.066,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-850,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1033.57,1036.755,But you don't have to rely on it if we agree with your initial argument.
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1036.755,1037.805,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-850,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1037.805,1042.107,Because then you're just... need a rational basis.
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1042.107,1044.042,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-850,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1239.103,1244.307,"Well, again, this is a criminal statute we're dealing with here."
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1256.814,1264.486,"Yes, Your Honor, and it was the court of appeals opinion that we could simply use this civil statute as a substitute for our criminal statute."
1980.80-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1285.05,1288.436,Are you interested in support for the child or putting him in jail?
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1288.436,1290.97,"Well, sir, they're dual interests."
1980.80-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1296.624,1297.857,I thought that was the whole purpose.
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1297.857,1301.593,"--Well, it's the whole purpose if the person complies with court orders."
1980.80-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1307.797,1314.503,"Well, I understand you that if somebody goes to another state and sends the money back, would you still bring him back?"
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1314.503,1315.586,I beg your pardon?
1980.80-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1315.586,1329.079,"If a man is giving $25 a month support and he goes to Alabama and he sends back $25 a month, you still would make him come back and go to jail?"
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1329.079,1330.596,Not in that particular instance.
1980.80-850,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1330.596,1331.146,That's right.
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1332.364,1335.149,"No, he would not be guilty of child abandonment because he--"
1980.80-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1335.149,1338.534,"No, I'm telling you, he says he has abandoned the child."
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1338.534,1339.901,"--Well, there are two prongs, Your Honor."
1980.80-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1339.901,1340.986,"Yes, that's what I thought."
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1340.986,1347.907,"You have to abandon your child, desert your parental duties, and then leave the child in a dependent condition."
1980.80-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1351.792,1360.482,He violated a support order and he went away and he changed his mind and sent the money back but he didn't come back.
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1361.634,1367.038,"--I think he would still be susceptible to this charge, Your Honor, because he needs to follow--"
1980.80-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1367.038,1369.254,He needs to be taught a lesson?
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1369.254,1370.69,"--Well, sometimes, Your Honor."
1980.80-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1370.69,1374.207,It's sometimes called a pound of flesh.
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1374.207,1384.013,"Well, Your Honor, sometimes it's called a typical drifting absentee father who comes into one court and says, of course, I'll pay, and he pays for a few months and then goes on."
1980.80-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1384.749,1386.949,You don't ever catch them.
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1386.949,1407.029,"--It's very difficult, Your Honor, it really is, and I think that is one of the crucial reasons that Georgia needs this felony provision of the child abandonment statute, simply in order to be able to get this type of person back if need be."
1980.80-850,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1433.963,1441.419,"Now, Ms. Cosgrove, this statute says that the felony shall be reducible to a misdemeanor."
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1445.404,1455.526,"Your Honor, this can either be by the recommendation of the jury and then has to be approved by the judge, or the judge on his own motion can reduce the felony."
1980.80-850,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1455.526,1456.428,The prosecutor can't do it?
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1457.428,1459.98,Not to my understanding.
1980.80-850,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1469.119,1471.021,Shall be reducible to a misdemeanor.
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1473.823,1480.661,"Basically, in the discretion of the judge, Your Honor, because the jury can recommend it but the judge has to approve."
1980.80-850,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1480.661,1481.377,Has to do it.
1980.80-850,0,18743,carol_atha_cosgrove,,1481.377,1483.346,That's correct.
1980.80-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1514.015,1516.5,Mr. Bonner.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1516.5,1517.034,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1595.602,1602.84,"I think the question before the Court, before you get to that, is, what does the 5th Circuit's opinion mean?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1608.11,1610.596,"Not completely, Your Honor."
1980.80-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1620.384,1620.903,By all means.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1620.903,1622.486,Revive it.
1980.80-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.49,1679.942,What's the matter with that?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1679.942,1685.244,"--Well, quite a bit is the matter with that, Your Honor, because the right to travel is a constitutionally secured right."
1980.80-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1685.244,1700.136,"Well, but certainly someone who is subject to not leaving the state under conditions of bail can't exercise his right to travel to visit his sick mother in Alabama."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1700.136,1709.692,"Yes, sir, that's correct, but that person is accused, the restriction on his right to travel, for example, could be relieved by a court, it could be relieved... there are adjustments."
1980.80-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1709.692,1712.477,There are all sorts of restrictions on right to travel.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1712.477,1712.81,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1740.661,1742.496,He could migrate.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1748.517,1748.933,That's true.
1980.80-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1748.933,1759.339,"Well, that's what we're talking about, whether that's unconstitutional, to make the abandonment a felony if he's left the state."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1759.339,1774.931,"In effect, what you are doing is inferring or raising, the statute I should say is doing, is making a presumption, erecting a presumption that any parent who leaves the state for any reason without even any nexus to the offense of abandonment--"
1980.80-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.931,1785.206,"Well, do you think it would be... I suppose you would say it would be just as unconstitutional if they made it a misdemeanor to abandon the child and another misdemeanor to leave the state after having abandoned the child?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1785.206,1787.391,"--No, sir, there would be no equal protection problem there."
1980.80-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1787.391,1787.841,Why?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1787.841,1788.791,It would be the same difference.
1980.80-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.791,1792.626,"It would certainly bear on the right to travel, wouldn't it?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1795.945,1797.014,"Oh, I see what you mean."
1980.80-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1807.702,1810.737,Why would you have to have an intent element?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1810.737,1812.587,"--Well, you've got to at least have some connection."
1980.80-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1814.739,1820.643,"The statute says, if you abandon the child, you have committed a misdemeanor."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1826.98,1832.433,"--Actually... Actually, Your Honor, the statute said, a misdemeanor to abandon your child, and/if the parent leaves the state it's a felony."
1980.80-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.933,1838.554,"Well, I know, but you would make the same argument if there were two misdemeanors."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1838.554,1841.006,"--Well, no, I don't believe we would."
1980.80-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1848.51,1849.029,Yes?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1849.029,1853.564,"--that's an encumbrance on the right to travel, and admittedly."
1980.80-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1853.564,1854.581,But a valid one.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1854.581,1855.516,That's a valid one.
1980.80-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1858.235,1861.103,But you insist that there be an intent requirement?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1861.103,1861.737,"No, sir, no."
1980.80-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1904.614,1906.132,Let's alter that a little bit.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1913.586,1915.155,"--No problem whatsoever, Your Honor."
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1934.049,1935.918,How does this affect his right to travel?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1938.52,1940.203,"--Well, now, it might not--"
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1940.203,1944.024,But if he took care of those children.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1944.791,1945.341,"--Yes, sir."
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1945.341,1947.709,And he wouldn't violate any statute of Georgia?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1947.709,1948.276,That's right.
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1948.276,1952.261,So how does this case involve the right to travel?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1952.261,1953.863,Same way Aptheker did.
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1959.167,1960.101,Come on.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1961.702,1967.439,"Well, let me back up, too, because you've got to, you've raised what is really the next issue, whose right to travel is affected here?"
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1967.439,1968.572,But it doesn't affect it.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1970.641,1971.791,"Well, Your Honor--"
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1971.791,1974.443,"So, he didn't... the first one didn't even bother him."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1974.443,1975.276,--You're assuming--
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1975.276,1976.712,Didn't he travel twice?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1976.712,1978.095,--You're assuming a couple things.
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1978.095,1982.282,Do I assume that he traveled twice?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1982.282,1984.466,"Oh, he traveled abundantly."
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.466,1986.018,"Yes, he was a traveling man."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,1986.018,1987.618,Even more when he was in the Army.
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1998.914,2002.631,It doesn't involve my right to travel because I haven't abandoned any children.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2002.631,2007.099,"No, sir, but if you were a poor mill worker in Griffin, Georgia--"
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2007.099,2007.395,But I'm not.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2007.395,2012.133,"--No, but I'm trying to tell you who's... I'm trying to answer the question of whose right to travel it affects."
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2026.143,2027.809,It is because he's poor?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2027.809,2028.459,--That's true.
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2029.778,2032.547,Do you think a poor man would be traveling twice?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2032.547,2033.613,--Poor and he traveled twice.
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2033.613,2034.547,"Yes, he's poor."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2034.547,2035.332,This is exactly the situation--
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2035.332,2037.682,Did he borrow the money or something?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2037.682,2037.951,--I'm sorry.
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2038.617,2042.436,Could he have used that money he used to travel to pay for his children?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2042.436,2043.586,He didn't go far.
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2068.151,2074.422,"Well, if my opinion said what you think it says, why in the world do you think I'm asking these questions?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2074.422,2075.824,--I don't know.
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2077.642,2078.909,"Mr. Bonner, can I ask you?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2078.909,2079.642,"--Yes, sir, Justice Stevens."
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2079.642,2081.061,I'm not sure I understand your position on one thing.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2094.701,2096.603,I don't see any problem whatsoever with that.
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2096.603,2100.122,"So, your whole argument turns on the absence of intent?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2100.122,2101.541,Not necessarily.
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2110.83,2113.932,"Well, it's promiscuous in the sense that it applies when there's no intent."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2113.932,2118.517,"--No intent, no purpose, no connection with the offense."
1980.80-850,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2119.886,2123.921,It would be just as though a state should make it criminal offense to travel?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2123.921,2124.99,"I'm sorry, Justice Stewart?"
1980.80-850,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2124.99,2135.128,"Well, if a state made it a criminal offense for anybody to leave Georgia, that would be an extreme example of what you find invalid about this case?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2135.128,2136.714,And it would not analytically be different from this case.
1980.80-850,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2136.714,2137.23,That's correct.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2137.23,2138.064,That's it exactly.
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2138.064,2139.932,Except that it would be after having committed an offense?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2139.932,2141.399,That's what we've got here.
1980.80-850,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2143.118,2149.538,"But the reason this is a felony, not a misdemeanor, is because your client left the State of Georgia."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2149.538,2152.54,--Because he exercised a right the Constitution gave him.
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2152.54,2153.157,That's all he did.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2154.426,2155.292,"Well, it happened."
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2158.911,2161.196,After having committed the first element of a two element offense?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2168.134,2175.089,"If he had run from Phenix City down to Tybee Light and hidden out in the dunes down there, he'd be guilty of a misdemeanor."
1980.80-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2175.089,2182.376,"I thought you had previously conceded that if he'd committed any crime and then left the state to avoid prosecution, they could double the penalty?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2182.376,2182.759,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2187.613,2191.132,"Not the precise statute, but you tell me what's the distinction?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2191.132,2191.782,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1980.80-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2204.123,2205.492,To avoid prosecution.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2205.492,2206.425,--No problem.
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2217.282,2223.42,"What if a statute said that it shall be a crime to escape from prison; shall be a misdemeanor, say, to escape from prison?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2233.809,2235.311,"That's a much tougher question, Your Honor."
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2235.311,2237.346,How's it different?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2237.346,2243.917,"One thing that makes it different is... as a matter of fact, maybe that's a welcome question for me."
1980.80-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2265.596,2270.248,"Yes, but the reason they may not have been prosecuted is that they left the state and couldn't be reached."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2270.248,2274.869,"Oh, well, Your Honor, I think later the problem of their being reached is going to dissipate."
1980.80-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2277.988,2298.834,"Do you think Georgia could enact a ""blue sky"" law making it a criminal offense to misrepresent something in a prospectus about a security and completely omit any requirement that the misrepresentation be intentional?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2298.834,2299.701,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-850,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2316.946,2323.869,"Well, there are an awful lot of crimes that have emerged in the past 50 years that don't require any intent at all."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2323.869,2324.669,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-850,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2347.567,2357.44,"You'd have no case at all, Mr. Bonner, would you, if people who abandon their children and didn't leave the state were also guilty of felonies?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2357.44,2358.106,No problem at all.
1980.80-850,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2358.89,2360.242,You'd have no case at all?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2360.242,2361.008,--No case at all.
1980.80-850,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2362.26,2366.529,So your case depends upon the fact that other people are treated more leniently?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2366.529,2367.046,That's right.
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2385.123,2397.331,"Do you suppose it would be constitutional for Georgia to pass a statute that said, if a parent abandons a child, that parent may not leave the state?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2397.331,2399.25,Let me run that by.
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.954,2408.989,What they've done here is something less extreme.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2419.013,2425.584,Our problem here with this particular statute is its impact upon a broad group of people.
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2435.206,2436.292,"No, he's not charged."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2443.762,2444.346,"--Okay, I'll back up."
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2445.248,2446.414,Georgia couldn't do that?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2446.414,2446.714,No.
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.714,2453.753,"That's not an equal protection problem, that's just a flat violation of the right to travel, to impose that restriction on a person who is guilty of a misdemeanor."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2458.855,2463.292,But there you've got... one who escapes from prison knows he escaped from prison.
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.292,2467.177,"Well, by hypothesis, here, one who abandons a child knows he's abandoned the child."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2467.177,2468.513,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2471.398,2474.583,"Well, he's not guilty unless he willfully and voluntarily abandons the child."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2474.583,2480.437,"--In your hypothetical, you've got a carefully circumscribed group on which the statute impacts, and we don't have that here."
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2480.437,2482.521,Those who willfully abandon their children.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2482.521,2483.439,"Well, here you've got--"
1980.80-850,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2483.439,2484.539,Same group in this case.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2484.539,2485.606,--You've got parents.
1980.80-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2491.293,2494.079,This is true of a person under indictment who flees the state.
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2498.198,2501.75,"And the restrictions on him are reasonable, but what you've got--"
1980.80-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2501.75,2507.138,Why are they more reasonable or less reasonable than with the misdemeanor that Justice Stevens postulated to you?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2507.138,2517.177,"--Well, because that's a reasonable intrusion onto the right to travel, vis a vis the state's interest in having him there and prosecuting him."
1980.80-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.825,2571.429,Do you question at all the authority state to criminalize the failure to support a child?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2571.429,2573.114,"No, sir, none at all."
1980.80-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.114,2584.921,"Even though it's criminalizing not paying a debt, in a sense?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2586.238,2588.94,"Well, I have no qualms about that."
1980.80-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2592.244,2598.148,"--Yes, I know, but no part of your case questions at all the authority of the state to criminalize?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2598.148,2607.004,"No, sir, I think there are a lot of policy reasons why not, and I think that's why you've got URESA, because of the judgments that the state made that this kind of problem is better approached civilly."
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2607.004,2611.372,You agree that the jury could have made it a misdemeanor?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2611.372,2612.908,"Yes, but that's just entirely discretionary."
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2612.908,2614.191,"Oh, I see, you agree to that?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2615.008,2616.109,"Yes, sir, they, could have done it."
1980.80-850,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2619.994,2621.963,But they could have done that in your case?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2621.963,2623.129,"--Yes, sir."
1980.80-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2793.991,2800.595,"Well, what about the initial interest of the state in keeping the fellow within reach so that they can collect child support?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2806.083,2812.203,"Well, because in effect it attaches a special penalty to any parent's right to travel--"
1980.80-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2812.203,2812.97,"Well, the right to travel--"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2812.97,2815.172,"--whether he's going to come back, whether he's not going to come back."
1980.80-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2815.172,2829.764,"--All right, accepting for the moment the fact that it burdens the right to travel, then there must be a compelling interest to justify it, and what's wrong with keeping him around so that support may be collected?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2829.764,2831.564,"Oh, maybe I should back up."
1980.80-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2833.166,2833.516,"Well, I know."
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2837.118,2846.024,"--Well, that might be how the Chief Justice's question a minute ago makes sense about one under indictment can't leave the state."
1980.80-850,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2865.521,2873.308,"Although Georgia, surely Georgia could not make it a criminal offense for any Georgia parent to leave the state?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2873.308,2874.643,"No, it couldn't."
1980.80-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2886.685,2887.251,On the other hand--
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2887.251,2893.305,"And then you'll have Alabama on the other side saying, if he brings his children in, he's got to post bond to make sure they don't become public charges."
1980.80-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2893.305,2902.278,--Are you suggesting the state couldn't adopt a felony statute that they couldn't leave the state if they left dependent minor children behind them?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2902.278,2904.496,I don't think the state could.
1980.80-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2904.496,2907.948,"Well, what's the statute except that?"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2911.083,2912.418,That's exactly why the statute is wrong.
1980.80-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2912.418,2914.051,"Yes, but you say they can't--"
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2914.051,2914.701,Is bad.
1980.80-850,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2914.701,2916.786,--That's your reason for saying it's bad?
1980.80-850,1,28964,james_c_bonner_jr,,2916.786,2917.603,"Yes, sir."
