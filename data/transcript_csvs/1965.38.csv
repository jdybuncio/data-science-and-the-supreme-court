1965.38,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,24.615,"Number 38, Alfred D. Rosenblatt, Petitioner, versus Frank P. Baer."
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,26.912,31.908,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,311.885,313.463,"You say, there's a different contract?"
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,313.463,314.804,"Yes, Your Honor there was --"
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,314.804,318.535,Is that or is this a contract under which he was employed?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,318.535,321.462,He was employed for approximately nine years.
1965.38,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,349.282,351.984,Is that contract in the record from --
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,351.984,352.949,"Yes, it is Your Honor."
1965.38,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,358.809,361.864,"Well, I see you filed a transcript of record (Voice Overlap)"
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,361.864,363.465,"Yes we have, Your Honor."
1965.38,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,363.465,364.016,I see the context is in there.
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,364.016,365.881,And the exhibits are here before you.
1965.38,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,365.881,379.613,"And did you just tell us that at the time that the alleged libel occurred, the respondent was employed on a week to week or month to month?"
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,379.613,383.975,"No Your Honor, the respondent was not employed at the time the libel was --"
1965.38,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,383.975,394.791,"I beg your pardon, but when -- as of the time to which the libel relates, was he employed on the long -- on the term contract or was he being employed week to week?"
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,394.791,405.085,"Well, I've said that the contract at that time which was the second one he had had, had a provision that it was to continue after the two-year period from week to week."
1965.38,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,405.085,407.396,And this was after the two-year period?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,407.396,408.541,Yes it was.
1965.38,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,408.541,409.554,Thank you.
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,409.554,443.249,"Now, under the written contract, he had supervision and control over collection of fees and charges, disbursement of fund -- some funds and approval or disapproval of the disbursement of others, the keeping of records, the hiring and firing of employees who were paid by public funds, depositing of cash, supervision of all operations including ski lifts, ski school, cafeteria, gift shop, ski shop, rental of equipment, maintenance of public property, purchases, construction and all other activities carried on at the area."
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,443.249,445.885,And from what funds were his salary is paid?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,445.885,447.559,They were paid from public funds.
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,447.559,452.105,That is not without relation to the proceeds of the operation of the recreational area?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,452.105,452.353,No.
1965.38,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,573.067,574.29,Who picked them?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,574.29,574.888,Pardon me?
1965.38,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,574.888,575.636,Who picked them?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,575.636,578.277,They're picked by the county delegation.
1965.38,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,578.277,579.47,County was that?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,579.47,588.986,That's the elected representatives to the state legislature who run the county affairs within the area where they're elected.
1965.38,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,630.424,636.969,"Is this authority -- I beg your pardon, is this authority part-time?"
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,636.969,637.739,Yes sir.
1965.38,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,637.739,642.264,That is to say they were just citizens who were selected for this purpose.
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,642.264,643.344,That's correct.
1965.38,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,643.344,653.189,"And as of the time to which libel related, there was a contract between this authority and the respondent here, is that right?"
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,653.189,658.18,"At the time, pardon me, at the time that the -- of which the libel related?"
1965.38,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,658.18,659.241,Yes.
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,659.241,675.798,"The respondent here was the manager of the Belknap area who was hired by the county commissioners, the political group, under written contract which by statute had to be approved by the county delegation."
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,753.127,757.725,How are we to read the New Hampshire Supreme Court's opinion on this question?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,757.725,758.37,Pardon me sir?
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,758.37,762.498,How are we to read the New Hampshire Supreme Court opinion on this question?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,762.498,771.761,"Well, the New Hampshire Supreme Court opinion sir, it seems to us misinterprets completely the doctrine as laid down in the Sullivan case."
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,806.983,812.122,"Well, are we to treat this that the New Hampshire Supreme Court thought he was a public official?"
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,812.122,831.772,"The Supreme Court in New Hampshire didn't particularly discuss whether he was a public official or not because in their opinion, it seems to me, they don't differentiate between the public official one who's not because they indicate that their rule anyway is as liberal as the New York Times case and they said, “We see no conflict between the two.”"
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,831.772,833.108,Even if he were a public official?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,833.108,854.704,"Even if he were, and we think the case is clearly wrong on that as you will see if you examine the charge of the jury, and I'll give you part of it if I have time, and then note that the court said that we think this is the law and we certainly don't think that's what the Supreme Court intended to say here."
1965.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1265.032,1270.786,"Well that would just -- I don't know if that would be any easier test than who's the public official, wouldn't it?"
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1270.786,1271.96,It would not.
1965.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1276.858,1278.376,It says that it ought to be broadened --
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1278.376,1278.533,Correct.
1965.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1278.533,1281.031,-- but you are not suggesting that it would be a different test --
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1281.031,1281.187,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1281.187,1282.676,-- to be sure but you're not suggesting to be easier.
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1282.676,1283.803,I'm not suggesting that.
1965.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1297.551,1306.001,You don't -- do you suggest here that as far as -- does as far as you want to go include the ski patrol?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1306.001,1310.196,"Not as far as we want to go, Your Honor, because the ski patrol --"
1965.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1310.196,1312.661,"Well, (Voice Overlap) as far as I can see in your --"
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1312.661,1313.621,Pardon?
1965.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1313.621,1319.638,As far as I can see there's nothing in the standard as you would apply that would exclude the ski patrol.
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1319.638,1335.165,Well what I'm -- what I'm saying Your Honor is that as far as our case is concerned this can be decided on the facts and leave for future determination the question of how far down the various echelon of government should go.
1965.38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1348.15,1358.552,"How do you suggest we decide it on the facts, I mean, we got to decide it against some -- some major against some standard and what is that as you -- how do you put it?"
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1358.552,1368.03,"Well, this is -- it's rather difficult in any case like this to actually come right down to a decision, as Justice Fortas meant."
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1394.738,1401.867,"Well if that so then surely the member of the ski patrol has a function in an official capacity, doesn't it?"
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1401.867,1407.156,If -- if the criticism of him were with respect to his duty on the ski patrol.
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1407.156,1409.635,Or the way a dog catcher performs --
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1409.635,1409.699,That's correct.
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1409.699,1413.593,"-- services a dog catcher, or a garbage collector -- services of a garbage collector."
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1413.593,1414.974,That's right.
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1437.364,1447.9,"Well, that's only to say that his official capacity is one which involves rather heavier responsibilities, and perhaps the member of the ski patrol or the other?"
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1447.9,1448.092,That's right.
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1448.092,1448.753,Is that it?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1448.753,1451.888,That's correct.
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1473.545,1479.738,"Well, here again, I would suppose the public would have a legitimate interest in how a dog catcher performs his official duty as a dog catcher."
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1479.738,1488.125,"Quite possible sir, I -- I think it's quite possible that even this definition might be extended quite a bit beyond the facts for the case."
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1488.125,1508.6,"Many people, I suppose, would think that if my public image believed in who are not or treating animals cruelly make it to the slightest public interest and say that this man is killing dogs without any reason for it, he's doing it cruelly and so forth."
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1514.408,1515.411,I think that's correct.
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1523.536,1524.782,I understand.
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1528.737,1529.331,That's correct.
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1529.331,1532.005,-- has more extensive dealings for the public?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1532.005,1532.903,Yes.
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1532.903,1535.391,And some money with this other man have a dog.
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1535.391,1537.371,That's right.
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1671.375,1674.446,May I ask you one or two questions about the facts that I'm interested in?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1674.446,1674.874,Yes.
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1674.874,1677.745,What -- is this a county a job or a city job?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1677.745,1678.959,It's a county job.
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1678.959,1680.487,What's the population of the county?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1680.487,1682.492,"About 30,000."
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1682.492,1684.389,Is it an industrial county?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1684.389,1689.027,Laconia is an industrial town but it has a large summer population.
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1699.672,1706.0,Is the salary paid for this job one that makes it rather competitive and many people would like to have it?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1706.0,1708.035,"Well, I think there are many people who would like to have it."
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1717.105,1718.678,Can it perform any other task?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1721.385,1728.106,"No, this is a fulltime job of operating the Belknap Recreation Area, fulltime employee."
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1728.106,1730.634,But (Voice Overlap) it's a rather important job of the new community.
1965.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1730.634,1731.994,I beg your pardon.
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1731.994,1732.438,I'm sorry.
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1732.438,1735.152,Accepted as a rather important job of the new community.
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1735.152,1736.677,Yes it is and --
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1736.677,1740.009,The reason of the summer recreation purposes and so forth?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1740.009,1741.301,Yes it is.
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1797.821,1800.732,Did you say it's an unpaid column?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1800.732,1802.408,"Yes it was, Your Honor."
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1802.408,1804.282,What is the man's business who wrote it?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1804.282,1812.377,"Well, he ran a store and being a -- well sometime ago, he had some training in journalism."
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1821.208,1822.612,Regularly?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1822.612,1823.025,Pardon?
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1823.025,1823.778,Regularly?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1823.778,1824.483,Regularly.
1965.38,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1863.703,1868.286,Well is this man's employment terminable at will of the county commissioners?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1868.286,1880.379,After his contract had expired and was continued by the terms of it from week to week it was terminable on notice by the county commissioners.
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1880.506,1883.291,Is the newspaper a defendant in this action?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1883.291,1884.304,Is the newspaper?
1965.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1884.304,1886.624,Was the newspaper a defendant in this action?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1886.624,1897.044,The newspaper was originally a defendant and that case was apparently settled out of court before our case came to trial.
1965.38,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1898.638,1904.399,Was his week to week status due to the change in the statute?
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1904.399,1916.61,"No, the statute did not proscribe any particular term but only proscribed that there should be a manager who would be hired by the county commissioners, but with the approval of the county delegation."
1965.38,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1922.51,1923.893,"Oh, I see."
1965.38,0,16640,arthur_h_nighswander,,1923.893,1929.599,Thank you.
1965.38,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1929.599,1931.125,Mr. Brown.
1965.38,1,41019,stanley_m_brown,,1931.125,1933.429,If it please the Court.
1965.38,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2267.84,2270.533,Why did they tell him not to tell the public?
1965.38,1,41019,stanley_m_brown,,2270.533,2294.847,"Because when this man raised these questions, the county commissioners immediately sent word to him at his store in Laconia, he owns two, that if he wanted those facts, all he had to do was to go down to the end of the street, it's perhaps 700 yards and all of the answers to all of his questions were a matter of public record at the courthouse and he was welcome to come in and they'd all be made available to him."
