2018.17-1094,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.25,8.175,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-1094, Nutraceutical Corporation versus Lambert. Mr. Hueston."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,8.175,22.035,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the proceedings below, Respondent filed his Rule 23(f) petition months late, and Nutraceutical timely objected."
2018.17-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,64.82,83.755,"Counsel, I thought that both sides agreed that if the motion for reconsideration is filed within 14 days, within that period, then there is tolling until the motion is decided."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,85.66,88.2,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.17-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,88.36,90.97,And isn't that a form of equitable tolling?
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,90.97,94.03,"It is not a form of equitable tolling, Your Honor."
2018.17-1094,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,156.9,178.85,"Mr. Hueston, given the reasons that you just stated for that rule, why is the rule limited to a motion for reconsideration that's filed during the 14-day window? In other words, suppose the motion for reconsideration was filed in a timely manner for such a motion but after the 14-day period. Why wouldn't the same reasons apply?"
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,178.85,251.99,"Because, Your Honor, if that reasoning applied, in this instance, for instance, there was actually no deadline for filing of a motion for reconsideration in the Central District of California, but let's assume for purposes of your question we had a 30-day deadline. If that 30-day deadline were imposed in this case and one could file on the 30th day and begin tolling, that would render the 14-day deliberately small window that the advisory committee drafters created in order to minimize the disruption and delay in the context of class action cases a nullity because, in any instance where you would have a longer deadline for a motion for reconsideration, you could wait out that period and avoid the window that was intentionally created by the drafters. And I would like to direct the Court's attention specifically to the advisory committee notes to the 1998 amendment to Rule 23(f), where they specifically stated the importance of the short window to deliberately keep the time as short as possible."
2018.17-1094,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,251.99,303.29,"It just seems as though the -- the exception that you admit, which is the exception for filing a motion for reconsideration within the 14-day period, also effectively renders that 14-day period a nullity, right, because it stops it in its tracks and then, once the motion for reconsideration has been dealt with, as I understand the agreement between the parties, the -- the clock goes all the way back to the beginning. So given that -- that what you -- the exception you admit renders the 14-day period a nullity, again, I just wonder why the exact same reasons, practices, traditions don't suggest that, for example, as in -- as -- as what -- the example you gave, if the motion for reconsideration is timely filed within 30 days, that as long as you do that, it should have the same effect."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,303.29,313.035,"Justice Kagan, there is no doubt that if the motion for reconsideration is filed, for instance, on the 14th day, there would then be a longer period of time."
2018.17-1094,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,420.7,421.51,On that --
2018.17-1094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,421.51,428.60500005,What happens if there's -- what happens if Hurricane Katrina comes along and no one can reach the courthouse?
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,428.60500005,439.095,"Your Honor, Hurricane Katrina -- so the answer is, Your Honor, the situation in Carlisle was far more grave than Hurricane Katrina."
2018.17-1094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,439.87,445.89499995,"In other words, if Hurricane Katrina comes along and all the courthouses are shut, nobody can get there, everybody loses their motion?"
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,445.89499995,472.99,"Your Honor, in this instance, when you have with Rule 26(f) the emphatic language without the harsh consequences at issue that you do in Carlisle and others, then, if the deadline cannot be abided by within the 14 days, then the opportunity to pursue the petition for permission for interlocutory appeal is lost. Now that may seem like a harsh consequence --"
2018.17-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,472.99,473.4,"Well, didn't the --"
2018.17-1094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,473.4,474.52,I'm not saying harsh consequence.
2018.17-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,474.52,488.245,"-- same Justice say in Carlisle that it wasn't utterly exception-less, so it may be that Hurricane Katrina would fall into that category?"
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,488.245,503.3,"Well, Your Honor, the language in the plurality opinion is that it was plain and unambiguous, and there was simply no room in the text for even legal innocence to justify a single day's delay."
2018.17-1094,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,503.3,503.82,How would we --
2018.17-1094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,503.82,506.78,"But your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, I couldn't hear it."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,516.905,517.2,Yes.
2018.17-1094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,517.2,521.235,"In your opinion, does everybody -- and, you know, there are dozens of motions pending."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,532.705,544.13,"It is our position within this context of a mandatory claim processing rule in the emphatic language that is present here, more so than even in the Carlisle and Robinson cases."
2018.17-1094,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,544.13,555.04999995,"Isn't there -- I -- I may be misremembering this, but isn't there a provision that extends the filing period when the courthouse is closed?"
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,555.04999995,567.145,"Your Honor, there is an exception for accessibility of the courthouse that would apply in that situation."
2018.17-1094,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,567.145,579.185,"Now that doesn't help you with intervening periods, I gather that would not toll in that sense, but if the due date is a date on which the court is inaccessible or formally closed, that would get at least that relief?"
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,579.185,580.37,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1094,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,603.365,624.085,"Well, before we leave -- before we leave 26(b), there is a bit of a complication, right? It says that we can extend time or permit an act to be done after the time expires. And then what it -- after having given that authority to the court, it then takes away the authority to extend the time to file."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,629.525,651.84,"Your Honor, that very issue was addressed in the Robinson case, and that is, with that other issue, can an act be allowed later, the Robinson case found that to allow an act or a filing later would effectively enlarge or extend the period of time, and so, therefore, that would be prohibited."
2018.17-1094,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,651.84,668.50999995,The problem with Carlisle and Robinson is that they were well before our explanation of there being a difference between jurisdiction and non-jurisdiction claim processing rules.
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,675.38,676.925,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1094,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,676.925,730.685,"Justice Gorsuch's question, though, is a fair one because it's the practice of the Supreme Court with respect to filing of amicus briefs that we don't grant extensions but we take late amicus. And so why can't we look at the exact words of 26(b) and say, no, you can't extend the time, but a court has, as it always has, equitable discretion to take something that's filed late because, assuming that the facts qualify as equitable, and that's open to question, I know, in this case, but assuming, why don't we read the provision as it states, a court can permit an act to be done after that time expires?"
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,730.685,736.93,"Justice Sotomayor, let me address -- there were several parts to your question."
2018.17-1094,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,812.53,820.365,So what work does that language then do to permit an act to be done after the deadline?
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,820.365,821.13,And I --
2018.17-1094,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,821.13,826.015,Why doesn't your interpretation itself render that language a nullity?
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,826.015,828.87,"And, Justice Gorsuch, I've been giving thought to that."
2018.17-1094,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,828.87,831.27,I had hoped you might. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,831.27,831.78,Thank you.
2018.17-1094,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,831.78,833.12,So have I. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,833.12,844.515,"And, Your Honor, I believe what that may open the door to are other acts that do not effectively enlarge or extend the period of time."
2018.17-1094,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,850.56,856.44,"Give me an example, though, because 26(b) is entitled extension, extending time."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,866.98,883.36,"Your Honor, it might, for instance, countenance some other related proceeding or action, other than an extension of time on the actual motion for petition for permission to appeal that would be filed."
2018.17-1094,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,887.48,891.51499995,"I'm sorry, you'll need to explain that to me because I'm not following you."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,891.51499995,902.775,"Your Honor, I think the language in 26(b) as construed by Robinson in this instance would preclude an enlargement of the time to file."
2018.17-1094,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,935.685,957.025,"The problem is that we really wouldn't -- yes, you're right, we would be revisiting Robinson, but we would be saying that the words of a statute have meaning, and Robinson read out of that permission the equitable considerations that the very statute permitted."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,957.025,981.52,"Your Honor, this case is actually a stronger case with more emphatic language considered collectively than Robinson and Carlisle because we not only have the equivalent of Rule 45(b) and 26(b), we also have Appellate Rule 2, where there is, of course, the notion of equity and suspending the rules."
2018.17-1094,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,985.05,1023.83,"That's a -- that's a circle with no out because 2 refers to 26(b), and if we read 26(b) the way I suggest, that already builds in the equitable exception. But, in terms of the purpose of the rule, we have previously said that 26(b) gives -- 26(f) gives the court, the trial court, almost unfettered discretion whether to grant the motion to appeal."
2018.17-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1042.785,1046.025,"It's the discretion of the court of appeals, not the district court."
2018.17-1094,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1046.025,1046.54,Yes.
2018.17-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1046.54,1048.82,To give permission to appeal.
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1048.82,1082.585,"Justice Sotomayor, to answer your question, the court of appeals has discretion to accept a timely petition but does not have the discretion to accept an untimely petition because the rule-makers specifically removed that discretion in the language of 26(b) and 2, and there's one other rule that's applicable, and that is Appellate Rule 5(a)(2), which further reinforces that a petition must be filed within 14 days."
2018.17-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1082.585,1092.505,"And Rule 26(b), it says generally the court may grant an extension of time."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1106.89999995,1108.52,Yes.
2018.17-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1113.62,1114.62,"Yes, it does."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1114.62,1127.46,"Because, in that instance, we can clearly see the intent of the rule-makers in providing for a broad range of equitable discretion and then withdrawing it in the particular instance of 26(b)."
2018.17-1094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1127.46,1152.81500005,"What do you think in -- I think it was Justice Ginsburg's concurrence in Carlisle, where she said that the Court had recognized one ""sharply honed equitable exception"" -- it doesn't have the word ""equitable,"" but it means it -- ""to mandatory claim processing rules."" The unique circumstances exception."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1152.81500005,1154.29,Your Honor --
2018.17-1094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1154.29,1156.13,Is that -- do you agree with that?
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1156.13,1162.055,-- I agree that Justice Ginsburg filed a concurring opinion and described -- (Laughter.)
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1162.055,1180.6,"-- the unique circumstances doctrine as, indeed, a sharply honed exception that covers cases in which the trial judge misled a party who could have and probably would have taken timely action had the trial judge conveyed correct, rather than incorrect, information."
2018.17-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1180.6,1192.96,"I believe the example was the trial judge, you have until X date to file, and the litigant filed on X date, but, in fact, the judge was wrong and it should have been an earlier date."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1192.96,1193.83,That's right.
2018.17-1094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1210.01,1210.565,But that's -- that's different.
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1235.33,1236.77,"Your Honor, there has -- yes."
2018.17-1094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1236.77,1237.3,Yes? Okay.
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1237.3,1247.03,"There has been an exception generally in several cases that has been described, the unique circumstances doctrine."
2018.17-1094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1260.08,1269.555,"Well, that's what I wonder, because I could see -- would you agree or not agree? Holding 1, this is not jurisdictional."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1282.71,1293.43,"Yes, Your Honor, if -- if I understand Holding 2, we are addressing not the facts here but claim processing rules that would be other than this sort of emphatic --"
2018.17-1094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1293.43,1295.60500005,I'm address -- I'm just saying in general --
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1295.60500005,1296.39,Yes.
2018.17-1094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1296.39,1301.815,"-- with claim processing rules, there are equitable exceptions."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1301.815,1302.42,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1302.42,1305.25,At least for unique circumstances.
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1315.215,1326.38,"Your Honor, I am arguing in this case that the Court need not reach the application of the unique circumstances doctrine, and, factually, if we attempt to apply it, it does not apply here."
2018.17-1094,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1326.38,1340.17,"Well, are we slicing the baloney pretty thinly? I mean, what's unique, all right? A judge misinforming a party about the time remaining to appeal sounds pretty terrible."
2018.17-1094,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1350.235,1367.54,"Why aren't those all unique circumstances too? Don't you really have to argue that Thompson's wrong and that, in fact, the rules here preclude any equitable tolling, and unique circumstances is a species of equitable tolling? Doesn't that have to be your argument?"
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1367.54,1378.0,"Your Honor, doctrinally, that is our argument, that when you have language as we do at issue here, emphatic and mandatory, it precludes the reading of all equitable exceptions."
2018.17-1094,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1378.0,1381.43,"Well, Mr. Hueston, you can't please everyone here. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1381.43,1383.59,"I'm trying my best, Your Honor."
2018.17-1094,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1383.59,1401.06,"I think you're going to have to choose between nothing, no time, never, and, sure, you can reserve some -- the possibility of an equitable exception in circumstances that are different from the ones here."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1402.685,1409.61,"Your Honor, again, we don't believe the Court needs to reach the application of the unique circumstances doctrine."
2018.17-1094,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1431.15,1434.49,"I mean, it's not clear that you face this binary choice."
2018.17-1094,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1460.93,1465.43,"So, if there's a Martian invasion, there would be an exception for that."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1472.59,1474.75,"That's right, Your Honor."
2018.17-1094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1474.75,1501.615,"Well, it's rather hard to -- what is -- what is the answer to what Justice Alito says? We have the answer, as the Chief Justice points out, where the courthouse is closed, but one can think of epidemics or fires in the north -- and, you know, that's exactly right -- and what -- what do we write about that? What, in your opinion, do we write? A forest fire keeps the lawyer from the courthouse, which is open."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1503.74,1504.26,All right.
2018.17-1094,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1537.74,1545.585,"Well, that's going to be too late in the real world of how the litigation transpires, though, you would admit? Too -- too late as a practical matter."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1545.585,1563.005,"Well, in the -- Justice Kavanaugh, in the context of class action cases, typically -- and, of course, the rules allow this -- you can continue to challenge the class certification or decertification order. So, practically, there is no catastrophic lost ability."
2018.17-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1577.275,1592.38,Would it be fair to say that your position is not necessarily never but not more than hardly ever? (Laughter.)
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1592.38,1593.6,"Repeat the question, Your Honor."
2018.17-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1595.07,1595.29,Yes.
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1621.75,1626.085,"That could be the pathway, obviously, the Court does take."
2018.17-1094,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1637.79,1638.08,What -- what --
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1638.08,1639.985,"Here, it factually does not apply."
2018.17-1094,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1639.985,1651.0,"Picking up on Justice Kagan's question at the beginning, is the exception for a motion for reconsideration that's filed within 14 days, is that equitable, or what is that exception?"
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1651.0,1653.76,"No, it is not an equitable exception, Your Honor."
2018.17-1094,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1653.76,1655.48,"Well, it's not written in the rules."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1655.48,1660.27,"It is based -- according to U.S. v. Dieter, it is not written in the rules, but it is instead based on --"
2018.17-1094,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1660.27,1676.37,"If it's not written in the rules, doesn't it have to be characterized as equitable? I'm still not understanding where that comes from, and -- and I'm also not understanding what sense that makes, really, because, if you filed a timely motion for reconsideration, you have filed a timely motion for reconsideration."
2018.17-1094,0,63059,john_hueston,,1684.76,1731.425,"What's -- what's wrong with that, Your Honor, is that it departs, and the Court can revisit, the teaching of Healy that, to keep the appellate right alive, the motion for reconsideration has to be filed within the applicable time, in this case 14 days, and that has been the rule that has applied here. And motions for reconsideration have not been described as equitable exceptions. And, again, the point I made earlier that they have been applied to delay in the context of the application of jurisdictional rules shows that they are not regarded by this Court historically as equitable in nature. Mr. Chief Justice, if I could reserve the remaining time for rebuttal."
2018.17-1094,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1731.425,1740.6800001,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Herstoff."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,1740.6800001,1767.935,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For three main reasons, the court of appeals properly decided to consider this appeal on the merits. First, the appeal was timely within the plain language of the federal rules. Second, the court of appeals properly determined that Rule 23(f) is subject to equitable tolling. And, third, the appeal was properly considered based upon this Court's decisions in Harris Truck Lines and Thompson."
2018.17-1094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1778.43,1785.52,"Rule 59(e) deals with final judgment at the end of the case, the final judgment on the merits."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,1800.94499995,1810.23,"I submit that the -- the language of Rule 59(e) refers to judgments, which are defined as orders from which an appeal lies under Rule --"
2018.17-1094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1810.23,1828.77,"Yes, but -- but those words, an order from which the appeal -- an appeal lies, means an appeal as of right. And the one thing I think we can all agree on here is permission to appeal the grant or denial of class action is not an appeal of right."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,1828.77,1832.64,And I agree with that. It is a permissive appeal.
2018.17-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1842.98,1851.24,"You read -- just to clarify, you read -- you read Rule 54 to apply to appeals not just as of right?"
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,1851.24,1853.635,"That's right, Justice Kavanaugh, I do."
2018.17-1094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1868.77,1892.42,"But in the context of 59(a) -- 54(a), it is an appeal of right. If you segment out one party and a judgment is finalized to that party or a particular claim, the judgment can be made final as to that claim even though other claims are pending."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,1896.08,1901.405,"Well, Rule 54(b) does permit a district court to enter final judgment with respect to certain claims."
2018.17-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1918.61,1930.7,"Can I just ask on the Rule 59 question, again, suppose a local rule gave you 45 days for a motion for reconsideration, but Rule 59 has the 28-day. What's your position on that?"
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,1930.7,1950.52,"If -- if Rule 59 were determined to apply here, then that would not work because Rule 59 has a non-extendable 28-day period. If it is not a Rule 59 motion, though, I think in -- in your example there would be a local rule that gives -- I think you said 45 days, that would be a timely reconsideration motion."
2018.17-1094,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1950.52,1953.605,Why would that be -- why would that even be permitted?
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,1953.605,1956.49,Why -- why would it be permitted to --
2018.17-1094,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1956.49,1957.065,Yeah.
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,1968.335,1986.635,"Because, there, this Court has long held that a timely reconsideration motion will suspend the time to appeal. And in the Dieter, Healy, and Ibarra line of cases, those dealt with the criminal rules, where there is no specific provision for reconsideration motions."
2018.17-1094,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1986.635,2016.83,"Well, it might be that -- that filing it within the period allowed under the particular rule at issue here would toll the time to appeal, but I don't see where anything -- I'm not sure the basis for the idea that filing a motion -- forget about Rule 23 for the moment -- filing a motion for reconsideration, so-called, tolls the time to appeal. As I said, there's no mention of that in the Rules of Civil Procedure."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2034.07,2039.21,"Well, I think the -- this Court's decision in Ibarra explains this well."
2018.17-1094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2099.305,2109.74,But there's nothing inconsistent with the 14-day limit of seeking permission to appeal and making a motion to reconsider.
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2112.45000005,2121.43,"It's true that you could do both, but then you'd have the district court and the court of appeals considering the exact same order at the same time."
2018.17-1094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2126.245,2134.59,"Well, the court of appeals says we'll wait -- we'll wait on the district court's decision on the motion for reconsideration."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2134.59,2158.475,"The court of appeals would have the discretion to stay their proceedings, just like district courts have discretion to stay their proceedings. But -- but, still, you'd have the same on the order that's up at both the court of appeals and at the district court. And I think it makes more sense to say that when the reconsideration motion is pending at the district court, there should be no need to file a petition for permission to appeal."
2018.17-1094,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2158.475,2172.925,What -- what did you understand the district court to be saying when it set the motion for reconsideration? What -- what was -- what were the -- what's the -- what did it tell you about timing deadlines?
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2172.925,2174.01,"Well, the district court said --"
2018.17-1094,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2174.01,2176.47,And what did you infer from what it said?
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2176.47,2187.56,"So I -- I infer from that that the district court was, indeed, going to reconsider this decertification order and, indeed, they suspended, the district court suspended further proceedings."
2018.17-1094,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2189.91,2193.695,"The district court, though, didn't say anything about a time for appeal, is that correct?"
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2193.695,2196.075,"That is true, they did not specifically say that."
2018.17-1094,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2196.075,2198.255,And why doesn't that matter?
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2198.255,2199.12,Okay.
2018.17-1094,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2229.07,2230.59,"Well, but in -- in Thompson, we --"
2018.17-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2230.59,2230.72,What --
2018.17-1094,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2230.72,2231.56,"I'm sorry, please."
2018.17-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2231.56,2238.185,What did you understand us to be saying when we described these types of provisions as mandatory claims processing rules?
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2238.185,2242.5,"I think, in general, it -- it is strict."
2018.17-1094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2252.45,2253.18,But in the cases --
2018.17-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2253.18,2254.435,But we were -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-1094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2254.435,2280.45,"In the cases that said mandatory, Kontrick, Eberhart, it said strictly applied, but the party who would benefit from the rule can waive the rule or forfeit it, but -- but both cases said, if it's properly raised, as it was here, then it applies."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2280.45,2280.99,That's true.
2018.17-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2291.32,2292.42,I'm just trying to figure out.
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2330.78,2348.855,"So I -- I -- I don't think the claim processing rules are necessarily subject to any equitable exception. It's not necessarily subject to good cause exceptions or excusable neglect like -- like most softer deadlines would be. Equitable tolling is different, though."
2018.17-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2355.92,2359.51,"Well, yes, at a time where ""jurisdiction"" meant what we used to think it meant."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2368.845,2381.05,"I think, back then when equitable tolling did not apply, that those were in circumstances, from my understanding, where the time limit is what the Court today would refer to as jurisdictional."
2018.17-1094,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2383.755,2396.735,"Is -- is the upshot of your argument, though, counsel, that so long as it's a non-jurisdictional rule, equitable tolling must always apply? Congress couldn't authorize a truly mandatory statutory deadline?"
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2396.735,2399.0,"No, that is not our position."
2018.17-1094,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2400.17,2400.56,Okay.
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2427.43,2441.02,"Well, I think that -- that as Your Honor referred to with my -- with my co-counsel, Rule 26(b) specifically draws a distinction between extending the time, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, permitting a late filing."
2018.17-1094,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2443.03,2447.77,"Well, we have Robinson that takes care of that problem, he says, so we have precedent there."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2455.065,2486.26,"Well, I think the -- the rules committee actually was a lot clearer in another example where I think the rule would not be subject to equitable exceptions, and that's in Appellate Rule 4(a)(4), specifically the 2016 amendment to 4(a)(4). There, the Court changed the rule to make clear that only a timely Rule 50 or Rule 59 motion, and it's not an untimely Rule 50 or Rule 59 motion, would suspend the time to appeal regardless of what the district court --"
2018.17-1094,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2486.26,2498.94,"Well, what do you think as a standard we should use? That is to say, if it's a jurisdictional rule, I guess that's pretty unwaivable and nothing."
2018.17-1094,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2554.23,2565.93,"-- and various others that are unusual but cry out, okay? Now what about that? I'm not advocating it."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2567.48,2570.99,"I -- I agree completely, Justice Breyer, with -- with what you're saying."
2018.17-1094,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2583.41,2606.62,"If, in fact, we are at sharply honed, special, unique circumstances, how do you win this case? Because what seemed to happen here is it was -- I don't know if it was you, but whatever lawyer went in for your side, within the 14 days, did not even ask the judge to extend the time, at least not in writing."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2614.735,2631.87,"Well, I do think that the -- the Thompson rule applies here, because 10 days after the decertification order, the district court held a status conference during -- during which we asked for permission to file a motion for reconsideration in writing."
2018.17-1094,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2632.78,2640.99,"Counsel, on what ground would we overrule the circuit's rejection of that argument? You raised it below."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2656.56,2662.915,"Well, you're talking about with the Ninth Circuit saying -- saying that unless an exception applies, the petition would be barred?"
2018.17-1094,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2662.915,2663.665,Exactly.
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2663.665,2671.58,"So the -- when the Ninth Circuit said that, it included within that language a reconsideration motion that's filed within the 14 days."
2018.17-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2696.58,2700.595,The -- the unique -- we've talked about unique circumstances.
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2731.63,2738.59,"Well, I think it -- it is a unique circumstance where the district court misadvises the party on how much time --"
2018.17-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2738.59,2750.605,"I mean, I've seen dozens of cases where that has happened. In some, if it's an equitable tolling situation, it's typical that equitable tolling is appropriate, although not always."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2777.32,2798.485,"Well, I think that applying this doctrine is consistent with the federal rules, though, for instance, on Rule 1, and the rules are derived from the old equity rules, so it makes sense that there is some flexibility there when a district court misinforms litigants about the time that they have to file, especially in the context of a non-jurisdictional rule like we have --"
2018.17-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2798.485,2818.73,"Well, then I think you do have to say the exception is when the district court misadvises the litigants, rather than saying ""unique"" but not really meaning unique, because then you get in a situation that Justice Alito was talking about. Most lawyers consider their case unique when they run into something like this, and the judges gives them a lot more flexibility than perhaps the rules committee wanted as well."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2818.73,2819.52,I agree.
2018.17-1094,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2825.28,2833.96,"Yeah, Mr. Herstoff, I don't think this is your fault, right? This is the court's fault in -- in putting a bad label on something that it actually meant when it meant -- meant something else."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2853.31,2854.64,"Yes, I agree, Justice Kagan."
2018.17-1094,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2854.64,2857.80500005,So -- but -- but I don't see where that is here.
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2857.80500005,2868.935,"Where that is? Well, the district court paused the proceedings and specifically said that you -- that a reconsideration motion could be filed by March 12, 2015."
2018.17-1094,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2868.935,2869.51,Yes.
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2883.195,2884.07,That's true.
2018.17-1094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2909.12,2912.03,Has this Court cast any doubt on Thompson?
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2912.03,2941.815,"In the -- in the context of jurisdictional rules, yes, the Court overruled Thompson for jurisdictional deadlines and this Court's decision in Bowles but left it intact for non-jurisdictional rules. And I think with good reason, because non-jurisdictional rules, I think, presumably should be subject to or at least presumptively subject to equitable considerations, such as tolling, such as the -- what the Court has referred to as the unique circumstances doctrine, which I think is a subspecies of tolling or estoppel."
2018.17-1094,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2941.815,2942.46,Well --
2018.17-1094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2942.46,2951.685,I thought mandatory -- the Court has said in -- in the Kontrick line of cases mandatory means inflexible?
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2951.685,2955.2,"And that, I mean, generally is inflexible."
2018.17-1094,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2982.18,2982.75,Counsel --
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,2982.75,2987.8,"-- had established at most a garden variety claim of excusable neglect, so I think tolling is on a different level."
2018.17-1094,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2987.8,3031.68,"-- I -- I think -- I think you have two possible lines of response to Justice Ginsburg's question, and I'm curious which you choose. So, if Thompson doesn't apply to jurisdictional statutes, one could say it does apply to mandatory but inflexible claims processing rules because it's not a species of equitable tolling at all; it is, in fact, a rule of judicial administration that, when it's our fault, shame on us. Or one could say, yeah, let's be honest, it's a form of equitable tolling and, therefore, shouldn't apply, just as it doesn't to jurisdictional rules, it shouldn't apply to mandatory claims processing rules, but should remain a viable option otherwise."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3038.13,3057.38,"I do think that -- that these rules presumably should be subject to equitable tolling and not necessarily just for the district court misleading the parties. However, either way, the judgment should be affirmed because here, in fact, the -- the court did mislead Mr. Lambert into thinking that he had --"
2018.17-1094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3057.38,3061.855,How? The court didn't say one word about permission to appeal.
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3061.855,3071.425,"The court didn't, but I think this is just like Thompson, where the -- where the court said you had this amount of time to seek reconsideration."
2018.17-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3071.425,3083.80999995,Don't the local rules of many courts then miss -- also mislead counsel because the local rules of many courts would have motions for reconsideration that could be filed within periods longer than 14 days?
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3083.80999995,3086.24,"Well, then I think that --"
2018.17-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3086.24,3102.48,"Under your position, all the district court did here was identify a date that was longer than 14 days. The local rule for motions for reconsideration, the local rules of many courts similarly identify a date that's longer than 14 days for motions for reconsideration."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3102.48,3104.04,"Well, I think on that --"
2018.17-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3104.04,3109.07,How would you distinguish what happened here from a local rule that's longer than 14 days?
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3109.07,3113.37,"Well, I think here the district court did set this -- this specific deadline."
2018.17-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3114.59,3123.68,"How would you distinguish a local rule that has a date longer than 14 days, a period longer than 14 days in which you can file a motion for reconsideration?"
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3123.68,3140.02,"Well, I do think that -- that really Rule 59 comes into play here, which says 28 days, but I think it is very unreasonable to interpret Rule 59 to apply here, but even if the Court concludes that it does not, it's at least a reasonable interpretation to say --"
2018.17-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3140.02,3144.85,"And the Rule 59 argument, just to reiterate, depends on your Rule 54 interpretation, correct?"
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3144.85,3145.76,"That's right, yes."
2018.17-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3154.28,3163.83,"You could have the same confusion of a local rule that gives longer than 28 days, for example, the local rule here for motion for reconsideration, but then you're not within the 28 days of Rule 59, right?"
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3163.83,3173.935,I think that's true. The Court has not really had occasion to address the precise contours of when a motion for reconsideration is going to suspend the time to appeal.
2018.17-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3197.32,3207.33,"What do you do with a local rule that has no time limit, as the one here in a motion for reconsideration, a motion is filed a year later or something like that?"
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3207.33,3212.94,"I think, under those circumstances, it becomes a question of reasonableness."
2018.17-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3243.975,3258.19,"You know, sometimes in these unique circumstances situation, if you're focusing on judicial conduct, what we find when we look into it, it's a lot more ambiguous than you may think. And I do think we have to be careful about what we're requiring of the district court judges."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3299.2,3302.02,"Again, I'm not even sure I'm calling it blame."
2018.17-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3308.345,3322.38,"There's nothing misleading about that, I guess is the point here, because the local rule had no time, correct, for a motion for reconsideration? The district court set a time for a motion for reconsideration."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3325.29,3327.58,"Well, then -- well, what's the --"
2018.17-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3327.58,3335.135,"What's misleading, I guess, is, in context, when you roll in Rule 23(f), which the district court said nothing about, correct?"
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3335.135,3336.92,The district court did not say anything --
2018.17-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3336.92,3340.47,"I mean, I just don't think it's fair to say the district court misled here."
2018.17-1094,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3343.475,3353.105,"The leave to file a motion -- the motion for leave to file an appeal, you didn't tell the judge you were intending to do that, did you?"
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3353.105,3356.72,"The Rule 23(f) was not brought up at the status conference, that's true."
2018.17-1094,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3356.72,3380.87,"So how was the judge supposed to play lawyer? He's supposed to tell you -- you ask him, let me file a motion for reconsideration, he's supposed to protect you and be your lawyer and tell you, you know, if you file it next week, you're going to lose your time to appeal? I don't know of any case we've ever held where a judge has to tell you something when you don't ask the judge about that."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3380.87,3386.03,And it's really not our position that we're placing any kind of blame on the district judge.
2018.17-1094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3405.95,3407.46,It is --
2018.17-1094,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3407.46,3409.245,But can --
2018.17-1094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3409.245,3411.075,-- it is a non-final order.
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3425.955,3428.17,And let -- let me clarify.
2018.17-1094,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3453.48,3476.04,"You know, I suppose I'm with you that it makes more sense to do the motion for reconsideration before the appeal and that that is true even when the appeal is interlocutory, but, you know, not every rule we have makes perfect sense. And it just doesn't seem as though you're off the hook from actually looking up the rules and saying, well, look, this says 14 days."
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3487.475,3512.085,"Well, the rules actually do not specifically address reconsideration motions, and it has been long understood that a timely reconsideration motion will suspend the time to appeal. Now I think it would be a different situation if, for instance, we were in a bankruptcy appeal, which specifically says that the time to appeal stops running only if you file within 14 days under the bankruptcy rules, and there -- there it was clear."
2018.17-1094,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3543.925,3546.69,"If we reject that, do you lose?"
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3546.69,3547.59,If you reject --
2018.17-1094,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3547.59,3552.63,"That you -- that you didn't file a motion within the time, within the 14 days?"
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3552.63,3555.465,May I -- may I answer the question?
2018.17-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3555.465,3556.39,Sure.
2018.17-1094,1,62855,jonathan_a_herstoff,,3556.39,3566.505,"No, because we still have equitable tolling and the Harris Truck Lines and Thompson line of cases, so in either circumstance the judgment should be affirmed. Thank you."
2018.17-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3566.505,3571.95999995,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hueston, you have a minute left."
2018.17-1094,2,63059,john_hueston,,3571.95999995,3630.525,"Your Honor, in this remaining minute, let me emphasize and direct the Court's attention to PA 69 to 77, where the short status conference took place. And in that status conference, it is notable that not only did the court not mention Rule 23(f), not mention any sort of appellate right, but counsel did not even mention 23(f), nor even say the word appeal. And, in fact, no mistake at all was made by the judge in that case. To have the rule that Lambert is urging today would have a judge effectively need to conduct a Rule 11 criminal colloquy with counsel, asking if they're aware of all sorts of potential related rights. That is asking an impossible task for a district court judge and an unfair one and goes well beyond the acknowledged sharply honed exception, which does not apply factually in this case."
2018.17-1094,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3631.385,3632.45,"Thank you, counsel."
