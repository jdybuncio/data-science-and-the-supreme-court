1970.71,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.438,"-- in number 71, Abate against Mundt."
1970.71,0,23579,frank_p_barone,,16.001,21.811,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.71,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,355.391,358.873,"And that is according to your theory, I think I understand it?"
1970.71,0,23579,frank_p_barone,,358.873,359.191,Yes.
1970.71,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,359.191,368.03,It’s absolutely impossible for any multi-member district plan to meet what you submit are the constitutional requirements.
1970.71,0,23579,frank_p_barone,,368.378,376.936,"Yes, Mr. Justice. Our opposition is that every decision of this Court has been consistent."
1970.71,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,403.116,419.61,"In other words the, I’m looking now at page 4 of the brief of petitioners June Molof and others which as I understand it sets out the present plan and indicates the population of each one of the district."
1970.71,0,23579,frank_p_barone,,430.667,432.122,That is correct sir.
1970.71,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,432.122,433.673,And you say that’s insufficient?
1970.71,0,23579,frank_p_barone,,433.673,434.623,Yes.
1970.71,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,441.836,442.847,Right.
1970.71,1,21643,doris_friedman_ulman,,969.085,970.799,May it please the Court.
1970.71,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,987.265,988.147,Not using town lines.
1970.71,1,21643,doris_friedman_ulman,,988.147,991.635,Not using town lines and not using static boundaries.
1970.71,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,991.635,992.951,Right.
1970.71,1,21643,doris_friedman_ulman,,992.951,993.909,"Secondly, --"
1970.71,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,993.909,995.772,Can you define this to what you --
1970.71,1,21643,doris_friedman_ulman,,995.772,995.922,I beg your pardon?
1970.71,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,995.922,998.416,-- mean by a static boundary?
1970.71,1,21643,doris_friedman_ulman,,998.907,1002.425,A static boundary is which is not subject to change.
1970.71,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1049.613,1063.733,"If a plan reflects representation, it is substantially representative and equal here a variation of a very modest amount is it seems to meet per capita."
1970.71,1,21643,doris_friedman_ulman,,1063.733,1065.915,Yes.
1970.71,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1065.915,1077.361,Why should we become so concerned about how that’s achieved where the lines are whether they’re static or whether they’re changed every two years or whatever?
1970.71,1,21643,doris_friedman_ulman,,1077.361,1087.799,"Well, we have in our brief set forth the percentage deviations that would have occurred."
1970.71,2,29796,j_martin_cornell,,1980.474,1983.815,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.71,3,38273,paul_h_rivet,,4638.145,4642.497,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.71,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4722.594,4724.46,How do you give that anymore by --
1970.71,3,38273,paul_h_rivet,,4724.46,4730.027,"Well, maybe if I simply give you some budget for use."
1970.71,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4820.644,4825.032,"Well, but what’s the situation now in Stony Point?"
1970.71,3,38273,paul_h_rivet,,4825.032,4830.025,"Stony Point still has 12,000 people in it and Ramapo has 75,000 people."
1970.71,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4830.025,4831.517,How many representatives does Stony Point have?
1970.71,3,38273,paul_h_rivet,,4831.517,4833.66,Stony Point has one representative.
1970.71,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4833.66,4836.688,So that what you were worried about before has been cured.
1970.71,3,38273,paul_h_rivet,,4836.688,4850.913,But I’m talking about the good-faith effort that was allegedly made by the County of Rockland and the argument has been made that the good-faith effort is demonstrated every amply by the fact that we had an impartial commission that was appointed to do the job.
1970.71,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4906.027,4918.7,"Mr. Rivet, suppose we take the figures that were projected from 1969 to 1971 where the 11% variation deviation was reduced down to about 4% --"
1970.71,3,38273,paul_h_rivet,,4918.7,4920.996,Its 7.9 Your Honor to be specific.
1970.71,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4920.996,4924.467,7 -- from 11 it was reduced for approximately 4.2?
1970.71,3,38273,paul_h_rivet,,4924.467,4925.762,That’s right.
1970.71,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4925.762,4940.188,"Now suppose in 1971, this gets cut in half again and in 1972, it is one-half of 1% variation, then would you still have a quarrel with it?"
1970.71,3,38273,paul_h_rivet,,4940.188,4945.078,I think that you would then have met obviously the mathematical situation.
1970.71,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4946.012,4948.14,Is there any other to meet?
1970.71,3,38273,paul_h_rivet,,4948.14,4950.168,I think it is the first one to be met.
1970.71,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5215.077,5216.343,I guess.
1970.71,3,38273,paul_h_rivet,,5216.343,5222.923,The petitioners here represent the entire spectrum of the political body.
1970.71,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5384.587,5386.654,Thank you very much Rivet.
