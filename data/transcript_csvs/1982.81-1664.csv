1982.81-1664,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,77.416,"Mr. Sileo, I think you may proceed when you are ready."
1982.81-1664,0,21502,donald_f_sileo,,77.416,80.035,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1664,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,257.151,264.222,"Well, Mr. Sileo, in your petition you raise a second question that I take is independent of the arbitration problem."
1982.81-1664,0,21502,donald_f_sileo,,264.222,265.839,"That is correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,514.885,515.835,Mr. Sileo.
1982.81-1664,0,21502,donald_f_sileo,,515.835,516.67,--Yes.
1982.81-1664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,516.67,528.978,"May I ask you on the arbitration point, the arbitration clause in the contract that was in effect said that a decision by an arbitrator shall be binding for the term of this agreement."
1982.81-1664,0,21502,donald_f_sileo,,537.232,543.988,"That clause has remained the same, Justice O'Connor, throughout the life of these parties for the term of this agreement."
1982.81-1664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,543.988,546.523,Does that have a bearing on your arbitration clause?
1982.81-1664,0,21502,donald_f_sileo,,546.523,547.423,"We think not at all, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-1664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,668.031,685.844,Do you think the arbitrator back in the previous arbitrations had to be interpreting the terms of the contract to decide whether the greater punishment could be issued or whether there were greater duties or whether there was a waiver?
1982.81-1664,0,21502,donald_f_sileo,,685.844,694.95,"The arbitrator interpreted the terms of the contract and took into consideration, as this Court admonished arbitrators to do, industrial common law."
1982.81-1664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,694.95,707.841,Because the decisions of the arbitrators in these two instances were not complete enough to let us know what the arbitrator was really basing it on?
1982.81-1664,0,21502,donald_f_sileo,,707.841,713.828,"Well, I think it is clear that the arbitrator definitely did refer to industrial common law."
1982.81-1664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,723.1,729.587,"What could he have looked at other than the no-strike clause, do you think, to determine that there had been a waiver or--"
1982.81-1664,0,21502,donald_f_sileo,,729.587,737.793,"--Well, I... that... one of our points, of course, Justice O'Connor, is that he didn't have to determine there was a waiver, he determined that there was a contractual violation."
1982.81-1664,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,790.995,791.928,--What is the waiver issue?
1982.81-1664,0,21502,donald_f_sileo,,795.649,799.767,"Well, I prefer not having to make their case in bringing up what the waiver issue is."
1982.81-1664,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,800.451,801.635,Could you just describe it and if--
1982.81-1664,0,21502,donald_f_sileo,,801.635,802.302,--Yes.
1982.81-1664,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,831.155,833.572,"--Once you sign a contract, you're bound to carry it out."
1982.81-1664,0,21502,donald_f_sileo,,835.457,835.874,Okay.
1982.81-1664,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1436.614,1446.137,Mr. Come.
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1446.137,1450.874,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1664,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1506.877,1521.22,"What is the Board's view about the posture of the union leaders in terms of whether rank-and-file should follow their directions; for example, when they say don't go on a strike?"
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1525.422,1536.813,"Well, it only comes up insofar as you have a question of whether there was any discrimination that the Board can remedy."
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1537.579,1538.179,"Well, isn't it--"
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1538.179,1553.156,--it perfectly clear that the Board's position is not to say that union officers enjoy any right to engage in unprotected strikes.
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1607.373,1614.96,--But they didn't carry out the request that management made to them as the manner... as the manner in which management wanted that done.
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1614.96,1620.614,"--They did... they did not immediately return to work, that is correct."
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1620.614,1621.3,Did the Board--
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1621.3,1627.204,"And for that, they could have been disciplined just like the rank-and-file employees."
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1627.204,1627.654,--Okay.
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1630.239,1631.572,Yes.
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1631.572,1632.106,--the rank-and-file.
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1632.106,1633.441,"Well, we submit, Your Honor, that--"
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1633.441,1635.81,"I am going to ask you a question, Mr. Come--"
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1635.81,1636.176,--Surely.
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1636.176,1637.776,--if you will slow down a minute and wait for me.
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1670.381,1679.803,"Well, of course, your first situation, if you could prove bad motive, you would have the classic violation of 8(a)(3)."
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1679.803,1682.271,"But assume you don't prove that, though?"
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1682.271,1696.614,"You can't prove bad motive, it is the Board's position, absent the effect of a contract which might impose higher responsibilities on union officers, and that is the second issue in this case."
1982.81-1664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.726,1791.16,Was Lang an employee?
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1791.16,1792.612,Lang was an employee.
1982.81-1664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1794.295,1795.38,Did he participate in the strike?
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1795.38,1798.916,He did not cross the picket line.
1982.81-1664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.916,1807.021,You don't think that is a signal to other employees that it is perfectly all right to strike?
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1807.021,1812.925,Not in the circumstances where he made it plain that--
1982.81-1664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.925,1816.96,"Well, they didn't... he didn't cross the picket line and anybody--"
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1816.96,1817.777,--He didn't--
1982.81-1664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.777,1826.149,"--anybody else could say, well, here's the union boss not going to work, he is observing the picket line, why shouldn't I?"
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1826.149,1828.201,"--Well, he--"
1982.81-1664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.201,1829.301,Isn't that leadership?
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1829.301,1840.259,"--It is not, in the view of the Board and of the Courts of Appeals, sufficient to--"
1982.81-1664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.259,1843.86,Has the Board actually addressed straight that issue?
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1843.86,1845.562,"--Yes, Your Honor, it has."
1982.81-1664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1848.129,1849.431,And it is an issue in this case.
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1849.431,1849.998,It is.
1982.81-1664,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1851.716,1866.393,Isn't it an essential ingredient of the whole industrial picture that the Board wants and unions want members to follow the leader?
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1866.393,1903.833,"But in a wildcat strike the union officer may well believe that he will be most effective with the men or women in getting the unauthorized strikes ended if he does not cross that picket line but instead devotes his energies, as Lang and Light did here, to removing the picket line."
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1980.233,1981.268,"But, Mr. Come--"
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1981.268,1982.101,As a matter of fact--
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1982.101,1982.651,--Mr. Come.
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1982.651,1983.085,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1983.085,1996.809,"Even the Board agrees that particular contractual provisions could do it, and all the management here is contending is that an arbitrator's construction of a contract should also permit it."
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2006.866,2014.937,"Well, that brings us to the second issue in this case and... which I now will turn to."
1982.81-1664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2094.139,2104.964,"Well, Mr. Come, wouldn't the court also sustain usually the next arbitrator who decided the issue exactly contrary to the first arbitrator?"
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2104.964,2106.38,They might.
1982.81-1664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.38,2109.899,"Well, I mean one arbitrator isn't bound by another, is he?"
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2109.899,2110.851,"Well, that is correct, but--"
1982.81-1664,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.851,2113.701,And a court would probably sustain them both.
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2113.701,2136.149,"--The point, though, is that the Board's job is to interpret the statute, and section 10(a) provides that the Board's power shall not be affected by any other method of... or agreement or adjustment."
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2332.746,2339.415,"Well, before you get to the waiver issue, I presume you have to have some finding of a violation of the provision."
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2365.217,2402.973,"--Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say that any disparate treatment, but certainly disparate discipline for doing the same refusal to work here would violate 8(a)(3) because it is based upon... the sole difference is based upon holding union office, I mean the reason for the enhanced punishment."
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2424.256,2427.022,But it is not at all based on bad motive or on--
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2427.022,2428.957,"No, it is not based on bad motive."
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2525.537,2531.691,--But before you get to that question you have the question of whether the Board was warranted in finding there was an 8(a)(3) violation at all.
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2531.691,2533.291,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2559.489,2561.405,And that is your argument?
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2561.405,2562.691,That is our argument.
1982.81-1664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2562.691,2564.074,That four Courts of Appeals have agreed with the Board?
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2564.074,2574.832,"No, it is not... well, I tried to explain to Your Honor the reason why the Board's position is a reasonable one."
1982.81-1664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2574.832,2599.463,"Mr. Come, would you agree that, as I follow the argument, your opponent says we should decide the case narrowly just by looking at the arbitration awards, but if I understand your presentation, we really have to decide both issues because you say that we can't evaluate the arbitration issue without first deciding whether there would be a discriminatory act by a disparate discipline."
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2602.065,2611.671,"I think that is correct, Your Honor, because it's because if it is a statutory right and a statutory violation--"
1982.81-1664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.671,2613.207,Then you get a higher standard of waiver is what you're saying?
1982.81-1664,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2613.207,2613.973,--That is correct.
1982.81-1664,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2710.252,2712.752,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1664,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2712.752,2731.348,"On the point that was being addressed at the close of your colleague's argument, I take it to mean that if the contract provided that greater discipline could be given to officers than rank-and-file members in a situation like this, that it could be done."
1982.81-1664,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2732.181,2737.069,"I think that question, Mr. Chief Justice, goes to the heart of the case here."
1982.81-1664,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2742.723,2743.739,--But let me--
1982.81-1664,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2743.739,2755.797,--our initial position is that the right to protect employee union officials from employment discipline for the manner in which they exercise their office may not be waived.
1982.81-1664,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2770.891,2792.906,"--If the contract... assuming that a contract provides it, just exactly that, how does it help the basic argument that the Board has been making that this discourages people from becoming union leaders if there is some way in which union leaders can be disciplined more than rank-and-file members?"
1982.81-1664,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2792.906,2803.778,"It might indeed have that effect, but they would have consciously given up that right to be free from discipline, to have placed that additional burden on themselves in the bargaining process."
1982.81-1664,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2803.778,2813.819,"You don't think the acceptance of union leadership imposes that obligation, an obligation to lead in trying to avoid illegal strikes?"
1982.81-1664,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2813.819,2814.735,Not at all.
1982.81-1664,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2819.454,2826.543,"When you say ""not at all"", do you mean there is no obligation on a union leader to try to enforce the union's contract obligations?"
1982.81-1664,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2826.543,2833.781,"In this context, we submit that there is no such responsibility inherent in union office itself."
1982.81-1664,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2879.595,2885.932,"But did I understand you, Mr. Cohen, to say that you are going to argue perhaps after lunch that such a clause is in any event not enforceable?"
1982.81-1664,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2885.932,2890.57,That is the union... is not the statutory right of the union official--
1982.81-1664,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2890.57,2891.236,"No, I--"
1982.81-1664,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2891.236,2892.053,--May not be waived--
1982.81-1664,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2892.053,2900.425,"--if you have a clause in the contract that said you may impose on union leaders greater discipline, are you going to argue that that is an unenforceable clause?"
1982.81-1664,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2900.425,2900.925,--No.
1982.81-1664,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2900.925,2901.708,What are you going to argue?
1982.81-1664,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2901.708,2902.125,"No, I am not."
1982.81-1664,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2902.125,2903.377,What are you going to argue?
1982.81-1664,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2903.377,2913.316,I am going to argue that the statutory right of the union officials who are employees to be free from employment discrimination may not be waived by contract.
1982.81-1664,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2917.553,2919.953,It sounds to me as though that adds up to the same thing.
1982.81-1664,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,2920.789,2924.874,"Well, I view it, Mr. Chief Justice, as I say, the first of two steps."
1982.81-1664,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3065.649,3066.816,We will resume there at 1:00.
1982.81-1664,2,34211,laurence_j_cohen,,3088.682,3093.55,"Mr. Chief Justice, in my remaining time I would like to make several points which arose this morning."
1982.81-1664,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3393.73,3394.396,Thank you.
1982.81-1664,3,21502,donald_f_sileo,,3397.265,3397.848,"Yes, I do."
1982.81-1664,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3397.848,3401.05,You have seven minutes remaining.
1982.81-1664,3,21502,donald_f_sileo,,3401.05,3427.717,"First of all, with respect to the facts in this case, I think it important to note that contrary to the Heist situation, which was quoted or referred to by Mr. Cohen, the union officers in this case made no effort whatsoever during the strike to be of any help."
1982.81-1664,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3611.32,3614.172,Do you want the stewards to go out and break up the picket line?
1982.81-1664,3,21502,donald_f_sileo,,3614.172,3615.155,--I beg your pardon?
1982.81-1664,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3615.155,3619.576,Do you want the stewards to break up the picket line?
1982.81-1664,3,21502,donald_f_sileo,,3619.576,3625.813,"Just... in this situation, Justice Marshall, we had the picket line already established."
1982.81-1664,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3647.726,3650.128,I think you and I know what I mean.
1982.81-1664,3,21502,donald_f_sileo,,3650.128,3651.047,"--Well, okay."
1982.81-1664,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3673.393,3675.445,Do you think they must cross the line?
1982.81-1664,3,21502,donald_f_sileo,,3675.445,3676.778,Yes.
1982.81-1664,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3678.897,3693.49,"That is, that they must, in your view, say this line is... does not really exist as a matter of law because it's an illegal line, it is not a picket line under labor law?"
1982.81-1664,3,21502,donald_f_sileo,,3693.49,3694.123,That's correct.
1982.81-1664,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3694.707,3700.243,"And therefore, they should lead the union, you say, by crossing that... quote... line."
1982.81-1664,3,21502,donald_f_sileo,,3700.243,3701.843,--Absolutely.
1982.81-1664,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3704.964,3707.047,They don't have to go out and use force to break it up?
1982.81-1664,3,21502,donald_f_sileo,,3707.047,3709.016,"No, they don't have to use force."
1982.81-1664,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3709.016,3709.866,You're not saying at all--
1982.81-1664,3,21502,donald_f_sileo,,3709.866,3712.368,Nobody is suggesting... nobody is suggesting that they use force to break it up.
1982.81-1664,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3716.772,3717.972,"--Well, before you move on--"
1982.81-1664,3,21502,donald_f_sileo,,3717.972,3719.538,--the second point--
1982.81-1664,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3719.538,3722.14,--you would say they have to cross the line even if it's a legal line by another union.
1982.81-1664,3,21502,donald_f_sileo,,3722.14,3723.592,"--Yes, certainly."
1982.81-1664,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3723.592,3724.342,Yes.
1982.81-1664,3,21502,donald_f_sileo,,3724.342,3725.076,"Oh, certainly, we would say that."
