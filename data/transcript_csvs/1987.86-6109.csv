1987.86-6109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,76.631,"Mr. Gimbel, we'll wait just a minute until the crowd clears."
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,76.631,96.045,Yes.
1987.86-6109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,96.045,99.497,"You may proceed whenever you're ready, Mr. Gimbel."
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,99.497,102.382,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1987.86-6109,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,274.093,276.712,What is your point?
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,278.897,280.599,"--That's very good, Justice Blackmun."
1987.86-6109,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,557.895,558.928,Why not?
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,558.928,566.317,"Because there is a request that there be a confession by the accused, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-6109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,566.317,571.019,Why is that inconsistent with our cases on entrapment?
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,571.019,578.542,Because you have said in your cases on entrapment that that is not the rule that is to be applied.
1987.86-6109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,584.863,587.481,"Yes, but we take the majority opinion of the Chief Justice."
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,587.481,589.165,"--Absolutely, yes."
1987.86-6109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,617.267,623.071,"Yes, but I don't see that lays down much substantive law."
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,652.59,654.875,"Well, I respectfully disagree."
1987.86-6109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,687.346,692.481,"Yes, but you agree that the courts of appeals are split on this question."
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,692.481,692.898,I do.
1987.86-6109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,693.333,700.404,"And I for one don't see any strong requirement in our precedents, one way or the other."
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,709.51,734.291,"--I think that it will be more easily judicially administered if this Court adopts as its standard, as a minimum, the positions that have been asserted and now constitute the law in the District of Columbia, in the Fifth Circuit or in the Ninth Circuit, than following in the Seventh Circuit."
1987.86-6109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,829.039,838.31,"Well, certainly to date, the Court hasn't determined that the Constitution requires the courts to recognize entrapment as a defense."
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,838.31,840.177,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-6109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,840.177,844.481,May I ask you about a minor procedural point.
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,860.391,863.176,"It's one of those six of one, half a dozen of the others."
1987.86-6109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,948.116,960.857,"If entrapment is properly raised as a defense in a case, do you take the position that the government is required to disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt?"
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,960.857,982.587,"It is my view, Justice O'Connor, that the courts have spoken on this issue, particularly in D.C., the Fifth and Ninth Circuit, have essentially said this: It is appropriate for an accused to produce evidence that there was in fact inducement."
1987.86-6109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1041.791,1044.493,And what's your position on the burden of proof?
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,1044.493,1066.359,"My position is that once there has been the surface of inducement by the government of the criminal activities of the accused, that then another element of proof that the government must bear is to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in fact predisposed."
1987.86-6109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1066.359,1070.728,Why shouldn't we just treat the whole thing as an affirmative defense right down the line?
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,1077.482,1098.395,"It would appear to me that by doing that, Mr. Chief Justice, you would be inviting the government to have no constrictions on their use of deception, decoy, undercover activities, sting and what have you."
1987.86-6109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1098.395,1098.747,No.
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,1114.84,1124.946,"In the State of Wisconsin, if you raise the issue of self-defense, then the prosecution has the obligation to show beyond a reasonable doubt that self-defense in fact was not the basis upon which the action took."
1987.86-6109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1124.946,1128.517,"Well, there are fifty different States, and I dare say they have many different rules."
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,1159.553,1175.83,I don't think it would be efficient productive jurisprudence to lay upon a person accused of a crime any more burdens that he or she might otherwise have.
1987.86-6109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1209.636,1214.539,"But it's certainly not an element of the crime that we're talking about, is it?"
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,1214.539,1216.622,"Is what an element, Justice White?"
1987.86-6109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1216.622,1227.097,"I mean, even if you said the Government ought to have the burden, I don't know why proving predisposition, why do you say it has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt?"
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,1229.315,1247.761,I am echoing the sentiments which I urge this Court to adopt of circuit courts which have held that predisposition should be treated in the exact same way as any other statutory element of an offense.
1987.86-6109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1281.767,1296.709,"Well, I suppose you would argue then that self-defense, that the defendant constitutionally should be relieved of any burden of proof with respect to that defense?"
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,1296.709,1301.328,"--I would argue that the defendant should be relieved of burden of proof on self-defense, yes."
1987.86-6109,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1302.911,1305.963,What have we held with respect to that?
1987.86-6109,0,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,1305.963,1307.898,I don't know.
1987.86-6109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.863,1385.046,"Thank you, Mr. Gimbel."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1393.069,1395.938,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-6109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1469.017,1474.754,"Well, Mr. Rothfeld, we granted certiorari on the question that Mr. Gimbel argued."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1485.329,1485.896,No.
1987.86-6109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1492.799,1495.934,That is the very ground that the lower courts decided the case on.
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1495.934,1497.436,"That is also correct, Justice White."
1987.86-6109,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.379,1514.415,"But are you arguing that we should dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, then?"
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1514.415,1526.056,"--Well, we also think there's an important reason to resolve, as a practical matter, the issue that we've presented, the question of when entrapment is properly in the case is a tremendously important practical question."
1987.86-6109,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1538.863,1539.346,I understand.
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1542.398,1543.517,"No, we are not."
1987.86-6109,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1543.517,1549.254,If you're saying we ought to decide another question other than the one we granted cert to review.
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1549.254,1554.706,"Well, as I say, we think that it is an alternative ground for affirmance which is a--"
1987.86-6109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1554.706,1557.758,"The Court below never weighed the evidence, did it?"
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1557.758,1559.294,"--No, it did not, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-6109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1559.294,1561.979,But you want us to do that in the first instance?
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1561.979,1568.216,We're not asking the Court to make any factual determinations or sift through the record.
1987.86-6109,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1588.963,1597.485,"Yes, but isn't it true that he made a motion in advance of trial that raised the issue and had that motion been decided the other way, perhaps the record would have developed differently?"
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1597.485,1604.306,"Well, I think on that point, I agree with Mr. Gimbel's suggestion that it really doesn't make any difference in the setting of this case."
1987.86-6109,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1614.863,1616.78,Did the defendant take the stand in this case?
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1616.78,1618.482,"--Yes, he did."
1987.86-6109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1666.129,1668.848,What's the burden of proof in entrapment.
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1673.569,1680.723,"Well, there's no question that it is an affirmative defense, just as insanity or any other number of affirmative defenses."
1987.86-6109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1689.329,1694.482,Does the burden ever shift to the government based on the production of evidence by the defendant?
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1694.482,1705.338,"--The Courts of Appeals have generally, although not universally, said that there is a burden of production on the question of inducement, and to a certain extent on the question of predisposition that lies on the defendant."
1987.86-6109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1713.877,1714.812,Do you agree with that?
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1714.812,1716.079,We have no quarrel with that.
1987.86-6109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2009.486,2032.418,"Mr. Rothfeld, can you envision a case in which evidence of that kind might come out on cross examination, for example, of the government's witnesses, but in which the defendant never takes the stand at all, and asks at the conclusion of the case for alternative instructions."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2039.774,2043.309,"It is certainly possible to imagine such a case, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-6109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2043.309,2048.963,And you wouldn't deprive the defendant in those circumstances of the alternative instruction?
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2048.963,2061.02,"Well, the courts of appeals have taken inconsistent positions, and as we explained in our brief, there is no need to decide that in this case because the defendant himself took the stand."
1987.86-6109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2061.02,2063.556,"Well, but I'm asking you now."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2063.556,2075.78,"Well, our preferred approach... and we understand that there is a close question as to which of the two approaches is preferable... our preferred approach is the Seventh Circuit's approach, as I'll explain later on at the end of my argument."
1987.86-6109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2199.106,2209.58,What if we don't want to go off on that ground and instead we want to decide the issue on which cert was granted?
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2209.58,2217.186,"Well, if the Court were to conclude that that were the logically precedent question to decide, we certainly don't have any quarrel with that."
1987.86-6109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2235.564,2240.683,That could be left open to the Court below on a remand.
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2249.74,2250.873,I will argue that.
1987.86-6109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2406.86,2412.429,"Mr. Rothfeld, what's wrong with inconsistent defenses on the part of a defendant?"
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2423.469,2430.558,"--Well, I can give you two answers to that, Chief Justice Rehnquist, one empirical and one theoretical."
1987.86-6109,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2476.354,2491.18,"Well, isn't it possible one reason is that there's really not any necessary inconsistency between saying, well, sure I did these things, but I didn't intend to commit a crime, and to the extent I did them, I did them because the government agent talked me into it."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2492.548,2496.583,"Well, if the acts were all the elements of the crime, there wouldn't be."
1987.86-6109,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2498.702,2503.689,"Yes, but under the Seventh Circuit rule, they've got to admit that they intended a crime."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2503.689,2515.497,"--Well, the inconsistency in that I think was in the profoundest sense that a jury cannot simultaneously believe that a defendant was entrapped and that he did not commit the crime."
1987.86-6109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2532.772,2547.698,"But couldn't a defendant in a particular case take the position that he didn't have the necessary intent but if for some reason, the jury found that he did, he says that he was entrapped."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2550.733,2554.518,"Well, we think that in a case such as this one, it necessarily is."
1987.86-6109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2554.518,2559.672,"Well, speak not in terms of this case, then, but hypothetically."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2559.672,2562.624,"Well, as a general matter, I would say yes, they are inconsistent."
1987.86-6109,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2584.554,2592.393,You can convert anything into a non-contradiction if you preface the second part of it with... but if the jury finds.
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2608.736,2611.104,"Well, that's quite right, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-6109,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2630.083,2638.005,"Well, why in this very case, this is a government official who borrowed money from somebody who presumably wanted to induce him to take official action that would favor him."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2675.714,2683.201,"Well, the two statements that you've made, I didn't have criminal intent, and the government made me a loan--"
1987.86-6109,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2683.201,2685.753,Because factually I didn't realize he was doing business with my agency.
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2685.753,2709.785,"--Those two statements are not necessarily inconsistent, but when the defendant says, I did not understand that I was doing something illegal and did not intend to do something illegal, and then asks the jury to find I was entrapped, which by definition means that I had the improper mental state and that the improper mental state was implanted in me by the government, those two propositions cannot simultaneously be true."
1987.86-6109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2718.541,2727.313,"The defense of entrapment, as you say, presumes that every other element of the crime is satisfied."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2727.313,2733.217,The Court indicated explicitly in Russell that every element of the crime must be committed.
1987.86-6109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2733.217,2735.418,I guess it depends on how you define entrapment.
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2745.024,2749.428,"Well, if he said every element of the crime was there, he would have an entrapment defense."
1987.86-6109,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2766.99,2777.095,"Isn't he really saying that the element of intent was not mine, it was really the government's?"
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2777.095,2790.672,"Well, if he did not believe in this case that he was taking the money for an improper purpose as a gratuity rather than as a personal loan, he would not be guilty of the crime, he would not have committed all of the elements of the offense."
1987.86-6109,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2800.861,2805.349,"What's wrong with the inconsistent defenses, assuming I believe that they're inconsistent."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2805.682,2807.551,"I hope you do believe they're inconsistent, Justice White."
1987.86-6109,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2916.772,2934.984,"Are you saying it's the same reason you don't allow inconsistent testimony in other respects why you would not allow a defendant to come in and perjure himself to say one thing and then say, but if you don't believe that, then I testify to the opposite, because it does not help the truth seeking process."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2934.984,2936.467,That is certainly a major part of our argument.
1987.86-6109,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2936.467,2939.268,"Yes, but why do you presume there's false testimony."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2963.217,2971.59,"Well, the jury's conviction in the case that it believed that his account of the crime was not true."
1987.86-6109,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2971.59,2977.643,"Yes, but he's been convicted here, but every defendant before he gets on the stand is presumptively innocent."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2981.362,2983.547,"Well, that is certainly true, Justice."
1987.86-6109,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2983.547,2986.516,You don't presume he's going to give you false testimony.
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2986.516,2987.784,"Well, that is true."
1987.86-6109,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3030.278,3036.682,"Is it not correct that the reasons you advance for your position would apply equally to self-defense, because there's an inconsistency there too."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3046.288,3049.692,"Well, I'll give you two answers to that, three answers."
1987.86-6109,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3078.692,3083.996,"Because it's not obvious that there's any inconsistency, whereas it is obvious in these other cases there's an inconsistency."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3083.996,3085.532,"--Not at all, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-6109,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3100.541,3105.576,"They certainly are because if he's insane, he probably couldn't have had the intent to commit the crime."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3105.576,3108.98,"Well, he may say that he factually doesn't know where he was on the day of the crime."
1987.86-6109,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3133.196,3134.013,What about self defense.
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3138.583,3146.82,"Well, we were unable to find any authority on that point, and I think it is difficult to imagine a realistic case in which that will arise."
1987.86-6109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3146.82,3150.724,You don't ordinarily have the nicety of pleading in a criminal case.
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3161.865,3163.648,That's typically true.
1987.86-6109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3184.778,3209.393,"Of course, what makes this difficult is that we normally think that the government is put to its proof in these criminal cases, and the jury may look at circumstantial evidence to determine that the defendant had the requisite intent to commit the substantive offense, and it may not, the defendant may believe he didn't have the intent."
1987.86-6109,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3229.14,3234.175,"Well, it is certainly true that the defendant generally may put the government to its proof."
1987.86-6109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3250.67,3252.07,"Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld."
1987.86-6109,2,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,3254.105,3256.64,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1987.86-6109,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3401.635,3412.409,"Why is it any different than the position of a defendant that's accused of murder who really believes that he didn't kill the individual, someone else pulled the trigger."
1987.86-6109,2,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,3420.23,3421.182,I don't think it's different.
1987.86-6109,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3421.182,3421.932,It isn't different.
1987.86-6109,2,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,3421.932,3422.532,No.
1987.86-6109,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3422.532,3432.121,"And you don't think that that's contradictory testimony: number one, I didn't kill him, and number two, I killed him in self defense?"
1987.86-6109,2,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,3432.121,3432.404,No.
1987.86-6109,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3436.942,3442.262,I don't think we're arguing really about whether this is any different from any other contradictory testimony.
1987.86-6109,2,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,3450.784,3454.653,And my posture is that we should not exclude contradictory testimony.
1987.86-6109,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3521.162,3525.666,"But there is an issue here, how far the entrapment defense ought to reach."
1987.86-6109,2,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,3530.535,3531.486,Exactly.
1987.86-6109,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3531.486,3542.258,I suppose we could say that the entrapment defense is available but only where there's an admission of all the elements of the crime.
1987.86-6109,2,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,3542.258,3542.877,You can say that.
1987.86-6109,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3550.114,3560.087,It makes some sense in the terms of just how often and under what circumstances is entrapment available to a person whose committed a crime.
1987.86-6109,2,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,3560.087,3562.756,"That I understand, Justice White."
1987.86-6109,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3592.458,3600.464,"Well, it would have been available if there had been the proper groundwork if he had just stayed off the stand, is that right?"
1987.86-6109,2,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,3600.464,3600.914,No.
1987.86-6109,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3611.939,3614.056,It isn't just government behavior that he's complaining about.
1987.86-6109,2,24008,franklyn_m_gimbel,,3654.432,3669.727,"I just can't agree with that proposition, Justice Scalia, because the truth on intent is an amorphous concept and ten people looking at the same incident, nine may view it one way, and one view it another way."
1987.86-6109,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3798.826,3800.959,"Mr. Gimbel, your time has expired."
