1977.77-380,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,110.718,"We will hear arguments next in Andrus, the Secretary of Interior against Charlestone Stone Products."
1977.77-380,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,114.931,118.311,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1977.77-380,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,123.534,128.003,"Mrs. Beale, may I suggest you draw the microphone a little closer to you."
1977.77-380,0,41027,sara_sun_beale,,130.568,138.793,"Seeking review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, holding that water is a mineral subject to location under the federal mining laws."
1977.77-380,1,25611,gerry_levenberg,,1469.801,1475.663,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1977.77-380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1490.188,1500.658,"But did this Court not make quite a bit of them in the Beaver Portland Cement case, written by Justice Sutherland who is, himself, regarded as an expert on Western Water Law?"
1977.77-380,1,25611,gerry_levenberg,,1500.658,1505.795,"Your Honor, he certainly was so regarded."
1977.77-380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1538.547,1559.016,Do you think it is unfair to say that most Western lawyers involved in water law have read that decision to mean that those two Acts savored the water from the land and left the water to acquisition by state law?
1977.77-380,1,25611,gerry_levenberg,,1559.016,1561.657,"I do not think that is unfair to say either, Your Honor."
1977.77-380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1561.657,1567.854,But do you now say that perhaps those lawyers were wrong in reading the decision that was.
1977.77-380,1,25611,gerry_levenberg,,1567.854,1586.93,"What we try to say is that, as we set forth in the brief especially at pages 16 through 18, that what was involved in Beaver Portland were not claims under the mining laws of 1866, 1870, or 1872."
1977.77-380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.728,1639.098,"But, if the Dessert Land Act savored the water from the land, did that not mean that no further water could be acquired in the same way that you acquire other mineral patents?"
1977.77-380,1,25611,gerry_levenberg,,1639.098,1651.045,"In so far as Dessert Land Act entries, Homestead Act entries, Preemption Act entries were concerned, that is precisely what Justice Sutherland said."
1977.77-380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1657.986,1659.32,He is from your home state.
1977.77-380,1,25611,gerry_levenberg,,1659.32,1688.248,"There is no indication anywhere in Justice Sutherland’s opinion and the government points to none which states specifically that with respect to claims under the mining laws, and that is what is involved here, with respect to those claims the sole means by which water may be obtained is under state appropriation."
1977.77-380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1699.735,1707.641,Are you troubled at all by the Ninth Circuit’s failure to refer at all to the Beaver Portland Cement case in its opinion in this case?
1977.77-380,1,25611,gerry_levenberg,,1707.641,1722.315,"Obviously, Your honor, we would have preferred for the Ninth Circuit to spell out in greater detail the basis for its holding."
1977.77-380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1882.237,1884.767,"The two tests are quite different though, are they not?"
1977.77-380,1,25611,gerry_levenberg,,1896.065,1897.101,Correct.
1977.77-380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1897.101,1903.95,"On your water claim, under most western state appropriative systems, it does not depend upon value."
1977.77-380,1,25611,gerry_levenberg,,1906.889,1909.405,"Yes, Your honor, that is absolutely correct."
1977.77-380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2141.325,2148.226,But do you think there had been many mining patents obtained on the basis of discovery of water?
1977.77-380,1,25611,gerry_levenberg,,2148.226,2149.823,"No, sir."
1977.77-380,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2149.823,2153.851,"Then, really, that is all the government has to go on, on a case like this."
1977.77-380,1,25611,gerry_levenberg,,2169.721,2172.112,That appears to be the case.
1977.77-380,2,41027,sara_sun_beale,,3269.107,3276.624,"Just one or two very brief points, first, on the court’s question as to generally what is a mineral."
1977.77-380,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3298.261,3300.482,Oil was a mineral for those purposes?
1977.77-380,2,41027,sara_sun_beale,,3300.482,3301.481,That is my understanding.
