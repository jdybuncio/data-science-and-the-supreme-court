1988.86-1879,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.688,"We'll hear argument next in No. 86-1879, National Treasury Employees Union v. William von Raab."
1988.86-1879,0,35280,lois_g_williams,,70.698,74.408,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.86-1879,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,171.195,172.417,xxx be a warrant--
1988.86-1879,0,35280,lois_g_williams,,172.417,173.358,"Well, Your Honor--"
1988.86-1879,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,173.358,174.497,--on that basis.
1988.86-1879,0,35280,lois_g_williams,,174.497,182.983,--We have... we have... the government has never really made an argument that it should be freed of the traditional requirements of the Fourth Amendment.
1988.86-1879,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,182.983,189.338,"Well, are you arguing that in order to justify these tests that there must be a warrant?"
1988.86-1879,0,35280,lois_g_williams,,189.338,194.31,"I... we have... we did preserve that argument, Your Honor."
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,1699.035,1707.361,"Thank you, Mr Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.86-1879,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.5,1863.044,"Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask this question?"
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,1874.802,1894.774,"It is an element in the balance, and I think that's an important point to talk about because it's hard to argue... and nobody seriously argues... that the government does not have a very serious interest in assuring that those who are on the front line of drug interception are not themselves involved in drugs."
1988.86-1879,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1955.044,1957.816,"Mr. Solicitor General, may I interrupt because I don't think we should talk about applicants."
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,1980.813,1984.393,"The incidence is certainly small, and we do not contest that."
1988.86-1879,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1986.647,1988.687,"Well, but your tests show it to be nonexistent."
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,1988.687,1989.839,Not nonexistent.
1988.86-1879,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.989,1994.922,Not among... among transferees?
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,1994.922,1995.843,"--Yes, sir."
1988.86-1879,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2000.576,2001.735,Let me just first interrupt and ask you.
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,2006.188,2014.383,"--At the time the case was tried, I believe that there were no positives which were shown up in the transferee population."
1988.86-1879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2015.044,2022.809,But did you... but at that time was there any record of people who withdrew or who... who otherwise would have applied for a transfer?
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,2022.809,2025.491,"--Well, I don't think... I don't think records were kept--"
1988.86-1879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.491,2026.172,"Yes, of that."
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,2026.172,2029.694,--of people who withdraw And in fact it's rather important that they not be kept--
1988.86-1879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2029.694,2030.195,Yes.
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,2030.195,2035.258,--because the withdrawal process is one which is quite free.
1988.86-1879,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2035.258,2038.64,"Well, that might... if there were a lot of withdrawals, I suppose that might be one explanation you didn't find anybody."
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,2038.64,2041.492,"That's right, or people who simply don't apply."
1988.86-1879,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2050.317,2052.588,Would that... would those be the figures that Ms. Williams gave us?
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,2052.588,2053.719,--I think so.
1988.86-1879,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2076.655,2080.668,How long had the program been in effect at the time the case was tried?
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,2080.668,2085.74,"--I think about somewhat between a year and two years, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.86-1879,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2088.171,2090.833,"But, again, let me just... let me just... so you have time to address it."
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,2104.864,2121.345,"--I think that you're comparing, with respect, apples and oranges because the point of probable cause is to focus and... to focus and to confine discretion."
1988.86-1879,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2131.14,2134.963,But are you saying then that the probability of finding something is not relevant to the analysis?
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,2134.963,2137.763,The probability is not relevant to the... I have... I have--
1988.86-1879,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2137.763,2138.574,That isn't what you said earlier.
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,2139.015,2139.465,--No.
1988.86-1879,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2181.574,2185.846,--Are they compelled to file financial disclosure statements such as Justice Scalia suggested?
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,2185.846,2189.188,"--Well, of course, some of these people--"
1988.86-1879,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2189.188,2193.092,"I mean, do you regularly look at their bank accounts and find out what their financial status is?"
1988.86-1879,1,18942,charles_fried,,2193.092,2195.052,"--No, we do not, but there is--"
1988.86-1879,2,35280,lois_g_williams,,3163.126,3166.499,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.86-1879,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3286.27,3287.091,"Thank you, Ms. Williams."
