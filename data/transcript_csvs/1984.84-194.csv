1984.84-194,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,67.977,"Mr. Geller, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,67.977,70.929,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,281.48,283.616,May I ask one question on the Government's theory?
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,300.494,307.082,"--Well, I think one could read Section 2680(h) even to cover that situation, but we have not suggested that."
1984.84-194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,308.765,309.848,I understand there's a line of cases.
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,309.848,310.081,--Yes.
1984.84-194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.081,314.835,"But it seems to me if you read it as you say, you focus on the incident out of which the claim arises--"
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,314.835,315.685,"Well, but--"
1984.84-194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,315.685,317.235,--I have difficulty distinguishing the case.
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,317.871,325.108,"--I think the distinction is not difficult, Justice Stevens, because Section 2680(h) bars claims against the United States arising out of assault and battery."
1984.84-194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,330.678,333.813,"--Well, what if it was done by a guard who was a poorly supervised guard?"
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,333.813,338.284,"If it was a federal employee, we think it would be covered by Section 2680(h)."
1984.84-194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,359.948,364.066,You would read the arising out of language to mean arising out of an assault by a federal employee.
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,364.066,364.333,Yes.
1984.84-194,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,633.172,672.047,"Do you think there might be a difference, Mr. Geller, if the federal employee is, as Justice Stevens' question suggested, a federal employee is in a position where he has been told of the injured person... that is, as the prison guard vis-a-vis the prisoner, as compared with the prison guard, for example, meeting somebody in a local bar and committing an assault or killing him, as was the case here?"
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,672.047,683.355,"--We would think, Mr. Chief Justice, that both suits would be barred if the cause of action was dependent upon proving an intentional tort by a federal employee."
1984.84-194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1024.51,1030.83,"May I ask on that point, Mr. Geller, supposing that the suit were not by a soldier but by a civilian who had been killed by this--"
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1030.83,1031.682,--Yes.
1984.84-194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.682,1035.217,"--same military person, and you had precisely the same allegation."
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1039.002,1047.775,There would be only the difference that the Court has recognized in saying that the Feres doctrine doesn't apply to suits by civilians.
1984.84-194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.225,1049.927,Why shouldn't it?
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1056.047,1061.951,"--Well, but I think this Court has already said that someone like the Respondent stands in the shoes of her soldier."
1984.84-194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1062.751,1065.653,Then why are these policy concerns that you describe about the relationship--
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1065.653,1066.136,"--Well, I think--"
1984.84-194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1066.136,1068.355,--between the commanding officer and the subordinate--
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1068.355,1076.877,"--there's a special, a special problem which the Court mentioned in Feres in allowing soldiers or their representatives to challenge the actions of their superior officers."
1984.84-194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.576,1102.226,"--For that purpose, the widow is the soldier."
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1102.226,1102.778,--Yes.
1984.84-194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.784,1144.771,"What you're saying is that even if Feres might not apply, you might have a defense under the discretionary function exemption in any event."
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1145.688,1145.921,--Yes.
1984.84-194,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1148.723,1151.442,But you didn't plead that here because Feres is broader.
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1151.442,1157.163,"--Well, this is a suit by a soldier, and Feres I think is a much broader exemption, and therefore, we have relied on Feres."
1984.84-194,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1157.163,1163.15,"If the soldier had been dismissed from the Army a day before this, there would be no case."
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1163.15,1174.291,"I think even then, Justice Marshall, we'd be barred by Feres because the soldier would still be challenging military decisionmaking while he was a member of the Armed Forces."
1984.84-194,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1184.246,1187.948,"I hate to see it out that far, because what would happen if it was a year later?"
1984.84-194,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1187.948,1195.954,"--Well, I think there's a key... you have cases like Brown and Brooks in which soldiers were not... this is not a case like that at all."
1984.84-194,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1290.933,1296.42,Mr. Cannon.
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1296.42,1299.02,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1426.388,1435.244,Where is the analog to maintaining an armed force in the private sector?
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1435.244,1447.384,"There is no analog, Mr. Chief Justice, in the private sector between maintaining a force and a traditional claim brought under the FTCA."
1984.84-194,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1725.246,1728.115,I have a little trouble with one statement.
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1728.115,1729.899,Justice Marshall.
1984.84-194,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1729.899,1732.935,That the Army exposed him to this.
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1735.82,1738.339,"They were off the base, but--"
1984.84-194,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1738.339,1740.122,Why did the Army expose him to it?
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1740.122,1749.195,"--They exposed him to the jeopardy of contact with Shearer because they failed to eliminate, to supervise or to warn about."
1984.84-194,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1764.305,1766.407,How could they control him off base?
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1766.407,1775.695,"--They can't control him off base, but they had the opportunity to control him within their numbers so that he at the time of this incident no longer--"
1984.84-194,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1775.695,1776.628,How?
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1776.628,1779.58,"--Just by eliminating him, by looking at the regulations--"
1984.84-194,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.58,1780.166,By shooting him?
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1780.166,1781.249,--Beg your pardon?
1984.84-194,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1781.249,1782.349,By shooting him?
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1782.599,1782.349,"No, sir."
1984.84-194,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1783.882,1785.149,"Well, you said eliminate."
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1785.149,1795.323,"When he was returned... when he was returned from Germany after being released from prison, the service had an obligation under its regulations to eliminate him."
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1795.323,1803.012,Suppose they had discharged him and a week later he'd gone out and killed somebody.
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1803.012,1803.578,Yes.
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1803.578,1813.701,The theory of your case is that it was the bad conduct of the military in failing to train him or cure him--
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1823.676,1832.948,"If the Chief Justice is asking if somebody killed after he was released could bring an action against the service, in my opinion no, they would have acted responsibly in discharging him from their membership."
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1832.948,1843.071,"But the cause that you assert in this case is the same in both situations, in the hypothetical and in the actual, is it not?"
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1843.071,1854.295,"Well, I think that the difference is that the service had an opportunity and a mandatory duty to eliminate this person with demonstrated homidical tendencies, an obligation that they failed."
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1854.295,1865.086,"Well, are you suggesting that the difference would be that he wouldn't be killing a serviceman; if he had those homicidal tendencies he might kill some civilian on the outside?"
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1865.086,1871.24,There would be no negligence on the part of the Government if they had properly eliminated him and then he had killed someone after that.
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1873.39,1879.244,Part of your case is that the Government didn't properly handle him while they had him in the service.
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1879.244,1879.846,"--That is right, Chief Justice."
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1881.729,1887.516,But then the impact... the impact of that failure would be the same on a civilian as it was on this fellow soldier.
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1887.516,1893.153,"--The impact would have been the same, but the Government would not be liable in that situation because they would have discharged their duty."
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1893.153,1896.355,"Well, Mr. Cannon, let me follow up on that a minute."
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1896.355,1896.938,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1896.938,1901.307,"Supposing you had at the time they made the wrong decision, whatever it was, before this--"
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1901.307,1901.59,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.59,1909.329,"--you had some military officers sitting around saying this is a dangerous man, psychiatrists have told us he's going to kill somebody in 90 days."
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1910.596,1911.698,To eliminate him.
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1911.698,1913.398,What do you mean by eliminate?
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1913.398,1919.018,"To eliminate him is not to kill him, as someone has suggested."
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1923.688,1925.138,"Turn him loose on society, then, you're saying."
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1925.138,1927.39,"Well, they could hardly imprison him because--"
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.39,1927.974,"Well, that's my point."
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1927.974,1928.49,--Yes.
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1929.576,1937.58,"And they're advised in advance he's going to kill somebody, and the question is they had a duty to protect other servicemen, and the heck with the civilian population."
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1937.58,1941.067,"--Well, I think it will be too strong to say that they were advised that he would kill someone else, but certainly--"
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1941.067,1943.586,But you're saying they were on notice that it might happen.
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1943.586,1948.221,--He put the service on notice because of his past conduct that he had that potential.
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1948.221,1952.775,So you're saying that military personnel with those facts had a duty to turn him loose?
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1952.775,1961.38,"They had a duty to follow the recommendations of those officers who had recommended that he be removed from the service, that's correct."
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1961.38,1964.999,And you think there would be a net saving in human life by doing that?
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,1964.999,1978.823,"Well, there's no difference, I don't think, between someone who's been committed for 20 years to a psychiatric institution, and he's served his time, and the doctors say there's nothing more we can do for him, and they release him, and then he turns around and kills someone."
1984.84-194,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1995.535,2003.624,"Suppose they released him, to use your phrase, the day before he committed this murder, would the Army be liable?"
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2003.624,2006.409,I think not.
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2231.283,2233.417,"Before you get into the Feres doctrine, can I interrupt you with one question?"
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2233.417,2234.069,"Of course, Justice."
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2234.069,2242.675,"Do I correctly understand that there's no claim that the murder was committed with a government weapon, or it's not failure to supervise a soldier in the use of his weapon?"
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2242.675,2243.391,That's correct.
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2243.391,2243.941,"Yeah, I see."
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2245.241,2246.043,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2246.043,2246.793,--I see.
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2246.793,2258.017,"In the analysis of the court of appeals, Shearer did not sustain his injury either in the course of or incident to military service."
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2333.333,2342.521,"Are you familiar, Mr. Cannon, with a case in the Eighth Circuit, the name of which I don't recall, where suits were brought--"
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2342.521,2343.29,--The Brown case.
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2343.29,2353.996,--on the basis of the erroneous weather reports and erroneous judgments of the United States engineers about the flood level of the Mississippi River?
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2353.996,2354.596,"No, sir."
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2355.431,2355.898,No.
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2356.881,2357.514,Yes.
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2357.514,2369.256,"Now, there the Eighth Circuit held, and I believe this Court denied cert, that there just was no recovery."
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2386.383,2399.893,"Well, there are also cases, Mr. Chief Justice, where the government has been found liable where they had FAA personnel within their membership who did not perform their duties properly, and that was found--"
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2399.893,2400.726,In this Court?
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2400.726,2403.928,"--No, not before this Court, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2519.168,2524.405,"Well, you say it doesn't imply or suggest review of Army policy."
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2537.213,2546.069,"Justice Rehnquist, there is no question that if this case involves a review of policy or the formation of regulations that it would be barred."
1984.84-194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2581.741,2593.382,"Yes, but I thought part of the Feres doctrine was that you do not subject the Armed Forces to the same sort of review of their policies and actions as you do subject private companies."
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2593.382,2599.97,"Well, I suggest that the distinction is if we're reviewing policy, then the claim is lost."
1984.84-194,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2613.88,2617.247,"You may have answered this question before, and I missed it."
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2627.37,2627.737,Yes.
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2627.737,2628.805,What about that?
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2628.805,2631.172,"Oh, they clearly have a case without question."
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2635.126,2640.261,What case would you say supports your conclusion that they'd clearly have a case?
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2640.261,2654.105,"As Justice Marshall pointed out in the Stencel case, if the jet aircraft had crashed into a civilian house, there is no question at all but that the occupants of that house would have had a viable FTCA action against the government for their negligence."
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2654.105,2662.776,"Well, I take it from that you say that this fellow was the same as the pilot of that plane who crashed into the house?"
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2662.776,2663.96,No.
1984.84-194,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2674.268,2679.738,"Well, what about if he broke into the bar and robbed the bar and then shot the bartender?"
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2679.738,2685.809,--Then clearly the bartender or his heirs or his estate would have a viable claim.
1984.84-194,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2685.809,2690.88,"Well, what in the history showed that he was likely to rob a bar?"
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2690.88,2704.62,"There was nothing in his history that would suggest that he was in fact capable of robbing a bar, but certainly there is plenty in his history to suggest that he was a man of violence."
1984.84-194,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2713.042,2714.994,Don't open the gate too far.
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2714.994,2715.661,"No, sir."
1984.84-194,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2715.661,2718.28,You've got it about as wide open as you can get it.
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2718.28,2718.896,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2722.232,2723.85,This has been too fast for me.
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2727.552,2733.705,"--Well, I think... I think it owes... I think the service owes a duty to its members--"
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2733.705,2734.556,"Oh, I see."
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2734.556,2736.074,--not to unusually jeopardize them.
1984.84-194,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.074,2737.907,The bartender is outside the protected class.
1984.84-194,1,44156,william_t_cannon,,2737.907,2738.374,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-194,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2866.74,2868.809,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Geller?"
1984.84-194,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,2868.809,2872.678,"Not unless the Court has questions, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-194,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2872.678,2873.194,I think not.
