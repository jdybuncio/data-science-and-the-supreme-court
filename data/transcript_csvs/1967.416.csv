1967.416,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,31.181,35.225,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.416,1,41270,sam_j_ervin_jr,,2588.924,2592.196,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.416,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3016.787,3021.365,"Well, Mr. -- Senator what do you with the Doremus and that was --"
1967.416,1,41270,sam_j_ervin_jr,,3021.365,3021.843,And that --
1967.416,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3021.843,3023.67,That was Mr. Jackson too?
1967.416,1,41270,sam_j_ervin_jr,,3023.67,3025.181,Yes.
1967.416,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3045.799,3049.128,You don't suggest it would've been different if there's just been actually expenditures with --
1967.416,1,41270,sam_j_ervin_jr,,3049.128,3074.969,"[Indiscernible] independence of the action, the child of one of the plaintiffs, finished his school and was not in school at the time the suit was tried and of course as far as -- the jurisdiction was based upon the claim of the parent that was the establishment of religion or denial free exercise which was concerned became moot."
1967.416,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3098.526,3099.933,That's your reading of Doremus?
1967.416,1,41270,sam_j_ervin_jr,,3099.933,3100.23,Yes.
1967.416,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3100.23,3101.797,Do they involve no --
1967.416,1,41270,sam_j_ervin_jr,,3101.797,3102.3,No taxes.
1967.416,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3102.3,3102.894,No money at all?
1967.416,1,41270,sam_j_ervin_jr,,3102.894,3112.342,They didn't allege that any increase in taxes had been occasioned by the reading of this three or four verses from the bible.
1967.416,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3153.058,3160.573,Mr. Solicitor General.
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3160.573,3165.332,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.416,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3487.343,3503.322,"Well General, how about 13 on page 8A where the alleged money is the -- already has been spent and will be spent, the Secretary of Education?"
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3503.322,3505.432,They alleged that it has been.
1967.416,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3790.474,3796.096,"May I ask you, I looked at all these."
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3812.141,3823.564,"Yes, Mr. Justice, I contend, there's one more Section of the statute that helps in this contention that the statute is perfectly, plainly constitutional on its face."
1967.416,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3823.564,3837.246,I understand that but I'm talking about the acute issue they raise that it's not constitutional because it provides for the appropriation of tax-raised funds to operate church schools.
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3837.246,3856.155,"I am trying to contend at this point in my argument, Mr. Justice, that their contention is directed not against the statute, but against the administration of the statute and if it is against the administration of the statute, it was not a case which called for a three-judge court and therefore does not lie within the --"
1967.416,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3856.155,3859.477,You're limiting your reference to this to that subject.
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3859.477,3863.757,"At this point, I am discussing simply the jurisdictional question."
1967.416,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3889.89,3890.772,Where is the text?
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3890.772,3895.051,And this is not --
1967.416,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3895.051,3897.233,Where is the text of this one?
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3897.233,3901.377,It is summarized on page 4 of the Government's brief.
1967.416,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3901.377,3910.641,Thank you.
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3910.641,3920.847,"The last part of the last full paragraph on page 4 contains practically all of it, but I'll read the full text of Section 705 which is three-and-a-half lines long."
1967.416,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3943.389,3946.856,"Well, does that really help you, Mr. Solicitor General?"
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3948.016,3959.928,I think it helps to support the proposition that the complaint here and all of the contentions are against the administration of the Act and not against the Act.
1967.416,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3959.928,3980.215,"Well, I understand your point up to 705 of the complaint and the complaint alleges as I understand it not that funds are being expended for religious instruction, but they are being expended for instruction in religious schools and that is unconstitutional."
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3981.268,3995.029,"And I would suggest to the Court that that is not enough of an allegation without any factual basis to support it, to support the contention that the statute is unconstitutional."
1967.416,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4121.83,4141.125,"I thought you think that's really surely clear that they mean something a little different from, what I understand you to imply, what they're saying is they're attacking the actions of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in approving the plan of New York."
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4141.125,4152.64,"Well, I think so, but let's take a look at page 17 of their brief."
1967.416,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4205.582,4210.426,Didn't I read in the briefs somewhere that there is pending litigation in the state courts attacking this?
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4210.426,4219.878,"Yes, Mr. Justice there is pending a case there and that seems to me they go to what you might call equity jurisdiction in this case."
1967.416,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4248.769,4256.395,"Is there a reference to the caption and file of that case and then where it is, I suppose that's a matter of the court's judicial notice?"
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4256.395,4269.66,"Yes, it cited in our brief, but I'm not -- it's in a footnote, but I am not sure that I can turn to it at once."
1967.416,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4269.66,4271.509,"Well, --"
1967.416,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4271.509,4279.374,Isn't it true that reply briefs are the copy that's been filed with the clerk of the New York action?
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4279.374,4280.475,A copy of the --
1967.416,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4280.475,4283.584,New York Action has been filed with the clerk of this Court?
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4283.584,4285.357,"That may be, I'm not -- well."
1967.416,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4285.357,4293.127,And is also -- is it correct that it has no attack on Title II of the New York action?
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4293.127,4296.375,I do not know Mr. Justice.
1967.416,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4296.375,4301.928,"Well, I don't see how we can decide without reading it whether it affects this case of not."
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4301.928,4305.761,I'm not contending that it does materially affect this case.
1967.416,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4305.761,4308.988,"But as a matter of fact, the only thing we passed on is this complaint."
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4308.988,4326.651,The only thing that is before the Court is this complaint and I am suggesting that a complaint which does not in effect allege any facts with respect to the defendants in the complaint does not present the issue which the parties seek to present here.
1967.416,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4344.866,4354.731,"Well, wouldn't that be the â€“ if what you say is the proper construction of the complaint there is really nothing stated against these defendants."
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4361.791,4368.635,It would have been a motion to dismiss Mr. Justice if it were not for the fact that the Court had found probable jurisdiction.
1967.416,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4375.271,4377.283,"Well, I agree with that, I agree with that."
1967.416,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4385.547,4389.274,"Well, I will get to that in the next portion of my argument."
1967.416,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,6641.542,6654.171,"First, a brief comment on hypothetical case of Gardner against [Indiscernible] and how it's distinguished from the very real case, Flast against Gardner."
1967.416,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6689.802,6694.258,It's all -- you've got another problem haven't you as suggested by the Solicitor General?
1967.416,3,34959,leo_pfeffer,,6694.258,6703.57,"Well, we ought to -- the declaratory judgment and an injunction, injunctive relief or both."
