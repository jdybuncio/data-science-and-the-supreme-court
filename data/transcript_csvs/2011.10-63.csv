2011.10-63,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.07,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 10-63, Maples v. Thomas."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,6.854,9.706,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-63,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,49.147,51.599,You talk about the State's role.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,56.503,58.57,"I think that -- that's right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-63,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,73.612,79.952,"Well, put -- putting that -- that to one side, what if only one of the three notices had been returned?"
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,79.952,83.504,I think -- if only one from the out-of-State pro bono counsel?
2011.10-63,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,83.504,83.837,Right.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,83.837,85.02,I think that would be a different case.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,104.15,104.433,Who says so?
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,133.251,135.036,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,135.036,138.155,He failed to check with -- with the New York lawyers who were working with him.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,141.607,144.392,"We have three points on the local counsel, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,156.366,156.782,Disclaimed to who?
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,168.757,172.578,I think a -- a couple things on the clerk's perspective.
2011.10-63,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,183.767,184.801,"Well, who says that, Mr. Garre?"
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,188.67,191.122,"--A couple of the things, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,214.805,221.492,"--you are begging the question, which is how is the clerk supposed to know this?"
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,231.13,231.866,--Well--
2011.10-63,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,231.866,236.234,"How is he supposed to know the difference between those that do, and those that don't?"
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,236.234,241.222,"--What -- what -- I think the clerk would be imputed with knowledge, general knowledge of the system."
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,251.161,269.039,"But, you know, even if local counsel is as you -- as you describe it, and nothing in the record establishes it, even if he is a functionary, surely the function would include when he gets a notice, that he makes sure that the -- the people who do the real work know about the notice."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,269.039,269.907,--Of course.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,270.724,272.241,He didn't perform that function.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,272.241,276.061,--In this case the local counsel didn't perform as a mail drop and that was intentionally so.
2011.10-63,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,280.93,283.549,But he didn't have a mail drop?
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,285.417,289.703,--My point was that ordinarily a local counsel would serve as a mail drop; he would forward notice.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,300.144,301.294,To whom did he make that clear?
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,304.996,309.449,"--It's in his affidavit, Your Honor, the petition appendix page 256."
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,309.449,311.484,"His affidavit after -- after the fact, right?"
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,311.484,312.718,"That's right, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.718,315.786,Did -- did he tell the clerk of the court that that was the case?
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,315.786,317.055,He did not.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.055,318.472,"You know, you know, I'm counsel of record."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,327.461,328.711,He did not tell the clerk.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,330.127,330.561,Extraordinary.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,330.561,339.817,"--must not have viewed him as a meaningful player, because when the default at issue in this case occurred the State sent a letter -- faxed it -- to Mr. Maples directly on death row in Alabama."
2011.10-63,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,339.817,341.519,He said that even before that.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,356.778,362.598,"The clerk sent out notices to all three attorneys of record, the two out-of-State counsel and Mr. Butler."
2011.10-63,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,369.919,373.24,Did the -- did the prosecutor -- I'm not talking about the clerk now.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,385.381,386.214,--He did not.
2011.10-63,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,401.824,407.109,But you seem not to rely on what the State as prosecutor did.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,418.684,420.786,"I absolutely agree with you, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,427.622,438.644,"Where does the Constitution say, by the way, that you have to give notice, that every judicial action has to be noticed to the parties to the case?"
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,438.644,439.294,Well--
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.294,441.28,"The Federal rules don't -- don't require notice, do they."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,441.28,443.215,--The Constitution doesn't say that explicitly.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,443.215,444.915,And the Federal rules don't say it.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,447.834,455.772,"We think notice of a post-conviction order in a capital case would at least implicate a due process interest in receiving notice, that it's reasonable--"
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,455.772,456.722,Capital cases are different?
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,462.426,463.045,--I think under the--
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,463.045,465.861,"--No, I mean, it's either a rule for all criminal cases or it's not a rule."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,465.861,466.613,--Well--
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,466.613,470.865,"And if -- if it's a rule for all criminal cases, the Federal rules are unconstitutional, you are saying."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,470.865,475.686,--The Mullane case specifically takes into account the interests of the individual receiving notice.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,486.994,493.564,"Once you are in court and you have a lawyer, it's up to your lawyer to follow what goes on in the court."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,511.859,517.096,--Here Mr. Maples did not have an attorney that was serving in an agency role in any meaningful sense.
2011.10-63,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,528.738,533.689,What if -- but -- your case it seems to me turns critically on Butler's role.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,543.93,553.269,"I think the -- the ordinary role of local counsel, which would have been to at a minimum forward notice in the proceeding, would be a meaningful relationship."
2011.10-63,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,569.898,581.372,Where do we look -- where do we look to see that it's standard practice for local counsel throughout the country to contact out-of-State counsel when something like this is received?
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,619.395,630.536,"I think Mr. Butler -- just simply saying, I'm going to allow -- I'm going to facilitate your out-of-State attorney to represent you, but that's my role, he has, quote, unquote, ""no role"" outside of that."
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.536,632.555,He can't define his role as a lawyer.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,641.577,642.861,"Well, clearly that's right."
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,642.861,656.02,"And if they don't extend even to forwarding notice, even to making sure that the people who were doing the leg work in the case know that -- that the clock is running, my goodness, I can't imagine what his responsibility is."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,657.586,661.99,"That's exactly our point, Justice Scalia, which is that he forswore any responsibility."
2011.10-63,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,682.738,689.825,"Before you get to the court, could I ask you about what the State attorney, the prosecuting attorney, knew?"
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,696.58,700.282,--Certainly they knew that they were counsel of record in the proceeding.
2011.10-63,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,712.257,712.49,All right.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,727.432,729.551,"Well, I don't want to speak for my friend."
2011.10-63,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,736.538,745.894,Is there any reason to think that the State attorney or whoever was prosecuting thought that the local counsel was likely not to do much?
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,745.894,746.51,Yes.
2011.10-63,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,746.51,747.244,"Yes, okay."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,747.244,749.096,"The very actions it took, Justice Breyer."
2011.10-63,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,749.096,749.462,All right.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,784.019,785.152,"That's true, Justice Breyer."
2011.10-63,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,785.152,797.16,So all we have to decide is whether under these circumstances the State attorney's knowledge of all those facts mean that the State cannot assert this is an adequate State ground?
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,797.16,798.26,Right.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.444,801.078,Do we know that he knew all of those facts?
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,801.078,801.896,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.896,803.08,Of course we don't know that.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,803.08,809.317,"But we know -- we know what action it took, and that action was an action that assumed that he didn't have meaningful counsel, or else it would have been unethical."
2011.10-63,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,809.317,810.919,"Counsel, can I--"
2011.10-63,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,810.919,812.769,"Let me ask you -- let me ask you this, if -- if I may."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,825.143,828.897,"I don't know that, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-63,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,848.008,857.448,"What if -- the New York lawyers did not abandon Mr. Maples prior to the time that they left their law firm in New York, right?"
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,857.448,858.15,That's right.
2011.10-63,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,858.15,861.685,"So their conduct prior to that time would be attributed to him, right?"
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,861.685,863.835,I think that's right.
2011.10-63,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,863.835,864.22,Right.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,875.659,878.344,I don't think they would be attributed.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,899.893,902.679,"Mr. Garre, can I go back to Justice Kennedy's question?"
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,912.785,914.902,The direct proceedings had concluded.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,914.902,916.402,The direct proceedings were over.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,920.004,920.673,He did.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.673,921.256,He did.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,923.439,930.695,"It was, but when the State sets up that system and allows for appeals it can't arbitrarily deprive it of an appeal based on the sort of circumstances here."
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,930.695,935.73,"--That may be, but I don't think it's extraordinary that there be no appeal post conviction."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,935.73,938.849,I am not aware of any State that does not allow appeal in post-conviction proceedings.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,938.849,942.92,"It can be allowed, but it would not seem to me extraordinary that it not be sought."
2011.10-63,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,942.92,954.393,"Well, in -- in this case there was a direct appeal, and then there was this proceeding that we're talking about here."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,975.891,976.574,No.
2011.10-63,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,997.154,999.439,I'm -- I'm aware of the allegations.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,999.439,1009.545,"And I think, going back to the court and the clerk's actions here, one of the things that exacerbated the chain of events here was that you had an order which directed that all parties would be served."
2011.10-63,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1009.545,1017.282,"Mr. Garre, I have two questions for you."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1030.208,1033.16,"--Well, I believe that Alabama may appoint them."
2011.10-63,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1039.147,1040.38,But the vast majority do?
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1040.38,1041.164,--Absolutely.
2011.10-63,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1041.164,1042.182,In capital cases.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1042.182,1043.599,The vast majority do.
2011.10-63,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1043.599,1044.332,All right.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1059.626,1061.111,Yes.
2011.10-63,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1061.111,1069.917,--in a -- to excuse a procedural bar in a State court.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1069.917,1070.45,Right.
2011.10-63,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1071.034,1074.903,So we have to decide first whether we extend Holland to this setting.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1074.903,1077.439,"--Well, I think they're independent grounds."
2011.10-63,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1079.555,1081.141,That's the due process.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1087.961,1089.028,--Well--
2011.10-63,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1089.028,1092.199,Will we extend Holland to this type of situation.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1092.199,1094.249,--I don't -- I don't -- I just want to be clear on this.
2011.10-63,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1097.317,1099.269,"Yes, I understand."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1099.269,1100.653,"--But with respect to the attorneys, that's right."
2011.10-63,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1100.653,1101.221,Yes.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1101.221,1107.125,"What is the line, Mr. Garre, between abandonment and just plain old negligence?"
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1107.125,1110.911,It would be the line established by agency law going back to Justice Story's time.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1110.911,1123.651,"So if his local counsel simply goofed in not, not advising the people that were doing the leg work in the case, why is that abandonment?"
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1123.651,1128.622,I think it's actually more of a situation where he disclaimed any meaningful role at the outset.
2011.10-63,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1136.309,1148.286,"Putting aside the question of local counsel, could we find that there was an abandonment if the law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell continued to represent Mr. Maples after the two young attorneys left the firm?"
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1148.286,1149.386,--The Court could.
2011.10-63,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1149.386,1157.391,"And does the record show that they did not represent Mr. Maples, that this was done purely by the two attorneys?"
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1159.141,1163.461,"There is no not a finding, but we think that's the better reading of the record, and I am happy to explain why."
2011.10-63,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1185.291,1189.743,"But in the practice of a law firm, these were very junior people."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1216.06,1218.429,--I think one would ordinarily expect that.
2011.10-63,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1230.287,1232.606,"--What do we know about Mr. De Leeuw's role, Mr. Garre."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1232.606,1237.473,"--What we know is what Mr. De Leeuw has said, which is that he was involved in the case at some point."
2011.10-63,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1248.948,1252.317,"Mr. Garre, we don't know, we don't know."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1262.708,1264.558,"I think that would be appropriate, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1269.926,1299.029,"In that regard, there is one part of Holland that you don't really address, which is that Holland contrasted a statute of limitations issue with respect to access to a Federal court with a procedural bar and said that the State's procedural bar had interest of federalism, that we had to be cautious of ignoring a State procedural bar because of federalism."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1309.003,1309.67,--That's right.
2011.10-63,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1356.234,1358.351,"Mr. Garre, could we go back to the state of record."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1371.493,1374.029,I think there are conflicts of interest here.
2011.10-63,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1399.961,1403.096,"We do know, though, that they were not counsel of record."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1403.096,1404.981,We absolutely know that they were not.
2011.10-63,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1404.981,1411.802,We know that the two who were listed of as counsel of record were not representing him and they hadn't told the court.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1411.802,1413.087,They were not counsel of record.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1425.378,1434.484,But it seems to me it's up to you to produce the facts that would justify our reversing the case that you are asking us to do.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1434.484,1434.984,We asked--
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1434.984,1441.072,"You can say, we don't have these facts; well, send -- send it back so I can -- no, you should have gotten the facts in the first place."
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1448.843,1450.779,--But the petition did include a request for an evidentiary hearing.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.311,1477.68,When did you first make the abandonment claim?
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1477.68,1480.465,"Well, I think we've argued--"
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1480.465,1484.25,Wasn't it -- wasn't it first made in the -- in the request for rehearing?
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1484.25,1485.952,--I think explicitly.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1487.735,1488.702,That's rather late.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1488.702,1493.189,--We think that all along they argued that the attorneys' actions established cause.
2011.10-63,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1499.526,1501.128,That isn't abandonment.
2011.10-63,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1505.247,1516.972,"--We think this falls squarely within the rule of Escondido, where -- where a party makes the claim below -- which they made the claim here that the attorneys' actions established cause -- can make new arguments, different arguments."
2011.10-63,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1536.635,1537.968,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1549.526,1552.245,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1572.058,1577.276,"Let's say the three notices are sent out, all three of them come back, okay?"
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1584.699,1592.222,"In that case, Your Honor, there would be a much more substantial argument."
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1592.222,1594.372,"Yeah, I know it would be more substantial."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1611.849,1620.122,I don't think that the return of all three notices would justify necessarily a finding of abandonment in toto by all the lawyers.
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1631.18,1635.715,What does the return mean when you get -- get a notice returned?
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1640.703,1641.953,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1641.953,1644.071,But does that necessarily mean that they've abandoned the case?
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1646.356,1647.439,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1647.439,1651.426,"Isn't that the only thing it means for sure, these lawyers are no longer here at Sullivan & Cromwell?"
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1651.426,1652.843,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1652.843,1655.462,I don't know how that would be an indication of abandonment.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1657.83,1662.716,"Absolutely, Your Honor, although the presumption generally is that the client stays with the firm."
2011.10-63,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1667.87,1669.472,"Mr. Neiman, I think we're blurring two issues."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1692.551,1696.289,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1712.049,1716.953,"But as far as -- as far the record shows, De Leeuw was not on the record at all."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1739.818,1746.405,"No, Your Honor, I respectfully disagree with that assessment of how we can read the service of the Rule 32 answer."
2011.10-63,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1763.434,1776.324,"What about -- what about the notice that he had lost in the Alabama court and he better, if he wants to go to the Federal court, do something about it?"
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1778.359,1780.159,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1786.03,1798.571,"And Mr. Garre made the point that if Maples were represented, that that would be improper, to send a notice to Maples alone."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1812.414,1820.353,"Your Honor, the record does not reveal why Mr. Hayden decided to send the letter to Mr. Maples alone--"
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.353,1822.472,"Of course, he didn't have to send the letter."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1824.605,1825.774,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.774,1828.626,"I mean, it was just: By the way, your time has expired."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1836.113,1837.565,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1837.565,1844.552,So he just made this extraneous volunteered statement to Maples instead of to his lawyer.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1846.254,1850.205,"At that point in time, the State case was over."
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1855.693,1856.343,Why did he do it?
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1863.63,1869.334,"Your Honor, he certainly was aware that Mr. Maples' lawyers had failed to file a notice of appeal."
2011.10-63,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1872.905,1873.688,Is that surprising?
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1884.629,1889.914,"--Your Honor, I agree with my friend that we don't have statistics on that front."
2011.10-63,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1896.484,1898.151,In a capital case.
2011.10-63,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1898.151,1900.251,Particularly in a capital case.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1900.251,1910.459,"That's correct, Your Honor, although there are some instances in which a capital petitioner or someone on death row decides that they no longer want to invoke the process of the courts and they are ready for their sentence to be carried out."
2011.10-63,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1910.459,1918.713,"I just have two questions going back to the very beginning, when we were talking about the missed address, or the unreceived mail."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1926.484,1931.122,"Not quite, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1939.811,1944.28,"I mean, it's pretty clear that they didn't get the mail, get the letter, because it's sent back."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1944.28,1946.382,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1946.382,1953.202,"One other thing while I'm talking with you, and it's a tangential point, perhaps."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,1980.619,1983.904,"I don't think the law makes that crystal clear, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1995.26,2002.865,Has Alabama ever waived lack of timely appeal in a capital case?
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2002.865,2004.734,"I'm not aware, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2004.734,2010.036,"Counsel, could we go back to the Chief Justice's initial question?"
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2030.533,2032.902,"Perhaps, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2036.789,2043.359,"Well, we know that both lawyers in this case didn't move to another firm."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2055.5,2065.606,"The cause argument in that case, Your Honor, would be substantially stronger as I said before in part because, death, of course, is an external factor."
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2066.225,2073.879,"So you accept -- I don't mean to interfere the question, but so you accept the idea that there is a distinction between malfeasance and abandonment."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2073.879,2088.554,"--Your Honor, I think we would be prepared to recognize that in certain cases an abandonment of a client by an attorney would terminate the agency relationship with -- between the attorney and client."
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2088.554,2089.221,Okay.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2096.444,2097.36,That's correct.
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2097.36,2097.96,From your perspective.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2097.96,2098.862,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2114.122,2116.122,But we do know they were counsel of record.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2138.035,2138.987,Your Honor--
2011.10-63,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2138.987,2143.855,So there was no one from Sullivan & Cromwell other than those two on the record.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2149.343,2152.211,"--I disagree with that assessment, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.211,2163.536,"Well, the argument is that on the record or not is determinative for the out-of-town counsel, but it is not determinative for the in-town counsel."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2174.324,2175.326,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2187.468,2192.02,The notice inquiry is supposed to be a pragmatic one.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2243.238,2250.974,"Your Honor, I suspect that in those circumstances I might well personally do something else."
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2259.064,2262.199,Whereas the clerk has to believe that it's an important letter.
2011.10-63,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2268.42,2270.222,Justice Scalia is right.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2300.741,2303.009,"No, Your Honor, I disagree."
2011.10-63,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2316.353,2344.92,"You concede from these questions that the arguments that you are making in this capital case, which is sui generis, are pushing the Court to consider rules that would have far-reaching effect, such as a rule that places upon a clerk of the court a constitutional obligation to serve counsel with important documents in the case similar to the constitutional obligation to serve initial process in the case."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2388.532,2390.734,"--There are several responses, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2405.161,2410.564,There is no possibility under Alabama rules for an out-of-time appeal in this circumstance?
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2411.28,2419.67,"The holding of the Alabama courts here, as recognized by the Eleventh Circuit, was that this would not be an appropriate circumstance for an out-of-time appeal."
2011.10-63,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2421.17,2428.692,"Is that a discretionary matter or is that a flat rule, once you passed a certain time deadline, you are out of luck."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2431.644,2434.763,--There is opportunity where there is good cause for an extension.
2011.10-63,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2452.141,2468.917,"Well, this goes to my earlier question, and continuing Justice Alito's line of questioning, if the State of Alabama had told the State court, you know, under all of the circumstances we think there should be an out-of-time appeal granted."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2476.69,2480.542,"That seems to be the holding of the Court of Criminal Appeals in this case, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2480.542,2481.744,Did you oppose it?
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2484.127,2490.682,"Yes, Your Honor, the State did oppose the out-of-time appeal, and the State pressed the procedural bar in Federal court in this case."
2011.10-63,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2507.892,2516.882,Could the state in the Federal litigation have waived the procedural default?
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2516.882,2529.642,"--Your Honor, I think the law's not exactly clear on that, but I know of no law that would say the Alabama Attorney General -- the Alabama Attorney General has to press every single non-jurisdictional defense at his or her disposal."
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2543.817,2550.555,You agreed with me earlier that abandonment is an exception to the adequate and independent State grounds.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2554.09,2565.148,"--Your Honor, if I suggested that abandonment itself is an exception to the AISG doctrine, let me correct my earlier answer."
2011.10-63,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2619.949,2637.344,"When -- when lawyers stop representing a client, as the two did, isn't there some obligation of them to tell the client and the court, we're no longer representing you, and arrange for substitutions?"
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2663.144,2665.18,"Yes, Your Honor, I think there is."
2011.10-63,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2692.498,2696.55,Is it -- is it -- I'm still unclear on one factual thing.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2700.502,2701.687,Your Honor--
2011.10-63,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2701.687,2702.787,Or should they have known.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2702.787,2705.056,"--Your Honor, the record is not clear on that point."
2011.10-63,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2709.674,2714.994,Do they check -- do they check the docket every so often to see what's happened?
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2714.994,2732.039,"Most -- most attorneys have an obligation at some point to check the docket, and that's -- that's one problem with the position that Mr. Maples has taken regarding Mr. Butler here and the ability of these parties to obtain information from the court."
2011.10-63,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2749.501,2750.051,Why did--
2011.10-63,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2750.051,2755.738,Then why did they -- why did they send to Maples alone the notice to -- the Federal habeas?
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2767.979,2772.283,"--Again, this is -- this information that's not in the record, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2796.915,2803.819,So he had figured out that something had terminated the relationship between Mr. Maples and his lawyers?
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2803.819,2808.456,"No, Your Honor, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's an accurate characterization of--"
2011.10-63,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2808.456,2809.223,Well--
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2809.223,2813.241,"--of what exactly happened in this case, but in the very least his lawyers had missed -- had missed the deadline."
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.241,2826.918,"Even if you assume that he had figured it out, that -- you would have to impute his knowledge to the clerk of court to -- to find the -- the fault on the part of the State that's alleged here."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2826.918,2829.018,"Well, more so than that, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2829.018,2833.238,Did he tell the clerk of court that he was only going to send it to Maples?
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2833.238,2836.024,"As far as I know, no, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2883.171,2889.324,"--Counsel, could you tell me -- I'm assuming you have practiced in your State for a while."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2889.324,2890.341,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2890.341,2908.536,"How frequent is it in the Alabama capital system that local counsel takes the laboring oar, or even an active participation in the defense or actions of a capital defendant?"
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2924.998,2928.45,"Your Honor, of course that information's not in the record."
2011.10-63,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2935.937,2936.472,--All right.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2968.342,2975.78,"Your Honor, a remand would not be appropriate in this case on those -- on grounds for a number of reasons."
2011.10-63,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2975.78,2976.214,Because?
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,2976.214,2985.12,One is that Rule 7 of the rules governing admission to the Alabama bar made emphatically clear that the role of local counsel was not simply--
2011.10-63,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2985.12,3005.534,"Irrespective of what the rules were, you would have to show that -- you would have to show that, in fact, in this State it is a practice such that the local counsel doesn't do much of anything except facilitate, because this is a state of mind as to whether the State -- and the State knows that."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3031.767,3034.719,"--At least two-fold, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3045.527,3049.313,I think in the briefs -- there is certainly a lot in the briefs that seems to say that.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3049.313,3051.68,--There is certainly a lot in the briefs that says that.
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.453,3073.094,"Mr. Neiman, am I correct that under the Alabama rules when an attorney is represented by more than one attorney, the notice does not have to go to all of them?"
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3073.094,3074.194,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3074.194,3075.61,"It can only go to one, right?"
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3075.61,3076.077,That's right.
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3076.077,3083.216,"So as far as local counsel knew, he was the only one to receive notice of this thing, right?"
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3083.216,3084.633,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3084.633,3089.87,Is it correct or does the notice -- most of the notices I see list the people who have been served.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3092.989,3094.439,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3095.273,3097.29,"Well, then he knew he wasn't the only one getting notice."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3097.29,3097.773,--Right.
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3097.773,3099.675,Or he knew that he was the only one who was supposed to get notice.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3099.675,3108.748,"Well, the -- the cc line in this case cannot establish cause and cannot be deemed State interference for any number of reasons."
2011.10-63,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3165.018,3169.922,"I guess the problem is, accept the rule; it exists."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3193.937,3194.771,"Yes, well--"
2011.10-63,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3194.771,3197.806,"What's the difference between ""I don't care"" and abandonment?"
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3197.806,3202.591,"--I -- Your Honor, I guess I should just make -- make a couple points in response to that."
2011.10-63,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3214.232,3218.635,"We are not talking about the notice issue, we are talking about the abandonment question."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3218.635,3242.751,"On the abandonment question, if it really were -- if it really is true that Butler had decided he was going to do nothing in this case and not represent his client and not be an attorney for the client, then there might be a viable argument that Butler was not -- was not -- had abandoned the client in some way, but that is not the -- a reasonable reading of the record in this case."
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3242.751,3249.405,"If we find -- if we find that these lawyers did abandon their client, would there be some sanction imposed upon them by the Bar?"
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3262.562,3267.116,"Your Honor, I suppose it would depend on exactly what the allegations are."
2011.10-63,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3267.116,3269.235,Have you ever heard of anything happening to them?
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3273.854,3275.222,"Your Honor, I have not."
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3286.245,3290.816,You said -- you said a few moments ago that Butler did more than your friend suggested.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3292.016,3303.873,"Well, of course, we discussed in the brief the very -- the undisputable fact that Butler filed numerous things, and the act of default occurred in this case."
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3304.741,3306.458,"Well, after the default, sure."
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3307.61,3313.597,"--Butler's affidavit certainly -- the filing in the State court proceedings certainly doesn't say,"
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3321.101,3322.203,What did he do more than that?
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3322.203,3328.707,--Butler says on page 255(a) in the petition appendix that he agreed to serve as local counsel.
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3333.143,3338.861,You made a fairly serious suggestion that your friend did not accurately represent what he did.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3344.081,3351.954,Let me withdraw any suggestion that I am saying that Butler had in fact done something that's -- that's clear on the record.
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3353.889,3354.906,Sure.
2011.10-63,1,32172,john_c_neiman_jr,,3354.906,3364.495,The -- my point was that Butler did not simply agree just to move these people -- move these people's admission.
2011.10-63,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3373.351,3374.201,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-63,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3377.303,3379.955,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-63,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3447.582,3453.053,"We don't have to adopt the State's position that he was not abandoned, we have to adopt your position that he was abandoned."
2011.10-63,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3453.053,3464.86,"--And you have a record of the attorneys leaving without only not notifying Mr. Maples, not notifying the Court, and not obtaining the Court's approval, which is required by Rule 6.2 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure--"
2011.10-63,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3464.86,3485.172,"What is troubling to me about the abandonment argument is that -- is the fear that if the Court says that abandonment is cause, there will be many, many cases in which the allegation is my attorney wasn't just ineffective and negligent, the attorney was so bad that the attorney in effect abandoned me."
2011.10-63,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3491.428,3495.546,--Working through agency principles that go back to Justice Storey's time.
2011.10-63,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3521.197,3533.421,"Counsel, do you know how often Holland's brief has been granted -- since it's very recent, but how -- how -- how frequently Collins relief has been granted by the courts below?"
2011.10-63,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3533.421,3535.388,--I don't know the answer to that question.
2011.10-63,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3544.729,3553.501,"Mr. Garre, how do we distinguish between abandonment and simply a botched, very botched, transfer of responsibility within the law firm?"
2011.10-63,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3553.501,3562.357,"When you have counsel of record leaving without obtaining the approval required or telling the Court, I think that is abandonment pure and simple."
2011.10-63,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3654.45,3655.4,"Thank you, counsel."
