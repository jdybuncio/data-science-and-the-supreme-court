2009.08-970,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.872,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-970, Perdue v. Kenny A. Counsel."
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,10.872,22.18,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Plaintiff's counsel in this case earned a large fee award based on prevailing market hourly rates and a substantial number of hours expended."
2009.08-970,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,116.791,117.325,I'm sorry.
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,123.645,131.565,--It was the market for attorneys with similar skill or experience doing similar work as these counsel did.
2009.08-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,133.834,136.203,What is similar -- what is similar work?
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,136.203,143.356,"--Similar work would be Federal court work, where you -- involving class actions, for example."
2009.08-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,147.724,148.341,Okay.
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,148.341,173.876,"What the court did in this case, though, was, rather than take those hourly rates, which were prevailing, which the record was clear were prevailing, the court determined the quality factor justified an increase because they advanced case expenses, because they were not paid on an ongoing basis, and because their fees were contingent upon the success of the case."
2009.08-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.876,178.344,"Well, that has nothing to do with the -- with the quality of the representation, does it?"
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,178.344,179.28,"No, it doesn't, Your Honor."
2009.08-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.28,186.766,"Why didn't it name those factors as -- as the determinative factors, instead of saying, and therefore they should get more money for quality?"
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,186.766,196.907,"Well, for whatever reason, the court determined to use contingency-related factors to increase the fee award based on the quality factor."
2009.08-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,196.907,197.974,Okay.
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,201.209,201.743,Correct.
2009.08-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,201.743,202.645,--during the case.
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,207.047,210.732,And the third one was that they weren't paid on an ongoing basis.
2009.08-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,210.732,212.084,They weren't paid on--
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,212.084,212.867,That's right.
2009.08-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,214.203,215.836,--Isn't that -- isn't that the same as contingency?
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,215.836,221.44,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor, and it's not a rare or exceptional circumstance when you're talking about a fee-shifting statute."
2009.08-970,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,221.44,231.211,"Mr. Cohen, I thought this judge, Judge Shoob, said: These lawyers were amazingly good; I have never seen a better performance."
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,238.882,245.555,"He did say that they exhibited the best skill and professionalism, Justice Ginsburg, that he had seen in his time on the bench."
2009.08-970,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,245.555,246.171,Yes.
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,246.171,251.292,But I would submit to you that that is not a reason to enhance the lodestar because--
2009.08-970,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,251.292,280.894,"How about you get a second-year associate whose billing rate for 2 years of experience is $200, and a partner's rate is $500, and a judge says: This individual didn't perform like a 2-year associate; he did the quality and kind of work of someone far superior in years in skill and experience."
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,288.048,304.842,"--No, it wouldn't, Your Honor, because, if that $200-an-hour associate was doing other work for other clients, the bill would be for $200 an hour, regardless of what the result would have been or how good that associate would have been."
2009.08-970,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,306.559,335.279,"Mr. Cohen, you said in your brief that, in such a case, the prevailing party could argue that counsel should obtain a higher hourly rate in the litigation than the customary rate he or she charges in other cases, and that's the situation Justice Sotomayor inquired about."
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,369.416,391.096,"--What I meant by that position in the brief, Your Honor, was that, in presenting affidavits to support the hourly rate of that associate, that associate may present hourly affidavits that the rate was between $200 and $300 per hour, and the judge could determine, because of how good he did, I'm going to give him at the upper end of that market."
2009.08-970,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,391.531,393.615,But you haven't dealt with my hypothetical.
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,436.977,457.974,"--Well, remember, Your Honor, that, when the statute was enacted, it was said in the congressional reports that they wanted to compensate for the expenditure of time and to reimburse the plaintiff, if you will, for what the plaintiff put out in terms of expenses and fees."
2009.08-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,479.923,512.56,"Well, I suppose the question under the statute is whether it would be a reasonable attorney's fee, and I guess one way to determine that is to ask whether it would be considered reasonable if a law firm that billed a client according to their regular hourly rates came in and said, but we're going to kick it up another -- you know, another $10,000 because this -- this second-year associate, boy, he's a whiz, and he performed like a senior partner."
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,519.845,520.778,"No, it wouldn't--"
2009.08-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.778,521.278,I didn't think so.
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,521.278,527.749,"--and no reasonable law firm would do that, which is why a judge would be beyond his discretion -- or her discretion--"
2009.08-970,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,527.749,528.784,That's not true.
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,539.157,542.674,--But those are private agreements that are entered into with a client.
2009.08-970,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,542.674,547.845,So why can't the judge determine a reasonable fee in the same way the market does?
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,548.545,549.864,That's not the -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-970,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,563.588,567.723,"--No, but the -- but the Congress didn't use the per-hour lodestar--"
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,567.723,568.273,No.
2009.08-970,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,568.273,569.158,--as the method.
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,581.565,582.332,"Well, Congress was--"
2009.08-970,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,582.332,583.501,That part of the market anyway.
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,583.501,584.184,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-970,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,596.575,601.629,"Well, but that's why we have held in our cases that it should be a rare and exceptional circumstance."
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,624.292,645.223,"Well, that's -- in answer to your hypothetical, again, in the market where you have an hourly rate for an associate, that's the hourly rate that that client is going to be billed by that law firm, and they are not going to have a results fee or a bonus fee because that attorney happened to do better."
2009.08-970,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,646.325,662.684,"Counsel, this -- this brilliant second-year associate we are talking about, the way these submissions to the Court are -- the way they're presented, do they carve out her contribution to a particular filing?"
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,689.085,691.954,"--You don't in the traditional way of billing that you are talking about, Your Honor."
2009.08-970,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,691.954,701.911,"Or, indeed, you don't know that the brilliance of the second-year associate enables the $500-an-hour partner to spend less time on the matter."
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,706.713,707.565,"Well, that's true, Your Honor."
2009.08-970,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,744.053,754.511,It is not clear to me what the district judge should do in making the lodestar calculation when he considers quality of performance.
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,763.248,764.617,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-970,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,764.617,775.389,"Because the brief for the Respondent said: Well, you know, you are really counting this at the front end, and if you can do that, why not put it in at the back end?"
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,793.1,805.742,"Well, I would submit, though, that when the judge decides how to do the lodestar rate, he is looking at the affidavits, talking about what the range of the market is for that area."
2009.08-970,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,808.777,813.995,"But -- so that in computing the lodestar rate, he cannot consider quality of performance?"
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,813.995,825.202,"Quality of performance is built within, I would say subsumed within, the hourly rate and the number of hours expended, as this Court has said in Delaware Valley I."
2009.08-970,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,825.202,829.523,"Well, then it seems to me you're saying that he does not look to actual quality of performance."
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,835.025,835.677,"Well, but--"
2009.08-970,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,835.677,842.664,"--That's why I'm having -- I'm -- I mean, you know, the -- the question presented is -- is just quality of performance and results obtained; that's all we're talking about."
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,842.664,843.314,--Correct.
2009.08-970,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,844.047,850.068,"And I don't see why that can't be considered as part of the lodestar, and if it can be, then I don't see what the argument is about."
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,850.068,855.489,--But superior performance is just the reason that hourly rates are what they are.
2009.08-970,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,857.857,858.807,But not necessarily--
2009.08-970,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,858.807,863.745,But does that -- does that mean that the fee would be the same under the lodestar whether the lawyer won or lost?
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,863.745,864.978,"Well, no."
2009.08-970,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,868.664,876.252,"But if for some reason, if -- if you did had some reason to calculate it, theoretically it would be the same fee as if he had lost?"
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,876.252,877.337,That's correct.
2009.08-970,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,877.337,879.62,And so the quality of performance really is totally irrelevant.
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,879.62,883.741,As it is for the normal lawyer working on a private matter for a client.
2009.08-970,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,883.741,884.308,Right.
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,884.308,886.443,They get paid an hourly rate and it's win or lose.
2009.08-970,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,900.018,905.153,"--But we are going back to the judge, who did say that this was the best performance he ever saw."
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,951.031,964.589,"Well, but in the normal system, Your Honor -- and I would ask to reserve some time for rebuttal -- that that hourly rate that that first-year or second-year associate gets is the rate that they bill their clients."
2009.08-970,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,988.203,989.003,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-970,0,35584,mark_h_cohen,,989.003,989.738,Thank you.
2009.08-970,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,989.738,1006.765,Mr. Shah.
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1006.765,1014.27,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1988 permits reasonable attorney's fees."
2009.08-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1031.232,1033.815,You are saying we can never exceed the lodestar amount?
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1042.838,1045.556,"There are none for attorney performance, Your Honor."
2009.08-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1047.242,1047.825,Such as?
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1048.658,1049.11,--Right.
2009.08-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1049.11,1051.56,"What are you referring to, if not attorney performance?"
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1051.56,1052.061,Right.
2009.08-970,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1067.154,1072.975,But it's one of the long-standing traditions of the bar that lawyers are expected to do that in the normal course.
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1075.677,1085.949,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that circumstance is much more closely tied to the statutory purpose of section 1988, which is to attract competent counsel in this subset of--"
2009.08-970,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1085.949,1088.985,"Well, how do you tell -- how do you tell whether a client is popular or unpopular?"
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1107.529,1108.648,"--No, Your Honor."
2009.08-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1150.475,1152.041,"You think that's what we had in mind, huh?"
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1156.462,1157.579,"Well -- well, Your Honor, I--"
2009.08-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1157.579,1163.483,"I think it's very imaginative, but I would never--"
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1164.235,1170.639,"--Well, it is -- Your Honor, it is one of the 10 -- one of the Johnson factors set forth, so it's not coming out of thin air."
2009.08-970,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1171.322,1172.805,Is -- is there another example?
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1182.112,1190.2,"--Your Honor, that is the only one that I think is left after this Court's fee-setting jurisprudence over the last 25 years."
2009.08-970,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1208.128,1210.68,How about a downward adjustment?
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1238.283,1246.12,"--Your Honor, I think the limited circumstances which allow for a downward adjustment would be those set forth in this Court's decision in Hensley."
2009.08-970,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1251.007,1254.126,"Hensley is you lost on an issue, so you don't get paid for what you've done."
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1254.126,1254.626,--Right.
2009.08-970,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1263.564,1265.266,But the plaintiff -- the plaintiff prevailed on everything.
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1271.17,1280.526,"No, Your Honor, I don't think a downward departure would be appropriate in that circumstance, because that's what the -- the prevailing market would not allow for a downward departure."
2009.08-970,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1281.51,1287.364,Even if the judge found as a fact that this lawyer spent 50 hours doing what any good lawyer could do in 5 hours?
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1287.364,1291.418,"--Well -- well, Your Honor, that would be taken care of in the setting of the lodestar rate."
2009.08-970,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1292.418,1295.37,I don't -- I don't see how that is set forth in the lodestar rate.
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1295.37,1306.177,"--Well, it -- not in the lodestar rate, but in the number of reasonable -- there are two components to the lodestar calculation: the number of -- number of hours reasonably spent on the matter and the reasonable hourly rate."
2009.08-970,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1322.27,1328.274,"For extraordinary circumstances, what about a very, very popular cause and he wins and they are beating his door down?"
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1330.559,1332.376,"No, Your Honor, that would not require a reduction."
2009.08-970,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1336.744,1346.617,"Well, I mean, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander."
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1350.254,1354.705,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think there is any basis in the -- in the private market for that sort of downward adjustment."
2009.08-970,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1428.652,1439.96,"One of the purposes of Congress -- one of the purposes of Congress was to ensure that litigants under these fee-shifting statutes could attract competent counsel, correct?"
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1439.96,1440.81,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-970,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1440.81,1460.04,"If the market doesn't give them attorneys to start with because there are so many risks involved in this process and it sets a reduced fee because of those risks, how do you attract competent counsel?"
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1482.537,1502.783,"Two responses, Your Honor: First, the problem that you posit about attorneys having -- being deterred by having to absorb, you know, the -- the upfront outlay of significant expert expenses or to having absorbed the contingency risks, those are problems created by this Court's precedent in Dague, not before this Court now."
2009.08-970,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1502.783,1504.302,"That doesn't mean Dague was right, right?"
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1504.302,1505.202,"Well, Your Honor, no one has asked--"
2009.08-970,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1505.202,1506.421,No one is arguing a different point?
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1506.421,1508.554,--No one in this case has asked the Court to revisit Dague.
2009.08-970,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1619.26,1620.027,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-970,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1620.027,1620.91,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2009.08-970,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1620.91,1626.014,Mr. Clement.
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1626.014,1642.293,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me begin with the colloquy that involved Justices Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy about the rates and whether you can have sort of pre-enhanced rates as part of the lodestar or whether you can only do the enhancement after the fact."
2009.08-970,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1672.062,1678.316,"But sometimes there's a great advantage in doing things mechanically, because it -- it provides an element of fairness."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1752.597,1762.636,"Well, Justice Alito, let me say that I don't think that you need any more standards for the possibility of an upward departure than you need for the possibility of a downward departure."
2009.08-970,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1779.912,1780.58,"Well, but wait."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1852.026,1853.543,"--Well, two things, Your Honor."
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1878.494,1886.314,"I will let you answer your second point, but just on that, I don't understand the concept of extraordinary success or results obtained."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1914.251,1918.969,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, I defer to you, but I'm not sure that comports with my experience."
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1937.616,1942.318,"Well, but what does a judge say when he said, you have achieved extraordinary results?"
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1946.305,1953.059,"--No, I think what he says is, in the hands of another counsel, the relief that was obtained might have been significantly less."
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1954.578,1959.613,"Well, I guess that's saying the same thing I said, which if it weren't for how good you are, I would have made a mistake."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1959.613,1961.231,"--Well, maybe not -- no, not how good."
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1966.468,1967.618,Maybe we have a different perspective.
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,1972.087,1974.639,"--And maybe your perspective's changed, Your Honor."
2009.08-970,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1997.555,2000.373,"Maybe -- maybe your perspective has changed too, Mr. Clement."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2009.645,2012.68,"--Well, on that my perspective has changed, Your Honor."
2009.08-970,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2069.703,2070.803,What is the overhead?
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2070.803,2071.419,--What's that?
2009.08-970,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2071.419,2072.419,What is the overhead?
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2111.094,2113.796,"Justice Breyer, the numbers aren't broken down."
2009.08-970,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2114.68,2141.549,"Well, I mean, if you have any rough idea at all, because I think if it's anywhere near $700,000 on average, you say to a taxpayer: You are going to pay this, and that's more money than 99 percent of the taxpayers hope to see in their lives, and suddenly they are paying that money to somebody, which is -- I could say: Okay, pay them 400,000."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2173.401,2180.674,"--Well, what I think you can say for sure, Justice Breyer, is that what came out of that is a lot more if you have your office in New York--"
2009.08-970,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2180.674,2181.19,"Oh, I know, but--"
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2181.19,2182.79,--than if you have your office in Atlanta.
2009.08-970,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.79,2195.95,"--that doesn't help me, and the reason it doesn't help me is because if it's a very, very high number in dollars per year, then I am tempted to think: Well, very high is enough."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2201.152,2206.321,"I do, Justice Breyer, but I also think the question presented here is whether you can ever have an enhancement."
2009.08-970,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2206.321,2206.705,Yes.
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2243.095,2243.763,Right.
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2316.027,2322.181,"Counsel, this lawyer -- I'm sorry, this judge said they were extraordinarily good, but, I mean, where's the cutoff?"
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2331.738,2333.754,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice--"
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2333.754,2334.538,"Yes, that's the thing."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2335.704,2336.288,"--No, no."
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2345.56,2349.012,"Well, for 28 years -- the judge was on the bench 28 years, right?"
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2354.05,2359.252,"--Well -- but he had one case in 28 years, so, I mean, whatever the denominator is--"
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2359.252,2359.954,"I know, but we are trying--"
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2359.954,2360.887,"--it's a huge denominator, and this--"
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2360.887,2364.756,"--We are trying to establish a principle, and other judges are going to have to follow this."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2371.576,2379.181,"--I mean, actually, I don't think that's a crazy way to approach it, which is this really is supposed to be something that's reserved for the rare case."
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2380.181,2386.419,"And I assume -- how long -- how does a judge, who is on the bench in his or her first year, do this?"
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2396.627,2399.662,"--Well, maybe the judge stays his or her hand in the first year."
2009.08-970,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2409.768,2410.57,You say discretion.
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2430.883,2433.752,"--Well, no, I think it's a -- it's a discretionary judgment."
2009.08-970,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2494.891,2499.777,"So you want this Court to look to those cases -- you know, it's the world turned upside down."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2507.633,2508.8,"Well, two -- two responses, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-970,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2508.8,2509.8,I don't do that.
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2509.8,2513.252,"I know you don't, and I know that because I read your dissent -- or your concurrence--"
2009.08-970,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.252,2513.602,Yes.
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2513.602,2514.368,--in Blanchard.
2009.08-970,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2540.569,2548.175,"Should I -- should I look at the fact that, in the early 1970s, when this was done, legal fees were not quite so high?"
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2552.377,2558.797,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I would say that -- you know, you can look to the fact that we have had a lot of inflation since then."
2009.08-970,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2559.697,2560.983,Not just inflation.
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2581.479,2590.002,"--I don't think you should because, again, what Congress said it was trying to do here was not to try to make people indifferent between whether they became lawyers or not."
2009.08-970,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2600.791,2605.678,"Of course, this statute was passed before we adopted the lodestar approach, wasn't it?"
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2605.678,2608.147,"--Before you adopted the lodestar, sure."
2009.08-970,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2608.147,2608.797,Before this Court--
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2608.797,2612.599,"But not before the lower courts had adopted the lodestar, and which way does that cut?"
2009.08-970,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2620.771,2621.287,--No.
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2630.143,2637.233,"Well, again, Your Honor, with respect, I don't think, in any direct way, the lodestar takes into account the quality of counsel."
2009.08-970,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2676.158,2679.826,"But you, yourself, make the point in your brief that the -- that legal fees are changing."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2685.697,2691.034,"--Well, I think, right now, they are sort of, at best, staying stagnant and maybe going down a little bit."
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2735.478,2749.322,"There is a flip side to the unpopular case situation the S.G. talked about, which is lawyers and law firms sometimes take on a particular high-profile case to increase their profile, and they would have done it for a lot less."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2762.646,2766.682,"Well -- and maybe that's right, and maybe there should be adjustment in those cases."
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2791.032,2793.065,"Well, it's also not the term Congress used."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2793.065,2800.921,"--It's not, but if we want to resort to what Congress had in mind, I think that only favors the idea that you would have adjustments upward and downward."
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2800.921,2803.79,"I want to resort to what Congress said, which was--"
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2803.79,2812.146,"And the term is ""reasonable"", and, again, I think, if you were looking for fertile ground to derive a bright-line rule that you never, ever have an enhancement for quality--"
2009.08-970,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2812.146,2828.94,"Aren't you -- most of your arguments are suggesting that the counter -- that your adversary is now limiting, that the adjustment should be made -- tied to something, and that something would be the actual rate."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2858.626,2864.78,"--Well, I guess what I would say, Justice Sotomayor, is that that potentially could be more structured."
2009.08-970,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2912.261,2915.13,But Mr. Cohen said that that would be a very limited adjustment.
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2977.637,2990.611,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, first let me say that I had understood, and perhaps this was wishful thinking, but I had understood that Justice Sotomayor was suggesting the possibility of a broader inquiry at the rate-setting stage, not just a narrow focus sort of within bands."
2009.08-970,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3123.395,3128.466,"Were -- were expert witness fees reimbursable in this case, under -- under the statute?"
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3131.934,3136.504,"The district judge cut -- cut out all of them following this Court's decision in Casey, Your Honor."
2009.08-970,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3136.504,3137.338,All right.
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3137.338,3143.891,"There was still, though, I should say, something on the order of $750,000 in reimbursable expenses that had to be advanced."
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3159.77,3160.47,"--Oh, I think it does."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3176.914,3185.235,"Oh, I was just making a narrow point, Mr. Chief Justice, which is the current rates don't take into account the fact that there was a delay in repayment for reimbursable expenses."
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3319.005,3324.309,"Well, but there -- general counsel do that all the time when they get a bill from a law firm."
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3333.081,3334.199,"Two things, Mr. Chief--"
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3334.199,3339.335,So it's the same -- it's the same thing that happens when a district court looks at the -- the lodestar and cuts it down.
2009.08-970,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3339.335,3352.126,"--Two things, Mr. Chief Justice: One, it's the law of the Eleventh Circuit and I think every circuit that before submitting your fees to the court you are supposed to use billing judgment and take care of some of those things, approximating maybe what your client would do for you."
2009.08-970,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3431.978,3432.78,Thank you Mr. Clement.
2009.08-970,3,35584,mark_h_cohen,,3434.864,3435.649,"Than you, Your Honor."
2009.08-970,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3622.887,3629.191,"May I ask this one final question: We have a question of law before us, whether there's an absolute ceiling here."
2009.08-970,3,35584,mark_h_cohen,,3637.797,3639.915,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2009.08-970,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3642.201,3651.14,"We are assuming for purposes of decision that the enhancement was reasonable, if that was -- if it's ever available, because you are not challenging the amount."
2009.08-970,3,35584,mark_h_cohen,,3657.044,3661.745,"--We are arguing that the enhancement in this case was unreasonable, Your Honor, and--"
2009.08-970,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3661.745,3663.797,That is not the question presented in the cert petition.
2009.08-970,3,35584,mark_h_cohen,,3663.797,3664.797,"--Well, no, I understand that."
2009.08-970,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3664.797,3669.684,"If I understand it, the question of law presented is that even if the enhancement had only been $1,000--"
2009.08-970,3,35584,mark_h_cohen,,3669.684,3670.234,That's correct.
2009.08-970,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3670.234,3671.553,--you would say that was equally wrong.
2009.08-970,3,35584,mark_h_cohen,,3671.553,3673.42,For quality or result.
2009.08-970,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3673.42,3673.87,Right.
2009.08-970,3,35584,mark_h_cohen,,3673.87,3674.755,For those two factors.
2009.08-970,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3674.755,3675.555,"Thank you, counsel."
