2018.17-1026,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.64,"We'll hear argument next today in Case 17-1026, Garza versus Idaho. Mr. Ali."
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,5.64,49.72,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Flores-Ortega, a unanimous Court held that where -- excuse me -- a unanimous Court held where -- that where a defendant pleads guilty and instructs his trial counsel to notice an appeal, disregarding that instruction renders ineffective assistance in which prejudice is presumed. The Court reached that conclusion even though pleading guilty waives the vast majority of claims that could be raised on appeal and even though most defendants who plead guilty do not ultimately succeed in their direct appeal. The Court correctly concluded that prejudice is presumed, both because a defendant's disregard for the instruction to notice of an appeal forfeits the entire direct appeal and because the attorney then usurps a fundamental decision that rests with the client alone."
2018.17-1026,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,49.72,60.84,"Mr. Ali, when you just described the relief that you seek, am I right that you -- what you're seeking is reinstatement of the right to appeal?"
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,60.84,75.0,"That's correct, Your Honor. I think it -- I think that's a really critical point because it shows that what Mr. Garza is requesting here, what Petitioner is requesting, is simply to restore the bargain that the parties struck before his trial counsel usurped his fundamental decision to appeal."
2018.17-1026,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,75.92,86.56,But what -- but what happens -- what happens to the plea -- plea bargain? The plea bargain was conditioned on waiving the right to appeal.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,100.16,102.84,"So, no, that is not Mr. Garza's argument."
2018.17-1026,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,177.08,177.72,"Well, I thought that --"
2018.17-1026,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,177.72,202.32,"But he -- he gets keep the -- I mean, this -- this was a plea agreement that gave him fewer years than he could have been subjected to under the law. And so you're -- you're -- you say -- there was one judge who said he wants his cake and eat it too."
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,210.88,213.12,"Well -- so, Your Honor, I think a couple points in response."
2018.17-1026,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,252.44,257.2,"Yeah, and if it's determined -- I -- I think this -- I thought this was the thrust of Justice Ginsburg's question."
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,266.2,267.4,"That's correct, Your Honor, yes."
2018.17-1026,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,267.4,269.64,And -- and it may be void.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,269.64,270.6,That's right.
2018.17-1026,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,271.72,271.76,And what -- what --
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,271.76,272.72,Whose choice is that?
2018.17-1026,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,272.72,275.96,"-- what breaches the appeal waiver? In other words, you said it's not the notice."
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,277.04,281.36,"It is raising an issue that is, in fact, within the scope of the appeal waiver."
2018.17-1026,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,308.36,308.72,What if the --
2018.17-1026,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,308.72,310.6,Are there any states --
2018.17-1026,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,310.6,320.36,"-- what if the issue that the defendant wants to raise is clearly within the scope of the appeal waiver? You know, he comes to a lawyer and says, I want to appeal because I'm not guilty."
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,320.36,320.64,So --
2018.17-1026,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,320.64,328.36,"In other words, I -- I think, you know, it was voluntary and all that, and the -- it's not beyond the constitutional limits."
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,332.16,333.6,"So, Your Honor, a few responses."
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,367.08,369.28,I think you're -- you're going a little too fast --
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,369.28,369.52,Okay.
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,369.52,371.0,-- because I'm breaking that down.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,371.0,371.12,Okay.
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,371.12,378.72,"All right? A defendant comes to you, you're a competent attorney, and says I want to appeal."
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,411.84,413.44,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,413.44,416.68,The attorney can decide what to appeal.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,431.32,431.72,That's right.
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,431.72,433.4,"And then the court makes the decision, correct?"
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,433.4,434.6,That's correct.
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,434.6,444.0,"With the client deciding whether he wants to rescind the plea agreement? Nothing prohibits a defendant from rescinding a contract, correct?"
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,444.0,445.52,"That's right, Your Honor, although I don't think that our argument --"
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,445.52,446.44,You suffer consequences --
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,446.44,450.28,"-- is contingent on that, that -- this idea of -- of autonomous right to breach."
2018.17-1026,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,452.04,454.36,I understood that to be your position.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,455.92,456.28,"Yeah, and --"
2018.17-1026,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,456.28,457.12,What was the second one?
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,457.12,457.36,Sure.
2018.17-1026,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,551.36,614.68,"But I think your argument does ultimately depend on the proposition that the defendant has this categorical right based on autonomy to insist on an appeal and have an attorney perfect the appeal, file the notice of appeal, even if there is zero chance that the appeal will be found not to have been waived. I think -- and maybe that's right, but I -- I do think your argument depends on that. And I wonder how that is consistent with the way Flores-Ortega analyzed the question of whether the attorney was deficient in that situation. If there is such a right, then why wouldn't the attorney have the right to -- have the obligation to consult with the -- with the client and to tell the client that the client has that right? But, instead, it went through a very complicated fact-bound inquiry into whether what the attorney did or called for such an inquiry into whether what the attorney did was deficient."
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,614.68,617.28,So I think there are two parts to your question.
2018.17-1026,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,734.84,735.44,I think we have to --
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,735.44,735.76,Mr. Ali --
2018.17-1026,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,735.76,778.92,"-- understand the nature of the right that you're asserting, if I could just come back to the Chief Justice's question and perhaps embellish it a little. So you have the -- you have a defendant who is an expert on plea bargains and plea waivers and knows everything about it. This is a highly intelligent, educated person, and signs a plea -- a plea agreement waiving Issue A and then, as soon as the defendant is sentenced, says to his attorney: I want to appeal Issue A. And -- and I think your answer has to be that the -- that that is the right of the defendant and the obligation of the attorney to carry out that -- the client's wishes."
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,779.56,780.48,I think that's --
2018.17-1026,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,780.48,781.36,That has to be your position.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,781.36,782.2,"-- I think that's right, Your Honor."
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,785.28,805.8,"Mr. Ali, what do you do with the jurisdictions that permit a defense attorney to tell a client: I don't see there's a meritorious issue, but I'm going to give you the instructions on how to file your own notice of appeal? There are other jurisdictions -- I think the majority -- who require the attorney to file the notice of appeal and then an Anders brief."
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,821.08,821.6,Right.
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,821.8,823.04,Is that enough for you?
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,823.04,843.36,"Can I just clarify, this particular record, Idaho does specifically provide that if a attorney withdraws before the notice of appeal is -- is filed, that the defendant will be provided with new counsel. And, of course, it was the very representation of the defendant here that prevented the defendant under -- under procedural rules from filing a notice of appeal himself."
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,844.84,849.88,"Yeah, the error here was the attorney did nothing and ignored -- claims to have done nothing --"
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,849.88,850.24,That's right.
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,850.24,850.84,-- and ignored --
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,850.84,851.32,And so --
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,851.32,853.04,-- repeated inquiries about the appeal.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,853.04,883.36,"And, of course, we agree that counsel should have a conversation with the defendant and say: We think -- you know, I believe -- I don't have the record yet, he should caveat it, I don't have the record yet, this is a preliminary assessment during the short window, but I think it's going to be very difficult for you to argue around your appeal waiver to raise this issue that Justice Alito was describing, but he should still perfect the appeal, because what we're asking the attorney to do is a ministerial task here once the defendant has made its decision. And we know that -- the United States knows that better than anybody."
2018.17-1026,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,902.36,919.96,"But what are the practical differences between the consequences of the position you're advocating and what would happen if you were to lose this case? If you win in the situation where the attorney thinks there's no non-frivolous claim to be raised on appeal, after the plea waiver, the attorney, you say, will file an Anders brief, right?"
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,919.96,920.92,That's right.
2018.17-1026,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,921.32,921.8,Okay.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,976.68,991.84,"So, Your Honor, of course, 92 percent of post-conviction defendants across the country don't get counsel on post-conviction review. But I think that one very important collateral consequence was left out, in addition to -- I think the difference in -- in burdens is a significant one here."
2018.17-1026,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1050.6,1058.92,"Well, I guess what I left out is that the issue -- the claim in the -- in the collateral proceeding would be ineffective assistance of counsel."
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1058.92,1061.48,"Well, so then we're attaching an additional burden."
2018.17-1026,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1099.88,1112.8,"I would like to understand better what happens, what are the -- so the -- so the attorney is obliged to file the notice of appeal."
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1126.16,1127.52,"Oh, I'm sorry, no, Your Honor."
2018.17-1026,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1161.2,1176.28,But you -- you want to -- this is a question I started out with. You want to reinstate his right to appeal and you still -- it's still not clear to me what remains of the plea bargain.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1176.28,1176.56,So --
2018.17-1026,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1176.56,1184.96,"Because if -- if he had a right to appeal, he would not have had a -- a plea bargain that says I'm not going to appeal."
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1184.96,1212.04,"So, Your Honor, when Mr. Garza signed this plea bargain with the State of Idaho, all -- both parties understood that Mr. Garza was waiving his right to raise certain issues, you know, a scope defined by the language in the plea waiver -- the appeal waiver, but was -- could still raise several issues which my friends do not contest he can raise on direct appeal. So he would notice the appeal."
2018.17-1026,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1243.04,1248.56,Because the appeal would -- an appeal waiver never precludes any and all possible appeals?
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1248.56,1251.16,That is what is undisputed on this record.
2018.17-1026,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1251.16,1251.4,Right.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1251.4,1298.2,"And that -- that's what the federal courts have concluded, that they're not categorical. And -- and I think it's important to recognize that -- to think about how unrecognizable the conception of trial counsel we're dealing with when we apply the United States or the State's test here. Essentially, what their tests would have trial counsel do is listen to the words of the client and determine whether the words were the right words to be outside the scope of the waiver, and give up that client's best chance, simply because during the notice of appeal window, trial counsel can't come up with an issue or doesn't think the client said the right things, give up his best chance of proving his conviction unlawful -- is unlawful, which is the implication of him having instructed trial counsel to notice the appeal."
2018.17-1026,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1298.2,1298.56,Could -- could I --
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1298.56,1298.72,Mr. --
2018.17-1026,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1298.72,1301.96,-- get your take on the question of when you're in breach.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1322.08,1334.08,"Yes, I think so, Your Honor, because, in Idaho, for instance, the rules are very clear that even with respect to the issues you specify -- and generally speaking, in federal court, we're talking about identifying the order you're appealing from."
2018.17-1026,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1381.96,1388.48,"In -- in other words, if -- if there's -- if the defendant files a brief that raises issues within the scope of the waiver?"
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1388.48,1389.16,That's right.
2018.17-1026,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1392.32,1399.48,And how about if there's an Anders brief that -- that raises issues within the scope of the waiver? Does that breach the defendant's bargain?
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1399.48,1410.52,"Well, the way that Anders plays out is that counsel is required to -- to file a brief, as -- as I think Your Honor's question is suggesting, and -- and the pro se litigant is also given an opportunity to file a brief under Anders."
2018.17-1026,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1444.24,1444.64,Counsel --
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1444.64,1445.24,Are you -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-1026,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1445.24,1446.56,"No, please, go ahead."
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1446.56,1475.36,"Are -- are -- just to go through this, are you aware of whether the federal system or state system would deny a defendant another attorney if, under Flores-Ortega, it's found that an attorney was directed to file an appeal, didn't do it; hence, he was ineffective under Flores-Ortega? When the defendant went back down, would he or would he not get another attorney?"
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1475.36,1486.32,"I think he probably would. In this case, factually speaking, he -- he would because, on appeal, Idaho provides that the state appellate defender comes in."
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1486.32,1490.28,"I -- I'm just asking because I'm not aware, at least from my old circuit --"
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1490.28,1490.52,Yeah.
2018.17-1026,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1490.52,1494.76,-- that we would have not appointed a new attorney once one has been found ineffective.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1507.56,1508.8,I think that's right.
2018.17-1026,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1534.68,1536.88,Counsel -- if I might.
2018.17-1026,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1536.88,1537.72,Sure.
2018.17-1026,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1537.72,1538.0,Thank you.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1594.76,1596.6,So let me -- I think there are two separate questions there.
2018.17-1026,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1611.68,1613.6,"But looking at it as a whole, we've -- it's complicated."
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1614.44,1614.8,"Well, I think --"
2018.17-1026,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1614.8,1616.0,Time 1 and time 2 are complicated.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1616.0,1618.88,"At time 1, the autonomous decision is to waive certain claims."
2018.17-1026,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1618.88,1619.04,Yeah.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1619.04,1619.88,"At time 2, the decision is --"
2018.17-1026,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1619.88,1620.16,Yeah.
2018.17-1026,0,62684,amir_h_ali,,1620.16,1665.92,"-- go file a notice of appeal because I still have other claims. And to answer the second point really quickly, when this Court looks at a situation in which a proceeding has been provided to the defendant and there are certain errors, a client's not entitled -- or a defendant is not entitled to a perfect proceeding, then, yes, in that circumstance, to presume prejudice, you look for those circumstances where prejudice is so likely that, you know, it should be presumed. Now the United States all but concedes that that doesn't apply in this circumstance. If you look at the bottom of page 12, top of page 13, after they do all of the posturing, saying you should be identifying the most likely circumstances, they say: Oh, but the Court has also recognized that when you forfeit an entire proceeding, a proceeding which is a contingency -- or is an important part of reaching finality, that that's not the inquiry the court goes through."
2018.17-1026,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1665.92,1671.2,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jorgensen."
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,1671.2,1683.88,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: My friend keeps referring to a waiver of issues, but there was no waiver of issues in this case."
2018.17-1026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1741.64,1742.68,"Well, many but certainly not all."
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,1742.68,1743.04,Not all.
2018.17-1026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1743.04,1752.48,"They haven't -- they didn't assure themselves of victory on appeal since there were arguments outside the scope of the agreement, including some that have to be available outside the scope of the agreement --"
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,1752.48,1753.52,That's correct.
2018.17-1026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1753.52,1756.24,-- that could have been the basis for an appeal.
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,1756.24,1773.76,"Well, that's correct insofar as it goes, and that's one of the reasons why this has to be a fact-by-fact analysis. In this case, Mr. Garza clearly did waive the appellate procedure to all of those issues that he could conceivably waive it to. So he waived appellate procedure to address his sentences."
2018.17-1026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1794.88,1798.68,Would you have -- could you address Flores-Ortega?
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,1798.68,1800.2,Certainly.
2018.17-1026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1800.2,1803.88,Because the way it approached the issue was pretty clear.
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,1873.6,1879.24,"Well, first off, Flores-Ortega does not address that circumstance where there are both."
2018.17-1026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1898.56,1899.68,I don't know what's both here.
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,1902.32,1903.92,"Well, I would submit it's the first --"
2018.17-1026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1903.92,1914.32,"The attorney -- no, the first part says there's a plea waiver. If the defendant doesn't ask you for one, you don't have to consult."
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,1921.44,1934.28,"I -- I -- respectfully, Your Honor, I would say that where the -- where the client has given this type of conflicting guidance -- in other words, this was a waiver that was secured through the direction of counsel."
2018.17-1026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1951.04,1997.84,"How about totally not understand the system? You don't think that a defendant who has a right to appeal has a right, I mean, to even an Anders brief? Because that tells you why you can't appeal. In -- in my experience, again -- and I don't know if it's typical or not -- Anders briefs are filed and most defendants don't respond, but occasionally you get a few who do. If you forfeited that right to have someone explain to you the whys, you can't get it back."
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,1997.84,1998.12,Well --
2018.17-1026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1998.12,2005.72,Under your -- under your position that you're not -- you've forfeited your right to appeal altogether.
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2005.72,2020.44,"Our position is that in post-conviction, where we are evaluating the conduct of counsel in making this choice, that we have to look at the totality of the circumstances. And in this case, the totality includes the waiver."
2018.17-1026,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2035.0,2060.0,"Mr. Jorgensen, so on what you just said, I guess I was a little bit confused in your brief as to the scope of your argument. Suppose that the client had, you know, after doing the appeal waiver, but there are some issues that you could still bring, not very many, but some, and the client says: I want you to -- to his attorney -- I want you to appeal."
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2089.44,2116.04,"At that point, you can presume neither deficient performance nor prejudice because that may, for example, originate a duty to consult with the client, to actually ascertain whether the client wants to try to vitiate the entire plea agreement, to ascertain whether the client really wants to just test the state and see if they will maybe not act on a direct breach of the plea agreement. There are several different things the client may be trying to achieve."
2018.17-1026,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2121.92,2122.04,Yes.
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2165.08,2165.56,Yes.
2018.17-1026,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2185.96,2218.52,"But doesn't that run counter to our normal division of labor between clients and lawyers? Don't clients generally specify the end, I wish to appeal, and leave it to the lawyer to determine the means? And doesn't it become incumbent at that stage upon the lawyer to identify whether there are any viable issues for appeal and come back to the client and say there are some or there are not some? And a failure to do that, why isn't the failure to do that presumptively prejudicial?"
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2218.52,2224.0,The failure to do that could conceivably be presumptively prejudicial depending on our facts.
2018.17-1026,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2246.16,2268.72,"What -- what is the answer? What is your answer to what I think people are making a fairly simple argument, very clear, very simple? There are trials where there's a guilty plea. Now we hope that at those trials or plea proceedings there are very few errors, indeed, we hope none."
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2321.6,2326.76,"Well, first off, Strickland is the general standard."
2018.17-1026,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2326.96,2328.8,"Yeah, but it's exactly the same."
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2372.0,2374.04,For a couple of reasons.
2018.17-1026,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2427.6,2445.6,"That's disheartening, because we would hope that in trials and in guilty -- guilty plea proceedings, there are also very few grounds for appeal. And you're saying -- I see your point. Your point is, oh, there are a lot there, but there aren't many here."
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2457.96,2459.52,"That what's true or not, Your Honor?"
2018.17-1026,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2459.52,2463.28,That there are lots of grounds for appealing a trial.
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2487.8,2494.04,"Well, I think that the right -- again, it's not just a limitation of the issues you can raise on appeal."
2018.17-1026,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2497.96,2512.04,Is there any practical difference in -- differences between the consequences of taking a hopeless appeal when there is no plea -- when there is no appeal waiver and the consequences of taking a hopeless appeal that is covered by a plea waiver?
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2512.04,2513.32,"Yes, there is."
2018.17-1026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2544.92,2545.16,I don't --
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2545.16,2547.08,-- does the waiver preclude this proceeding?
2018.17-1026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2547.08,2548.12,-- I don't understand.
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2573.0,2576.8,"Well, I think that a motion to dismiss is on the applicability of the waiver."
2018.17-1026,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2602.84,2623.84,"Counsel, in addition to Justice Breyer's question of why complicate the law, or on top of that question, what practical harm has there been in those jurisdictions, those areas, that have applied the presumption? Because I haven't seen much evidence of practical problems from the presumption."
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2623.84,2629.36,"Well, it is -- it is true that most courts deal with these fairly quickly and summarily up front."
2018.17-1026,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2642.4,2644.32,"But -- but it's very simple, I think you're agreeing --"
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2644.32,2644.6,Yes.
2018.17-1026,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2644.6,2662.68,"-- for the court when they get an appeal, so to pick up Justice Ginsburg's point, if the appeal is reinstated, you get the appeal, well, most issues are probably going to be within the scope of the waiver and then there might be, in some cases, something outside the scope of the waiver. Oftentimes those are not meritorious, of course, and are quickly dealt with."
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2677.64,2683.4,What the state gets out of these types of agreements is the procedure itself.
2018.17-1026,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2685.68,2692.84,"But -- but -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but I think you acknowledged that the appeal waiver gives up the appeal except in certain limited circumstances."
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2692.84,2693.0,Right.
2018.17-1026,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2693.0,2694.0,And that goes to my point earlier.
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2696.56,2697.12,Right.
2018.17-1026,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2697.12,2698.12,It can't.
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2704.68,2705.44,That's right.
2018.17-1026,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2751.32,2760.36,I think Mr. -- I think Mr. Ali said that -- that Garza would like to raise the issue of the voluntariness of his agreement.
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2762.6,2763.08,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-1026,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2766.72,2770.24,"Well, has there been a decision on that issue by any state court?"
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2770.24,2799.36,"The district court at I believe pages 31 through 32 -- or, excuse me, 30 through 32a of the appendix on the -- the petition, the district court specifically asked Garza, what issues do you wish to raise on appeal? If -- if we reinstated your right, what would you pursue? And he specifically limited it to the sentence issue."
2018.17-1026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2805.96,2822.16,"Counsel, I'm looking at page 5 of the brief, the blue brief, and so you didn't write it, but it says that, ""Mr. Garza promptly filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief."
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2840.0,2841.44,"Yes, he did."
2018.17-1026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2841.44,2842.2,So let's --
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2842.2,2842.64,He did.
2018.17-1026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2842.64,2853.24,"May I assume the following: that that's what he wanted to appeal, but his attorney, by never conferring with him, didn't get that information?"
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2853.24,2853.52,No.
2018.17-1026,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2853.52,2868.4,"Your answer would be if the attorney wasn't told that by his client because the attorney never asked his client, that that's not ineffective assistance of counsel in this situation where the attorney asked him to file a notice of appeal?"
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2868.4,2877.92,"It might have been ineffective assistance of counsel if that is, in fact, what he wanted and his attorney failed to ascertain that through consultation. If I may continue?"
2018.17-1026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2877.92,2881.12,"Just briefly, one --"
2018.17-1026,1,63046,kenneth_k_jorgensen,,2881.12,2882.4,Very briefly.
2018.17-1026,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2902.64,2911.84,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kedem."
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2911.84,2947.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A prejudice inquiry under Strickland is the normal tool for identifying which final criminal judgments should be reopened based on counsel's ineffective assistance. That is, cases where the harm to finality is justified by increased accuracy and reliability, the court should not abandon that case-specific inquiry here, where any benefits would exist only in exceptional cases. A lot of the focus of argument today has been on the question whether counsel has an obligation to file a notice of appeal under various circumstances."
2018.17-1026,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2986.52,2988.48,But why doesn't that answer the question here? Because --
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2988.48,2989.0,Sure.
2018.17-1026,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2989.0,2991.56,-- there's undoubtedly a statutory right to appeal.
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2991.56,2993.92,That's right.
2018.17-1026,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2993.92,2997.64,And the waiver is only good if it's asserted.
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3004.72,3005.2,Right.
2018.17-1026,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3005.2,3016.12,It is in the nature of an affirmative defense that you'd lose if you don't use. So why isn't it the denial in a proceeding to which the defendant is entitled by law?
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3016.12,3031.76,"So the question is not merely whether he would have filed a notice of appeal and submitted some brief that the court would have read, if we know based on the circumstances that the court would just have thrown out the proceeding at the threshold --"
2018.17-1026,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3031.76,3032.8,I read what it says in Flores-Ortega.
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3054.36,3056.16,That's right.
2018.17-1026,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3057.32,3057.8,Okay.
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3084.72,3087.84,So Flores-Ortega certainly says what you're talking about --
2018.17-1026,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3087.84,3088.16,All right.
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3088.16,3121.64,"-- but it also clarifies elsewhere that the type of appeal to which we're talking about is an appeal to which the defendant has a right, which is to say a merits proceeding. If a defendant, for instance, asks to appeal to the wrong court, he wants to appeal to the Ninth Circuit rather than to an Idaho state appellate court, no one would say that if his attorney declines to file that notice of appeal, knowing that it would just be tossed out without any consideration of the merits of his claims, that the defendant has been prejudiced in the sense that -- that the Sixth Amendment cares about, because Strickland uses the term prejudice --"
2018.17-1026,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3121.64,3124.56,Because he has no legal right to that kind of appeal?
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3124.56,3125.2,That's correct.
2018.17-1026,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3125.2,3129.08,But he does have a legal right to appeal to the court -- relevant court of appeals.
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3144.24,3144.48,Sure.
2018.17-1026,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3144.48,3146.96,-- removed that complication you've added.
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3146.96,3148.24,"Well, let me give you another example."
2018.17-1026,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3165.08,3168.68,"Again, I think that's just evading the hypothetical, respectfully, counsel."
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3179.76,3179.84,So --
2018.17-1026,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3179.84,3182.52,And you also might have some good arguments.
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3183.88,3184.84,Right.
2018.17-1026,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3184.84,3190.28,Let's look at the Anders briefs filed in those cases where there was no waiver.
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3190.28,3190.64,Sure.
2018.17-1026,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3190.64,3191.0,I mean --
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3191.0,3191.76,You know --
2018.17-1026,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3191.76,3196.24,"-- none of those cases did he have a really good argument, or the lawyer wouldn't have filed an Anders brief."
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3196.24,3208.92,"So -- so here is why we think it is different in a case where the defendant just has bad arguments of the sort that might get asserted in an Anders brief. You still know there that if a notice of appeal is filed, that there will be review on the merits."
2018.17-1026,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3239.72,3264.0,"Do you think we can get anything out of the question whether the defendant has a legal right to file some thing there? Isn't it the case that, under statutes and under rules, defendants have the right to do all sorts of things during a criminal proceeding, but for almost all of those, the decision is made by the attorney?"
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3264.0,3265.12,That's correct.
2018.17-1026,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3279.12,3279.56,Sorry.
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3289.28,3290.04,That's correct.
2018.17-1026,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3290.04,3299.04,"And what you're saying is the court will read it, he has a chance to file his own, and then it will write the word affirmed, all right? So now what we have is this case."
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3312.36,3312.88,Usually they --
2018.17-1026,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3312.88,3318.0,"Do you know that they don't write the word affirmed, rather, that they write the word dismissed? I've never seen that, you know."
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3321.36,3322.04,"Well, Justice Breyer --"
2018.17-1026,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3322.04,3326.2,Do you know that the court of appeals writes the word dismissed and not the word affirmed?
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3326.2,3327.08,That's right.
2018.17-1026,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3331.04,3332.24,Where they'll say dismissed and not affirmed?
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3332.24,3332.84,-- in which they dismiss.
2018.17-1026,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3332.84,3333.04,All right.
2018.17-1026,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3336.04,3357.56,"It's -- it's -- that is one technical difference, but I think it also goes to the question: Are they reviewing the claims on the merits? When there's a loss of a proceeding in which no merits review occurs, that doesn't undermine our faith in the reliability of the proceedings. It's also important to note that an appellate waiver doesn't just make the likelihood of success on appeal lower."
2018.17-1026,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3392.36,3427.84,"How does that fit with the usual breakdown of responsibilities between client and lawyer where we normally assume that clients only specify objectives or ends and that the lawyer has the obligation under our ethical rules and, mostly -- most of our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence to -- to pick the appropriate means? So, if a client says I wish to appeal anything that's possible, why isn't that a necessary directive to the lawyer to figure out which possible things fall outside the waiver or -- or those sorts of things? Why does a client have to come forward and identify the winning argument?"
