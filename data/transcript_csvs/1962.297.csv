1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,30.733,34.082,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1962.297,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,139.002,142.591,Is that the same as the second reason one as the same as the first one?
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,142.591,161.585,"It ties in -- yes, I think it is except that in considering the exculpatory clauses in the contract, Mr. Justice Stewart, Crescent asked you to relieve them not only of their liability for failing to furnish sufficient power but also of their liability for unseaworthiness of their equipment."
1962.297,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,161.585,164.116,Was there an explicit finding of unseaworthiness?
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,164.116,170.689,The Court found that the engine failed as a matter of law that makes the engine unseaworthy.

1962.297,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,233.666,245.87,"Mr. Vickery, this case involves the failure to lower these legs and that's the immediate cause of hitting the bridge."
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,245.87,246.338,Yes sir.
1962.297,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,246.338,253.323,There's a picture of this rig in the opening front page of the -- what are we talking about?

1962.297,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,275.449,278.616,And is that -- how's that done?
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,278.616,289.215,This is done by three motors connected to these three -- two leg -- of these three legs which are constant speed motors that lower the legs at approximately one foot per minute.
1962.297,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,313.721,314.649,Right.
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,314.649,316.658,And then lower the additional 20 feet.
1962.297,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,316.658,318.345,And that would have taken about 20 minutes.
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,318.345,321.411,Approximately 20 minutes since the legs lower at one foot --

1962.297,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,324.106,327.407,It would have had to have been stopped there in the water for about 20 minutes.
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,327.407,327.528,Yes sir.
1962.297,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,327.528,328.813,In order to carry out the plan.

1962.297,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,350.409,351.321,Where would be what?
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,351.321,354.949,Where an additional 30 feet would be added to each of the three legs.
1962.297,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,354.949,355.899,You said something else first.

1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,371.736,373.241,"Yes, it's much like launching a ship."
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,464.735,468.128,Has there been any congressional enactment in that subject sense?
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,468.128,470.006,"Not at all, Your Honor."

1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,788.328,790.554,Mr. Kohlmeyer I'm sure can answer that question.
1962.297,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,899.635,909.679,Is there anything in the record to indicate that a mere more horsepower would not have solved this problem?
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,909.679,916.993,Mr. Kohlmeyer refers in his brief to the fact that additional horsepower might not have solved this power.
1962.297,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,954.557,958.574,Why -- why did he say that it hit the bridge then?
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,958.574,967.33,The captain of the flotilla testified that he stopped there for 20 minutes and Dixilyn's duty was to lower the legs at his command.

1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1155.531,1157.531,Yes sir.
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1176.685,1184.285,Are there different -- different rules for this kind of vessel and others so that they come in a particular category?
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1184.285,1187.735,The rules are different only because of certain acts of Congress and regulatory --
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1187.735,1189.318,I mean in reference to rates --
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1189.318,1189.812,In --
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1189.812,1191.423,-- insurance rates.
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1191.423,1192.961,With respect to insurance rates?
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1192.961,1195.305,Yes.
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1203.252,1205.516,"Yes sir, this offshore drilling rig?"
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1205.516,1205.929,What did you say?
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1205.929,1207.289,The offshore drilling rig?

1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1207.802,1208.115,Yes sir.
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1218.031,1226.364,"And what -- with reference to insurance rates, what would be the difference?"
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1226.364,1227.186,I can't tell you.
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1236.315,1246.377,"But I would assume if the Bisso rule continues to apply, it might make a difference if it were to be overruled."
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1246.377,1247.237,If this would --
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1247.237,1248.65,"-- difference in rates, would it or not?"
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1248.65,1250.343,"Yes sir, I think definitely that it would."
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1254.762,1255.907,Prospectively.
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1255.907,1256.246,Yes sir.
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1256.246,1257.888,But not retroactively.
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1257.888,1262.001,Retroactively insofar as any cases that are still pending in the courts below.
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1262.001,1272.358,Well that would -- they couldn't compensate themselves for the change of the great necess -- necessary change in rates that would be brought about by increasing the liability.
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1272.358,1274.193,That is correct.
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1274.193,1275.15,How about decreases?
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1275.15,1276.093,That's right.
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1276.62,1282.828,What you have here is a question of -- which insurance company would pay.
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1292.682,1294.108,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1294.108,1300.422,Remaining probably stationary this though as left as it was but changed if it's overruled?
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1300.422,1301.492,Yes sir.
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1307.659,1312.193,That's about the sum total of the controversy.
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1312.193,1320.025,"Well, I suppose that you can -- you can bring it down to that little nutshell, Your Honor, yes."
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1320.025,1323.406,"But that is rather important I assume in their business, isn't it?"
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1323.406,1325.485,"Yes sir, it's very important."
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1365.407,1366.909,So Bisso should be overruled.
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1372.678,1376.605,"None at all, none at all."
1962.297,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1376.605,1378.005,It wouldn't do any good isn't it?
1962.297,0,23328,e_d_vickery,,1380.265,1383.922,"It's only applied prospectively to others, that's correct."

1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2141.892,2142.48,The two reasons --
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2142.48,2154.627,"Suppose the reasons that the Court gave in following the rule and considered to be the rule were not adequate reasons, is that any reason why the rules should be ignored?"
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2154.627,2158.497,If the Court please; it's our submission that if -- that Your Honors --
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2158.497,2160.475,Are you asking to overrule --
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2160.475,2161.471,"Yes, I think the social one."
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2161.471,2163.1,That's why I can't understand that.
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2163.1,2164.301,"Yes, it's wrong I think."
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2164.301,2164.875,Yes.
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2164.875,2165.461,And the industry feels that it's wrong.

1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2167.749,2169.83,"Yes, I think it does."
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2195.438,2198.339,How does that affect the rule?
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2198.339,2209.299,It simply shows that the rule is existing to block a legal result that is practically being achieved whether or not legal.
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2209.299,2212.02,Now have you -- you've produced evidence to show all that.
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2212.02,2212.345,No sir.
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2215.948,2229.122,"Now whatever it is, it is true isn't it that in Bisso and the cases that came down the same day, we held that a contract at that time could not be enforced was invalid."
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2229.122,2231.099,This was a dam barge if the Court please.

1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2232.094,2234.076,"Yes, that is correct."
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2234.076,2243.85,"And here, if you win, it has to be held that that rule -- this old rule completely are through a large extent [Inaudible]"
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2243.85,2244.872,Not at all sir.
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2244.872,2245.403,It doesn't.
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2245.403,2246.207,No.
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2287.434,2306.336,"But if we held -- if we held as I thought we did which was the rule which was enforced contract to that kind were invalid, nobody could rely on, how can you get a concurred decision here without overruling the case?"
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2306.336,2308.739,"If the Court please, this isn't that sort of contract."

1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2313.665,2315.631,"No, it does not if the Court please."
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2317.962,2319.225,What is it?
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2319.225,2323.022,This is a contract which has three phases.
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2405.523,2408.413,Why isn't that an exemption from liability?
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2408.413,2410.983,It is if the Court please but is it illegal?
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2420.916,2423.801,What does it do about shifting the liability?
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2423.801,2426.181,As I understand Bisso --
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2426.181,2426.408,What --
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2426.408,2428.825,-- because of reasons that I consider inadequate --
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2428.825,2448.612,"Maybe I'm wrong but I thought that you would -- I can understand that you're saying Bisso was wrong and ought to be overruled, but I frankly cannot understand, I've looked at the record carefully, I frankly cannot understand how you can say that we would have to overrule it to decide your way?"
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2448.612,2452.972,"Well, I say please overrule it first (Voice Overlap) but secondarily if the Court the please, I --"
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2452.972,2453.757,Maybe it should be.
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2454.901,2463.979,I don't see why it is inherent in Bisso that across naming of assureds in an insurance policy is improper.
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2465.054,2469.071,But what's the result of it?
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2469.071,2474.352,"Well, the result is that the underwriters on the barge pay the loss which is what should happen."

1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2484.567,2486.417,"No, it doesn't do that at all."
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2490.414,2495.389,That's a different language which was -- what's the effect of it?
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2500.382,2501.034,What you have you're saying.

1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2512.426,2513.289,Yes.
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2513.289,2516.303,"That's right, as I understand it."
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2516.303,2519.159,But in a way that I say is not reprobated by Bisso.
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2519.159,2521.145,"Well, they used different words."
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2521.145,2542.043,"No, if the Court please, it is completely different to say to you that you are in -- let's assume you have an automobile that you're riding in or a truck that you're driving and you tell the truck insurance company that you want the truck policy to include all riders as well as the driver of the truck."
1962.297,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2549.146,2552.025,So you're saying to get somebody else.
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2552.025,2556.443,"No, if the Court please, there is no change in rates for this."

1962.297,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2581.368,2589.316,Because you'll pay the premium insurance even though you cross it on barge policy.
1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2589.316,2593.096,"No, if the Court please, you would eliminate that insurance if you're able to foreclose this."

1962.297,1,19378,charles_kohlmeyer_jr,,2661.003,2671.344,That's one of our arguments that differentiates this from Bisso namely that they have a choice of either taking the contract with the release clause where their insurance would cover us --
