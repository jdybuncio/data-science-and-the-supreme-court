2011.10-1062,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.587,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1062, Sackett v. the Environmental Protection Agency."
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,8.62,11.808,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,50.933,59.622,"Of course, there would have been a daily fine with or without the compliance order, wouldn't there, if they were indeed in violation of the -- the act."
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,59.622,64.106,"Justice Scalia, the fine would only have been attributable to the statute itself."
2011.10-1062,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,73.881,90.674,"So, Mr. Schiff, your understanding is that each day your clients are subject to $37,500 of fines for the violation of the statute, and an additional 37.5 for violation of the compliance order?"
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,93.293,94.712,"Yes -- yes, Justice Kagan."
2011.10-1062,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,112.673,124.581,But the court of appeals did say that there would be no independent liability under the -- for -- for violation of the compliance order.
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,133.253,135.22,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-1062,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,156.452,160.77,What -- what kind of review are you seeking?
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,181.668,188.337,"No, Your Honor, we seek review of that jurisdictional question as it is incorporated into the compliance order."
2011.10-1062,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,203.614,208.401,"Can you tell me, what -- what would be the scope of your holding?"
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,236.237,247.962,"Well, Justice Kennedy, we do not believe that what we are articulating extends as far as -- as creating a right under the APA for review because a health inspector has come onto your property."
2011.10-1062,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,259.77,261.653,"Well, this is under -- under the APA."
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,261.653,262.12,--Correct.
2011.10-1062,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,262.12,264.405,This is the APA prong of your argument.
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,264.405,265.272,"Correct, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,275.712,305.481,"It seems to me that -- that there's another distinction, a more significant one, between routine inspections by fire marshals or -- or restaurant inspectors, and that is that if you -- if you disobey their order, you're not subjected to any more substantial liability than -- than you would have been subjected to had they not issued the order."
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,310.968,312.635,"That is exactly correct, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1062,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,320.341,327.245,"What if the sanction imposed each day was not the $37,000, but was $10."
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,342.59,347.576,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe that would change the Court's finality analysis under Bennett."
2011.10-1062,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,352.545,360.735,"But it might go to adequacy of judicial review, the adequacy of the judicial review that would come when the APA brings the enforcement action."
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,379.28,387.885,"--Well, to begin with, Mr. Chief Justice, in addition to the independent liability that the compliance order imposes, there are other legal effects."
2011.10-1062,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,403.262,403.945,To apply for a--
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,403.945,405.695,--For an after-the-fact permit.
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,438.685,439.635,What do -- what do you care?
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,450.759,452.026,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.026,455.561,"So, you know, sufficient unto the day the evil thereof."
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,486.266,487.466,"Well, Justice Scalia--"
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,487.466,489.718,Is that such a hard -- a hard hit?
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,493.686,503.794,"--Well, the difficulty, Justice Scalia, is that the Sacketts cannot obtain judicial review of the compliance order within the context of the permitting process."
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.698,514.599,"Well, but their challenge to the compliance order is simply that they don't have wetlands."
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,522.803,534.427,"That issue might be raised, Your Honor, but the Sacketts could never get review of that issue within the context of the compliance order, which is, of course, the agency action that has caused their harm."
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,550.373,552.856,How long does it take to get one of those after-the-fact permits?
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,552.856,558.126,"There is -- there is a study, Your Honor -- in terms of averages, I think it is about a year."
2011.10-1062,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,574.071,579.123,Could you -- I don't understand what exactly you might get from the Army Corps of Engineers.
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,594.967,595.784,Very much so.
2011.10-1062,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,629.556,631.508,"Is that -- is that what's critical, Mr. Schiff?"
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,645.917,658.575,"No, it would not, Justice Kagan, because, again, the fact is that the -- the compliance order is -- well, the permitting process is an entirely separate agency action."
2011.10-1062,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,665.581,666.448,So why does that matter?
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,677.805,690.879,"Justice Kagan, the difficulty is that that judicial decision would have no impact and would not remedy the deprivation that the Sacketts are currently enduring."
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,690.879,694.081,Do they issue permits when there are no wetlands?
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,702.187,703.387,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,703.387,708.575,"So if -- if they decide that there's -- that it's not a wetland, what do they -- what do they do?"
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,709.141,710.777,That's my understanding.
2011.10-1062,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,714.662,718.114,--But then the compliance order would automatically be vacated?
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,724.536,727.904,"--The difficulty, Justice Kennedy, is that we are talking about two agencies."
2011.10-1062,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,740.495,749.501,"That seems very strange for that, for a party to apply for a permit on -- on the ground that they don't need a permit at all."
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,760.958,762.792,"--That's -- that's exactly right, Justice Alito."
2011.10-1062,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,808.357,810.809,What would the standard be -- be called?
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,822.883,841.511,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it would be your typical arbitrary and capricious standard of review, substantial evidence based upon the record that was before the EPA when it made its finding of statutory violation, which is the statutory predicate for the issuance of the complaint."
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,841.511,842.195,"Well, wait, wait."
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,857.104,860.239,"No, exactly, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,864.693,867.828,"I don't think that one standard of review would do you very much good, to tell you the truth."
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,875.249,877.951,"--Well, I certainly hope not, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1062,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,890.242,904.751,"Given -- given the rather vague nature of the test that's been adopted for determining whether something is part of the waters of the United States, wouldn't you have a very difficult time showing that a determination that it was, was arbitrary and capricious?"
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,904.751,910.172,"--There is no question, Justice Alito, that there -- there -- yes, it would be a difficult time."
2011.10-1062,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,930.753,941.543,"And Mr. Schiff, is the way you see this operating that you bring an action contesting on the basis of the arbitrary and capricious clause or otherwise not in accordance with law?"
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,951.582,953.768,Yes.
2011.10-1062,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,964.309,972.58,Would collateral estoppel apply to you because of the judicial determination on the compliance order in the subsequent enforcement action?
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,984.137,989.705,"Well, not necessarily Mr. Chief Justice, because, one, the standard of review would be different."
2011.10-1062,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,995.493,997.878,I guess I am back to Justice Scalia's question.
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,1008.685,1011.037,"--No, you are correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-1062,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1030.199,1031.632,But to go back to the Chief Justice's--
2011.10-1062,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1031.632,1039.652,"If they are wrong about that, if there is a finding in the APA process that these are wetlands, is that the end of it?"
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,1057.947,1058.632,No.
2011.10-1062,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1078.077,1078.863,Who would review that and where?
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,1097.157,1104.411,"--Well, at that point then both sides get to create a new record, consistent with what the Ninth Circuit held."
2011.10-1062,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1104.961,1108.548,--So the Chief Justice's suggestion that there would be preclusion you do not agree with?
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,1108.548,1109.398,--No.
2011.10-1062,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1134.363,1135.882,So does anything get estoppel?
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,1135.882,1137.199,"I'm sorry, Justice--"
2011.10-1062,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1137.199,1138.484,Does anything get estoppel?
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,1152.242,1162.614,"--It -- it would be difficult to imagine a case of estoppel, because again, in the APA context it's just based upon the record at the time the compliance order is issued."
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1179.242,1184.044,This wouldn't be a problem if -- if this procedure were not employed.
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,1214.916,1220.219,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, to some extent it is, of course, the process that -- that--"
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.219,1221.586,But that's in the statute.
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,1230.175,1241.05,"--It -- it -- it does indeed, and so even if the Sacketts on remand don't get their ideal mode of judicial review, something is frankly better than nothing."
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1300.421,1304.306,"Of course, you know, you are not going to be out of the woods."
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,1321.168,1322.952,"--No; that is correct, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1323.302,1341.831,"And so even if you lose on that, you might still think you can win when the EPA finally brings a -- a civil action seeking to impose a penalty, where the burden will be on the EPA without -- without any deference to its fact-finding."
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,1345.55,1346.617,--Well--
2011.10-1062,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.617,1348.669,You've have lost one but you may win the other.
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,1349.835,1353.473,"--Well, respectfully, Justice Scalia, it's more than rolling the dice."
2011.10-1062,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1381.656,1384.608,Is there no limitation on the compliance order?
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,1390.946,1406.456,"As -- Justice Ginsburg, as EPA interprets the statute of limitations for collecting civil penalties, so long as the ""discharge"", quote unquote, remains in place, it is considered a continuing limitation, and so the statute of limitations never even begins to run."
2011.10-1062,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1435.056,1448.549,"I asked you earlier, in this APA review would there be any further question after the determination is it wetlands, is it not."
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,1466.86,1469.646,"Allow me to clarify, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-1062,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1507.337,1513.425,"You are conceding that the compliance order, assuming there is a violation, is all right?"
2011.10-1062,0,21552,damien_m_schiff,,1520.245,1523.866,"That is correct, Justice Sotomayor, yes, that is correct."
2011.10-1062,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1528.768,1529.687,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1538.543,1540.476,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-1062,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1592.524,1593.908,"You say ""practical""."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1601.047,1608.051,--That language in the order would have been accurate even if the statute didn't authorize penalties for violating the order itself.
2011.10-1062,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1655.949,1656.801,"But, Mr. Stewart--"
2011.10-1062,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1656.801,1658.401,I don't follow -- I didn't follow that.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1662.288,1662.921,--It is--
2011.10-1062,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1662.921,1665.973,"One for violating the act, two for violating the compliance order."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1665.973,1674.078,"--The first is it is a legal possibility; we are not aware of any case in which a district court has ever imposed penalties of greater than the 37,000--"
2011.10-1062,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1674.078,1677.38,"Well, you don't doubt that -- you don't doubt that they have the authority to do that?"
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1677.38,1678.297,--They have the authority to do that.
2011.10-1062,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1700.161,1701.163,Has the--
2011.10-1062,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1701.163,1701.913,"But, Mr. Stewart--"
2011.10-1062,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1702.93,1703.782,Justice Alito.
2011.10-1062,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1703.782,1714.387,--Has the United States adopted a rule or adopted a policy that it will never seek anything more than the penalty for the underlying violation?
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1718.357,1720.524,We have not adopted a policy to that effect.
2011.10-1062,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1722.493,1724.178,"So it's more than theoretical, then."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1731.015,1737.519,"--I guess the two -- I don't know that we have ever asked for more than the 37,500 per day."
2011.10-1062,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1763.47,1767.022,"Your order could have read, it could have read:"
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1814.586,1823.459,"--And again, we don't dispute that violating the order could as a realistic matter cause the penalties to be greater within the statutory maximum."
2011.10-1062,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1832.148,1837.018,It could -- it could as a theoretical matter double the penalties.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1837.018,1837.951,That's correct.
2011.10-1062,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1837.951,1841.07,You are just saying as a practical matter it doesn't often do that.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1841.07,1849.509,As a practical matter we are not aware of any case in which the penalties imposed have been greater than the per day statutory maximum provided--
2011.10-1062,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.509,1851.028,I'm not going to bet my house on that.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1851.028,1864.019,"--In terms -- I think, first of all, we would say that until we floated the theoretical possibility in our opening brief, the Sacketts seemed to be entirely unaware of it."
2011.10-1062,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1880.478,1881.263,Mr. Stewart--
2011.10-1062,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1881.263,1882.547,They were getting a good night's sleep?
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1885.715,1903.175,"--I don't think that -- I guess that's really my point, that the one thing the Sacketts have never argued is: If it were just the 37,500 per day for violating the statute, we would be willing to build our house and take our chances, but once you double that we are not willing to take the risk any longer."
2011.10-1062,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1903.175,1905.71,"That's not their argument today, either."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1905.71,1906.461,Right.
2011.10-1062,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1931.344,1941.383,"--Counsel, but those situations are slightly different because the act doesn't specify any specific remedies that apply to any specific property."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1990.215,1992.817,"I don't think that's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-1062,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2001.69,2002.873,But those are not in the statute.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2007.844,2026.239,"--EPA's view of the statute is that without regard to the issuance of a compliance order, once fill material is deposited in waters of the United States EPA's view of the penalty provisions would be that the violation continues for as long as the fill remains in the wetlands."
2011.10-1062,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2026.239,2031.292,That has nothing to do with the fact that the act doesn't specifically tell you to remove it.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2031.292,2037.879,"The act doesn't specifically -- and the act doesn't specifically tell the person to remove it, but that's our interpretation of the statute."
2011.10-1062,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2064.597,2068.482,"Counsel, you referred a couple of times to the EPA's view of the statute."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2070.0,2070.85,--That's our view as well.
2011.10-1062,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.729,2118.081,What about those provisions of the original order?
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2144.146,2146.848,--I don't know about well beyond.
2011.10-1062,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.672,2159.256,"Well, that's very nice."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2170.197,2182.871,"--I think the portion of the order dealing with the planting of plants, which is the primary one that was eliminated in the final iteration of the order, is really removed from what the Sacketts have been complaining about."
2011.10-1062,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2183.956,2192.895,"It shows the high-handedness of the agency, it seems to me, putting in there stuff that is simply not required by the EPA."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2192.895,2205.453,"--Well, I think in the main what every version of the compliance order required was appropriate if you accept the initial determination that there was a violation that these were waters of the United States."
2011.10-1062,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2205.453,2209.757,"What would you -- what would you do, Mr. Stewart, if you received this compliance order?"
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2217.861,2223.681,"Well, as we know from documents that have -- were not in the record of the case, but have been provided to--"
2011.10-1062,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2223.681,2225.866,"If they weren't in the record, I don't want to hear about them."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2234.406,2238.024,--I think at that stage your options would be limited.
2011.10-1062,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2240.376,2241.426,"You wouldn't do that, right?"
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2246.297,2253.034,"--Or you could simply comply with the compliance order at the cost of, it's been estimated, $27,000."
2011.10-1062,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2257.322,2258.055,That's what you would do?
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2271.997,2276.066,--It may be that the Sacketts at that point were in an unattractive position.
2011.10-1062,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2289.543,2290.159,--Could I ask you--
2011.10-1062,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2290.159,2303.733,"Mr. Stewart, if you related the facts of this case as they come to us to an ordinary homeowner, don't you think most ordinary homeowners would say this kind of thing can't happen in the United States?"
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2346.562,2358.203,"Well, the first thing I would say is as a matter of standard EPA practice the compliance order would not be the first communication from the agency that would alert the landowner to the belief that there was a violation."
2011.10-1062,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2371.378,2371.947,"Well, so what?"
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2384.854,2393.026,"At the time that that sort of letter is issued, there is no compliance order and there is no impediment to an after-the-fact permit."
2011.10-1062,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2396.245,2409.053,"In other words, what the landowner is supposed to do -- the agency says, because you didn't apply for a permit, you are in trouble, because you didn't give us a chance to say whether we were going to take away your constitutional rights or not, so we can do it."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2409.053,2420.611,"Well, the first two things I would -- the first thing I would say is it's not simply a hypothetical means of challenging CWA coverage to seek a permit."
2011.10-1062,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.288,2473.678,Suppose the Corps of Engineers agrees that it is not a wetland and its basis for refusing to issue the permit is: We don't give a permit; you don't need a permit.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2473.678,2478.716,It would issue a letter either to the effect that there was no wetland or that it was a wetland that was not covered by--
2011.10-1062,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.716,2481.418,Is that binding on the Environmental Protection Agency?
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2481.418,2482.368,"--Yes, we would--"
2011.10-1062,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2482.368,2485.986,How can they bring an action -- I would like some clarification here.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2539.621,2544.859,"--It's not precluded, but I would agree with you: It's very unlikely that without complying with the order--"
2011.10-1062,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2544.859,2545.609,"All right, I agree."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2573.444,2577.146,"--Well, we are not arguing that the statute precludes all judicial review."
2011.10-1062,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2583.65,2585.169,You're arguing on the final part--
2011.10-1062,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2585.169,2589.12,You are arguing that the presumption of reviewability does not apply.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2589.12,2590.389,To this particular order.
2011.10-1062,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2590.389,2592.305,And that seems a very strange position.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2595.457,2607.196,First because the order doesn't express the final -- the agency's final view both in the sense that it invites the Sacketts to provide further comment--
2011.10-1062,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2607.196,2609.365,But they asked for a hearing.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2620.939,2625.06,"--EPA said no to a formal hearing, but I think that would be characteristic agency practice."
2011.10-1062,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2657.448,2665.552,"There's -- there's one thing I do want you to tell us is, EPA has three choices."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2689.683,2699.208,--I think the admin -- the agency's normal practice would be to issue an administrative compliance order before initiating judicial proceedings.
2011.10-1062,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2710.665,2720.104,"What about this administrative order that, the administrative order internally within EPA subject to judicial review?"
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2723.156,2724.323,It could use that.
2011.10-1062,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2752.857,2759.077,Can -- can the EPA issue a warning instead of using this order procedure?
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2760.21,2761.112,"Oh, absolutely."
2011.10-1062,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2772.737,2774.087,But doesn't most of -- 14--
2011.10-1062,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2774.087,2804.473,"So they can just dispense with this compliance order and tell the Sacketts: In our view, this is a warning; we believe you are in violation of the act; and you will be subject to -- you are subject to penalties of 37.5 per day for that violation; and to remedy the violation, in our judgment, you have to fill in and you have to plant, you know, pine trees on the lot."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2805.808,2808.593,They could use the letter for that mechanism.
2011.10-1062,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2809.393,2811.379,And there would be no review of that.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2811.379,2813.814,--We would certainly argue there would be no review of that.
2011.10-1062,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2830.441,2837.779,"--Is there anything you've got by -- I mean, I'm -- You've got me now into the area, we are applying the APA and the question is Abbott Labs and is it final."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2870.099,2872.384,We don't have statistics on that.
2011.10-1062,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2873.203,2875.186,Is there any impression that you could tell us?
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2875.186,2883.924,"--I -- I would have the impression that it's in a nontrivial number of cases, the landowner does approach EPA."
2011.10-1062,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2885.01,2885.593,Do--
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2885.593,2901.703,"--I will say that the statistics I do have are that only a very small percentage, you know, a rough estimate somewhere on the order of 3 % of wetlands-related compliance orders under of the Clean Water Act ultimately culminate into lawsuits for enforcement."
2011.10-1062,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2901.703,2902.722,"--But Mr. Stewart, you--"
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2902.722,2909.059,That would encompass both the cases in which the landowners came in and talked to EPA and those in which they just complied.
2011.10-1062,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2909.542,2915.612,"--Mr. Stewart, you suggested that, that some communication occurs before this compliance order."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2942.179,2962.677,"I think you are right as a matter of typical agency practice that there would be an invitation well before the compliance order was issued to come in and give your side of the story, and you are probably right that if we got to the point where a compliance order was issued, then the likelihood that further communications would sway the agency substantially might be reduced."
2011.10-1062,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2964.493,2967.229,"--Mr. Stewart -- I'm sorry, finish your answer."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2967.229,2969.597,"--So yes, I would agree with that."
2011.10-1062,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2969.597,2972.548,Your cut-off.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2991.11,3000.733,"Well, I guess the two things, one of which may be more troubling rather than less troubling, is to say that if you are troubled by this, then there are a lot of other things that might be troubling as well."
2011.10-1062,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3013.542,3014.509,--This is not a warning.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3038.258,3042.227,It -- it is not -- it is phrased as an order.
2011.10-1062,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3055.636,3073.848,"Can't you usually obtain a declaratory judgment if prosecution is threatened and you think that there is no basis for it, and you can't -- you are not -- you're not compelled to just stand there and wait for the prosecutor to, to drop the hammer?"
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3081.087,3088.441,"There is no -- the Court has held that there is no constitutional bar to that, and that a declaratory judgment remedy can be made available in that circumstance."
2011.10-1062,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3101.265,3113.225,"Well, in those -- maybe with an informal warning, but when you have something as formal as this which shows that the agency does intend to prosecute, why wouldn't you be able to bring a declaratory judgment action?"
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3113.225,3123.764,"Again, I don't think there would be any value to agencies or to regulated parties to encourage the agencies to hedge their bets or to say less than what they really mean."
2011.10-1062,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3125.299,3128.918,The more -- that's what I am trying to get you to talk about just for one minute.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3155.599,3164.538,--The Court in Abbott Labs emphasized that that was an industry-wide regulation having the force of law and that the basis for challenging it was a purely legal ground.
2011.10-1062,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3198.875,3203.579,But how would it work if you say it's lesser standard under the APA?
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3208.065,3210.0,It's more than just is it wetlands.
2011.10-1062,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3218.689,3223.325,"But as far -- as far as the EPA is concerned, they are finished with that question."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3233.948,3236.498,I think they have reached that conclusion for now.
2011.10-1062,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3257.162,3259.514,"Well, that makes the EPA's conduct here even more outrageous."
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3272.087,3285.731,"--I -- I would assume that any prosecutor, any enforcement person, would want to be better prepared when a case actually went to trial then when he was communicating to the potential defendant that there's a real likelihood that we would sue you."
2011.10-1062,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3286.464,3289.799,But you're required to make a finding that there's a violation.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3300.005,3303.473,"--Obviously, we would feel that we had sufficient evidence for doing that."
2011.10-1062,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3320.251,3321.401,Well -- that's right.
2011.10-1062,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3341.748,3355.341,"--I -- I guess the only point I would make is, if Petitioners had wanted a judicial resolution of the coverage question without subjecting themselves to potential penalties, they could have filed a permit application before discharging, they could have gotten review there."
2011.10-1062,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3365.113,3366.549,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1062,2,21552,damien_m_schiff,,3368.649,3373.303,"Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has any additional questions--"
2011.10-1062,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3373.303,3376.171,"I do, actually, because I see their point better than I did."
2011.10-1062,2,21552,damien_m_schiff,,3436.043,3442.13,"--Well, Justice Breyer, the difficulty is essentially of EPA's own creation."
2011.10-1062,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3454.488,3457.99,They want the power because they have thousands of these things.
2011.10-1062,2,21552,damien_m_schiff,,3484.457,3493.815,"--I think, Justice Breyer, the fear of it being too pro-homeowner is in fact protected by the fact of the APA standard of review."
2011.10-1062,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3499.969,3507.306,"Yes, but maybe the agency is only entitled to deference when in fact it has made a record."
2011.10-1062,2,21552,damien_m_schiff,,3512.027,3514.177,"--You're correct, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1062,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3520.296,3532.621,"Well, they -- they might -- the might change their -- their system here if you -- if you win this, and provide for various kinds of preorder procedure or post-order procedure where they would be open to change."
2011.10-1062,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3534.373,3537.758,But then -- they'll just issue warnings is what they'll do.
2011.10-1062,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3537.758,3550.818,"Are there cases in the courts of appeals or the district courts where landowners, having received these notices or compliance orders, are said that there's a taking of the property, inverse condemnation?"
2011.10-1062,2,21552,damien_m_schiff,,3550.818,3566.094,"--I'm not aware of that, Your Honor, but -- Justice Kennedy -- but -- as this Court I believe held in Riverside Bayview, a takings claim under the Clean Water Act is not considered ripe until a permit application has been -- has been attempted."
2011.10-1062,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3587.924,3597.98,"Mr. Schiff, I take it that the government agrees that there's not much of a chance that you could get an after-the-fact permit, but its view is you should have gotten a before-the-fact permit."
2011.10-1062,2,21552,damien_m_schiff,,3613.223,3625.114,"We -- Justice Kagan, we don't deny that by applying for a permit and having the Corps make a decision on the permit that that's one way to get into court."
2011.10-1062,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3641.573,3654.816,"Well, I think what EPA is saying was, as long as you knew that your lands were potentially wetlands, you could have gone in from the get-go and -- and sought a determination that they were not wetlands through the permit process."
2011.10-1062,2,21552,damien_m_schiff,,3654.816,3655.933,"That's correct, Justice Kagan."
2011.10-1062,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3672.862,3673.562,"Thank you, counsel."
