1958.161,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,37.813,"Number 161, James P. Mitchell, Secretary of Labor, Petitioner versus Kentucky Finance Company Incorporated, et al."
1958.161,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,39.57,45.188,Mr. Chief Justice and Your Honors.
1958.161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,168.479,174.077,"Is there any issue on the 50% borrowed here, Ms. Margolin?"
1958.161,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,174.077,176.323,"Well, there's no issue if we get to that."
1958.161,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,675.827,690.683,"May I ask this -- as I understand it, the original Act had the exemption or had exemption for retailers, the category that was exempted, the category or retail or service establishment, is that right?"
1958.161,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,690.683,691.623,That's right.
1958.161,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,691.623,695.85,"The 1949 amendment didn't change those categories, did it?"
1958.161,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,695.85,696.682,That's our point.
1958.161,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,696.831,697.151,"Now, therefore --"
1958.161,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,697.151,698.07,-- we didn't change it.
1958.161,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,698.07,716.894,"--instead of going to the legislative issue of â€˜49 to tell me what it didn't change, would you mind stating what the legislative history was of the original Act, particularly in the reports of the Committee giving the de-limited scope to retailer service establishment that you are giving here."
1958.161,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,716.894,731.685,"Well, the -- the original legislative history I haven't gone into here because this Court had pretty well expressed what it was in the Phillips case and in the Kirschbaum case, and --"
1958.161,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,731.685,736.61,But didn't -- did those cases turn on the -- on the inclusiveness of these terms?
1958.161,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,736.61,770.176,"Yes, I think those cases did turn on the certain enroll and elected it too, that those terms did not -- were not used in the broad sense, but were used to -- in reference to the corner grocery store, the drug store, the department store, the -- and the beauty shop, the shoe shop, the -- the barber shop, and service establishments comparable to your traditional retail establishments."
1958.161,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,778.295,779.571,It was the other way around.
1958.161,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,790.799,804.106,"Well, I'll say what this Court said in the Phillips case was that the reference was to establishments selling merchandise epitomized by the corner grocery, the drug store and the department store."
1958.161,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,836.761,837.007,(Voice overlap)
1958.161,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,837.007,845.045,"But the Administrator explicitly said, he explicitly said, that this did not refer in the financial field to banks."
1958.161,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,898.888,902.45,What are these -- what are the classifications by these Senators?
1958.161,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,912.498,923.058,"Well, is -- there's real -- there's agriculture, there's real estate, there's financial industries, there's utilities, transportation, they are several well recognized areas."
1958.161,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,923.058,942.719,"Now, assuming you're right, that was fixed both by the administrative construction by the Court upholding of them, but as for the original act, this thing -- the amendment isn't changed, the categories to which the exemption is applied."
1958.161,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,948.966,949.4,That's exactly our point.
1958.161,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,949.4,955.936,"That's why I have to think the burden must be heavy to show, they meant to use the old terms with new meanings."
1958.161,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,955.936,975.179,"Well, that -- that is the contention that they meant to use the old terms with new meanings and to create a self-sufficient, self-contained definition which any business could come in and bring in experts or bring in their own industry people to prove that they regarded their particular type of transaction is retail."
1958.161,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,975.179,981.532,"Because, in fact, they enlarged the exempted areas, enlarged the exempted opportunity, is that right?"
1958.161,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,981.532,985.658,"There's no question that Congress, in demanding this exemption, did enlarge it."
1958.161,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,987.764,988.804,And regarding it is --
1958.161,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,988.804,988.976,-- pretty substantially.
1958.161,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,988.976,995.418,"-- that for that enlargement of the qualifications for exemption, you enlarge the categories of exemption."
1958.161,0,17850,bessie_margolin,,995.418,999.199,That is the -- that's -- that's the respondent's case.
1958.161,1,27500,harold_h_levin,,1582.43,1587.767,Mr. Chief Justice and the Court.
1958.161,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1675.742,1678.141,You're saying they were not changed by the amendment?
1958.161,1,27500,harold_h_levin,,1678.141,1680.279,I say they were certainly changed.
1958.161,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1680.279,1680.915,It wasn't.
1958.161,1,27500,harold_h_levin,,1680.915,1682.275,They certainly were changed and that it wasn't --
1958.161,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1682.275,1693.43,"And it's the same words -- the same words were to be given different context from what they have been given, leaving out what -- what was or was not given."
1958.161,1,27500,harold_h_levin,,1693.43,1696.867,"No, I wouldn't say that, Your Honor."
1958.161,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1836.313,1850.022,"Was there any change made as to what -- what enterprise is to be judged whether it is retail, it doubtless made the changes as to what constitutes retail --"
1958.161,1,27500,harold_h_levin,,1850.022,1850.378,Right.
1958.161,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1850.378,1851.614,-- something about that.
1958.161,1,27500,harold_h_levin,,1861.565,1865.286,"Well, I think so and of course, that's a matter of interpretation."
1958.161,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1883.709,1888.639,Was it -- was it made -- was that part the exemption?
1958.161,1,27500,harold_h_levin,,1892.718,1894.541,I think most certainly.
1958.161,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2114.146,2120.385,Did you find anything in connection with the hearing's final report that indicated anybody else thought about this at all?
1958.161,1,27500,harold_h_levin,,2120.385,2122.583,No.
1958.161,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2129.291,2134.426,But -- but this people being treated as a wholesalers or retailers.
1958.161,1,27500,harold_h_levin,,2134.426,2138.408,"Well, there was nothing said about any particular industry."
1958.161,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2173.692,2176.76,Who would you think should be a wholesale money lender?
1958.161,1,27500,harold_h_levin,,2176.76,2193.484,"The -- the First National Bank of Chicago, whose vice-president testified in the Household case and the testimony came over to this case, lends millions of dollars to the Household Finance Company, which in turn lends it to the individual."
1958.161,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3424.196,3427.874,"We do not say that a pawnshop, as such, is within this exemption."
1958.161,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3436.364,3438.376,"(Voice overlap) pawnshop, is that right?"
1958.161,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3438.376,3443.473,It's a bailment more than a sale.
1958.161,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3514.475,3517.293,"If they purchased, somebody must have sold it."
1958.161,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3517.293,3522.872,"Yes, but they are not selling and this applies only to an establishment that's engaged in selling something."
1958.161,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3522.872,3525.263,What's the classification of banks?
1958.161,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3525.263,3525.887,I beg your pardon?
1958.161,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3525.887,3527.755,What's the classification of banks?
1958.161,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3527.755,3534.194,A bank is classified as non-exempt in the non-exempt financial category.
1958.161,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3534.194,3534.737,Why?
1958.161,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3537.193,3550.226,"Well, the -- the original basis the Administrator originally adapted, he was following the stand -- primarily the standard -- industrial classification that the Government had established for other purposes."
1958.161,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3573.579,3575.251,How does the local --
1958.161,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3575.251,3578.394,I mean this was -- this was generally recognized.
1958.161,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3588.983,3590.733,What about a bank in a small town?
1958.161,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3591.912,3595.433,A bank in a small town would not be exempt.
1958.161,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3595.433,3598.291,What's the line of distinction there?
1958.161,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3599.031,3603.501,That it's just not -- it's just not in the category of a retail establishment.
1958.161,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3654.547,3656.027,Where that stipulation?
1958.161,2,17850,bessie_margolin,,3656.027,3661.93,The stipulation is -- is in the record and I don't think there's any question about it.
