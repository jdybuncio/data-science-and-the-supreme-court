1996.95-853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.628,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-853, M.L.B. v. S.L.J.--"
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,10.658,14.201,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,48.337,60.766,"When you say, Mr. McDuff, considering her claim, what do you suggest would be the factors that the supreme court of Mississippi would take into consideration if it were to ""consider it"", as you say?"
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,60.766,65.781,"Well, I just mean that they have not even considered her claim that she is too poor, which would involve a consideration of her income."
1996.95-853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,65.781,70.983,"But if they were to conclude that her income were too poor, were below whatever standard--"
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,70.983,71.254,Yes.
1996.95-853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,71.254,75.939,--then they would have to allow the... require this money be paid to the court reporter?
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,75.939,79.782,"Or they... well, they could do a number of things that would allow her to appeal."
1996.95-853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,92.171,96.712,"The court reporter is going to have to be paid in any event, I take it."
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,102.877,121.619,"Under State law as it is written now, that is correct, but as we pointed out in our reply brief in response to the claim of the State that if we win this case this will involve an incredible outlay from the State Treasury, if Mississippi chooses it can change State law so that in certain cases the court reporter is not paid $2 a page."
1996.95-853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,126.534,132.458,"But the reason he takes the job is because of his access to these out... these transcripts, is it not?"
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,141.54,143.48,"Well, I don't know the answer to that."
1996.95-853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,151.327,153.971,"Or it could abolish appeals, alternatively, couldn't it?"
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,153.971,156.051,"Certainly, yes, and I mean our point here--"
1996.95-853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,156.051,171.021,"Which suggests, you know, if the greater includes the lesser we can abolish the appeal entirely, why can't it simply provide, we'll give appeals, but not if the State has to put in any money, and we're not going to give it to impecunious litigants?"
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,171.021,176.385,"--Well, for the same reason expressed in the majority opinions in Griffin and the long line of cases that have followed Griffin."
1996.95-853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,176.385,177.426,Those were criminal cases.
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,177.426,206.885,"That's true, Your Honor, but in, for example, Lindsey v. Normet, which is a civil case, this Court expressed the same principle that, if... once the right of appeal is provided by a State as a means of promoting accuracy and as a means of correcting errors and correcting injustices, it cannot be taken away in an arbitrary fashion, and that's our argument here, is that the interest in this case is so important that the same principle should apply here that applies in Griffin and--"
1996.95-853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.885,208.124,Payment is an arbitrary fashion?
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,216.041,225.197,"--Certainly, but this is different than someone who comes along and says well, I want the Government to pay for something I can... I want to purchase on the free market, whether it's a car, or whatever."
1996.95-853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.307,269.068,"How about a custody proceeding, a child custody proceeding?"
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,274.093,279.436,I don't think... I don't think that argument would have the same weight we have here because of the difference.
1996.95-853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,286.331,289.572,"Well, maybe the custody order doesn't provide for visitation."
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,289.572,291.435,Or... and even if it doesn't--
1996.95-853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,291.435,292.754,Is it going to turn on that?
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,292.754,294.506,"--Even... it doesn't in most custody orders, no."
1996.95-853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,307.558,310.139,So you think a principle line can be drawn--
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,310.139,310.62,--Yes.
1996.95-853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.62,311.261,--between the--
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,311.261,312.641,"Yes, I--"
1996.95-853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,312.641,314.003,--this case and a custody case?
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,314.003,328.952,"--Yes, I do, Your Honor, and one example is Santosky v. Kramer, where this Court held that in parental termination cases, because of the severity, because of the finality and the irrevocability, a clear and convincing evidence standard was necessary before terminating parental rights."
1996.95-853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,344.663,352.718,"How do you distinguish Harris v. McRae, where the Court was dealing with a medically necessary abortion for an indigent woman?"
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,352.718,367.608,"The distinction I think there, Justice O'Connor, is that in Harris the citizen wanted an abortion paid by the Government that she would be receiving on the free market of something she chose to obtain."
1996.95-853,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,367.908,371.741,"There was considered, I thought the circumstances were that it was medically necessary."
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,371.741,377.545,"--Yes, but it was done through the governmental program of medicaid, is what the citizen was seeking."
1996.95-853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,394.965,395.446,"Well, how much--"
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,395.446,396.838,--that a wealthier person would receive.
1996.95-853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,396.838,401.06,--How much weight do we give to this exclusive method for termination?
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,410.317,411.208,Yes.
1996.95-853,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,411.208,414.34,"--The person says, this home is absolutely essential to me."
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,420.405,427.491,"Yes, and we're not basing our claim solely on the fact that the State has this exclusive power, but we are basing it in part."
1996.95-853,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,449.776,450.707,You think that's right?
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,457.894,471.825,"Oh, certainly it's important, but I think that... I think this Court's long line of decisions have noted that family relationships between children and parents are of a much greater constitutional magnitude, and the notion of liberty--"
1996.95-853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.825,493.908,"You mean to tell me that if I am... let's say I am dismissed by an employer allegedly for sexual abuse of a child committed to my care as an employee, my reputation is ruined, I pay millions of dollars in damages in a civil suit, I am unemployable in the future, in that kind of a situation the State would not have to pay for an appeal?"
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,493.908,496.94,--There would be less of a case in that situation--
1996.95-853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,496.94,497.2,Less of a--
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,497.2,497.501,--than we have here.
1996.95-853,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.501,498.622,--Less of a case than--
1996.95-853,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,498.622,498.822,"Yes, less of an argument."
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1481.33,1485.474,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-853,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1571.343,1572.484,May I ask just one question?
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1577.239,1578.919,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-853,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1578.919,1585.943,"And that's a matter of due process, too, I would suppose, because the child's rights are as vitally affected as either set of parents."
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1585.943,1588.114,The statute requires--
1996.95-853,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1588.114,1606.638,"At least the statute does require it, and what is the... and therefore there has to be a guardian ad litem appointed if the child is a minor, and what if the guardian... I know it's... it would be an unusual case, but what if the guardian took the position that the natural mother was a better parent and wanted to appeal an adverse decision, would the guardian have to advance the transcript cost?"
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1606.638,1611.78,--That is unclear.
1996.95-853,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1635.806,1644.402,"If the interest of justice required, in this unusual case the judge might conceivably order the State to pay the... order a transcript if the guardian indicated a desire to appeal."
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1644.402,1648.165,"--Well, I think it simply... it's unclear."
1996.95-853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1655.361,1667.989,"Would it be wrong for the court to say that a guardian is entitled to an attorney, the child is entitled to an attorney as an equal protection matter because a fundamental right is implicated here?"
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1667.989,1675.533,"I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't get the question."
1996.95-853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1675.533,1699.329,"Suppose counsel were required in a termination proceeding such as this, and the court announced that the requirement was pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause in the case of an indigent party, would that be an incorrect statement of the law?"
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1712.227,1720.093,"If you're asking, if the court had ordered an attorney be appointed for the mother, or the child, then--"
1996.95-853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1720.093,1721.213,For the child.
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1733.071,1741.159,"--No, what I was saying is, the attorney is... has to be appointed for the child based on the statute, the Mississippi statutes that deal with termination."
1996.95-853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1741.159,1742.688,It's not required by Mathews v. Eldridge--
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1742.688,1743.159,No.
1996.95-853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1743.159,1744.35,"--to have an attorney, in your view?"
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1744.35,1744.561,No.
1996.95-853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1744.561,1746.452,"Or due process, no due process requirement."
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1746.452,1746.902,No.
1996.95-853,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1756.327,1761.283,"Mathews really doesn't address the question of when you should have an attorney, does it?"
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1763.196,1764.285,Right.
1996.95-853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1767.497,1767.858,Yes.
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1767.858,1770.211,--additional safeguards have to be provided.
1996.95-853,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1783.099,1793.886,"Counsel, do you concede that a fundamental right is at issue here in the case when you deprive a parent by State action of parental rights?"
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1793.886,1802.482,We would concede that the parent-child relationship in the past has been held by this Court to be a fundamental interest.
1996.95-853,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1840.018,1844.62,"Well, I don't know why the interest wouldn't remain the same throughout the proceeding."
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1852.747,1860.942,"--Well, the argument is based, again, on those... the biological father cases, and it seems like at this point--"
1996.95-853,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1860.942,1876.383,"Hasn't the Court already decided in Santosky that there is something about depriving one of parental status that's not like anything else, and therefore, instead of the ordinary preponderance test, there is a clear and convincing evidence test?"
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1880.884,1886.558,"--Yes, I don't disagree with that, but Santosky is talking about in the trial itself."
1996.95-853,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1887.259,1896.185,"Yes, but in order to... why did the Court say that a clear and convincing evidence standard is required, instead of the ordinary preponderance?"
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1898.095,1905.882,"--Well, it may be the greater interest, I'm not arguing with that, in the trial stage, but what I'm arguing--"
1996.95-853,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1905.882,1921.711,"It may be... what did the Court... why did the Court say that as a matter of the Federal Constitution, in order to deprive a parent of parental status, the proof standard that the... that must be met is clear and convincing?"
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1921.711,1927.457,--I assume that the interest were considered somewhat more than the normal.
1996.95-853,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1934.48,1954.542,"Well, if the Court said that because there is a fundamental interest at stake, that is, the parent-child relationship is a fundamental interest... let's assume that's what the Court said, as I think it did... then the parent's loss at the trial level doesn't mean the interest is changed, as Justice O'Connor suggested."
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,1956.144,1982.151,"Well, again, my argument is based on those line of cases that talk about the biological connection alone is not sufficient to raise any interest, and the parent's conduct determines that, so when you have a trial court determining that the conduct of the parent is such that the parental right should be terminated, then it would seem like at that point the presumption of a fundamental right might be lessened, at least."
1996.95-853,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1982.151,1998.763,"Well, wouldn't the same reasoning that supported the Court's statement that this higher standard... why do we have clear and convincing as opposed to preponderance for these cases?"
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,2008.0,2009.071,"Yes, I believe--"
1996.95-853,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2009.071,2012.884,So the appellate review is similarly an extra check.
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,2012.884,2019.61,--I believe the higher standard is... within the case was to lessen the risk of error.
1996.95-853,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2019.61,2022.381,And isn't that what the argument is here?
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,2031.928,2041.995,"Theoretically, any appeal would be designed to lessen the risk of error, an appeal of any case."
1996.95-853,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2041.995,2050.791,"I suppose that would have been true in Ross v. Moffitt, too, where you petition for certiorari to the highest court of a State from the decision of an intermediate court of appeal."
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,2050.791,2052.55,"Yes, that... yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-853,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2052.55,2060.266,"Let's assume that the decisions of this Court establish that the... that this is a fundamental right, fundamental relation."
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,2071.855,2090.036,"I would disagree with that, because I think that it's not an impingement of the parent-child relationship, and it's certainly not a direct and substantial impingement, which the Zablocki case and others require for this kind of constitutional violation."
1996.95-853,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2139.099,2169.359,"But that's not the argument that was made, and I may have misunderstood the petitioner's brief, but I thought they were saying, we're trying to bracket our case not with Boddie but with Griffin, that we think that the impact on our client, permanent deprivation of parental status, ought to be treated the same as a criminal conviction, that there's no other civil case like that that declares a woman a nonparent."
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,2169.359,2190.373,"--Well, I think based on the use of the Griffin case and what they're arguing for the rights, it's very hard to distinguish between fundamental rights at that point, so you get into a situation of having to kind of do a hierarchy of fundamental rights and then decide where you cut off the appeals and where you don't."
1996.95-853,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2190.373,2209.156,"But we asked the petitioner that question, and the answer was, there's only one other thing that the petitioner would put in that same box, and that's civil commitment, involuntary civil commitment, so now you want them... you want to make their argument something that they are not attempting to do with it."
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,2209.156,2214.522,I'm saying that that argument would be very hard to implement.
1996.95-853,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2250.264,2254.559,"Yes, but how many of those involve termination of parental rights?"
1996.95-853,1,40065,rickey_t_moore,,2254.559,2257.521,--There were 194 of these parental rights cases.
1996.95-853,2,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3133.679,3135.429,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3178.619,3178.899,Mr. McDuff--
1996.95-853,2,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3178.899,3179.21,Yes.
1996.95-853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3179.21,3180.361,--what about divorce?
1996.95-853,2,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3188.649,3198.614,"No, sir, and a divorce also is something actually that can be remedied in the future if people want to remarry, plus they can continue to have contact or not contact."
1996.95-853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3201.384,3204.907,"No, but let's assume it's not a no-fault divorce kind of State."
1996.95-853,2,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3234.148,3235.75,"No, I don't think so."
1996.95-853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3252.411,3255.973,"Well, I thought that was the rationale of Boddie, that divorce did."
1996.95-853,2,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3255.973,3281.889,"The rationale of Boddie, as I understand it, is that divorce, because it involves a marriage relationship, is very important, and because the State has an exclusive monopoly on it, that filing fees that freeze people out are unconstitutional, so I think there is a high status and an important interest here, but I don't think it comes to the kind of grievous injury that's done here."
1996.95-853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3281.889,3291.507,"So cutting off a parental relation is a ""fundamental"" interest, and a right to get a divorce is high, but not fundamental?"
1996.95-853,2,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3291.507,3308.817,"No, I didn't... no, I'm sorry, I don't mean to sort of do a gradation there, but in Boddie the people were married and wanted access to the State-created apparatus for obtaining a divorce, and this Court said they can't be frozen out by a certain amount of money, and when you're talking about appeal, I do think that is different."
1996.95-853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3308.817,3317.994,"Well, but you have to do a gradation, or then Boddie is going to come out the same way as your case, isn't it, and we'll have transcripts in all divorce cases."
1996.95-853,2,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3317.994,3318.614,No--
1996.95-853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3318.614,3321.277,So that I take it was the thrust of the Chief Justice's question.
1996.95-853,2,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3321.277,3322.906,"--Yes, and I didn't mean to sort of--"
1996.95-853,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3322.906,3326.088,"And so I think you have to have a hierarchy, or a gradation."
1996.95-853,2,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3326.088,3340.189,"--And I guess that's what we're saying, is that because of the nature of the harm here as compared to whatever happens in a divorce proceeding, that this is the kind of thing where a transcript will be required and it might not there."
1996.95-853,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3340.189,3347.663,"On the theory that children are more important than spouses to the individuals involved, is that the theory that causes you to put this on a lower level?"
1996.95-853,2,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3347.663,3365.495,"No, on the theory that a divorce decree, or the resolution of a divorce case, involves all kinds of complicated mechanisms that the parties have a right to effect in terms of their interrelationship, but here, the person's child is being taken away against their will, and we think it's a qualitative--"
1996.95-853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3365.495,3367.118,"Are you saying that Boddie is... or Boddie, I don't know how to pronounce it--"
1996.95-853,2,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3385.72,3385.98,--That's correct.
1996.95-853,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3385.98,3388.413,So the two cases seem to me quite distinct.
1996.95-853,2,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3392.136,3392.607,Yes.
1996.95-853,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3392.607,3394.29,"Thank you, Mr. McDuff."
