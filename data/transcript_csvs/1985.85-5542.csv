1985.85-5542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.356,"Mr. Burr, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,11.356,15.676,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.85-5542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,143.34,152.429,"What you're going at is to tell us that the Florida statute which prescribes the method for dealing with this problem is invalid, is that it?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,158.618,168.474,"The statutory procedure, we submit, does not provide a sufficiently reliable process for the determination of competence."
1985.85-5542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,168.474,171.009,You think it must be an adversary process?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,171.009,172.293,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1985.85-5542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,172.293,176.413,"Well, what if all the psychiatrists had agreed?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,176.413,183.917,"If all the psychiatrists had agreed that Mr. Ford was competent, I think there would be no issue."
1985.85-5542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,186.352,192.589,"Well, I thought you were saying that this procedure, this provision, is invalid on its face."
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,192.589,205.766,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, there would have to be some threshold showing of incompetency, similar to a threshold showing of incompetency before trial, for example."
1985.85-5542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,205.766,210.718,"Well, let's assume there is a threshold showing, but then all the psychiatrists agree."
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,210.718,230.214,"Well, if there is a threshold showing of incompetency, then whatever procedure follows that results in all expert opinion being unanimous, then the procedure would likely be at an end, because there'd be no issue to litigate."
1985.85-5542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,230.214,236.701,So it's just a question of the application of this procedure in any particular case that you're--
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,236.701,238.051,"Well, I think--"
1985.85-5542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,238.051,240.753,--That triggers any kind of constitutional problem?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,240.753,248.676,"--In a case where competency is seriously in question, this procedure we submit is inadequate."
1985.85-5542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,248.676,258.699,"Mr. Burr, this Court has never held that it's required that a defendant be found competent before he can be executed, has it?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,258.699,259.484,"No, Your Honor."
1985.85-5542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,259.484,269.339,"You contend that it isn't just the Florida statute, though; that there's a requirement of the United States Constitution that says that one must be competent to be executed?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,269.339,274.26,"That's right, we submit that there are two legs upon which this issue stands."
1985.85-5542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,290.853,294.324,Is it cruel and unusual to imprison someone who is incompetent?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,294.324,306.881,I think the question would have to be resolved on the basis of the nature of the punishment.
1985.85-5542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,306.881,314.201,So it could be in some circumstances cruel and unusual to imprison someone who is incompetent?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,314.201,318.605,"It could be, depending on the nature of the incompetency and the nature of the sentence."
1985.85-5542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.605,323.074,"And he would then have a right to be released from prison, I take it, if he could show he were incompetent?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,323.074,327.628,"Well, I think that the alternative would not be release from prison."
1985.85-5542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,339.869,343.805,Why is it cruel and unusual to execute someone who is incompetent?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,343.805,353.528,"Your Honor, I think the answer requires a blending both of historical analysis and of modern day analysis."
1985.85-5542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,366.086,368.972,But it never provided for any sort of a judicial hearing.
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,375.942,377.894,"Well, that's certainly true."
1985.85-5542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,386.917,388.367,"Well, not inexorably."
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,392.153,398.057,Solesbee in my view treated the issue from the perspective of procedure.
1985.85-5542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,439.718,455.394,Do you think it violates any constitutional provision for a state legislature to vest in the Governor authority to act on the sentence and to set it aside?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,455.394,459.113,"No, not per se."
1985.85-5542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,512.48,517.801,"You condition that on his acting impartially, as you just said."
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,522.888,545.552,"Well, if as a matter of due process law some minimal due process requirements were required, whether a particular competency determination was made in accord with those requirements would, I believe, be an appropriate matter for federal review in habeas corpus."
1985.85-5542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,545.552,546.821,But you said if it's required.
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,549.606,551.406,"Your Honor, we submit that it is."
1985.85-5542,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,571.186,586.363,What about a state law that said that the Governor shall appoint a commission of five reputable psychiatrists to decide as to whether he was sane enough to be executed?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,586.363,612.661,"Again, I think if that were the only procedure, if those five psychiatrists were in the course of making that decision required to examine the person and then decide among themselves by whatever method they choose whether the person is competent or incompetent, I don't think that would stand up under constitutional scrutiny."
1985.85-5542,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,612.661,618.382,You mean you'd want to get in there and decide what kind of hearing that the five psychiatrists held?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,618.382,621.184,"Your Honor, again it depends on the role assigned."
1985.85-5542,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,625.404,628.706,The five psychiatrists are made the decision makers.
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,628.706,638.728,"--If they are the decision makers and there is a case where there is differing psychiatric opinion, not necessarily among those five--"
1985.85-5542,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,638.728,642.449,"Don't they have a right to a dissenting opinion, just the same as I have?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,642.449,643.815,--I'm sorry?
1985.85-5542,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,643.815,650.619,"Wouldn't one of those psychiatrists have a right to a dissenting opinion, just the same as I have a right to file?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,650.619,651.721,"Certainly, certainly."
1985.85-5542,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,677.955,688.644,"Well, what more do you have to cite that says that five psychiatrists cannot be designated by the state as a ""fact finding body""?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,696.084,697.984,"Your Honor, I think the state could do that."
1985.85-5542,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,729.019,729.903,You wouldn't need the commission.
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,737.309,739.142,--Where there is a dispute--
1985.85-5542,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,739.142,739.744,Yes.
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,739.744,750.266,"--Your Honor, I don't see how five commissioners among themselves can resolve that dispute without some input from--"
1985.85-5542,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,750.266,752.234,Can five judges do it?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,752.234,757.205,"--Certainly, after having heard presentations from both sides of an issue."
1985.85-5542,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,757.205,759.755,The judges don't have to be lawyers.
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,759.755,761.09,"No, that's correct."
1985.85-5542,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,761.09,763.609,So they could be psychiatrists.
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,763.609,764.209,Absolutely.
1985.85-5542,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,764.209,766.311,So what are you arguing about?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,766.311,784.855,"Your Honor, what we are arguing about is, in a case where there is a dispute about competency, the only fair and reliable way to resolve that dispute is through an adversarial process, at the end of which psychiatrists may well be the deciders."
1985.85-5542,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,804.5,807.102,Did I say the procedure would not be adversarial?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,812.173,812.906,--I'm sorry.
1985.85-5542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,817.994,826.765,"Mr. Burr, are you arguing for a full fledged adversarial hearing at a minimum, or can that be on paper?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,833.419,840.49,"Justice O'Connor, I think that a critical component would be an oral adversarial hearing, for this reason."
1985.85-5542,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,909.003,918.359,"Mr. Burr, can I ask you what in your view the test of incompetence is for this purpose?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,918.359,922.977,"Again, I think the test would depend upon the source of the right."
1985.85-5542,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,922.977,924.763,Assume it's the Eighth Amendment.
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,924.763,935.219,"If the test is the Eighth Amendment, we have proposed a test that we believe follows the contours of the Eighth Amendment reasons for the right in the first place."
1985.85-5542,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1038.952,1044.423,"Mr. Burr, would you agree that the threshold ought to be directed at one or more of those three components of the test?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1044.423,1045.641,Of the Drope components?
1985.85-5542,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1045.641,1046.825,The three you gave me.
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1054.981,1067.988,"I think that's true, but I think the showing as to the relationship with the component would certainly not have to be as strong as after a full proceeding."
1985.85-5542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1154.846,1164.035,Why does the Eighth Amendment require the person appreciate the potential termination of his life?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1164.035,1168.237,"Justice Rehnquist, there's certainly no explicit requirement--"
1985.85-5542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1168.237,1169.356,"No, that's quite obvious."
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1169.356,1170.222,--in the Eighth Amendment.
1985.85-5542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1186.615,1191.202,"Well, the historic prohibition really comes out to be making peace with your maker, doesn't it?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1191.202,1193.721,"Well, there were a number of rationales given."
1985.85-5542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1193.721,1195.923,"Well, what other ones sufficed in your view?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1195.923,1203.66,"Historically, the thinking was that madness was punishment itself."
1985.85-5542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1203.66,1206.029,"Well, do you think that's an adequate reason?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1206.029,1220.805,"Well, I think there's a common thread through all of the common law reasons which is certainly relevant today, and that is that the concern for a functioning human intellect in a person being punished was a great concern."
1985.85-5542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1220.805,1223.823,"Well, but why doesn't that apply equally to anyone being sent to prison?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1231.512,1237.416,"To that extent, that's true."
1985.85-5542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1237.416,1239.983,And doesn't that involve entanglement under the First Amendment?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1239.983,1251.474,"I don't think so, because I think making peace with God is simply a form of expressing the capacity to appreciate the termination of life."
1985.85-5542,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1290.385,1292.968,Have you just discarded all the atheists?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1292.968,1305.644,"I don't think so, Justice Marshall, because I did say that it's the capacity to come to terms with death, not the capacity to make peace with God per se."
1985.85-5542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1315.933,1324.022,"This concept that you've been discussing really antedates the Middle Ages and the medieval period, doesn't it?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1324.022,1325.822,"As best we can determine, yes, sir."
1985.85-5542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1325.822,1334.545,"Have the psychiatrists come to terms with that, or do they accept the medieval concept?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1334.545,1338.532,I don't quite understand your question.
1985.85-5542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1338.532,1342.584,"Well, you're making... you are urging that the psychiatrists make this decision."
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1345.936,1348.737,Back in the Middle Ages?
1985.85-5542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1348.737,1349.304,--No.
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1366.866,1391.75,"Well, I think, as I understand the medical literature and the research that has been done on death and dying, the medical profession understands now that there is an ameliorative psychiatrical process that seems to be common to being a human being, that people go through in different ways when their death is imminent."
1985.85-5542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1629.754,1636.907,"But the basic decision on the punishment has been dealt with in the sentencing hearing, has it not?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1636.907,1637.574,Absolutely.
1985.85-5542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1637.574,1640.359,And that's an adversary proceeding.
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1640.359,1648.132,We concede that the question of the appropriateness of death as a punishment is settled and is settled in Mr. Ford's case.
1985.85-5542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1669.813,1684.722,"Should that be a final decision in this third stage, or could it be conditioned, that he could not be executed until he had recovered his capacity to grasp all the meaning of it?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1684.722,1698.815,"--Historically and in most of the states that have this rule, the rule is the latter, that the execution is postponed until and if the person regains competency."
1985.85-5542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.049,1812.321,"Could I ask you, do you believe that the decision, by whomever it is made, should be subject to judicial review?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1813.107,1819.594,"--I sound like a broken record, but again I think it depends on the source of the right."
1985.85-5542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.765,1827.248,Then what?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1827.248,1830.985,--I think that's a tough question.
1985.85-5542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1830.985,1832.069,"Well, I know."
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1835.771,1836.137,Certainly.
1985.85-5542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.137,1841.358,"--procedure, and so you should be able to say what you think the right procedure is."
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1841.358,1842.241,I will try to do that.
1985.85-5542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1846.31,1848.579,"Well, do it the hard way, then."
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1848.579,1855.684,"This Court in non-capital cases, criminal cases, has never required appellate review."
1985.85-5542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1859.136,1863.854,"Well, but we've at least required that there be a judge."
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1863.854,1864.89,Certainly.
1985.85-5542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1867.273,1868.742,"No, I said just judicial review."
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1868.742,1869.825,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
1985.85-5542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.812,1881.4,"What if the Governor went here had had an adversary hearing, you could call all the witnesses you wanted, make all the arguments you wanted, and then he decided the facts?"
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1890.739,1896.325,--I think the due process clause would require a judicial review of that action.
1985.85-5542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1903.415,1909.652,So the state might as well just quit wasting its time and provide for this hearing before a judge in the first place?
1985.85-5542,0,38830,richard_h_burr,,1909.652,1917.473,"--Not necessarily, because I think any form of judicial review after a fair administrative proceeding can be limited."
1985.85-5542,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1951.229,1957.133,Ms. Shearer.
1985.85-5542,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1957.133,1960.335,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.85-5542,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2054.38,2056.046,Wasn't there a contrary opinion?
1985.85-5542,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2056.046,2064.085,--There was an opinion which was a psychiatrist that Ford's attorneys asked to go and see Ford.
1985.85-5542,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.854,2067.604,He was not one of the commissioners?
1985.85-5542,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2067.604,2068.473,"--No, that's correct."
1985.85-5542,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2068.473,2075.477,So they did have a... they were allowed to submit that evidence from their independent psychiatrist?
1985.85-5542,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2075.477,2084.399,"They gave this report to the commissioners and they sent it to the Governor's office, although there was no solicitation of this material by the Governor."
1985.85-5542,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2094.172,2095.24,There was no hearing.
1985.85-5542,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2096.84,2097.706,That's correct.
1985.85-5542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2200.791,2202.476,"Let me interrupt you, if I may, with that one."
1985.85-5542,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2219.021,2227.775,"--Well, I think the fact that he has heard the sentence pronounced upon him in court gives him the opportunity to prepare for death."
1985.85-5542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2235.447,2244.387,"Well, supposing at the time of imposing the sentence he fully understands, but then a month later he loses the capacity to prepare for death."
1985.85-5542,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2248.791,2249.257,--Yes.
1985.85-5542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2249.257,2249.891,I see.
1985.85-5542,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2249.891,2250.641,I am.
1985.85-5542,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2301.507,2322.903,"Well, could I ask, suppose Florida had no provision at all for determining whether a person were competent to be executed, and the law of Florida was that once you're convicted, the fact that you become incompetent and don't know what's going on doesn't make any difference, we'll still execute you."
1985.85-5542,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2325.105,2332.342,Unless there was going to be an argument that the common law prohibition should carry over and that there was some sort of fundamental--
1985.85-5542,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2332.342,2332.959,"Well, I just asked you."
1985.85-5542,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2339.263,2339.746,--No.
1985.85-5542,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2340.548,2346.951,"So Florida could just say, we intend to execute people who become incompetent after they are sentenced to death?"
1985.85-5542,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2346.951,2348.184,"Well, of course we haven't."
1985.85-5542,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2348.184,2348.886,I know.
1985.85-5542,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2351.755,2358.826,"That's correct, that there is no constitutional right, because it's like clemency and it falls outside any stage of the judicial process."
1985.85-5542,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2614.142,2615.727,"Thank you, counsel."
