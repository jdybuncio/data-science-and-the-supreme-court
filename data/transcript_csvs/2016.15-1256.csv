2016.15-1256,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.98,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 15-1256, Nelson v. Colorado. Mr. Banner."
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,7.98,18.535,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a judgment is reversed, a person who has paid money pursuant to the judgment is entitled to get the money back."
2016.15-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,43.8,55.62,What is the basis of -- of the right? You said the person whose conviction is overturned has a right to get the money back.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,58.875,80.87,"It's -- it's a right under the common law of property that's existed for centuries; that it has always been the case that a successful appellant gets her money back. In this case, the money was taken from Shannon Nelson and Lewis Madden pursuant to criminal convictions, but --"
2016.15-1256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,80.87,87.535,It has to be -- it -- it has to be constitutional if Colorado says we don't want to follow the common law.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,88.935,90.27,"Well, but -- but here --"
2016.15-1256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,90.27,96.39,"So -- so if it's not constitutional, then -- then what's the -- what's the basis for -- for your case?"
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,96.39,96.58,No.
2016.15-1256,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,130.84,132.0,Make that argument.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,132.0,132.68,Excuse me?
2016.15-1256,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,132.68,133.51,Make that argument.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,133.51,134.005,Okay.
2016.15-1256,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,160.01,168.405,"The dissent here said something quite simple, which was the only entitlement to the money was the conviction."
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,168.405,168.815,Correct.
2016.15-1256,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,168.815,176.98,"If the conviction has been voided, then what legal right does the State have to retain the money?"
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,176.98,178.915,We agree with that exactly.
2016.15-1256,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,178.915,187.815,"The Colorado supreme court, on the other hand, said when you paid the money, we were entitled to it."
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,201.21,210.575,"The State was entitled to the money initially because there were judgments of conviction in place, judgments of conviction that required the payment of the money."
2016.15-1256,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,234.66,246.075,"I thought your argument was -- was this, but what you're saying now and a lot of your brief is much more complicated, but the simple argument I thought was this: This was your client's money."
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,260.82,261.53,You're right.
2016.15-1256,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,261.53,261.93,Okay.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,285.45,312.91,"We -- we -- the reason why we said that is that in several of -- of this Court's older cases, the Court describes these refunds as equitable. Now, in a -- in a garden variety -- in garden variety criminal cases like this one, there would be no equitable considerations that would interfere with a refund of the money. But there -- there are -- it's possible to imagine other sorts of cases where it would."
2016.15-1256,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,345.79,365.63,"If that's right, and this is the basic argument, it's our money by virtue of State law, and once the conviction disappears, why doesn't the State have to proactively return the money? In other words, why is it even required for the person to bring any kind of refund action against the State?"
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,365.63,365.85,No.
2016.15-1256,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,376.725,381.43,So your complaint is not to the nature of this action and to exactly what you have to prove.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,386.275,386.77,"Well, okay."
2016.15-1256,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,407.21,407.3,No.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,424.17,424.915,"No, that's right."
2016.15-1256,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,431.73,442.635,I was just -- I -- I understood you in responding to Justice Alito to say that the State had to give the money back because they'd acquired it as a result of a flawed prosecution.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,443.77,444.81,Right.
2016.15-1256,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,444.81,447.39,"Well, that's not true for some of the payments."
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,456.16,456.52,"Well, yes."
2016.15-1256,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,463.29,464.31,Including the docket fee?
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,464.31,465.16,"Including the docket fee, right."
2016.15-1256,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,479.585,494.975,"The other complication that I see in this make-whole argument, in other words, the State took things away from you, they took property away from you, and when the conviction is reversed, they have to restore you to the position you were in before the prosecution."
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,520.895,521.41,No.
2016.15-1256,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,521.97,522.5,Why not?
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,522.5,540.165,"The reason -- I'm -- I'm getting -- the reason for that is that while there's a long historical tradition of providing refunds of monetary payments upon the reversal of the conviction, there is no comparable tradition of providing compensation for periods of lost liberty."
2016.15-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,540.165,542.56,That's why Colorado passed the Exoneration Act.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,542.56,543.18,Exactly.
2016.15-1256,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,551.89,569.025,"Well, if tradition -- I mean, if tradition like that can defeat the argument for compensation for time wrongfully spent in prison, then can tradition defeat the argument that you make with respect to the fees and the restitution?"
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,569.025,581.62,"No, because the tradition is -- is the -- the normal practice for centuries has been to refund monetary payments that are contingent upon a judgment when that judgment --"
2016.15-1256,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,581.62,581.86,"Oh, okay."
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,584.8,587.185,"If there were such a thing, if the opposite -- right."
2016.15-1256,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,588.14,589.29,But we have to look at the tradition.
2016.15-1256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,589.29,603.17,"Can we look at the tradition again? It seems to me for constitutional reasons, not for State law reasons, that's where I'm somewhat confused. I mean, who -- who cares about tradition if the State says X and the tradition is Y, unless there's a constitutional --"
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,603.17,603.84,"No, no, that's right."
2016.15-1256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,616.75,618.96,Getting back to the State law for a moment.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,618.96,619.05,Yeah.
2016.15-1256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,619.05,635.395,"Are -- are you saying that if a State creates a right under State law, it cannot unduly complicate that right by flawed procedures, under our procedural due process jurisprudence?"
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,635.395,638.1,"Well, I'd say it even more simply than that."
2016.15-1256,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,680.22,698.31,"Well, then your -- I think your argument has moved from the simple one I started out with, which is that you're absolutely entitled to be made whole, to the argument that they have to provide -- that we look to tradition and we have -- we have to see what sort of tradition is adequate. So what would be an adequate procedure here?"
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,698.31,703.12,They -- they have to be made whole -- I guess I don't think I'm saying anything different from what you're saying.
2016.15-1256,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,713.19,716.67,So what is that process after the conviction is reversed?
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,716.67,719.23,"Well, I'm simply -- simply to refund the money."
2016.15-1256,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,726.98,729.98,I thought -- let's -- let's take the act.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,737.17,743.7,"Well, the -- the requirement of proving one's innocence in order to get one's own money back."
2016.15-1256,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,746.12,750.18,"It would seem to me that if the State had an equitable reason, it should prove it, not you."
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,750.18,750.95,"Oh, exactly."
2016.15-1256,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,761.57,767.435,Do you think the requirement to start a separate civil action comports with due process?
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,767.435,770.7,That's -- that's a harder question.
2016.15-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,790.02,791.93,You'd have to get -- pay a filing fee --
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,791.93,791.99,Yeah.
2016.15-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,791.99,793.52,You would have to engage a lawyer.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,793.52,793.775,Yes.
2016.15-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,793.775,799.32,"And we're talking about hundreds of dollars, not even a thousand in one case. So --"
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,799.32,800.07,That's right.
2016.15-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,800.07,804.785,-- if any -- it seems to me any requirement that you sue to get the money back.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,804.785,805.63,I agree.
2016.15-1256,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,829.22,833.16,I assume you apply the Mathews framework.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,839.73,840.12,"Oh, no."
2016.15-1256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,916.15,916.63,If we're writing --
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,916.63,917.14,-- from being returned.
2016.15-1256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,917.14,924.165,"If we're writing this opinion and we begin, ""Tradition is very important here,"" because?"
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,924.165,929.08,"Well, in the Court's due process cases, the Court has often said that tradition --"
2016.15-1256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,929.08,929.92,That's --
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,929.92,930.91,-- is very important.
2016.15-1256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,931.06,933.74,That's if we're trying to define the substantive right.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,933.74,934.585,Yeah.
2016.15-1256,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,969.145,973.295,"Well, so that's a different analysis than the Mathews analysis, though."
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,973.295,985.9,"Correct. You know, the thing about this case is that what Colorado is doing here has never been done before. So there is no precedent directly on point at a very high level of specificity."
2016.15-1256,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,992.87,996.695,"Well, it -- it seems, Mr. Banner, that you could be approaching this in two ways."
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1010.94,1011.42,That's right.
2016.15-1256,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1011.42,1025.75,"But in -- if you're looking at procedural due process, I would have thought that your argument is the simple one of: This is property under State law; it's -- it's my property, it's your client's property."
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1031.89,1032.3,That's right.
2016.15-1256,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1032.3,1033.865,-- to get that property back.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1034.92,1035.01,Right.
2016.15-1256,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1035.01,1036.03,-- wouldn't be any part of that.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1036.03,1036.32,"No, that's right."
2016.15-1256,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1077.54,1085.075,What did Colorado do before the Exoneration Act with respect to returning --
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1085.075,1089.42,Just -- just gave back the money just like every other jurisdiction.
2016.15-1256,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1129.655,1152.105,"Well, is that true? I mean, I still don't understand the difference between the simple argument that you're required to be made whole and the argument that a court could deny restitution based on equitable considerations as this court has said. So which is your argument? You automatically get it back; that's the end of it."
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1154.28,1154.36,No --
2016.15-1256,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1154.36,1161.55,-- or that you could be denied receiving the money back for equitable reasons?
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1161.55,1167.29,You automatically get it back unless there is some equitable reason that you shouldn't get it back.
2016.15-1256,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1178.54,1193.14,"Well, what if the State says that you -- that the defendant has the obligation to move for a stay of the judgment of restitution when the defendant takes an appeal, and if the defendant doesn't do that, then the money is not refunded?"
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1193.14,1193.38,Yeah.
2016.15-1256,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1263.57,1263.92,Should we be --
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1263.92,1264.195,Yeah.
2016.15-1256,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1264.195,1293.66,Should we be differentiating between some jurisdictions that don't collect the money until the conviction is final and a conviction that's overturned on collateral review where the possibility of money having been collected may exist? Should there be a difference in how we think about those two situations?
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1293.66,1307.54,"No, because -- because whatever the reason for the disappearance of the judgment of conviction, the key thing is that these are -- these are -- the State's only right to this money is in the judgments of conviction."
2016.15-1256,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1308.46,1330.135,"Well, I have a problem because there are some cases in our jurisprudence -- not in English jurisprudence, but certainly in American jurisprudence where the payment of restitution to a third party would have been good reason, an equitable reason for the State not to have to return that money."
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1330.135,1330.89,Yeah.
2016.15-1256,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1331.09,1332.16,So what do we do --
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1332.16,1338.82,Let me -- let me say -- let me say a word about -- about restitution in -- restitution in the -- in the modern sense of restitution.
2016.15-1256,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1339.48,1340.21,Paying the victim.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1340.21,1340.73,-- to victims.
2016.15-1256,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1364.11,1379.765,"What do States generally do if they've collected this money, they've paid it out to the victim, and then the conviction is overturned? Do they usually leave the money with the victim and just take it out of their general treasury, or do States try to take it back from the victim?"
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1379.765,1392.76,"That -- that, I do not know. And the thing is there -- there are very few reported cases raising the issue of refunds of restitution after the reversal of a conviction."
2016.15-1256,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1403.815,1412.96,But your argument is that if -- let's say there's a very substantial judgment of restitution and the money is paid to the victims.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1416.895,1417.2,Uh-huh.
2016.15-1256,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1417.2,1438.235,"-- for abuse. And then even after the judgment has become final, if there is -- if -- if the defendant is given relief on collateral review, the State would have to -- would have to compensate the defendant for all the money that was paid to the victims."
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1439.18,1469.275,"I -- well, I agree with all of that except for the word ""compensate."" The State would have to refund the amount of money it had taken from the defendant. Remember that -- that -- I mean -- and then as between the State and the victims, that's between -- that's -- that's between the State and the victims. That's no -- there's no bearing on the -- the property rights or the due process rights of the defendant. Bear in mind that all the money the State collects from convicted defendants, whether denominated restitution or denominated anything else, all of that money the State is spending on something."
2016.15-1256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1485.41,1488.96,"Well, you don't have to make that argument to prevail in this case, do you? I think there's --"
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1488.96,1489.43,Correct.
2016.15-1256,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1489.43,1498.82,-- some severe equitable problems with -- with the -- with the hypothetical of the State having paid the -- the victim and the victim having spent the money.
2016.15-1256,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1498.82,1499.29,"No, no."
2016.15-1256,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1526.945,1536.469,"Thank you, Mr. Banner. General Yarger."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1536.469,1550.08,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The dispositive question in this case is substantive, not procedural."
2016.15-1256,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1559.08,1572.18,The argument is that that Act is an inappropriate procedure; that the procedure set up by the Exoneration Act where they have to prove themselves actually innocent is a procedure that does not comport with due process.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1572.18,1580.275,"Justice Ginsburg, if I understand Petitioners' argument appropriately, what they're saying is that they shouldn't have to prove actual innocence at all."
2016.15-1256,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1597.12,1599.555,"Well, I think that that's just mistaken, General."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1610.515,1612.615,"No, Justice Kagan."
2016.15-1256,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1618.0,1618.75,Whose money is it?
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1618.75,1622.105,"This is the State's money, as the Colorado supreme court held."
2016.15-1256,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1624.15,1625.545,"Well, why is it the State's money?"
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1625.545,1636.63,"Because, as -- as Petitioners acknowledged during opening argument, it was properly taken pursuant to a conviction. And the Colorado supreme court described this money as public funds."
2016.15-1256,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1638.32,1641.625,But it's -- it's money that's conditioned on a valid conviction.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1654.39,1662.9,"Justice Kagan, it's the same reason that, upon reversal of the conviction, certainly the Petitioners can't be subject to that conviction anymore."
2016.15-1256,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1674.42,1675.94,I'm not talking about due process.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1691.09,1697.14,"The reason why is that -- well, first of all, the Colorado supreme court described this as public funds."
2016.15-1256,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1721.79,1732.08,"Could you just sort of describe to me in sort of common sensical terms, you know, rather than point me to a sovereign immunity case or something, just in common sensical terms why is this the State's money?"
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1732.08,1745.075,"It's the State's money -- just as it -- just as the State lawfully incarcerated these defendants -- and Petitioners don't dispute that. The State lawfully, but erroneously, took the defendants' liberty away in this case."
2016.15-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1755.85,1769.91,"So -- so do you have any obligation to return the money at all, pursuant to any procedures? Could you just say once -- once you pay the money, we have no procedure for you to get it back. In fact, we won't give it back to you ever."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1772.025,1781.54,"So long as the conviction itself existed at the time that the money was taken, no, the State does not have that obligation."
2016.15-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1798.3,1815.48,"So if you said instead of the $128 for this, the $30 for -- if you said everybody who is convicted owes the State $10,000 and you don't -- you don't get it back if you're later -- if the conviction is later overturned."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1815.48,1839.08,"That is the rule that this Court has adhered to, and that -- that is precisely the implication of courts that, when deciding these claims, look for waivers of sovereign immunity, because the assumption is that the deprivation of both the liberty and the property at the time of conviction is lawful, and that the property passes into public funds."
2016.15-1256,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1839.08,1848.38,"Was Mr. Banner wrong, then, when he told us that before the Exoneration Act, Colorado, like every other State, just gave the money back?"
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1848.38,1851.6,"He is -- that is incorrect, Your Honor."
2016.15-1256,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1851.6,1853.225,What did Colorado do --
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1853.225,1853.55,Well --
2016.15-1256,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1853.55,1857.15,-- with respect to monetary sanctions before the Exoneration Act?
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1857.15,1859.81,They -- they didn't have authority to give it back.
2016.15-1256,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1910.04,1915.09,Are you denying that there were courts -- lower courts that routinely ordered the refund of these monies?
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1915.09,1917.04,"I -- I am, Justice Sotomayor."
2016.15-1256,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1917.04,1927.21,"I think in the briefing, we're pointed to any number of situations in which lower courts did order -- automatically gave -- ordered the money to go back."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1927.21,1931.16,"Justice Sotomayor, we're not denying that there are certainly some courts that have done so."
2016.15-1256,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1941.51,1943.9,"That's, to me, a question of labels."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1960.955,1962.55,"Well, as Petitioners --"
2016.15-1256,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1962.55,1965.1,How about if you took his car?
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1965.1,1967.36,"Well, that would be a forfeiture situation."
2016.15-1256,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1968.345,1970.36,Why isn't this comparable to forfeiture?
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1970.36,1977.615,"Well, in fact, the forfeiture proceedings in some cases provide a useful analogy."
2016.15-1256,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1991.65,2014.325,"Let's go to the stay. Could you -- can you honestly say to me that if this defendant had moved for a stay, that the trial court would have granted one? In how many cases do you think of the thousands of convictions that Colorado goes through would a court order a stay?"
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2014.325,2021.625,"Justice Sotomayor, you're correct; not many, as the -- the requirement is that there must be a serious question of substance."
2016.15-1256,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2029.99,2038.565,What a wonderful procedural quagmire you're throwing on courts below. The number of vacated convictions are tiny.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2049.74,2051.405,"I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor?"
2016.15-1256,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2051.405,2056.335,You want every trial court to decide whether a stay is appropriate.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2056.335,2057.17,No.
2016.15-1256,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2062.3,2069.299,Let me ask you this question: Suppose we have a criminal trial.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2089.015,2090.735,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2016.15-1256,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2090.735,2096.61,But the judge instead says there was sufficient evidence; appeal.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2114.455,2122.205,"The difference is that at that time, there was a lawful conviction in place, and that is what's required."
2016.15-1256,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2143.62,2144.85,We're not talking about compensation.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2146.335,2149.12,"Well, that's the -- Justice Ginsburg, that's the question."
2016.15-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2157.92,2179.415,"It says on page 27 of their brief, they had three cases, one going back to 1832 of this Court that says the law is that when you reverse the judgment in a civil case -- I wouldn't know why it would apply, too, as well as to criminal -- that you -- the person on the other side gets the money back. Now, it doesn't say what law."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2203.13,2204.01,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2016.15-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2211.51,2219.66,"It doesn't say ""can."" It says the law raises an obligation to the one who's received the benefit of the erroneous judgment to make restitution to the other party --"
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2219.66,2219.93,Well --
2016.15-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.93,2221.0,-- or creates an obligation.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2222.035,2226.04,"Respectfully, Justice Breyer, some -- some courts use that specific formulation --"
2016.15-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2226.04,2226.87,This Court used that.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2226.87,2227.03,This --
2016.15-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2227.03,2228.44,This Court was the one --
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2228.44,2229.8,This Court likewise --
2016.15-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2229.8,2229.97,In 1832.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2230.54,2252.42,"In two cases, Justice Breyer, Atlanta Coast Line Railroad, which is a Justice Cardozo case from 1935, and United States v. Morgan, which is a case from 1939, the Court overturned an order from the district court and yet declined to provide a refund because what the Court said is it had to remand for a hearing on the merits of the substantive dispute. One of Petitioner's own sources, a --"
2016.15-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2252.42,2266.93,"I'm more interested in what does the -- did the Colorado supreme court say, this is his money, but we don't have a remedy? Did it say, this is our money and we don't have to have a remedy? What did it say?"
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2266.93,2280.085,It said that these amounts are considered public funds such that a statute is required providing that courts may draw on public funds to award these amounts.
2016.15-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2288.33,2291.955,"But that's a question, it seems to me, of -- you keep talking about compensation."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2317.475,2318.615,Yeah.
2016.15-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2340.99,2348.265,"Suppose we go by the -- what this Court said in 1832, which seems like historical tradition."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2357.9,2363.505,"My response to that, Justice Breyer, is I -- respectfully, I don't think that's exactly what the law says."
2016.15-1256,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2375.67,2385.865,"For known -- the issue, I've never known us to wonder or call it a substantive due-process right to own money."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2390.145,2391.83,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor."
2016.15-1256,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2391.83,2396.525,So I'm a little confused by what you're asking for.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2408.0,2408.87,That's correct.
2016.15-1256,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2408.87,2410.64,And you don't deny that.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2410.64,2411.95,"I don't deny that, no."
2016.15-1256,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2416.62,2426.07,"How about we borrow from double jeopardy? Once the -- once the judgment is void, you no longer have a basis to that property."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2439.925,2448.97,"And, Justice Sotomayor, I think that that wouldn't necessarily explain cases like Gettinger from 1927 when this Court denied that kind of a remedy."
2016.15-1256,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2464.95,2466.73,"General, can I go back to what -- I'm sorry."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2468.485,2468.99,No.
2016.15-1256,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2468.99,2473.995,"That's the -- you said ""that's the question"" as though something big was coming up. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2473.995,2476.97,"I think I've, Justice Kagan, probably said it before."
2016.15-1256,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2481.9,2482.325,Okay.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2495.235,2496.07,"Yes, Justice Kagan."
2016.15-1256,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2496.07,2496.415,Okay.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2501.08,2502.38,That's -- that's correct.
2016.15-1256,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2502.38,2519.34,"So if this were your money on this -- on the simple theory of, there once was a conviction, it once was valid, we collected the money at that time, and that makes it our money going forward forever and ever, no matter what happens to the conviction."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2538.24,2539.52,"That's correct, Justice Kagan."
2016.15-1256,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2539.52,2558.185,"And it would also be true, I would think, that even if that conviction were improperly gained, not just in the sense that it was later vacated, but let's say it was the State's fault that that conviction occurred; in other words, let's say, oh, I don't know, there was a Brady violation or something like that."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2559.975,2567.38,"Justice Kagan, in that -- that actually neatly illustrates the decisions that States like Colorado have to make."
2016.15-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2605.59,2616.55,"Does your -- does your analysis -- why doesn't it apply to criminal fines? In other words, the fine for whatever the offense is, you know, $10,000."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2637.12,2638.79,"Mr. Chief Justice, two points."
2016.15-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2651.24,2652.62,You say your line doesn't depend.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2654.72,2655.2,Yes.
2016.15-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2655.2,2663.21,Really? Are fines in Colorado unredeemable once you -- once you put them in the treasury?
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2663.21,2666.4,"As we understand the Colorado supreme court's decision, yes."
2016.15-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2680.03,2680.14,Right.
2016.15-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2687.38,2696.565,"You have a corporate criminal defendant, you can't put him in jail, and -- and so what they do is they fine the corporation $15 million."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2711.84,2720.04,"Justice Breyer, if there's something wrong with that, then there was something wrong with those long -- the cases decided previously. And this is --"
2016.15-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2720.04,2724.99,Maybe they were right in 1832 and then they went off on a wrong track. (Laughter.)
2016.15-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2724.99,2726.75,Maybe those cases were wrong.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2737.93,2738.46,Well --
2016.15-1256,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2738.46,2755.64,"Now -- now, that, I stop right there and then I'm asking -- I don't know what your -- I have to ask him, and that's why his brief has several different arguments, because it's hard to figure out, but there's -- okay. Do you want to say anything in response to this question? (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2755.64,2757.73,"Justice Breyer, I understand what you're struggling with."
2016.15-1256,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2789.7,2802.22,Why does it -- why does it matter who owns this money at this time under Colorado law? This was the defendants' money and it was taken away from them.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2815.805,2824.43,"Yes, and the due process is, as -- as Petitioners admit, and they did so below in their petitions for rehearing to the Colorado supreme court."
2016.15-1256,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2838.26,2846.81,"Well, how can the conviction -- how -- how can the conviction have been reversed if -- if they were convicted consistent with due process?"
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2846.81,2869.95,"Your Honor, there were errors -- there were errors in these trials, but the question is whether there was process sufficient to allow the conviction to attach, and certainly Petitioners don't argue otherwise. If there were defects sufficient enough that this was a wrongful deprivation of liberty, for example, like the Manuel v. City of Joliet case this Court encountered."
2016.15-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2888.31,2890.955,Why should -- why isn't it a violation of the takings clause?
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2890.955,2892.05,For the same -- so --
2016.15-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2892.05,2895.135,Private property shall not be taken without just compensation.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2899.34,2906.27,"Chief Justice Roberts, Mr. Chief Justice, that's why the -- the tax cases that Petitioners cite don't apply here either."
2016.15-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2928.78,2936.715,"Well, that's -- I mean, what are you going to do? You can't -- you can't give them back whatever time they've spent in jail."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2939.085,2971.59,"That's true, but -- but you can compensate them for it and certainly for a very long time the common law and other principles of -- of jurisprudence have supported the notion that you can -- you can either order restitution or some other compensation to account for a deprivation such as a deprivation of liberty. And so if the rule were that this is Petitioners' property and it was -- and it certainly was Petitioners' liberty before it was properly, although not wrongfully although erroneously taken, it's unclear why Petitioners' principle wouldn't apply to the same question."
2016.15-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2971.59,2983.04,"Was there any -- you know, I -- one source of the difficulty we're having, it seems to me, is that the Exoneration Act was addressed to some -- a situation very different than what we have here."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3012.01,3038.74,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I agree with you that the substantive right encompassed by the Exoneration Act is very narrow, and it doesn't cover the claimed right that's at issue in this case, and what the Colorado supreme court told us is that there is no other statutory mechanism for the kind of compensation that Petitioners are seeking in this case. So I agree with you, the Exoneration Act is very narrow and is not addressed to --"
2016.15-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3038.74,3041.19,"Well, thanks for agreeing with me."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3042.36,3044.235,Okay. (Laughter.)
2016.15-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3044.235,3052.5,"I guess what I said is that by its -- its -- as I understand the background at least, the act was not addressed to the specific situation."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3063.42,3077.08,"I don't -- Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that's necessarily a fair understanding of what the Colorado supreme court was thinking of. What the Colorado supreme court was thinking of was where is the statutory authority to order this type of refund."
2016.15-1256,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3109.54,3131.68,"General, you said a couple of times that if -- if we were to look at this as this is not public property once the conviction is vacated, that instead it once again becomes the criminal defendant's property, the acquitted defendant's property, if that were true what kind of procedure would you have to set up to return the property, do you think?"
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3131.68,3135.095,"Justice Kagan, I think it would -- would be fairly minimal."
2016.15-1256,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3154.6,3156.72,"This is what they, they made a motion."
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3156.72,3157.52,That's correct.
2016.15-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3168.44,3171.035,I thought you told me it was not their property.
2016.15-1256,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3177.69,3210.26,"Chief Justice Roberts -- or, excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice, if this is their property, if they have a present entitlement to it, it is their property, then due process requires them some procedure to get it back, and that's the question. Is this, as a matter of substantive law, their property or public funds as the Colorado supreme court held, and, therefore, there's -- there can only be a mechanism for compensation from public fund for those losses? And so that is the key question in this case. If there are no further questions."
2016.15-1256,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3210.26,3214.97,"Thank you, Mr. Yarger. Mr. Banner, you have four minutes."
2016.15-1256,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3214.97,3215.34,Okay.
2016.15-1256,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3232.21,3233.63,It doesn't say the opposite either.
2016.15-1256,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3233.63,3234.47,It doesn't say the opposite --
2016.15-1256,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3234.47,3234.75,All right.
2016.15-1256,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3236.25,3251.93,"But -- but -- but the -- what the Colorado supreme court did was to skip over that question and proceed straight to the next logical question that would occur if it was -- the money was our property, which is, is the Exoneration Act an adequate procedure for returning it?"
2016.15-1256,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3251.93,3256.43,"Because that could be consistent with the money's their property, but they have an obligation to give it back."
2016.15-1256,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3256.43,3262.76,"Not really, because -- because if it was -- if the -- if the -- if the money is the State's property, then it doesn't matter."
2016.15-1256,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3279.77,3285.17,"They use the word ""return""? I'm looking for something here -- but, I mean, you see what's --"
2016.15-1256,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3285.17,3285.3,Yeah.
2016.15-1256,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3285.7,3289.8,"I'm looking for something here in the opinion that will -- that I could just say, ""Okay."
2016.15-1256,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3297.29,3299.48,"Well, unfortunately, they don't explicitly concede it."
2016.15-1256,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3301.815,3302.37,Okay.
2016.15-1256,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3302.37,3304.56,I know that's not helpful to you. All right.
2016.15-1256,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3307.06,3315.87,"The other quick point I want to make is, I just want to explain very briefly why sovereign immunity has never been thought to be -- provide any bar to these refunds."
2016.15-1256,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3345.1,3348.32,"Well, wait, as long as you have a minute. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1256,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3348.32,3348.6,I mean --
2016.15-1256,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3348.6,3349.81,I'm not going anywhere.
2016.15-1256,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3349.81,3354.55,"-- let's go over your case that you like, the Bank of Washington v. United States, 1832."
2016.15-1256,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3358.74,3360.05,The common -- I believe the common law.
2016.15-1256,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3360.05,3360.2,Common.
2016.15-1256,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3360.2,3360.99,I believe all those cases --
2016.15-1256,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3360.99,3361.53,That is what I am afraid of.
2016.15-1256,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3361.68,3362.7,-- are about the common law.
2016.15-1256,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3362.7,3363.025,"Yeah, yeah."
2016.15-1256,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3363.025,3363.565,Yeah.
2016.15-1256,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3367.19,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
