1980.80-207,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.224,We'll hear arguments first this morning in CBS v. The Federal Communications Commission and the related cases.
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,16.26,24.448,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.80-207,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,212.318,218.721,"The statute involved here was not in effect in 1976, was it?"
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,218.721,223.725,"It was in effect in 1976, it never resulted in any litigation."
1980.80-207,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,223.725,226.343,But it was in effect at the time that the--
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,226.343,226.977,Yes.
1980.80-207,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,228.093,229.593,--Passed in--
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,229.593,231.811,"Seventy-two, the Federal Election Campaign Act."
1980.80-207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,322.236,332.743,"--Mr. Abrams, do you deny that the Commission could take that into consideration at the time the station's license comes up for renewal?"
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,332.743,348.353,"--We think that it was proper to take into account a charge by a complainant at the time the charge is made, Justice Rehnquist, the violation of Section 312(a)(7)."
1980.80-207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,348.353,353.674,The same way any of the other conditions for license renewal could be considered?
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,353.674,377.289,"It's an appropriate thing to be considered then; the fashion in which the Commission has handled it is the fashion akin to the way its handled fairness doctrine complaints, which is to say, on a case by case approach, which we think is an entirely proper way to approach it, we do not object to the fact that when a complaint is made with respect to Section 312(a)(7), the Commission makes a ruling then as to whether the complaint is justified or not."
1980.80-207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,388.163,394.084,Well what did the Court of Appeals grant the Commission here?
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,400.888,413.295,Our objection to what the Court of Appeals affirmed had nothing to do with the propriety of a complaint being filed.
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,489.946,506.74,"Mr. Abrams, how is the... I take it that it is possible for a network to violate 312(a)(7) by certain kinds of conduct even within your construction of it?"
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,506.74,509.109,"Yes, Mr. Justice--"
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,509.109,518.632,"How would the Commission go about remedying that, you say there would be a complaint and then adjudication?"
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,518.632,521.167,"--A complaint would be filed, there would be an adjudication--"
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,521.167,523.117,And what would the Commission do then?
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,523.117,532.974,"--As a practical matter, the Commission would have to do no more than it did here, to make a ruling that the network had acted, or that the language of the statute--"
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,532.974,534.141,Issue a declaratory judgment?
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,534.141,536.276,"--It is, as it were, a declaration--"
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,536.276,542.747,"It has no authority to issue a cease and desist order or to order you to do anything, does it?"
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,542.747,548.317,"--It has the power, under 312(a)(7) only to revoke."
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,548.817,560.189,"I wonder, is that what a complaint says when it is filed with the Commission, the network has violated 312(a)(7) and therefore you should revoke its license?"
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,560.808,0.0,--No sir.
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.683,621.596,"Do you think... I take it that right on its face, that the Commission did violate... if the network did violate the 312(a)(7) and it was sustained in Court, and as final judgment the Commissioner actually could revoke the license without waiting for license renewal time."
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,621.596,626.798,--If there were a willful or repeated failure within the meaning of the statute--
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,626.798,627.25,"Right, right."
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,627.25,633.57,"--we would, I take it, be arguing it was of course not willful nor repeated nor existing--"
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,633.57,634.354,"I understand, I understand that."
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,634.354,642.093,--But what the statutory language provides is that if that occurs that this is an allowable sanction.
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,646.145,649.664,So really all the Commission does is issue a declaratory judgment--
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,649.664,652.282,"--Yes, and the network... the station understands--"
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,652.282,657.603,--And then the network has to decide what it's supposedly going to do about it.
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,657.603,659.972,"--Well it doesn't have an awful lot of choice, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,659.972,660.455,Oh exactly.
1980.80-207,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,660.455,699.763,"Mr. Abrams, is it conceivable that over a period there would be a number of complaints, two, three or four, by the candidates or committees, on which the Commission would give no relief but then at the renewal stage, under United Church of Christ, among other things, examine whether there was a pattern of favoring one kind of a candidate, or one candidate or one party and take that into account in the renewal proceedings?"
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,699.763,708.468,"It's appropriate at the renewal proceedings for the Commission to take into account the conduct of the broadcaster, including to be sure--"
1980.80-207,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,708.468,710.404,For the entire three-year period?
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,710.404,713.872,"--compliance... yes sir,... it's compliance with its public interest obligation."
1980.80-207,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,776.845,792.021,"But I gather, Mr. Abrams, you do agree that if there's a violation of 312(a)(7) that the Commission finds and the only sanctions it may impose are immediate revocation or wait until license renewal time."
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,795.056,821.438,"I don't know of any other sanctions which the Commission can impose, I think it fair to say as a practical matter, as I suggested to Mr. Justice White, that the conclusion by the Commission of a violation of Section 312(a)(7) which is affirmed by the Courts or not appealed to the Courts, would have more than a little effect on the conduct of the station involved."
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.438,843.054,"Well if the Commission, at the end of its declaratory judgment it says we find that you have violated the section but we don't propose now to revoke your license, we'll just take it into account at some time... I take it there's never been any question that you can get review in the Court of Appeals of that declaratory judgment?"
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,843.054,844.27,"There's never been any question about it, no sir."
1980.80-207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,844.27,858.963,And the Commission doesn't claim any authority to go further and... or... require you at a particular point to sell time?
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,864.431,870.854,I think you'd do best to ask that question to my friend on my right.
1980.80-207,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,891.684,898.004,But I take it that would depend on whether Carter-Mondale still wanted the time at the time you were now required to give it to them.
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,898.004,913.264,"--It would depend, in this case, indeed it did depend, Mr. Justice Brennan, because they withdrew their request in light of the Iranian crisis, made a new request for time which was granted by in fact, all of the networks."
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.264,925.238,"But the case is still a live case because, I take it, you think the Commission has... it maintains its view and that you will be in trouble with them again?"
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,925.238,936.879,"It is live in that sense, it is live in the Southern Pacific sense, it is live in... for another reason, and that is that the Commission takes the position in this very case with respect to these very networks that there is"
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,944.283,952.239,"Well, as long as they are still ahead at license renewal time the rule is there, isn't it?"
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,952.239,961.761,"--Yes, well it is always there and of course, as I said first, it is a recurrent controversy and indeed it is a peculiarly recurring controversy in the context of election campaigns."
1980.80-207,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,976.188,983.61,"The statute, of course, talks about individual stations--"
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,983.61,984.727,Yes.
1980.80-207,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,984.727,989.514,"--and the parties in this case are networks, not individual stations."
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,994.383,1010.011,"Mr. Justice Stewart, we argued that below, we took the position below that Section 312(a)(7) does not apply to the networks because it says what it says."
1980.80-207,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1010.011,1010.511,"--Yes, right."
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1010.511,1017.931,"And indeed, because in the ordinary case it wouldn't make sense for it to apply to the networks."
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1032.008,1035.043,You haven't... that isn't one of your points raised?
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1035.043,1036.293,"--No sir, it is not."
1980.80-207,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1036.293,1052.219,"But still with all this discussion with my brothers about the sanctions to be imposed, the statute is very clear, it has no reference whatsoever to networks, except insofar as they may be the owners of individual stations, and I know they are, a limited number."
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1052.219,1061.61,"That is correct, and that was the view that we took, as I've indicated... we did not press that point in this Court."
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1061.61,1063.76,The networks' license could never be revoked.
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1063.76,1065.228,The networks don't have licenses.
1980.80-207,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1065.228,1065.662,Yes.
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1065.662,1066.112,Yes.
1980.80-207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.418,1078.12,Do the networks have an obligation to obey the Fairness Doctrine?
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1078.12,1085.392,"The networks have been held by Commission practice... yes sir, to be obliged to obey the Fairness Doctrine."
1980.80-207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1086.626,1087.759,Do you question that?
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1087.759,1088.342,--No sir.
1980.80-207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1088.342,1094.163,"Well, individual stations do, and most, many individual stations are affiliated with one network or another."
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1094.163,1094.663,Yes.
1980.80-207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.663,1099.381,Are the statutory provisions related to the Fairness Doctrine that apply to the networks as opposed to licensees?
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1099.381,1103.202,There are no distinct statutory provisions.
1980.80-207,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1129.336,1136.073,"What happens, Mr. Abrams, as a practical matter, between the network and the affiliated stations?"
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1145.679,1146.396,Yes sir.
1980.80-207,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1159.521,1166.775,"If half of the affiliates declined to carry it, I suppose that would have something to do with the cost of the time, wouldn't it?"
1980.80-207,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1166.775,1181.435,"--No, the cost of the time would be arranged beforehand... would have to do of course with the effect of the broadcast... but the time of this sort would be paid... the amount would be paid to the network itself, because the time would be purchased from the network itself."
1980.80-207,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1655.545,1656.529,Very well.
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1662.266,1680.41,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-207,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1710.18,1718.786,"Mr. Shapiro, may I ask you first, why did the Commission go after the networks rather than stations, since networks aren't licensed?"
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1718.786,1727.375,The networks are the sole owners and operators of five licensed television stations in the biggest television markets in the country.
1980.80-207,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.301,1747.539,It would be only the licenses of those particular stations that would be subject to revocation?
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1747.539,1758.847,"--Only the licenses of those stations could be revoked; the Commission has not yet determined whether cease and desist orders, in addition to revocation, could supplement its remedies in this area."
1980.80-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1760.881,1769.052,"Nor has it been determined whether if it did use cease and desist orders, whether the statute would authorize it."
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1769.052,1770.487,That's correct.
1980.80-207,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1781.978,1826.907,"At some time, Mr. Shapiro, as you develop this discussion of the new obligation, as you call it, would you suggest hypothetically what would be the situation if some of the committees... and we read in the paper that there are activities already developing right in Washington for 1984... if some of these committees made requests now for 15 minutes or 30 minutes, for May or July of this year, or a year from now... in other words, at what point is the Commission authorized to say when the campaign begins?"
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1826.907,1836.097,"At these early stages, I'm quite sure that the Commission would conclude that the Presidential campaign for 1984 is not yet in full swing."
1980.80-207,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1854.308,1858.212,"By the statute there has to be a legally qualified candidate, whatever that means."
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1858.212,1858.695,That's correct.
1980.80-207,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1858.695,1860.295,"There is none now, for 1984."
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1860.295,1861.228,That's quite true.
1980.80-207,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1878.007,1879.84,That's why I emphasized hypothetically.
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1893.516,1902.038,"The source of authority in the Commission's view, is in the statutory requirement that reasonable access be afforded."
1980.80-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.403,1944.799,"Do you think the statute would authorize the Commission to, at some point in the process, just to announce that the campaign has now begun, without purporting to sit in review of a network's judgment as to when the campaign has begun?"
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1944.799,1949.269,"We believe that it would have that authority, but it hasn't purported to proceed on that basis."
1980.80-207,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1959.975,1965.962,"Of course this statute applies not only to Presidential elections, but to any federal elective office, doesn't it?"
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1965.962,1966.862,That's quite true.
1980.80-207,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1966.862,1969.462,Congressional races and Senatorial races?
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1969.462,1969.645,That's right.
1980.80-207,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1970.314,1974.182,Any problems arisen under it in connection with such races yet?
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1974.182,1982.538,"The statute has worked remarkably well, even with respect to these races for a seat in Congress."
1980.80-207,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2005.051,2009.789,Aren't the economic factors a natural damper on these early requests?
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2009.789,2011.141,"That's quite true, Your Honor."
1980.80-207,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2027.167,2031.352,"Mr. Shapiro, how many of these 37 rulings were before this ruling and how many after it?"
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2031.352,2044.028,"In our brief in opposition we note that eight of them have come afterwards and all of those were in favor of the broadcaster, save one, the rest of them preceded the Carter-Mondale ruling here."
1980.80-207,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2044.028,2051.932,"At the time of the Carter-Mondale ruling, was that the ticket on the ballot in ten states?"
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2051.932,2053.932,Yes.
1980.80-207,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2070.708,2074.595,That's their definition of a legally qualified candidate?
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2074.595,2075.695,That's one component.
1980.80-207,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2086.819,2093.307,Is there anything to prevent a network from selling time next week to a 1984 candidate?
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2093.307,2098.544,"If it chooses to do so, it's perfectly free to negotiate and that's the--"
1980.80-207,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2098.544,2102.079,"If he has $186,000 for a half hour?"
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2102.079,2102.763,--That's right.
1980.80-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.338,2122.509,"Well, I take it you're going to tell us how (a)(7) changes the law?"
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2122.509,2123.175,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-207,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.448,2138.269,"And do you agree that if it hadn't imposed a new duty, the Commission's order in this case would have been infirm?"
1980.80-207,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2138.269,2139.369,Well that's quite true.
1980.80-207,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3495.315,3497.481,"Just one moment, Your Honor."
1980.80-207,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3610.773,3629.152,"Do you agree, Mr. Abrams, that they... that this process of undertaking these cases where there is no claim of repeated violations, no claim of a willful violation; only a claim of an unreasonable one and go at it the very first time around?"
1980.80-207,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3629.152,3634.389,"Well, there's a claim, Mr. Justice White, and there was a claim here of willful misconduct--"
1980.80-207,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3634.389,3634.389,"Yes, but there was never a claim--"
1980.80-207,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3634.389,3635.055,--the Commission--
1980.80-207,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3635.055,3636.655,--Oh was there a claim of willful misconduct?
1980.80-207,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3636.655,3639.691,--The Carter-Mondale campaign said that was so--
1980.80-207,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3639.691,3641.043,So you think--
1980.80-207,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3641.043,3641.393,--and we think--
1980.80-207,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3641.393,3645.428,--they ought to actually claim a... a willful misconduct?
1980.80-207,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3645.428,3651.999,"--A claim was made, I don't think the Commission had any option but to rule on it at the time and in the way that they did."
1980.80-207,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3651.999,3664.741,But I gathered Mr. Shapiro indicated that they would undertake these adjudications even if there's no claim of... either of repeated or willful misconduct?
1980.80-207,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3664.741,3679.334,"My impression, Mr. Justice White, and I must say it is that, is that parties have come to characterize their claims in this area within the statutory language and so they say, at least when they file complaints, that it is willful or--"
1980.80-207,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3679.334,3682.12,Willful in the sense... surely they know what they are doing?
1980.80-207,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3683.52,3698.712,"--In terms of the broadcasters, I mean the worst thing of all would be to be confronted with a situation where the only punishment is capital punishment, license revocation, and the first time it comes up is at the moment that your license is up for consideration."
1980.80-207,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3698.712,3704.716,"Presumably if they moved to revoke the license, there would be a hearing process, I take it?"
1980.80-207,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3704.716,3706.401,"I certainly trust so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-207,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3706.401,3709.287,"Mr. Abrams, before you sit down, I'd like to ask you just one question if I may."
1980.80-207,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3732.553,3744.193,"We don't believe that we could have refrained, under the public interest standard as it exists, from making any use time available, say, in this Presidential campaign or in this Presidential primary--"
1980.80-207,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3744.193,3745.526,"No, he's talking about other campaigns."
1980.80-207,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3745.526,3747.662,"--Oh, in other federal races like that?"
1980.80-207,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3776.346,3776.929,"Thank you, gentlemen."
