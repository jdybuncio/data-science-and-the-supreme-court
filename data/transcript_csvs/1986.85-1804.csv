1986.85-1804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,59.622,You may proceed whenever you're ready.
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,59.622,63.757,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,275.113,281.533,Most of those things we can't make up for just by giving you service time as well.
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,287.318,289.47,"No, we do not suggest that."
1986.85-1804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.47,290.636,"Well, so."
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,290.636,300.158,But we do suggest that the things that have to be done in order to file a complaint are greater than the things--
1986.85-1804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,300.158,304.11,"Well, that's so, but the only one that's relevant here is the service time."
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,304.11,329.511,"--It is in part the only thing that is relevant, although if in fact one of our arguments is that if in fact the Court is going to borrow the service requirement of Section 10(b) as well as the limitations period, then the question will arise, why not borrow the other things that the board has said are all that a charging party has to do in order to file an unfair labor practice claim?"
1986.85-1804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,396.036,398.719,"That's not necessarily true in a diversity case, is it?"
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,398.719,400.071,That's not true in a diversity case.
1986.85-1804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,508.375,521.683,Isn't one practicality that we don't want to have to fight this thing out or have circuit courts try to figure it out every time there's a new borrowing of another statute?
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,542.012,563.676,"Precisely, and the uniform rule, the traditional rule in the federal courts, is that filing is sufficient to satisfy the statute of limitations, rather than simply looking at each statute of limitations and then trying to discern from the rules adopted by the authority that adopted, that provides the statute of limitations, whether service or indeed something else is required."
1986.85-1804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.676,571.782,But haven't we allowed haven't we borrowed the service rules in the past?
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,571.782,583.772,"The only case in which a service rule has been borrowed is in the diversity context, and there the problem was that it would have been inequitable."
1986.85-1804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.801,605.603,Has a service rule been rejected in any cases?
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,605.603,630.087,"--Not of this Court, although every Court of Appeals and other courts, or virtually every one, to consider the question has, even though a state had a service rule as part of its statute of limitations, the courts have borrowed only the limitation period and not the service rule in federal question cases."
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,739.375,744.51,Would that line of cases be overruled if we borrowed the service requirement?
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,744.51,754.218,"It would be all of the lower court cases, but unanimous lower court cases, unanimous understanding."
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,755.534,756.034,Except this one.
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,756.034,757.253,Except this one.
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.253,765.09,You mean this is the only this is the only case that borrows the service requirement?
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,765.09,767.792,"In a federal question case, that's correct."
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,767.792,770.311,You're just talking about federal question?
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,770.311,772.43,Just in federal question cases.
1986.85-1804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,772.43,776.482,"What are your other types of federal questions, other than this particular?"
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,780.619,780.919,The civil rights cases.
1986.85-1804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,786.789,792.093,And in none of those did the federal courts borrow the service requirement of any of the states?
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,792.093,797.128,"That's correct, although the states had a service requirement, albeit it in a different section."
1986.85-1804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,797.128,800.413,"And in some they borrowed the tolling rules, but not the service requirement."
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,800.413,811.721,"In many cases, not only lower courts but in this Court's cases, state tolling rules have been borrowed, but only after first looking to see whether there was a federal rule to govern the question."
1986.85-1804,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.945,824.814,So your basic argument is you don't borrow unless you have to.
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,824.814,826.714,--You don't borrow unless you have to.
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.359,852.882,"It would be unfair for all of the cases that borrow 10(b), wouldn't it?"
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,852.882,867.741,"That's correct, for all DFR cases and hybrid cases, and I suppose it is an open question what other kinds of labor cases are covered by DelCostello and Section 10(b)."
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,924.228,928.898,Why does it take so long to effect a service?
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,928.898,943.225,"--Because very often if you have an individual process server the individual process server may not be able to find the appropriate member, particularly of a labor organization, in order to effectuate service."
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,978.231,979.765,"Well, is this a suit against a union?"
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,979.765,982.933,This is a suit against both the union and the employer.
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.933,988.17,"Not much of a problem of finding anybody in these kinds of cases, is there?"
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,988.17,990.622,"Unfortunately, there often is."
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,990.622,993.24,"I mean, don't they have offices?"
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,993.24,1002.43,"They have offices, but the office employee who sits at the front desk is usually not authorized or often not authorized to accept service."
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1006.398,1012.452,"They may take that position, but that may not survive."
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1012.452,1033.781,"Under Rule 4, when you're serving an unincorporated association you have to serve a managing or general agent--"
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1033.781,1044.887,"Well, how long do you think you yourself would take to find somebody who is authorized to accept service for this particular union?"
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1044.887,1048.54,"--It depends on whether that person is willing to be found, Your Honor."
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.858,1086.933,"Well, a lot of times if you really think you're going to have any problem with this you don't file your complaint until you know where you can find the guy that you're going to serve."
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1086.933,1087.833,But the problem is--
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1087.833,1089.535,"And before he can run, you've got him."
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1089.535,1094.82,"--But unfortunately, the problem is that you have a very short statute of limitations."
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1094.82,1095.606,"That's right, that's true."
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1095.606,1105.128,And pushing back the time to file the complaint means that you may have only five months to file the complaint or perhaps even less.
1986.85-1804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1105.128,1113.167,"Are these DFR cases typically brought against a local of the union as a labor defendant, rather than the national?"
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1113.167,1114.483,They can be both.
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1127.041,1131.279,Is there a problem of effecting service by mail on the national?
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1131.279,1140.218,It depends on whether the national is willing to accept the service.
1986.85-1804,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.218,1148.324,"They're fairly well established organizations, aren't they?"
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1164.016,1167.035,If you can find the right person at the right time.
1986.85-1804,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1169.987,1170.787,Aren't there people that do that?
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1172.003,1176.807,"There are people who do that, and then it costs extra money to do that."
1986.85-1804,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1194.602,1200.589,"Every city has one group who'll do it for the right amount of money, up to $500."
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1200.589,1206.243,"--If they can find the right person, and they can't always find the right person right away."
1986.85-1804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1235.262,1237.095,"""Penurious"" means miserly."
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1239.845,1241.261,"--Poor, poor."
1986.85-1804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1241.261,1242.278,Impecunious.
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1242.278,1243.047,Impecunious.
1986.85-1804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1293.063,1296.265,There are no problems at all in the administrative service?
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1296.265,1305.537,"Under the board's rules, once you pvu iu io uhe najm up uif pshbojzbtjon tibt's dhbrged, that's tif fne of it."
1986.85-1804,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1501.762,1503.262,"Well, the notice may never get there."
1986.85-1804,0,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1505.797,1508.166,It is effective.
1986.85-1804,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.781,1687.581,"Thank you, Mr. Levy."
1986.85-1804,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1689.066,1698.922,"Thank you, Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1804,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1807.125,1813.111,"Mr. Gold, would it make any difference if the service requirement were in a separate statute?"
1986.85-1804,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1813.111,1825.688,"Given the entirely federal nature of this case, my view, our view on that, is that the answer is no."
1986.85-1804,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.54,1945.098,"Mr. Gold, it is true, is it not, that there was a wealth of litigation under the treble damage provision of the antitrust laws, as well as 1983, where you had to borrow a state statute of limitations?"
1986.85-1804,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1950.9,1953.602,"Well, those cases, it seems to us--"
1986.85-1804,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1953.602,1957.054,They of course don't have the same language that 10(b) has.
1986.85-1804,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1957.054,1957.454,--Yes.
1986.85-1804,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1986.506,1996.012,"Well, except that some of those state statutes had been construed by state courts to require service within the limitation period, and that's just as though those words would have been written into the statute."
1986.85-1804,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1996.012,2010.17,"Well, in those terms I'm not sure what the right answer ought to be."
1986.85-1804,2,38080,paul_alan_levy,,2887.752,2902.796,"First, we agree, as Mr. Gold said, that if Congress decided that Section 10(b) should apply to cases of this kind, we would lose."
