1985.85-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,65.775,"Mr. Sosnov, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,65.775,68.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,101.382,109.035,"Do you suggest that that particular provision goes to anything other than the sentence, the penalty?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,109.035,110.637,Yes.
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,166.641,180.651,"I think what the Chief Judge is driving at, if the arm, the pistol was in evidence at the trial itself and was Exhibit A, what more do you need?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,180.651,183.269,As a matter of state law--
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,183.269,184.169,Yes.
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,184.169,193.941,"--If at the trial the pistol was exhibited in evidence, and even if defendant was convicted of an offense such as possession of an instrument of a crime, it is irrelevant under this statutory scheme."
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,199.262,202.63,Well what hearing do you need more than to look at the pistol?
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,202.63,220.341,"--Justice Marshall, we would not be here, we would have no complaint if in fact the factual determinations, visible possession of a firearm during the commission of an offense, had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial and that defendant had a right to a jury trial."
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,227.595,233.999,"Well, suppose the jury in a special verdict said he did shoot the man, he did rob the man with a pistol?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,233.999,238.22,"--If the jury was given, under Pennsylvania procedure--"
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,238.22,239.203,Yes.
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,239.203,257.599,"--special interrogatories that provided the question: did the defendant visibly possess a firearm during the commission of the offense, and the jury was instructed you must find that beyond a reasonable doubt, defendant had a right to a jury determination of that under Pennsylvania law, there would be no constitutional claim."
1985.85-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,257.599,260.634,Did you ask for that instruction?
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,260.634,262.367,We could not ask for that instruction.
1985.85-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,263.503,263.836,You could not?
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,263.836,266.053,We could not because the Act is clear.
1985.85-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,267.121,268.488,"Well, wait a minute, wait a minute now."
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,292.736,295.105,"--If the judge did that, he would be violating state law."
1985.85-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,326.826,335.032,"You would still, you would still have to make the determination at sentencing, I take it, under state law, even if the judge went ahead and wrongly decided he would also find it at the trial."
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,335.032,347.24,"--Not only that, the finding at trial would be irrelevant and nonbinding because the Act is clear that the procedure is one to take place at sentencing, and that the burden of proof is by only a preponderance of the evidence."
1985.85-215,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,495.103,496.705,May I ask this question?
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,504.459,507.644,"Yes, they were lawfully convicted for the offenses which they were charged with."
1985.85-215,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,507.644,511.465,So you are only debating the enhancement of the sentence?
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,511.465,517.702,"I am only debating the application of the Mandatory Sentencing Act, that that act is unconstitutional."
1985.85-215,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,517.702,527.557,And is it not a fact that each of the petitioners could have been sentenced to more than the mandatory add-on sentence if the Court had so decided?
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,527.557,528.657,No.
1985.85-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,556.79,560.461,"How would they... how would they get that, by proving that there was no firearm involved?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,560.461,564.146,To get a lesser sentence?
1985.85-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,567.082,578.756,"No, since the state was claiming it, would... if I win a defense, he would be free, or they, any one of them would be free to shore that there was no firearm involved."
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,578.756,590.563,"--Any defendant would be free in any criminal prosecution to cite, to prove anything, but the question here I believe is what burden of proof the state has to meet to provide for a more severe punishment."
1985.85-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,616.365,624.702,"Well, Mr. Sosnov, you take the position that the due process clause requires the invalidation of this scheme, right?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,624.702,625.535,That is correct.
1985.85-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,625.535,636.926,"What is the defendant were to be sentenced by a judge who simply takes the position that if somebody commits an assault with a firearm, by gum, I'm going to give him five years?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,645.531,648.148,"Do you mean under a discretionary scheme, Justice O'Connor?"
1985.85-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,648.148,649.15,Sure.
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,649.15,650.45,It would depend on how that arose.
1985.85-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,676.049,677.734,If he says at least five years.
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,677.734,686.674,"--If he says, if he isolated the one factor and ignored his duty to consider all the discretionary factors, he would be committing an abuse of discretion."
1985.85-215,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,701.599,706.401,"Mr. Sosnov, in these cases do we know what sentences would have been imposed apart from the mandatory statute?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,706.401,719.561,"--Yes, we do, because each of the defendants in this case, because the lower court judge concluded that the Mandatory Act was unconstitutional, in each of these cases the judge imposed a sentence based on the discretionary scheme."
1985.85-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,871.86,900.01,"Well, counsel, what if in this case the elements of the crime had not included committing it with a gun and at the sentencing stage the judge says, well, I notice in the probation report here that you had a gun when you committed this assault, and I always take that into consideration in sentencing someone, so I am giving you three years instead of six months, would that be a violation of anything in the federal Constitution?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,900.01,922.042,"The judge, as long as the judge did his duty, as I responded before to Justice O'Connor's question, as long as the judge did his duty, considering all the factors, he certainly could consider this factor, and the difference between a proceeding like that an this proceeding is there are no legislatively specified facts which have to be determined by the judge and which have inevitable consequences which follow."
1985.85-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,944.139,945.424,"Well, aren't those facts?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,948.726,963.802,"That's right, but the process is completely different because the process, unlike a trial, the process is not a search for legislatively defined issues, and they don't have inevitable consequences which follow just like at a trial."
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1006.313,1038.35,"I know you answered it a little while back, but just once again, this trial, a gun is in evidence, is Exhibit A, there are 87 witnesses that testify that he held up the person with the gun, and the jury finds that he held up the person with the gun, my only question now is what evidence could he give to save himself?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1038.35,1047.706,"--In some cases, obviously unless we had this hearing where a preponderance of the evidence was the standard, the separate hearing, in some cases defendant is going to lose."
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1048.907,1054.645,"Well, I mean... just give me the evidence that any person you can imagine would give."
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1054.645,1056.778,--In that particular situation?
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1056.778,1057.694,Yes.
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1057.694,1064.948,"I would think if he wanted to he might come up with some countervailing evidence, but he would probably lose, but that's true with any burden of proof."
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1064.948,1072.371,"But you agree, you agree there was no way he could escape being said to have had the gun."
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1072.371,1074.49,There would be--
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1074.49,1075.79,Is there any way?
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1075.79,1088.313,"--In that hypothetical, in that hypothetical, it would be very difficult, even if the proof burden was beyond a reasonable doubt, for that defendant to have a chance of prevailing and winning at it."
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1088.313,1089.999,"Well, what good would the hearing do?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1089.999,1093.201,"The same, Justice Marshall--"
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1093.201,1096.569,"I mean, I've given you whatever hypothetical you could imagine."
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1096.569,1102.323,"--Justice Marshall, but the same... I think the problem with that hypothetical is the same hypothetical could be given for trial."
1985.85-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1138.246,1149.971,"I understood, I understood Justice Marshall's question to be directed at in the second hearing, what would you prove to offset the evidence in the case in chief?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1149.971,1151.823,--That will vary from case to case.
1985.85-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1151.823,1153.906,"Well, take this case, then."
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1153.906,1166.666,"I will take, for example, in Mr. McMillan's case, given this statutory framework, in Mr. McMillan's case, Mr. McMillan was convicted at trial of aggravated assault, of shooting another individual."
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1216.897,1221.8,"Well, in order to do that, would the judge have to say I was wrong in convicting you?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1221.8,1222.516,No.
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1222.516,1224.002,"Well, how could he?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1224.002,1225.052,First of all--
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1225.052,1227.454,"He's going to say one, he had a gun, another time he didn't have one?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1227.454,1234.024,"--In this, in this, Mr. McMillan's case, the jury was the factfinder, so the judge did not find the facts."
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1248.368,1256.474,"If we rule with you, what outcome will you and your clients get other than a hearing?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1256.474,1263.293,"If you rule our way, our clients will be sentenced as they are pursuant to a valid, discretionary sentencing scheme."
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1263.293,1264.209,They would still go to jail.
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1264.209,1265.526,They've all gone to jail.
1985.85-215,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1265.526,1266.009,Yes.
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1266.009,1267.511,They've all gone to jail.
1985.85-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1287.824,1292.376,"--Well, isn't what you want a... you want this second hearing all over with a different burden of proof?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1292.376,1294.809,It does not have to be a second hearing.
1985.85-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1298.946,1304.95,You don't want a hearing with the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt?
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1304.95,1316.407,We are saying that Pennsylvania does not have to do it as a second hearing with proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a jury trial; Pennsylvania can provide that all this be done at trial.
1985.85-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1326.347,1328.232,But that isn't what Pennsylvania did.
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1333.703,1337.988,"--By a lower burden of proof and without a jury trial, and that's why it is violating the Constitution."
1985.85-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1337.988,1372.411,"You started your argument, Mr. Sosnov, with the assertion that, well, this only involves Pennsylvania and New Jersey, but what about the states that require by legislative action that restitution be ordered to victims of crimes where there's been a pecuniary loss, and that the sentencing judge determine by a preponderance of the evidence how much is to be repaid by the defendant in restitution, would your argument reach those cases as well?"
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1373.611,1376.03,I don't believe... I don't believe it would be governed because--
1985.85-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1376.03,1376.546,Why?
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1382.534,1388.521,"--For one, it does not have the legislatively mandated deprivation of liberty that is involved in this case."
1985.85-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1388.521,1391.89,"--It might have if he doesn't pay what's ordered, off he goes to jail."
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1400.929,1405.13,That I think presents separate issues because it is not offense related.
1985.85-215,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.13,1414.136,"Well, at sentencing some states impose the enhanced... determine whether he's a repeater at the sentencing, a separate hearing by a judge."
1985.85-215,0,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1414.136,1427.729,"I think there are key differences there, and that is that this Court has always held, in Winshin, in Mullaney, that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required for offense related facts, the question what did he do, what offense did he commit."
1985.85-215,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1460.667,1465.188,Mr. Cooperstein?
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1465.188,1469.223,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1520.073,1525.56,"Mr. Cooperstein, let me give you a hypothetical that keeps running through my mind."
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1550.275,1555.912,"No, I don't believe that would be permissible."
1985.85-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1558.948,1561.333,Doesn't it also... isn't that precisely this case?
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1561.333,1563.516,"--No, it's not precisely this case."
1985.85-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1578.109,1582.246,"Well, it's distinguished between robbery without a gun and robbery with a gun."
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1582.246,1589.233,--But each one... the key fact is how the state views the blameworthiness of an individual crime.
1985.85-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1611.766,1619.686,"Why can't a state treat all homicides as blameworthy, just as it treats all robberies as blameworthy, justifying a penalty up to life?"
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1619.686,1641.035,"--Because in Your Honor's hypothetical, if the state considers the mental element to be a distinguishing factor between one sentence and a greater sentence, the mental element is so basic to all definitions of crimes that that is beyond the power of the legislature to rearrange."
1985.85-215,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1653.593,1662.531,"Mr. Cooperstein, I doubt that you know the answer, but why did they just limit it to firearms and not knives and other deadly weapons?"
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1662.531,1665.566,--I don't know the answer to that.
1985.85-215,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1687.345,1687.945,Any weapon--
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1687.945,1688.295,Yes.
1985.85-215,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1688.295,1691.031,--May I ask this question as to how the statute actually operates?
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1697.535,1698.551,Yes.
1985.85-215,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1698.551,1706.54,--Apply the minimum mandatory sentence to just what the actual sentence was initially.
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1706.54,1716.598,That is what the... the judge in that case and in all four of these cases declared the Mandatory Act unconstitutional and sentenced as if it did not exist.
1985.85-215,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1716.598,1723.685,"I understand, I understand that, but on remand, and if we should affirm, if we should affirm the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, what would the sentence for Smalls be?"
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1723.685,1725.787,The sentence would be a minimum of five to ten years.
1985.85-215,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1727.154,1728.156,Minimum would be five to ten?
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1728.156,1728.622,--Yes.
1985.85-215,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1742.814,1747.117,"In other words, he must serve five years, but he could be required to serve another five?"
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1747.117,1747.933,Yes.
1985.85-215,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1747.933,1751.669,Why beyond the eight that he was initially sentenced to?
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1751.669,1770.749,"Because the... one missing fact is that under Pennsylvania law, the minimum sentence must be no greater than one half of the maximum, so that when it sets a minimum to be a mandatory five years, it in effect sets the maximum at a mandatory ten yeas."
1985.85-215,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1770.749,1774.617,Am I right that Peterson was sentenced from one to six year?
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1774.617,1778.236,"Yes, Peterson."
1985.85-215,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1778.236,1781.355,What would his sentence be on remand?
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1781.355,1782.105,Her sentence would he five to ten.
1985.85-215,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1789.711,1795.63,So they would have five years they have to serve but the next five they could be paroled.
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1795.63,1797.73,"Yes, that is correct."
1985.85-215,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1829.684,1843.444,"Mr. Cooperstein, what are the limits on the state's power to take something that looks a lot like an element of a crime in most states and label it a sentencing consideration in your view?"
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1848.079,1861.322,"--Well, I think the limits are, one limit is clearly intent, that the state may not move around intent and put the burden on the defendant or give the prosecution a lesser burden."
1985.85-215,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1861.322,1862.156,The mens rea element?
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1862.156,1863.989,"Yes, yes."
1985.85-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1867.559,1868.925,May I test that with a question?
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1891.175,1892.308,"Yes, I believe--"
1985.85-215,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1892.308,1893.475,The same intent in both cases.
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1895.877,1911.838,"--I believe the state would be free to rearrange that, yes, and if I might continue answering your question, Justice O'Connor, I believe that Patterson v. New York makes it clear... gives some examples of the type of thing that a legislature may not do."
1985.85-215,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1954.181,1963.871,"I hear the words, but I don't have a clear picture in my mind of what the constitutional line is in your view--"
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1963.871,1965.073,"Well, I think--"
1985.85-215,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1965.073,1967.023,--that this Court has drawn.
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,1967.023,1973.579,--I think that one has to look at several different factors.
1985.85-215,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2008.05,2016.089,"Well, could this statute have put the burden on the defendant to prove that he didn't have visible possession of a firearm?"
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,2016.089,2020.458,"I believe that that would have been permissible under the reasoning of Patterson v. New York, yes."
1985.85-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.214,2074.176,"Well, what if... I take it you would... you probably would come out the other way if the statute had said, had set ten years for ordinary robbery but if it's done with a gun, the sentence is twenty years."
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,2074.176,2077.395,I believe that sets a much more difficult question.
1985.85-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.395,2088.435,"Well, and the judge determines whether the... just like he would under this case, he would be permitted to find whether a gun was present by a preponderance of the evidence."
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,2088.435,2089.168,But in one--
1985.85-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2089.168,2091.137,What's the real difference between those two cases?
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,2091.137,2106.897,"--Well, I think Patterson makes clear that the way in which a state defines its crimes is entitled... is the dividing line, that when the state seeks to treat one class of robber different from another, it has taken upon itself the burden--"
1985.85-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.897,2114.466,"But if the judge determines at the sentencing hearing that the robbery was done with a gun, he shall impose twenty years."
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,2114.466,2118.787,--However--
1985.85-215,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2118.787,2123.774,You think that's just really just adding an element to the crime?
1985.85-215,1,41149,steven_j_cooperstein,,2123.774,2127.492,--I'm not saying that that statute would be unconstitutional.
1985.85-215,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2204.706,2207.575,Very well.
1985.85-215,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2209.225,2210.21,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-215,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2328.454,2329.704,"Thank you, gentlemen."
