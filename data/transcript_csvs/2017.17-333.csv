2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.36,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 17-333, Benisek versus Lamone. Mr. Kimberly."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,7.36,17.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: All nine justices in Vieth against Jubelirer agreed that partisan gerrymandering can violate the Constitution."
2017.17-333,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,41.84,64.52,"Mr. Kimberly, may I ask you a kind of preliminary question? I -- I take it it's -- it's much too late, even if you were successful, for there to be any change for the 2018 election, and if that's so -- and we're only talking about a preliminary injunction here, right?"
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,64.52,66.24,"We are talking about a preliminary injunction, Your Honor."
2017.17-333,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,66.8,83.64,"So how would you be irreparably injured by the denial of a preliminary injunction if the earliest that -- assuming you're right, that a redistricting could go into effect would be 2020?"
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,83.64,91.84,"Well, Your Honor, we don't concede for purposes of this appeal that it's too late to enter relief in time for the 2018 election."
2017.17-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,103.88,110.64,"Is there anything in the record to indicate that experts will tell you, oh, this is -- this is possible? It's --"
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,110.64,112.68,That it's possible to enact a new --
2017.17-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,112.68,116.6,That it's possible to comply with the injunction in time for the 2018 election.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,116.6,123.16,"There's nothing in the record about that, Your Honor, but that also isn't an issue that the district court has been in -- given an opportunity to address yet."
2017.17-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,123.16,126.68,"Well, but you're asking us to then just -- just assume it."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,126.68,136.6,"Well, as a matter of fact, Your Honor, I think what we're asking for is just a remand for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction motion in light of what we take to be the proper legal standards."
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,137.32,157.4,"Given the equitable principles involved in an injunction, this is -- you waited an awfully long time to bring this suit from the change in 2011, was it? Should that factor into our consideration of whether to uphold or not uphold your request?"
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,157.4,159.56,"So I think there are two things to say about that, Your Honor."
2017.17-333,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,178.76,181.32,But I don't think you finished --
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,181.32,184.08,"Well, it's not -- it's not just that equitable factor."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,201.24,202.52,"Well, I --"
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,202.52,203.0,Is -- is it --
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,203.0,204.2,It is true that those elections have been held.
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,207.56,215.76,"Well, no, but it is evidence of the -- the question of whether you've been irreparably harmed, that you've been willing to let go."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,238.76,241.44,"Well, I -- I guess I have a few things to say about that."
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,255.88,267.68,"Well, if you look at 20 -- you -- you did not file the suit presenting this particular theory of the case until 2016."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,267.68,271.48,"No, our -- our position is that this theory of the case has been in the case from the beginning."
2017.17-333,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,303.2,308.88,I still don't understand what you want to have take place for -- in practical -- in practical terms.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,322.12,328.6,"Your Honor, I -- I -- the -- the short answer to that question is that that is an issue for the district court to decide."
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,350.24,352.52,What would that -- what would that --
2017.17-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,352.52,361.8,"But -- but if it was ordered by this Court -- an order by this Court indicating, oh, there might be time, is going to upset settled expectations."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,382.48,391.44,"Well, I -- I think it would perpetuate the same sort of uncertainty, frankly, that's been hanging over Maryland politics from the pendency of this suit all along."
2017.17-333,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,411.4,413.0,Let me ask you a question --
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,413.0,427.4,"Well, it's not simply a question of -- we have held that, in a preliminary injunction context, you do not have to consider the merits if you think the equities and the irreparable harm questions cut against the grant of a preliminary injunction."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,427.4,431.52,"Well, that's true, but, again, that would be a question, I think, for the district court in the first instance."
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,432.16,434.28,"No, no, you're asking us to --"
2017.17-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,434.28,434.76,Right.
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,434.76,440.24,-- decide the merits and determine from that whether there's been an abuse of discretion.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,441.2,441.48,Right.
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,441.48,458.28,"And what I'm suggesting, most -- I guess the strongest case is the Winter case from a few years ago, where we said if the equities and the harm question cuts strongly in one direction, we don't have to consider the merits at all without determining that there has or hasn't been an abuse of discretion."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,458.28,478.6,"Well, I'm -- I don't recall what it is exactly the district court in the Winter case -- with which I'm familiar, before this Court, I don't recall what the district court in that case had done. If -- if the district court had reached each of the individual issues, surely, the Court can pick out among the issues that the district court resolved which it wants to base its decision on."
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,479.28,486.0,"Well, I think that's exactly -- I think that's exactly right, that the Court can pick out of the different criteria which one it wants to base its decision on."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,492.16,496.76,"Well, and -- and the short answer is because that's the one on which the district court based its decision."
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,510.84,512.8,Let me ask you a practical question.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,520.96,522.12,That also -- yes.
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,523.4,557.4,"Now can you go through that trial without a ruling from us? And, if not, why not? Judge Niemeyer said that there were many open issues in this case, not the least of which was the motivation of the -- of the Governor and his committee for the change at issue. Would that obviate some of the merits questions that are before us if you don't prove that first prong? You have fairly strong evidence to -- to show that."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,557.4,558.04,Is -- is --
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,558.04,560.32,Is your weakness in the other prongs?
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,560.32,562.96,"Well, we don't think we have weakness in any of the prongs, respectfully, Your Honor."
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,562.96,564.84,"No, assuming we accept your test. (Laughter.)"
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,564.84,566.04,I -- I agree.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,570.0,579.8,"Well, I -- I think what -- the concern that we have is if the -- if the case -- so imagine the district court does not enter summary judgment, and the case proceeds to trial."
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,616.48,616.92,There's been a lot of --
2017.17-333,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,616.92,621.76,"Well, let me ask you about your -- your legal theory then because I -- I probably don't understand it."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,674.0,689.4,"Well, if -- if what the map drawers are doing is looking at the way that individuals have voted in the past and on that basis attempting to make it more difficult for them to achieve electoral success moving forward, that is the specific intent and there is a burden imposed as a consequence --"
2017.17-333,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,689.4,689.96,Yes.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,689.96,690.92,-- it -- it -- it may well be that --
2017.17-333,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,690.92,693.04,The answer to my question is yes?
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,693.04,694.92,It -- it may well be that that would be a violation.
2017.17-333,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,694.92,702.04,But hasn't this Court said time and again you can't take all consideration of partisan advantage out of the district -- districting?
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,702.04,708.2,I -- I want to be very clear that our theory does not require taking all partisan advantage -- consideration of partisan advantage --
2017.17-333,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,708.2,713.72,"Well, I don't see how your theory is any different from that, other than -- than a de minimis partisan advantage."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,713.72,715.96,So there are -- there are two ways in which it's different.
2017.17-333,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,722.76,723.24,"Yeah, I know."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,747.76,750.8,"In -- in two consequences, that -- in two circumstances, that wouldn't be the case."
2017.17-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,769.64,778.8,"Well, what -- what would happen if you have the orange party and the green party, the green party's in the minority, orange with 45 and -- orange party 55."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,801.76,802.6,I -- it -- it --
2017.17-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,802.6,807.68,It seems to me that that would be definitely to retaliate against certain -- a certain voter.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,813.6,819.2,"Well, unless, as Your Honor suggested, it's in pursuit of -- of balanced map drawing."
2017.17-333,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,823.32,861.12,"But is your theory that that would be a compelling interest that could defeat strict scrutiny? In other words, the way I understand your theory is that you would put the state in that position to the test of -- of saying this is a compelling interest, this is the only way we can achieve that interest, and -- and sort of put it through the strict scrutiny hoops, even when the state, you know, wants to achieve balanced districts or wants to undo a former gerrymander, so you would still put the state through a very strict scrutiny test in that case?"
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,861.12,883.76,"Well, I -- I -- I think the answer is yes, Your Honor, but I -- I think in this circumstance strict scrutiny could do real work, just as this Court in the racial gerrymandering context has generally tolerated the idea, the consideration of race is a compelling -- is -- is a necessary means of achieving the compelling end of complying with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act for --"
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,883.76,900.2,"Well, how would you ever satisfy strict scrutiny in -- in a case like this? In other words, it would seem to me that there are so many alternative approaches that the idea of saying this one way of achieving a particular result was the only possible way."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,900.2,916.48,"I -- I don't -- I don't think, under the strict scrutiny approach, I don't think it's -- it's necessarily that that particular district as it's drawn is what would have to be necessary. I think, for example, in Arizona, the independent redistricting commission there is told to pursue competitive districts."
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,923.92,933.32,"But, I mean, your theory is that the legislature acts with a vengeful intent to punish people for the exercise of their First Amendment rights, right?"
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,933.32,936.92,"The way we put it is disapproval of their past voting history, yes."
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,936.92,947.36,"And they're going to say that in some circumstances that's going to be okay, even though it applies strict scrutiny, it's going to be okay for them to burden their First Amendment rights?"
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,947.36,962.08,"Well, I -- I think we would take the position, just as in any other First Amendment context that, yes, if consideration of past voting history is necessary to pursue that compelling governmental interest, we tend to think that balanced maps and competitive districts would fit that hole."
2017.17-333,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,962.08,1006.88,"But when you start -- when you start with a district that's been skewed and you take that as the baseline and say any deviation from that skewed districting has to get strict scrutiny, there's something wrong with that. I mean, isn't the state able to say in the past this was a gerrymandered district and now we want to undo the gerrymander, and then people who are left out will say: Now we've been diluted, we've -- we've lost the clout that we once had. I mean, isn't there something wrong with using the district as it now exists as your starting point?"
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1006.88,1008.88,"I think there are three things to say about that, Your Honor."
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1092.96,1104.88,"May I ask you, is this -- is yours the -- is yours the only test you're proposing? In other political gerrymandering cases, do you see other tests being a possibility?"
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1104.88,1105.92,Is -- is the question whether we --
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1105.92,1107.0,"Is this the only, versus --"
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1107.0,1109.0,"In -- in this lawsuit, this is -- this is the only --"
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1109.0,1109.96,I didn't ask that.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1109.96,1110.52,I'm sorry.
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1110.72,1112.56,In other gerrymandering cases.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1112.56,1113.36,Yes.
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1113.36,1120.24,"Do you see the applicability of any other test? You have a lot of amici with different tests, the ACLU."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1120.24,1120.96,Sure.
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1120.96,1132.04,"The others have proposed tests that would address some of Justice Kagan's concern, the entrenchment test, the durability test, that sort of thing."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1132.04,1132.92,Sure.
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1132.92,1136.32,Why did you disavow those? Do you lose under those?
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1136.32,1137.72,"Well, our --"
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1137.72,1140.12,Or is yours -- do you think yours is just easier?
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1140.12,1141.88,"Well, we -- there are two reasons."
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1184.08,1189.04,"Under your theory, do you think the Democrats in the Eighth District have a complaint?"
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1189.04,1192.28,"No, I think that's a good example of what would be a de minimis effect."
2017.17-333,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1214.04,1214.48,Counsel --
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1214.48,1219.16,"Presumably, it wouldn't satisfy the first part of your test, that this would have been done with a vengeful intent --"
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1219.16,1219.36,And --
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1219.36,1220.0,-- to get those Democrats?
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1220.0,1221.04,And that's exactly right.
2017.17-333,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1225.76,1226.92,"But, Mr. Kimberly --"
2017.17-333,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1226.92,1237.68,"So we have many briefs, we have three cases, one, two were -- you know, was Wisconsin, there's Maryland, and the one we are holding, I think, is North Carolina."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1237.68,1237.88,Right.
2017.17-333,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1237.88,1241.16,And -- and there -- you've read those briefs probably.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1241.16,1241.84,Yes.
2017.17-333,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1241.84,1245.76,And they all have slight variations on different themes.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1311.4,1315.04,"Your Honor, I -- I -- obviously, this Court has before it those three cases."
2017.17-333,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1354.8,1356.72,But I raise it not for that reason.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1385.52,1385.64,Sure.
2017.17-333,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1385.64,1386.76,Okay.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1388.6,1393.76,"Well, the -- I mean, the -- the immediate reason, I suppose, would be the intervening 2018 elections."
2017.17-333,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1409.4,1418.76,What do you -- what do you think would be permissible? You -- you said your theory allows for de minimis exceptions.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1418.76,1418.92,Right.
2017.17-333,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1418.92,1421.8,So what falls in the de minimis category?
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1421.8,1429.72,"Well, I think a good example would be -- as I was just describing to Justice Sotomayor, it would be what happened in the Eighth Congressional District."
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1431.44,1432.48,That's not de minimis.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1438.36,1440.6,"Well, that's -- that's -- I think -- I think you can get at the --"
2017.17-333,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1440.6,1441.0,All right.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1442.4,1444.0,But I think you can get at it both ways.
2017.17-333,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1451.88,1489.52,"Well, may I give you a hypothetical that gets to Justice Ginsburg's question? Suppose you had a district and there was a reapportionment and we realized we have to add 15,000 votes -- voters to this district. And they looked at the numbers and they said: You know what, if -- this is a solid Republican district, but if we add 15,000 voters from a Democratic area, we're going to turn this into a highly competitive district. Would -- you would now force the state to meet a strict scrutiny burden on that, wouldn't you?"
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1489.52,1493.12,I think in that circumstance -- it sounds like what's going to -- I just want to --
2017.17-333,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1493.12,1504.48,"We are taking 15,000 of the bluest blue voters, and we're parking them in this district in order to convert the district from a safe Republican district to a competitive district. How do you analyze that?"
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1504.48,1509.72,"I think -- and just to be clear that I have it straight, if the point is that lawmakers in --"
2017.17-333,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1509.72,1511.12,We want another Democratic senator.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1511.12,1512.16,-- in Annapolis -- exactly.
2017.17-333,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1532.4,1548.8,"Counsel, one question I have about causation for you. Before the district court, it appeared that you conceded that you had to prove but-for causation, that but for the alleged gerrymander, the outcome would have been different in these last three elections."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1576.44,1580.28,"Well, to be clear, we -- we believe that but-for causation is an element of the claim."
2017.17-333,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1585.76,1592.16,"I understand that. But before the district court, you took the position that you had to prove it, according to the district court's opinion."
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1592.16,1592.8,I --
2017.17-333,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1592.8,1595.48,According to -- your brief is saying our burden is to show.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1595.48,1595.96,Yes.
2017.17-333,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1599.52,1599.72,Right.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1599.72,1602.0,-- that's really twisted to mean 180 degrees of what it actually meant.
2017.17-333,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1602.0,1604.84,So the district court twisted your concession?
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1604.84,1607.2,"It misunderstood -- Your Honor, it misunderstood what we were saying."
2017.17-333,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1618.32,1618.88,No.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1633.4,1641.56,"And -- and, Your Honor, that was a description of the factual arguments that we had made in the case about how it was that we were describing the burden at that point."
2017.17-333,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1642.48,1642.6,All right.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1647.84,1652.12,"Because that -- I mean, that -- that concession is -- first of all, it's not a concession."
2017.17-333,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1683.2,1684.68,One more along these lines for you.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1700.92,1701.24,Right.
2017.17-333,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1701.24,1704.4,And it had nothing to do with gerrymandering.
2017.17-333,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1717.24,1719.32,"Well, there are two things to say about that."
2017.17-333,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1805.52,1813.24,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sullivan."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1813.24,1835.6,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The plaintiffs' First Amendment retaliation claim fails to -- to provide a manageable standard for evaluating partisan gerrymandering for three principal reasons. First Amendment retaliation does not even try to answer the perennial question of how much is too much politics in a redistricting process that this Court has called inherently political."
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1835.6,1836.32,I don't know.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1844.4,1845.88,"Well, no."
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1845.88,1848.32,That's basically as I read his argument.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1848.32,1848.84,"Well, it depends on --"
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1848.84,1859.96,"If that's all you're doing, then it's too much. Now, under that test, he might lose, because you're claiming there were other reasons for this. But that's an issue of fact for the jury, I think."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1867.08,1868.24,Used to be my mayor.
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1868.24,1877.28,"Yeah, your own governor saying that he felt duty-bound to ensure that his party won."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1890.92,1892.52,"Well, two things, Your Honor."
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1903.68,1935.88,"Well, how much is too much is when, I think, balled up in the question of which there -- I -- I grant you they're a little bit equivocal of who bears this burden, but they're -- they are saying that we have to show that there's some form of entrenchment, that the intent is to ensure that only Democrats will be capable of winning in this district for the life of the census or the life of this boundary. So you -- you have a -- you have some form of too much."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1935.88,1940.2,"But they -- but they're really relying on is the intent, which they would equate with retaliation."
2017.17-333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1945.56,1970.04,"Well, Mr. Sullivan, let's say you're right, that they have not shown us how much is too much, that they have suggested that in any forum, when there's partisan advantage, the courts should be intervening. But we don't have to say something like that to deal with this case because, however much you think is too much, this case is too much. (Laughter.)"
2017.17-333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1970.04,1973.76,"I mean, I think. You'll tell me I'm wrong."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2024.0,2029.24,"Well, you might want intent to create something other than a competitive district, which is what Maryland created."
2017.17-333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2036.6,2037.48,Plus 2.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2041.92,2048.68,"Well, Cook evaluated the first election after the redistricting, which is the most important one where you can judge the effectiveness of it."
2017.17-333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2048.68,2082.28,"I mean, Democrats have now prevailed in three straight elections, including in an election which was a wave Republican election. So the effects were exactly what the intent would suggest: A long-standing Republican incumbent is unseated by a Democratic newcomer, who withstands a wave election, who prevails three straight times. I mean, it appears that the Maryland legislature got exactly what it intended, which was you took a Republican district, like a safe Republican district, and made it into not the safest of Democratic districts but a pretty safe one."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2082.28,2084.8,"Well, no, it's not safe."
2017.17-333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2113.44,2121.04,"Competitive, the -- the -- the idea that's being advanced is extreme gerrymandering."
2017.17-333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2173.92,2176.28,And -- and they will never have such a record.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2204.56,2237.64,"Well, I don't know if I'm smart enough to exceed all of the knowledge that's been applied to this question by this Court for a generation. But we do think that the equal protection law, which is what Baker v. Carr looked to when it first embarked on this project, to have the courts oversee redistricting, provides the -- the best hope for a standard, therefore, to emerge. And -- and -- and First Amendment, there are cases outside of retaliation -- retaliation has never been used to evaluate a statute that's otherwise out."
2017.17-333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2237.64,2237.96,Okay.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2266.84,2267.68,Let's --
2017.17-333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2267.68,2269.72,What do you think?
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2269.72,2274.0,"Well, there's -- there hasn't been 100 percent showing of it was the only purpose here."
2017.17-333,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2293.04,2306.48,Suppose the Maryland Constitution had a provision that required that partisan advantage for one party be the predominant consideration in any districting. Lawful or not?
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2306.48,2316.84,"That would be viewpoint discrimination, Your Honor, which the court would evaluate on the face of the statute. But, here, we have a facially valid statute that doesn't have any content along that line."
2017.17-333,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2316.84,2322.08,"Well, you -- you -- you can have viewpoint discrimination with -- without challenging something on its face."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2323.36,2328.84,"Well, in Christian Legal Society versus Martinez, the Court pointed out that if it's content neutral --"
2017.17-333,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2328.84,2337.68,"Well, why is the hypothetical viewpoint consideration and what happened here not viewpoint consideration? I don't understand the difference."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2337.68,2343.96,"Well, it -- it comes down to how the Court evaluates that kind of statutory challenge, which it has traditionally done on the face of the statute."
2017.17-333,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2343.96,2357.08,"My question to you was, A, was that invalid, the hypothetical? I believe, if I can conclude that your answer is no, that's not constitutional."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2357.08,2358.92,"Yes, that -- on the face of the statute --"
2017.17-333,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2358.92,2361.12,How is this case different?
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2361.12,2367.08,"Well, we don't have a statute that establishes a preference for one party or the other."
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2367.32,2369.88,"Well, but, I mean, the redistricting is a statute, isn't it?"
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2369.88,2370.2,Yes.
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2370.2,2375.16,"Well, that seems to be a statute that -- that prefers one party over another."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2375.16,2378.2,"But on its face, it's a series of metes and bounds."
2017.17-333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2383.8,2387.72,"Well, suppose, Mr. Sullivan, that the Maryland legislature passed a statute."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2391.32,2392.12,Just about --
2017.17-333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2392.12,2393.0,Is that right?
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2393.0,2394.16,Just about -- Democratic.
2017.17-333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2394.16,2408.8,"Yes, 60 -- 60/40. Suppose the Maryland legislature passed a statute and said, in the next round of reapportionment, we're going to create seven Democratic districts and one Republican district."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2408.8,2412.8,I think it would have a similar result to the question from Justice Kennedy.
2017.17-333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2413.96,2419.28,"Well, that is what then -- I mean, the Chief Justice said the -- the reapportionment statute is that statute."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2419.28,2420.64,"Well, it isn't on its face in that -- that it would --"
2017.17-333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2420.64,2421.8,The districting statute is that.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2421.8,2435.0,"-- it would require -- rather than using a traditional well-developed standard, the Court would have to depart from its traditional well-developed standard of evaluating viewpoint discrimination on the face of the statute as it's done in recent cases where it doesn't --"
2017.17-333,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2435.0,2438.96,"So -- so, if you hide the evidence of what you're doing, then you're going to prevail? (Laughter.)"
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2438.96,2446.56,"Well, I don't think it's hiding by stating the statute for where the boundary lines are as they've always been stated."
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2448.24,2451.72,"Well, let's talk about the boundary lines for -- for a second."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2472.36,2472.44,Well --
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2472.44,2476.24,"I mean, they both have farms but the former, hobby farms. (Laughter.)"
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2476.24,2476.48,Well --
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2476.48,2478.96,And the -- and others -- the others are real farms. (Laughter.)
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2478.96,2481.64,"Well, there's a lot in the record that you'll find."
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2507.4,2516.96,"Well, it just seems to me -- I've read a lot in the record -- but worried about, you know, going over Chesapeake Bay and drawing a district, and that makes a lot of sense, but it's not just water that separates --"
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2516.96,2517.52,Right.
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2517.52,2525.24,"-- people, and -- and part of the objection here to the way it was redrawn is that it's -- it doesn't seem to have any internal logic."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2525.24,2553.08,"Well, it would be harder to justify the -- what the plaintiffs want to call the benchmark district, which extended the Sixth all the way across the state to far Harford County, which is as far from western Maryland as you can get without plopping into the Chesapeake Bay. So, if you want to say let's judge it by geographic and traditional methods, then you couldn't justify the benchmark district that plaintiffs want to point to, which is the old Sixth."
2017.17-333,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2572.72,2582.36,"Mr. Sullivan, in the racial gerrymandering case, there was a period when ""max-black"" was the effort."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2596.0,2597.08,There's a couple of reasons.
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2638.52,2638.88,But we haven't --
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2638.88,2642.84,"Counsel, you've made -- just to clear up, I meant to ask it before, a factual question."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2646.72,2646.96,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2646.96,2648.96,But that's just the identified party.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2652.44,2655.76,"Well, I'm not sure."
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2660.84,2666.56,Is that a pertinent consideration in deciding whether something's been a partisan gerrymander?
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2666.56,2673.48,"Well, I think it's -- it's important because, here, both major parties are in the minority as far as registration in that district."
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2700.8,2710.08,"As a general matter in partisan gerrymandering cases, do you -- do you have any theory about how you're supposed to take independent voters into account?"
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2710.08,2724.28,"Well, I think they have rights too, and I think what gets lost in -- certainly, in plaintiffs' theory, perhaps in some of the others, is what about all the people that aren't part of a major party? They don't enter into the calculus for this First Amendment retaliation."
2017.17-333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2727.4,2738.76,"But isn't -- isn't it true, Mr. Sullivan, just as a matter of fact, that most people who are independents tend to lean pretty strongly one way or the other over many election cycles?"
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2738.76,2745.36,"Well, I've heard some analysts call them as -- as the angry white vote, but I don't know that that's true."
2017.17-333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2746.52,2778.0,"I wasn't suggesting that they were anything in particular, just, you know, people who call themselves independents and who, in fact, are not members of a political party, you know, tend to -- not all of them, but many of them, tend to vote pretty consistently one way. And this is why when mapmakers do their mapmaking, they look not only to party registration; they look to the way people vote, and what they find is that more members than just the members of the political party -- more voters vote pretty consistently."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2778.0,2780.52,"Well, I don't know if our record would support that, Your Honor."
2017.17-333,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2809.48,2828.68,"Along the lines of things we don't know, we've been talking about the intent of the legislature, but what effect does the -- does the fact that this map was subsequently approved by the people themselves have when we're trying to determine intent? This went up for voter referendum, as I understand it --"
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2828.68,2829.56,"Yes, it did."
2017.17-333,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2829.56,2832.0,-- and passed with 64 or so percent of the vote.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2832.0,2832.44,Yes.
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2863.2,2865.84,What did the referendum question ask?
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2865.84,2870.6,It asked if -- if the voters approved the plan that had been drawn up.
2017.17-333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2870.6,2871.08,"No, it said --"
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2871.08,2875.24,"Is that what it said, the plan that had been drawn up? I thought it -- well, I can look at it."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2875.24,2876.4,"Well, it's a more elaborate statement."
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2877.16,2878.32,"Well, it is a more elaborate statement."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2891.6,2893.28,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.17-333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2922.8,2940.48,"Now here is the -- here it is, I think, if my clerk got it right. Are you for or are you against the following text: Establishes the boundaries for the State's eight United States congressional districts based on recent Census figures, as required by the United States Constitution?"
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2940.48,2940.76,Yes.
2017.17-333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2940.76,2941.8,Well --
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2941.8,2942.56,And they were --
2017.17-333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2942.56,2944.88,"-- I mean, it doesn't even tell you there what establishes it."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2945.4,2948.52,"No, but they were -- they were sent a notice that it had a fuller explanation."
2017.17-333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2948.52,2948.88,Notice.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2952.32,2953.8,"Notice, but they do read the paper."
2017.17-333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2977.88,2979.96,"I got that point, but I have a different question --"
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,2979.96,2980.08,Sure.
2017.17-333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2980.08,2983.16,"-- which is -- I haven't thought of, and I -- so you may have it."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3022.48,3054.84,"Well, if independent voters had support of that Democratic candidate on the merits of that candidate because they thought that candidate was the better candidate, as happened in the Sixth District when independent voters voted very heavily for the Democratic candidate, then you would be harming them if you were -- if you were -- I don't know if you were going to think about invalidating an election, which the Court hasn't tended to do, but it -- it would be hurting them as well and blaming them for a problem that they didn't create."
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3054.84,3073.96,We have found standards on things like how many -- what's the burden of treating different political parties to a requirement of signatures to get on the ballot.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3112.72,3115.24,"Well, there's two parts of that, Your Honor, if you -- if I may."
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3154.6,3156.32,But not to discriminate.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3156.32,3157.4,To cast a ballot.
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3157.4,3159.4,You -- you answered Justice Kennedy --
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3159.4,3159.6,Right.
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3159.6,3161.96,-- by saying you don't have a right to discriminate.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3161.96,3162.16,Right.
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3179.32,3198.56,"But the whole -- the whole purpose of a gerrymandering attack is that I am being discriminated against or at least the theory of their case because of the views I have expressed over time, and that those views want to be silenced by the other side."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3198.56,3204.28,But those are the same types of things that come up anytime you're on the losing side of legislation.
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3216.8,3222.88,Are you essentially saying -- are you agreeing that gerrymandering is not justiciable?
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3222.88,3231.04,"Well, not -- we're arguing that on this claim that plaintiffs are bringing, the First Amendment retaliation, that it would not be a manageable standard."
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3232.6,3247.4,"So go back to my question, why? Would you -- do you agree with the court below that it can be made manageable if you introduce the test that it suggests plaintiff has to undertake?"
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3247.4,3248.64,"No, no, because --"
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3248.64,3261.44,"So answer why. The court there seemed to agree, certainly the dissent, Judge Niemeyer, thought it was manageable, but --"
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3261.44,3261.76,Well --
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3261.76,3263.4,-- why do you disagree with the majority?
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3263.4,3263.6,"Well, one --"
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3263.6,3269.76,"The majority is basically saying it could be -- it could be, though, but you have to prove these other things."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3269.76,3273.44,"It -- it starts with a specific intent, the retaliation requires."
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3280.12,3288.08,"Counsel, given their evidence, they certainly have enough to go to a jury on that question --"
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3288.08,3288.4,They've got --
2017.17-333,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3288.4,3293.68,-- whether there really was any legislative intent outside of the gerrymandering.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3293.68,3312.6,"They don't have anywhere near the number of affidavits they would need from the legislators that actually voted or from the more than 1.5 million Marylanders who approved the plan in a referendum. That's the kind of diffuse intent that comes into play when you're talking about legislation and, here, legislation that's been taken to referendum."
2017.17-333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3330.0,3332.2,"I guess I don't quite understand that, Mr. Sullivan."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3378.88,3410.88,"Well, I would refer you to plaintiffs' expert -- if you want to say that this is not involving the interplay between race and politics, you should look at the expert report in the record from plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Morrison, who talks about one of the reasons that the plaintiffs are aggrieved is because of the make-up of the prior district was much less diverse racially and ethnically than the new district, and they are being forced to be part of a district with a more diverse population in Montgomery County. So I don't know if you can say that this case --"
2017.17-333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3410.88,3432.76,"I think my main point was that we just -- we do this, we -- we -- we -- we do it when we deal with racial gerrymandering cases, even if you want to say to me that this is no easier than that, I would say back -- I guess I would argue with that, but -- but my main point was even if it's no easier, we do it all the time."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3432.76,3436.4,But you do it under the Equal Protection Clause and not the First Amendment.
2017.17-333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3440.04,3441.92,"Well, we -- we would be looking at the same things."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3455.56,3456.28,No.
2017.17-333,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3476.76,3484.76,I guess -- I guess what I was suggesting was that we're looking to the same things to discover intent in each circumstance.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3484.76,3493.84,"You -- you may be looking at similar types of evidence, but as far as I know, you have not applied the First Amendment retaliation rubric to that analysis, as plaintiffs want you to do here."
2017.17-333,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3493.84,3494.44,Is there anything --
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3494.44,3503.68,"Well, one difference between -- one difference between the race and partisanship is that we've always recognized that a certain degree of partisanship is acceptable."
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3508.64,3510.08,"That's true, Your Honor."
2017.17-333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3542.8,3547.72,We've had briefs in other cases that do try to answer that question pretty directly.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3577.88,3578.2,Yes.
2017.17-333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3578.2,3578.44,Okay.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3586.12,3586.32,Well --
2017.17-333,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3586.32,3589.72,So -- so we're back -- that's why I'm back to where I started.
2017.17-333,1,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3589.72,3591.32,I'm -- I'm not saying it's impossible.
2017.17-333,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3611.2,3616.36,"Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Kimberly."
2017.17-333,2,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3616.36,3625.84,"I'd like to come back to something that Justice Kagan raised about intent. The fact is, when it comes to legislative intent, this Court does it."
2017.17-333,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3743.32,3743.52,Sure.
2017.17-333,2,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3743.52,3750.84,"When -- when plaintiffs succeed in proving that map drawers have succeeded in rigging an election, they ought to be entitled to relief."
2017.17-333,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3756.0,3756.88,"Thank you, counsel."
