1992.91-1600,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.587,"We'll hear argument next in Number 91-1600, the Hazen Paper Company v. Walter F. Biggins."
1992.91-1600,0,39356,robert_b_gordon,,39.666,44.551,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1600,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,141.922,147.278,"Mr. Gordon, does the record show the total number of employees at the Hazen Paper Company?"
1992.91-1600,0,39356,robert_b_gordon,,147.278,149.488,"I don't believe it does, Your Honor."
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,1838.825,1877.279,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, respondent submits that the First Circuit correctly adopted this Court's previously determined definition of willfulness in Thurston and properly considered the evidence concerning Mr. Biggins' pension status, and I wish to first address why the Thurston definition has been properly applied by the First Circuit in this case, and then, secondly, why the pension issue as presented does not actually appear in the facts of this case, and that, even if it did, pension interference would be proper evidence of age discrimination."
1992.91-1600,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.304,1982.457,"Well, I think your last remark indicates what the problem is."
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2029.45,2039.468,"Your Honor, we don't dispute that in the vast majority of cases of intentional discrimination it will be... the plaintiff will be capable of establishing willfulness."
1992.91-1600,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2233.456,2247.394,"Well, Mr. Cahillane, you know, reviewing this record from the standpoint of an appellate court, which is obviously not the... I would find it very, very difficult to say that the conduct made out here is outrageous."
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2262.824,2264.905,"Well, Your Honor, I think that that gets at the heart of the problem."
1992.91-1600,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.434,2333.871,"So in that kind of a case, is the conclusion that it had to be intentional discrimination on age, therefore?"
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2333.871,2346.76,"It may well be, Your Honor, but it's not... that question isn't presented by this case, because in addition to doing that, Mr. Biggins also presented additional evidence of age motivation in that he was taken at age 62 and forced--"
1992.91-1600,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.76,2354.354,"Yes, but what normally is to be inferred from the finding of pretext?"
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2360.729,2379.091,"--Yes, Your Honor, I think that's essentially what the Burdine case means, that... well, if... assuming, of course, in the beginning, that the plaintiff's case is a disparate treatment case and the plaintiff is using a McDonnell Douglas scenario to make out his case, that would be the result."
1992.91-1600,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2417.857,2421.117,You say he was the only one asked to signed this confidentiality agreement.
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2431.004,2432.834,"True, Your Honor, in the view of the owners of the company."
1992.91-1600,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2459.972,2471.129,"And, since that's the case, the reason they wanted to get... since that was a pretext, it therefore becomes clear immediately that the reason they wanted to get rid of him was that he was too old."
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2482.987,2493.685,"It's not just the two remarks, Your Honor, it's the fact that Mr. Biggins was being treated differently on the basis of age in being asked to sign that agreement, and that he was replaced by a 35-year-old."
1992.91-1600,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2493.685,2496.297,You say he was being treated differently on the basis... why on the basis of age?
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2514.339,2521.584,"Because at that point, Your Honor, Mr. Biggins was in a position only because of his age that he could not only vest in the pension but that he could draw on the pension--"
1992.91-1600,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.584,2522.724,"Okay, leave out the pension."
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2526.527,2539.944,"--And in addition to that, Your Honor, Mr. Biggins was then replaced by a 35-year-old individual who was then given the very things that he was requesting in order to be able to sign that, a far more favorable treatment than he was given."
1992.91-1600,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2539.944,2545.638,"Well, the fact that he was given far more favorable treatment doesn't prove anything, but you got something there."
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2556.297,2558.097,"No, Your Honor, and I think--"
1992.91-1600,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2558.097,2558.918,--Enough to support a verdict.
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2558.918,2560.37,"--No, Your Honor, it would not be."
1992.91-1600,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.733,2664.056,How do you know that the jury found that he was a loyal employee?
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2664.056,2691.775,"--Well, Your Honor, that was the reason advanced as a justification for Mr. Biggins' termination which, if it had been believed, the jury could not have otherwise concluded that Mr. Biggins was a victim of illegal age discrimination, because they then would have had legitimate cause for letting him go that was not related to age, and in fact that was the central factual issue of the entire trial on which both sides presented evidence and the jury drew its conclusions."
1992.91-1600,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.548,2735.693,"On their account of the thing I... well, I don't know."
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2753.966,2756.527,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1600,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2756.527,2758.23,"They said, we'll keep you on if you'll sign this agreement."
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2759.97,2783.475,"But in being asked to sign that agreement and being asked to do what nobody else was being asked to do, and in being asked to agree to what were very onerous terms for him, he was effectively being asked to sign away the stock compensation that he had been promised that was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, so this was not a question of Mr. Biggins simply refusing to do something that was reasonable in any other way."
1992.91-1600,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2783.475,2786.447,"We'll resume there at 1:00 p.m., Mr. Cahillane."
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2804.499,2809.921,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-1600,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2831.276,2847.469,"Could I ask, let's suppose that the only evidence the court of appeals relied on was the pension item, would you say that we should still affirm?"
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2847.469,2859.235,"--Yes, Your Honor, in this sense, because the pension... we agree with the contention that the pension... just vesting in and of itself wouldn't be evidence of age discrimination."
1992.91-1600,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2894.277,2895.91,I understand the objection point.
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2931.642,2932.373,"--Well, yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1600,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2957.15,2958.239,I don't understand.
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2968.387,2969.158,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-1600,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2975.372,2988.0,"Certainly, you can't appeal giving the jury an opportunity to consider it, I suppose, but if that is the only evidence supporting the verdict, you can still say there is no evidence supporting the verdict, can't you?"
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,2998.928,3015.868,"That may be, Your Honor, but in addition to that, this issue was not addressed by... just in terms... forgetting about whether it should be entered into evidence, the whole issue of whether or not it was evidence of age discrimination was not addressed by the district court and not addressed by the circuit court."
1992.91-1600,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3018.92,3025.695,"Well, doesn't a motion... was a motion to set aside the judgment on the basis of insufficient evidence made in the district court?"
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,3025.695,3026.644,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1600,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3026.644,3032.839,"Well, doesn't that raise the question, was there sufficient evidence to support the verdict?"
1992.91-1600,1,35597,maurice_m_cahillane_jr,,3032.839,3035.409,"It does, Your Honor, there's no question about that."
1992.91-1600,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3047.238,3049.929,"Thank you, Mr. Cahillane."
1992.91-1600,2,30060,john_r_dunne,,3051.942,3059.366,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-1600,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3100.513,3109.899,"Mr. Dunne, is it enough for a finding of discrimination that age was a factor, perhaps a very minor factor?"
1992.91-1600,2,30060,john_r_dunne,,3111.8,3121.606,"--If the jury concludes that it was a factor contributing to or determining the employment decision made by the employer, that is sufficient to find liability."
1992.91-1600,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3121.606,3123.557,"Yes, but... excuse me."
1992.91-1600,2,30060,john_r_dunne,,3127.33,3134.997,"A series of cases, as indicated, that if it is a contributing factor or is a determining factor--"
1992.91-1600,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3134.997,3138.968,"Well, can you tell me one case in this Court that supports that proposition?"
1992.91-1600,2,30060,john_r_dunne,,3138.968,3147.584,"--I believe that it runs through Thurston as well as in Richland, that that is a factor... that is a principle for this law."
1992.91-1600,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.584,3149.556,"Well, now, liability."
1992.91-1600,2,30060,john_r_dunne,,3151.167,3152.839,"No, I'm talking about the underlying--"
