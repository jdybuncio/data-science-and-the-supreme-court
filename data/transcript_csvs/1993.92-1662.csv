1993.92-1662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.272,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 92-1662, United States against Granderson."
1993.92-1662,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,10.422,15.01,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1662,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,122.279,129.967,"If that's the case, then you're arguing for a sentence of probation all over again, only one-third of... with a one-third minimum of the original."
1993.92-1662,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,134.27,136.955,"With respect, Justice Souter, we don't agree with that."
1993.92-1662,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,198.195,203.314,Do you agree that this is a rather poorly drafted statute?
1993.92-1662,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,203.314,204.683,"We do agree with that, Justice Blackmun."
1993.92-1662,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,220.043,254.864,"Mr. Hungar, following up on Justice Souter's question, I suppose at the time the statute was enacted there might well have been people still incarcerated who were sentenced to a term of imprisonment followed by a term of probation, and supposing someone was in jail on a 15-year sentence, 10 years jail imprisonment plus 5 years probation, and that had not expired at the time the statute was enacted, and that person had his probation revoked in the third year of the probation period, what would the appropriate sentence be there?"
1993.92-1662,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,254.864,263.053,"Well, as I understand the preexisting sentencing scheme, Your Honor, that would not be a possible sentence, because the way probation formerly worked was that it was an alternative to imprisonment."
1993.92-1662,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,267.005,269.04,"Well, that's true now, but was that always true?"
1993.92-1662,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,269.04,276.713,"--I don't know whether it was always true, but certainly prior to the 1984 Sentencing Reform Act the law was that probation was an alternative to imprisonment."
1993.92-1662,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,293.841,296.274,Probation would not have been a sentence prior to the '84 reform--
1993.92-1662,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,296.274,297.476,"That's also true, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,308.315,323.943,"--On your view of the interpretation of this language, then, not less than one-third of the original sentence, what is the maximum to which the defendant could have been... the maximum sentence that could have been imposed?"
1993.92-1662,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,323.943,324.576,"Well, it depends."
1993.92-1662,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.392,350.678,"Which is, in this case--"
1993.92-1662,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,350.678,354.48,"--Well, in this case it's 6 months, which is... so the guidelines range is not the maximum."
1993.92-1662,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,354.48,355.43,--I don't follow that.
1993.92-1662,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,358.098,358.615,Yes.
1993.92-1662,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,358.615,361.117,--wouldn't the full sentence be 5 years?
1993.92-1662,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,361.117,376.661,"Well, the maximum sentence is 5 years if the court wishes to depart from the... and has grounds for an upward departure from the guidelines range, but normally the maximum sentence that is available under subchapter (a), which is the language of 3565(a)(2)."
1993.92-1662,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,377.728,387.934,How can 20 months be one-third and 60 months not be the full original sentence?
1993.92-1662,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,392.671,393.321,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,393.321,394.54,--under your reading of the statute.
1993.92-1662,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,394.54,401.861,"Yes, Your Honor, but the last provision of section 3565(a), the provision we're discussing here, only imposes a mandatory minimum."
1993.92-1662,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,449.607,456.447,"I don't understand why it trumps anything inconsistent, because subsection (2), which is the"
1993.92-1662,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,465.236,468.505,"Yes, but the ""notwithstanding"" proviso only requires a mandatory minimum."
1993.92-1662,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.111,478.344,Not less than one-third.
1993.92-1662,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,478.344,486.132,"That's correct, so to the extent other provisions of section 3565 are not inconsistent with the mandatory minimum, they continue to govern."
1993.92-1662,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,553.507,558.161,"Well, is that necessarily true, just as a matter of pure plain meaning?"
1993.92-1662,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,576.023,577.04,"--Well, first of all--"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1147.709,1158.081,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1231.795,1235.914,Probation terms have never been used as the barometer for probation terms.
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1237.266,1238.516,"--I did, your Honor, I apologize."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1251.157,1253.709,"Well, what do you mean by a revocation term?"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1257.478,1260.696,"Your Honor, I'm talking about the revocation sentence."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1264.131,1266.814,So what is a revocation sentence?
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1269.849,1271.385,"The sentence imposed upon revocation, your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1356.102,1360.654,What's your argument as to what the term original sentence means?
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1372.794,1379.3,"Your Honor, we submit it is the equivalent of what the old original sentence would have been under old law."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.502,1385.787,"Well, what would it be in this case?"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1385.787,1388.489,"It would be the top of the range, which would be the top."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1388.489,1391.608,"Well, why the top of the range rather than the bottom of the range?"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1391.608,1395.827,"Well, your Honor, I don't think that this court needs to answer whether it's the top or the bottom."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1395.827,1398.012,"Well, I would ask you that question and you need to answer it."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1398.012,1398.879,All right.
1993.92-1662,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1417.323,1426.179,Except that the language of the statute now does clearly refer to a sentence of probation.
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1426.179,1427.245,"Yes, your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1427.245,1433.749,And the sentence of probation given here was five years probation.
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1448.425,1460.916,"Your Honor, while it's true that, in form, probation is treated as a sentence... it's called a sentence under the new statute, it is not treated as a sentence in every respect."
1993.92-1662,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1467.22,1480.913,"Perhaps, although we have to do the best we can in interpreting this, and it is clear that 3565 as it's currently written refers to a sentence of probation."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1480.913,1482.096,"Yes, your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1488.252,1495.989,"Well, but original sentence could logically refer to the original sentence of probation, could it not?"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1496.573,1497.441,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1503.695,1509.582,"--Well, but that would be more of a stretch than it would to say it refers to the sentence of probation."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1509.582,1513.951,"--Your Honor, I don't think so, viewed in its historical context."
1993.92-1662,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1554.028,1558.896,"Well, I'm not sure what you mean by a fundamental change in revocation."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1600.407,1612.566,"Yes, Your Honor, you do have to do that, but what is different from history, fundamentally different, is you've never based the amount of revocation time on the probation term, because probation serves a very different purpose."
1993.92-1662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1616.184,1617.001,Mr.--
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1617.001,1617.551,--very strange results.
1993.92-1662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.551,1619.136,"--Smith, maybe you've been too generous here."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1638.115,1640.383,"Yes, Your Honor, that would be the literal interpretation."
1993.92-1662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1640.383,1662.48,"And so once we... and literally, that's clearly what it means, and once we depart from that, the issue is simply whether we take a... I mean, really, to call it a nonliteral interpretation doesn't really do justice to what a leap it is... we take a fanciful interpretation, should we take a fanciful interpretation that favors your client, or the fanciful interpretation that favors the Government?"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1668.819,1669.953,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1727.422,1731.226,"Well, but I'm still not clear on your answer to Justice Scalia."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1741.265,1742.032,"No, Your--"
1993.92-1662,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1742.032,1757.294,"--and I don't see why you don't argue that one-third of the original sentence means one-third, as a minimum, of the original probation sentence, a probation sentence with maybe more onerous condition, but you seem to back away from that."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1757.294,1759.194,"--Your Honor, if I did, I apologize."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.826,1782.426,"Well, Mr.--"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1795.4,1800.954,"Your Honor, I think they followed it particularly in its historical context as closely as it could be followed."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1806.857,1813.797,"They certainly didn't say, did they, that the only sentence that could be imposed was probation?"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1813.797,1816.332,"They did not, no, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1816.332,1832.092,"Well then, in fact, Mr. Smith, the whole statutory scheme here seems to me to be perfectly clear that you can't reinstate someone on probation after they had a controlled substance possession established."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1835.877,1837.913,"Your Honor, I don't agree for this reason."
1993.92-1662,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1853.505,1868.448,"Mr. Smith, before you go on with that, do I understand you correctly to say that on your view, if there must be incarceration, then the top would be 6 months, and the minimum, not less than one-third, would be 2 months, is that your view?"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1868.448,1882.442,"Yes, Your Honor, and it's interesting, the Government below in its plea agreement agreed not to recommend a sentence above the original 6-month range, so it's clear that Mr. Granderson would not have gotten more than 6 months, unless the judge disagreed with the Government on what was the--"
1993.92-1662,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1882.442,1887.261,Your interpretation of not less than one-third of the original sentence would be--
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1887.261,1889.945,--Two months of some kind of confinement.
1993.92-1662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1938.628,1948.217,"--Mr. Smith, if we adopt your interpretation, is it always the more lenient for the defendant, or does it just happen to be in the case of your client?"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1948.217,1951.169,"It certainly is in the case of my client, and we submit it will always be."
1993.92-1662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.169,1959.192,I know... there's no situation in which using the Government's system would produce a lower sentence?
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,1959.192,1961.06,"We don't believe so, no."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2011.242,2038.227,"Dewsnup dealt with the principle we've enacted in connection with the Bankruptcy Code in 1978, that absent some showing to the contrary either in the legislative history or the statutory language, we would presume that the old Bankruptcy Act, the principles carried over, but we've never had... enunciated any such general principle in connection with the entire body of criminal law."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2038.227,2047.665,"--No, Your Honor, not specifically, but I think frankly it ought to be more easily applied in a criminal context because the Rule of Lenity applies in a criminal context and would not in a bankruptcy context."
1993.92-1662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2047.665,2052.652,No change from prior law unless it is specifically mentioned in the legislative history.
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2052.652,2054.668,"Yes, Your Honor, that's how we read Dewsnup."
1993.92-1662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.668,2058.556,"So you can't make any changes in conference committee, for example."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2061.525,2069.179,"Justice Scalia, I know you dissented from Dewsnup and don't necessarily agree with that principle, and I think it's an issue that--"
1993.92-1662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2069.179,2070.63,"Oh, I disagree with much more than that."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2080.571,2082.505,"--No, Your Honor, perhaps I'm stating it too broadly."
1993.92-1662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2094.48,2114.108,"May I ask you a question, going back to... looking at the time the statute was enacted, were there people in Federal prisons at that time who had been sentenced under the regime that Justice O'Connor described such as having gotten a sentence of 6 months... or a sentence of 6 months in jail suspended, and in lieu thereof probation for 5 years, for example?"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2114.108,2118.362,"--That's most of the cases that were coming before cases in 1988, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2118.362,2126.618,"And under that view, what would you have interpreted the original sentence to refer to, the suspended term of imprisonment, or the probationary period?"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2126.618,2127.452,The suspended sentence.
1993.92-1662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2131.486,2139.692,"So you're saying that there are... there were... at the time the statute was enacted, there was a prison population who would have fit the description Justice O'Connor's hypothetical used."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2139.692,2140.625,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2140.625,2144.663,And they were eligible for having their probation revoked at that time.
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2144.663,2145.663,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2145.663,2160.089,But do you disagree with the Government that that would not have fit this statute because prior to this change probation was not considered a sentence of any kind?
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2160.089,2166.093,"Your Honor, it's called a sentence in 1984, but it's not treated as a sentence in every respect."
1993.92-1662,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2168.379,2175.282,"Before it wasn't treated... I mean, you didn't convert probation time into jail time because probation was not considered a sentence."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2175.282,2176.132,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2176.132,2179.234,"It didn't fit the words, a sentence, until the change in the law."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2179.234,2185.99,"Yes, Your Honor, and even after the change in the law... after 1984, when probation was called a sentence, you still didn't use the probation terms."
1993.92-1662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2244.612,2271.679,"I suppose it wouldn't be strange to think that if Congress did have in mind the old system, and was referring to one-third of the original sentence that was suspended, I wonder, it was always my understanding that if you violated the terms of your probation, not just one-third of the sentence that was imposed would be given you, but in fact the whole term."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2284.337,2290.891,My understanding is that the parameters were set by the suspended sentence.
1993.92-1662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2294.175,2298.163,I'm talking about under the old system that Justice O'Connor was referring to.
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2307.369,2319.76,"--No, Your Honor, the court could suspend imposition of the sentence, for example, and there would be no sentence to put in its place, so I think the court still retained discretion, but there was something over their head, just like there's a guideline range over a defendant's head now."
1993.92-1662,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2319.76,2330.901,"Yes, but this statute would have made a change in that prior to this statute, if the person on probation were found in possession of cocaine, as this man was, the judge might not have revoked this probation at all."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2383.769,2384.485,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2412.704,2416.673,What was the sentence in fact imposed in this case?
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2416.673,2427.112,"Mr. Granderson was placed on probation for 5 years plus a $2,000 fine, and that doesn't fit either side's description."
1993.92-1662,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2427.112,2431.183,"Mr. Smith, let me make sure I understand something, because I was never a Federal sentencing judge."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2434.802,2435.785,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2435.785,2446.36,"--if the probation is violated, the judge under the prior law had complete discretion to determine how much of the execution would then be imposed, isn't that true, so if--"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2446.36,2447.593,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2447.593,2448.378,--Okay.
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2448.378,2464.387,"If you look at the legislative history the way we see it, where a floor is being placed within the existing framework of zero to 6 months, that is a minor technical change, the kind you would not expect there to be a lot of legislative history on, and so it's not surprising that there's not here."
1993.92-1662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2500.244,2503.862,"Gee, I guess if that's what they want to change it to, it must not mean that now."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2503.862,2507.583,"Your Honor, that is not the legislative history."
1993.92-1662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2508.733,2511.035,"This is subsequent legislative history we're talking about now, isn't it?"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2511.035,2511.585,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2511.585,2513.404,"Future... future history, so to speak."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2513.404,2519.308,"Yes, Your Honor, and Senator Thurmond's reason for introducing it was that there was ambiguity in the statute."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2519.308,2527.562,"This final decision whether there's ambiguity in the statute is committed to the courts, not to Senators, or individual Senators."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2527.562,2536.519,"Yes, Your Honor, this has limited impact, but all I'm trying to tell the Court is that if this Court finds ambiguity, it would be telling Congress nothing more than it's already been told."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2536.519,2538.819,Perhaps by a superior source.
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2538.819,2541.471,"By a superior source, indeed, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2576.227,2591.737,"On your reading, could the judge say, originally the guidelines gave me zero to 6 months, but I could have gone up to 5 years if I wrote an opinion saying why I was going outside the guidelines."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2609.466,2618.488,"Yes, Your Honor, if the facts warranted it, they could depart as they normally depart, but we would have a right to appeal that departure as being above the range."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2660.832,2668.671,The Government with a more serious crime always has the option to independently prosecute the person and not simply to resort to this provision.
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2668.671,2673.139,"Yes, Your Honor, and they have the opportunity to prosecute for possession of drugs as well."
1993.92-1662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2673.139,2679.043,"Mr. Smith, I think you've just given me an example in which the Government's interpretation would be more lenient to the defendant than yours."
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2681.126,2682.161,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2692.184,2702.472,"I thought your point was that you should be able, in the event of murder, to consider going higher, to consider going beyond the guidelines range, wasn't that your point?"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2702.472,2708.043,"Your Honor, I think upon any revocation you can depart if departure is warranted, even with drug possession."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2741.616,2744.318,--know that individualized sentencing is best?
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2754.257,2759.828,"--Your Honor, there are limits that Congress has placed on it, but they've never taken away individualized sentencing."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2759.828,2769.617,"Well, they haven't totally taken it away, but why should a court say that more judicial discretion is better than less judicial discretion in sentencing?"
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2769.617,2774.485,"Your Honor, I guess it's because I just don't think that judges are... I mean, why do we have judges?"
1993.92-1662,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2784.377,2789.162,It's not any necessary part of your case to talk about the difference between individualized sentencing and guideline sentencing.
1993.92-1662,1,26076,gregory_stuart_smith,,2789.162,2789.779,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2814.646,2815.796,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2818.448,2821.383,I have a few brief points I'd like to make.
1993.92-1662,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2855.037,2867.031,"How would the statute apply, Mr. Hungar, to a person who 4 years earlier had been given a suspended sentence of 6 months, then was suspended and was put on probation for 5 years?"
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2876.636,2897.383,"No, because the effective date provision of this particular statute at section 7303(d) of the 1988 act, which added this amendment... the effective date of this provision, it applies to sentences of probation that begin after December 31st, 1988, so in your hypothetical, it would not be subject to this provision."
1993.92-1662,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2897.383,2905.406,"So the sentence... if the person on probation had its probation revoked after the enactment of the statute, that person would not have had any mandatory requirement."
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2906.922,2908.358,"This statute would not apply to that person, yes."
1993.92-1662,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2908.358,2918.38,The statute you refer to explicitly says that the effective date of this statute will be with reference to those persons whose sentence of probation was after the effective date?
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2918.38,2920.832,"Yes, Your Honor, I think I have the language here."
1993.92-1662,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2925.301,2926.986,7303(d)?
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2926.986,2929.021,"Of the 1988 act, and it provides,"
1993.92-1662,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2934.925,2935.558,All right.
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2935.558,2943.781,"In answer to Justice Scalia's question about whether there are any cases in which the Government's interpretation would be more lenient, there are such cases."
1993.92-1662,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2972.364,2974.316,But that's an extraordinary case with a downward departure.
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2988.143,2989.026,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3012.175,3021.447,"It is true that supervised release terms, in terms of number of months or years, tends to be shorter than sentences of probation, is that not so?"
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3021.447,3022.631,"I don't know whether that's true, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3047.348,3048.981,"Mr. Hungar, how does the Rule of Lenity work?"
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3076.166,3078.384,I think the Rule of Lenity requires a constant interpretation.
1993.92-1662,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3088.425,3094.912,"Can you make your basic lenity determination based upon the standard case, the nonextraordinary case--"
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3094.912,3095.995,"Absolutely, Justice Souter, but--"
1993.92-1662,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3095.995,3098.447,--which would be this one rather than the D.C. Circuit case?
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3098.447,3103.518,"--Our... well, I suppose you would also have to consider the degree of lenity."
1993.92-1662,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3126.099,3127.05,"That's not the Rule of Lenity, that's just reading the statute."
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3127.866,3140.441,"That's right... no, Your Honor, the Rule of Lenity, as this Court said last term in the Smith v. United States case, which we've cited in our brief, the Rule of Lenity doesn't come into play to let you choose between one interpretation that is consistent with the language and another that's not."
1993.92-1662,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3145.612,3150.416,"But once we've applied the rule of least absurdity, then we may be in a position to apply the Rule of Lenity."
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3150.416,3151.382,"Well, that's my next point, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3219.476,3230.118,"Why isn't it just as logical, then, if you... to go back to the only reference you have for incarceration, which is the originally available sentence of incarceration?"
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3257.535,3261.903,"--Because original sentence doesn't mean, sentence that was available but not imposed."
1993.92-1662,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3267.041,3270.909,"But we know it cannot mean original sentence, because here the original sentence was one of probation."
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3270.909,3272.195,And that's precisely our point.
1993.92-1662,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3294.208,3301.047,"Well, but in... that's mis... it seems to me in 3583(g), the supervised release provision you're talking about, they made it very clear."
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3304.249,3305.032,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1662,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3305.032,3307.884,"""# not less than one-third of the term of supervised release. """
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3309.568,3327.246,"Because it was unnecessary, because when Congress says, ""sentence"", at the point in the statute where Congress is now directing the court to sentence the defendant, probation is no longer an option, because Congress has already directed the court to revoke probation, and the phrase, ""revoke the sentence of probation"" means in Federal sentencing law, probation is not an option."
1993.92-1662,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3334.868,3345.493,"Can you cite your authority... you've said it several times... for the proposition that once probation is revoked, the judge does not have the authority to reinstate probation on different terms and conditions?"
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3345.493,3349.195,"Well, it's inherent in the very doctrine... section 35--"
1993.92-1662,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3349.195,3352.48,"No case has said that, that you know of?"
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3352.48,3353.03,--Yes.
1993.92-1662,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3363.205,3370.109,"You all think this statutory language commands that, and forbids a different sentence of probation on much more severe terms?"
1993.92-1662,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3370.109,3375.345,The fact that Congress has always used revoked to mean exactly that I think commands the result that we urge.
1993.92-1662,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3375.345,3376.928,So you have no authority for it.
1993.92-1662,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3376.928,3377.928,"Thank you, Mr. Hungar."
