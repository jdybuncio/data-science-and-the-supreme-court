1979.79-565,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,56.885,We will hear argument next in Central Hudson Gas & Electric v. Public Service Commission of New York.
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,60.797,64.578,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-565,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,309.379,324.919,"Would this bar, Mr. Taylor, ads in the form of essays, as is sometimes done, promoting the more efficient use of electrical energy?"
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,324.919,326.637,Yes.
1979.79-565,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,352.787,357.26,But it wouldn't ban advertising in promoting the non-use of electricity --
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,357.26,357.531,No.
1979.79-565,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,357.531,361.424,-- if the advertising said turn out your lights when there is nobody in the room.
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,361.424,362.07,You're quite right.
1979.79-565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.3,494.825,"Mr. Taylor, supposing that a drug manufacturer sent out a letter saying ask your doctor to prescribe morphine for your pain you have, now the prescription of morphine is perfectly legal in most states, but you do have to get it by prescription."
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,498.286,510.79,"Well, if it was encouraging him to get it without a prescription, it would, of course, be advocating unlawful conduct and I suppose it would fall within the traditional category of speech which can be limited."
1979.79-565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,523.037,536.901,"But my hypothesis simply says the drug company sends to the occupant of every house ""ask your doctor to prescribe morphine"" --"
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,536.901,537.861,"Well, that --"
1979.79-565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.861,541.342,-- so it would be in compliance with the state law --
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,541.342,546.513,"That is encouraging the use of what are called controlled substances, well known to be dangerous."
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.582,725.892,I suppose if he state said we want to cut down the use of energy in this state so we are going to somehow say you can't sell to any one customer more than a certain amount or you can't sell any more that you sold him last month or something like that.
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,729.18,737.489,"Well, that question can't be answered fully without taking account both of statutory matters which I don't think are relevant here and constitutional matters."
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.321,751.044,Let's get past the statutory question.
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,751.044,755.106,"Yes, I was going to go past it right away."
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,762.153,763.452,Or any other problem?
1979.79-565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,763.452,773.981,"Well, there would be a matter of showing if there was a reasonable basis for the restriction and, of course, ordinarily the standards of review on that are very relaxed."
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.479,806.246,"But there wouldn't be any constitutional problem, would there, assuming that the state statute clearly authorized it, if the utilities commission could say no electric utility in this state shall take on any new customers for the next twelve months."
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,806.246,815.438,"If a satisfactory substance showing could be made in support of that regulation, the answer of course is they could do that, assuming the statutory questions were cleared up, there would be no First Amendment problem."
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,815.438,818.756,"Or no constitutional problem of any kind, would there?"
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,818.756,820.133,"If a satisfactory factual basis, there are none."
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,820.133,821.017,Right.
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,821.017,821.431,That's right.
1979.79-565,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,821.431,823.183,"Well, let's narrow that a little bit, Mr. Taylor."
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,834.805,836.656,"No different problem, Your Honor, no."
1979.79-565,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,836.656,838.547,You think it is no different from the other?
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,838.547,844.617,"No, this would still be a restriction on the activity itself it would not raise a First Amendment Problem."
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.617,857.813,But you nevertheless say that the state may not achieve an equivalent or roughly the same end by telling the company not to advertise the use of electricity.
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,857.813,874.603,"Yes indeed because the situation we have now is that the public or the consumer is entirely free to use electric energy, the company is entirely free to make it available, there are many alternative ways of using it, some of which are more effective than others, and --"
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,874.603,882.637,"Yes, but the state has decided that they have a very good reason for limiting th use of electricity."
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,904.527,916.334,"I don't believe they can do that, Mr. Justice White, it seems to me because that rests on achieving this consequence by keeping the public in ignorance to matters they are entitled to know."
1979.79-565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,959.326,962.098,Are you going to get to Ohralik?
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,962.098,962.787,"Yes, I will."
1979.79-565,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1030.228,1039.496,"Do you see any analogy, Mr. Taylor, in a rationing program, rationing gasoline, for example, with coupons?"
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,1052.644,1055.803,"It would seem to me not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.706,1294.71,"Do you agree, Mr. Taylor, that if you thought the state was giving a compelling interest, was using a compelling interest to justify this restriction, that it would be all right?"
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,1298.484,1302.21,"Of course not, Your Honor -- excuse me for putting it that way."
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1312.28,1334.578,"Then suppose the state just out and out says, well, we offer you a compelling interest, we don't know of any more compelling interest than to save energy and we think this is an effective way of saving energy, is that -- of course, you disagree that that would be a compelling interest, I suppose, or would you?"
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,1334.578,1341.6,We do not at all dispute the idea that the conservation of energy is a great value.
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1351.974,1359.141,"Well, if you didn't think your advertising was effective, you wouldn't really be worrying very much, would you?"
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,1359.141,1361.293,"Of course, the advertising must be effective --"
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.293,1363.409,You would it is effective or you wouldn't be spending your money on it.
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,1363.409,1365.474,Right.
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.896,1405.737,I take it you would be unsatisfied if just the over-broad portions were clipped off of the order?
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,1405.737,1407.427,We would be dissatisfied.
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1407.427,1407.968,Dissatisfied.
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,1407.968,1410.694,"We would be dissatisfied, yes."
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1410.694,1415.92,Although over-breadth you think -- do you think over-breadth applies right across the board in --
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,1415.92,1429.692,"Well, we believe the over-breadth doctrine is available in this case because it is not a situation where we would come within the legitimate scope of the statute in a complaint that it might apply to someone else."
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1448.368,1461.086,"Well, what would be our rationale if we said, well, we think the state's justification is saving energy, we think that is a compelling interest, then what do we say?"
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,1467.778,1471.333,"No other state does, and nether does the federal government."
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1472.943,1475.209,"But this state does, though."
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,1475.209,1478.296,"Yes, but I take it that --"
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1478.296,1481.991,Must we disagree with them to side with you?
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,1481.991,1493.509,I think you must find that assertion that this would measurably further conservation is not so here.
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1493.926,1495.95,"If we disagree with you on that, you lose?"
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,1495.95,1496.766,No.
1979.79-565,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1496.766,1496.937,No?
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,1496.937,1508.2,"Because we still have the over-breadth argument and we still have another argument which in point three of our brief, which we think is equally compelling."
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1566.238,1579.181,Even though within that broad authorization the commission perhaps comes up with a much narrower justification and says what we are really talking about is saving energy?
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,1579.181,1591.428,"Under the question of the standard though, what they have done here is only one thing that they might do for lack of the standard, and also the conservation is not the only point the commission is making, of course."
1979.79-565,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1671.34,1673.913,Has the state suggested any other reason for doing this?
1979.79-565,0,43387,telford_taylor,,1673.913,1680.268,"Yes, they have, even more inadequate than the first, Mr. Justice White."
1979.79-565,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1687.557,1690.579,Mr. Schiff.
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1690.579,1695.967,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-565,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1794.911,1814.251,Do you suppose the state legislature of New York would pass a law saying that no company engaged in the oil business shall engage in promotional advertising that would tend to increase the consumption of oil or of any kind of petroleum product?
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1814.251,1823.477,"I will tell you, we have not -- that is a more difficult question, in light of this Court's First Amendment cases."
1979.79-565,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1823.477,1832.467,What is really involved in that question I think is how much does your argument depend upon the fact that these are regulated monopolies.
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1832.467,1839.0,It depends very substantially on the fact that these are regulated monopolies.
1979.79-565,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1839.0,1842.547,The case posited by my brother Stevens would be the same if --
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1842.547,1848.39,"Well, let me, if I may, say why I think this is different and --"
1979.79-565,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1848.39,1852.518,"I will tell you why it is different, because the difference is rather obvious."
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1855.668,1871.127,"Well, in this case the basic information in commercial speech cases that the Court has protected is really saying that there is a need to provide price information to customers."
1979.79-565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1909.619,1910.494,I understand that it is different.
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1913.013,1919.978,"Well, I don't have to -- I guess I have to argue this case and I think there are compelling reasons here."
1979.79-565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1928.665,1931.45,So you don't want to answer the question.
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1931.45,1934.396,"Yes, I think it is too iffy because I don't think you have to reach it here."
1979.79-565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1937.836,1941.802,Is there competition for items such as heat pumps?
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1941.802,1943.136,"Yes, there is competition --"
1979.79-565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1943.136,1947.001,And are their suppliers of those competing items that are not regulated by your commission?
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1947.001,1954.459,"Absolutely, there are suppliers who are free to advertise, the appliance dealers, there are the manufacturers --"
1979.79-565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1954.459,1957.67,People can advertise oil furnaces?
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1957.67,1958.538,Yes.
1979.79-565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1958.773,1962.825,They can advertise the relative advantages over electric heating?
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1962.825,1964.475,They can advertise their relative advantages --
1979.79-565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1964.475,1968.141,"And that advertising may promote the consumption of oil, I assume?"
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1968.141,1978.028,"Yes, and there are appliance dealers who can promote and say why electric heat is better than oil heat."
1979.79-565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1982.607,1983.365,Let me just be sure.
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1992.311,1994.977,"That fact -- well, primarily."
1979.79-565,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2033.402,2044.485,"Well, there is nothing in the Constitution that prevents New York from making every single enterprise conducted in the state a regulated monopoly, is there?"
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2044.485,2052.587,"Well, we can't very well make something a regulated monopoly if the business is not essentially monopolistic."
1979.79-565,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2054.257,2056.277,"Now, wait a minute."
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2056.277,2058.141,"Oh, we could regulate them but not as monopolies."
1979.79-565,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2058.141,2067.346,"Well, couldn't New York simply have a system of state socialism where the state owns all the means of production and so forth?"
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2070.779,2075.635,"Well, if you are talking about state ownership, I suppose we could have that."
1979.79-565,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2097.173,2114.719,"Utilities is just a descriptive term for those types of businesses that the state has chosen to heavily regulate and franchise, isn't it, and there is no magic boundary between a utility and a kind of semi-free enterprise type of business."
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2114.719,2115.944,"I think there is, Your Honor."
1979.79-565,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2140.851,2142.449,That is because of the state.
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2142.449,2144.367,"No, no, it is not because of the state."
1979.79-565,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2153.338,2155.979,You mean you can't economically?
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2159.397,2162.197,"Oh, constitutionally, sure."
1979.79-565,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2347.971,2349.901,"Well, the point is you don't have any choice."
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2349.901,2351.275,"You don't have any choice, there is one price."
1979.79-565,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2351.275,2355.078,And that is all there is to know about it.
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2355.078,2360.093,"This isn't the routine legal services that we are involved with, this is talking qualitative kind of --"
1979.79-565,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2360.093,2365.645,Why do you say this is just in the terms of commercial speech?
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2386.533,2400.517,"No, this is on the promotion of electricity, this isn't on whether they are promoting -- this ban, the only thing that is involved here is the promotion by advertising of electric usage."
1979.79-565,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2410.812,2416.856,"If he is an oil man or an electricity man, it might be?"
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2416.856,2423.894,"Well, this particular order goes to the question of whether you can promote the usage --"
1979.79-565,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2423.894,2424.824,Of electricity.
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2424.824,2427.228,"-- of electricity, right."
1979.79-565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2427.228,2451.363,"On your point that the information is generally available about priced and the like and there is no choice, as Mr. Justice Stewart points out, as contrasted with other commercial speech cases, suppose a big company was concerned about the relative advantages and disadvantages of using heat pumps and using electric space heating rather than other kinds of space heating, isn't that information equally inaccessible except from the company itself --"
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2451.363,2459.666,"No, because that was my next point, that the utilities are really not uniquely qualified to speak on that."
1979.79-565,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.286,2481.627,"I take it that by refusing to answer earlier, you would agree that you could not prohibit them from advertising the advantages of using their equipment?"
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2481.627,2482.763,"Well, we certainly couldn't."
1979.79-565,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.895,2492.226,"No, but my question of could the legislature put some kind of an oil conservation board into effect that would censor advertising generally that tended to promote the usage of oil."
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2492.226,2503.052,"I think that would be -- I would really doubt that we could do it except in cases of extreme emergency, but we certainly haven't attempted to do that."
1979.79-565,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2506.641,2529.182,"But it seems to me that you might have two different cases, one in which you say you can't advertise where the consumer has no alternative choice such as providing electricity for burning lighting or something like that, but why do you have to extend the ban all the way into areas in which there is a legitimate difference of opinion as to whether electricity is the most efficient energy source?"
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2529.182,2564.71,"Your Honor, the reason that the monopoly aspect of this is very important is that, for example, it might be beneficial for a customer, an individual customer to take on an electric heat pump, the electric heat pump is normally -- Central Hudson says there are some without air conditioning, but at least they have never advised us of that -- normally carry with it air conditioning in the summer, and the commission found that this would result in air conditioning that would not otherwise happen."
1979.79-565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2625.474,2641.041,"Well, I understand heat pumps, of course, but I don't know why the competition for, say, a new subdivision is being developed by a huge builder or a new 100-story office building, they have a choice as to what kind of heating, space heating it shall employ, electric, coal, and so forth."
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2643.217,2654.537,"Well, you see, the resistance heating problem is that it uses substantially more oil and there really is not much argument and the situation in New York may be different --"
1979.79-565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2654.537,2655.477,It clearly is not a monopoly then.
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2655.477,2658.487,"-- when we have conversions to coal, but we don't have that now."
1979.79-565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2668.85,2672.443,"Isn't that the place they need the advertising the most, is where there is competition?"
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2676.086,2730.214,"The problem is when the utility does this advertising, the extra costs from using additional oil and from the rate structure problems which the utilities can equally work on with the commission, that problem is one that is going to be to the detriment of the rest of the consumers, so you really have to say, well, we can let them advertise to a fare-thee-well and the other consumers be damned, we can't control that even if you can't control it by putting in a -- suppose we said, well, you can promote but put in a label that this is dangerous to the general rates, that wouldn't help the other consumers because it is encouraging that use which in itself --"
1979.79-565,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2730.214,2734.699,Why don't you justify it on grounds of protecting other consumers rather than saving oil?
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2734.699,2737.858,"Well, that is part of it because -- no, we want to save oil."
1979.79-565,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2786.663,2793.042,Shouldn't we assume that the consumer is intelligent?
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2794.725,2809.107,"I think that the consumer is intelligent and we think that an intelligent consumer is going to accept the fact that if a utility is promoting generally, that it doesn't really mean what it says about conservation."
1979.79-565,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2817.797,2832.438,You reject then Mr. P. T. Barnum's oft-quoted maxim that no one ever lost a dime underestimating the intelligence of the American public?
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,2832.438,2835.958,I think the consumer is reasonably intelligent.
1979.79-565,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3008.049,3018.829,"Well, are you arguing that because you could be so draconian you can have this much narrower but effective ban?"
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,3018.829,3028.07,"Well, I think certainly -- I don't think the facts would warrant trying to be that draconian at this time."
1979.79-565,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3028.07,3033.101,"No, but you could, you might say, and therefore we can certainly do this."
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,3033.101,3058.156,"Well, we certainly did that back in '73, when the oil was practically running out in the Con Ed territory and some other places, we recognized that there were alternative means of doing it and that restricting promotion was a better means of doing that than saying you simply couldn't -- that you close down the electric system alternately throughout the system."
1979.79-565,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3083.259,3090.409,"This shift by its terms applies to ""all electric corporations."""
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,3090.409,3091.335,Yes.
1979.79-565,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3091.335,3094.322,How many of those are there in the state of New York?
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,3094.322,3104.555,"Well, there are seven -- there are basically seven privately owned utilities and -- well, this applies to the seven electric privately owned utility companies in the state."
1979.79-565,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3104.555,3106.015,"Well, this applies by its terms to all electric corporation --"
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,3106.015,3107.562,They are all the ones that we regulate.
1979.79-565,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3107.562,3110.305,-- and my question was how many are there.
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,3110.305,3114.896,"Well, there are some municipally owned which provide a very small service in New York state."
1979.79-565,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3118.016,3120.374,There are only seven over which the commission has jurisdiction?
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,3120.374,3128.696,"Well, there may be a couple of very small ones, but basically this applies to the seven."
1979.79-565,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3133.522,3134.568,Throughout the state.
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,3134.568,3135.913,"Throughout the state, yes."
1979.79-565,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3135.913,3140.858,"How many municipal or public owned, roughly?"
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,3142.306,3145.558,"Well, I think there are probably more in the nature of twenty."
1979.79-565,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3273.974,3300.3,We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock.
1979.79-565,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,3302.103,3306.638,"I am finished unless there are further questions, Your Honor."
1979.79-565,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3306.638,3309.755,Mr. Taylor.
1979.79-565,2,43387,telford_taylor,,3309.755,3312.57,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-565,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3368.491,3374.663,"Are you saying that is the commission's position, Mr. Taylor, that the commission has not found any of these things?"
1979.79-565,2,43387,telford_taylor,,3375.237,3379.389,"That is what it says, yes, sir."
1979.79-565,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3394.231,3400.717,Are you urging that the justification they submit or they tender is insufficient?
1979.79-565,2,43387,telford_taylor,,3400.717,3402.943,It is concededly so.
1979.79-565,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3405.178,3407.294,"Well, I didn't hear him concede."
1979.79-565,2,43387,telford_taylor,,3407.294,3426.54,"Well, I read it though at page 18 of his brief that there is no basis for the restrictions on electric heating, and we say if that is so that you cannot put a sort of slow brake on it by forbidding the public to be informed about the advantages that are there."
1979.79-565,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3506.865,3513.753,"I know, but your point is that even if it is costly, this restriction is invalid."
1979.79-565,2,43387,telford_taylor,,3513.753,3526.739,My point is that the additional costliness is very incorrect and difficult to quantify and neither federal nor state-wise has any other authority found any necessity for this sort of limitation.
1979.79-565,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3526.739,3530.689,So we are to disagree with the commission then.
1979.79-565,2,43387,telford_taylor,,3530.689,3539.021,We urge you to find the invocation of the value in sufficient because it will not accomplish measurably its purpose.
1979.79-565,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3539.021,3546.58,"Or, alternatively, the commission is without authority, even assuming the accuracy of those claims --"
1979.79-565,2,43387,telford_taylor,,3546.58,3550.253,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, for the other arguments I have advanced."
1979.79-565,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3550.253,3550.869,"Thank you, gentlemen."
