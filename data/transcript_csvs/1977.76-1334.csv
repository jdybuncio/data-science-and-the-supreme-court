1977.76-1334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.054,We will hear arguments next in Bordenkircher against Hayes.
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,38.838,42.848,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,101.564,103.545,It was a forgery of an $88 check?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,103.545,105.618,"This was not a forgery, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,108.372,109.811,It was $88.
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,109.811,111.666,"Yes, Your Honor, it was $88."
1977.76-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,111.666,113.133,How many years for that (Inaudible)?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,113.133,117.916,The possible penalty range for that substantive offense is 2-10 years.
1977.76-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,123.958,128.256,Good.[Laughter]
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,128.256,136.428,The prosecutor offered a sentence recommendation to Mr. Hayes of five years on this uttering charge.
1977.76-1334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.02,192.349,"Let me interrupt you just a second, if I may, General Chenoweth."
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,200.562,215.224,"At the time that the plea negotiations were going on at a pretrial conference, really two pretrial conferences, there was only the singular substantive offense of uttering a forged instrument."
1977.76-1334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,340.96,342.551,Let me interrupt you there.
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,354.599,359.533,"Yes, very definitely, if I understand your question, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1977.76-1334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,386.167,387.365,Why not?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,387.365,393.739,"Well, he has to be willing if he has already gotten the case to the posture of having an habitual charge."
1977.76-1334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,421.011,424.429,You are coming up from the other side of the case.
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,433.551,452.725,"Because if he brings everything, he is going to have to and he desires to go forward with plea negotiations, he is bringing an element into the negotiations that he really need not bring and that is the habitual criminal indictment."
1977.76-1334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,452.725,455.859,I thought you are saying that he has to give away more?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,455.859,456.669,That is really so.
1977.76-1334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,471.275,474.214,Does that not sound like a better deal for the defendant then?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,474.214,477.622,I do not know why that it should in the --
1977.76-1334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,477.622,479.526,Is it not anything that is strange to the defendant?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,500.57,521.166,"It seems to me the type of thing that why should the prosecutor go forward on a non-substantive charge as is involved in this case and indict on that habitual criminal element of a case and then turn right around and be willing “I have got it, but now I will be glad to give it away if we will go forward on plea negotiations.”"
1977.76-1334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,521.166,531.207,"I will give you one reason that neither you nor your opposition suggests, at least I think it is a reason, is not bail likely to be higher?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,531.207,544.932,"Yes, but we are talking at that point in time of, in fact, a procedure that you are indicating of bringing everything in the first instance that that is going to work to the detriment of the defendant, not the prosecution."
1977.76-1334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,547.184,560.519,"I realize this and I intend to ask your opponent that same question, but I think this is a consequence that perhaps there is a reason for not bringing the initial, the full charge initially?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,560.519,561.069,Very definitely.
1977.76-1334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,561.069,563.545,I do not think anybody is being fooled.
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,566.187,605.937,"Sure, they understand that there are prior felonies in existence, but I think we are talking about two ways to get to the same point, either bring them from the beginning and be willing to give up the enhancement if you are going to go forward on plea negotiation or if you believe that there is a reasonable possibility of entering into plea negotiations and arriving at a plea arrangement, and especially you are going to feel that way to have an overwhelming case as you had here a proof of guilt, that why get that indictment for the enhanced offense on the books and then be willing to turn right around and in the statement of one writer, give the sleeves of your vest?"
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,625.202,626.149,Mr. Chenoweth.
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,626.149,627.869,Yes Mr. Justice?
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,627.869,646.674,"In the Commonwealth of Kentucky, after a grand jury has indicted someone under your habitual criminal statute, may the prosecutor dismiss that indictment without consent of the court, is he free to do whatever he wishes to do?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,646.674,648.954,"Yes, there is to my knowledge no guidance."
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,659.55,663.487,Just on the prosecutor;s say so?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,667.48,671.34,Consent of court to the extent that you would have to make the motion and an order would have to be entered.
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,671.34,673.207,And it would be pro forma granted?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,673.207,683.277,"I think that would be very safe to say, Your Honor, that this is a matter within that discretionary power of the prosecutor and the judge is not going to tell the prosecutor to go forth --"
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,683.277,688.333,It is the grand jury who has brought the indictment?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,688.333,690.217,This is so upon request of the prosecutor.
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,690.217,691.567,And upon the showing of the prosecutor?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,691.567,693.142,Yes.
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,693.142,702.988,"It is going to be dismissed in practical fact in the unreviewable and untrammeled discretion of the prosecutor, is that it?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,703.171,716.77,"That is safe to say that the judge is not going to say “prosecutor, you go forward with that what you do not want to go forward with.” So to that extent, I think that it would be very, very rare situation where that would be denied."
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,716.77,718.883,Are you really saying that?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,725.99,728.25,I would not go so strongly as to say that.
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,729.127,731.255,Then there is some discretion on the part of the court?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,731.255,739.612,"Sure, that there would exist discretion in the judge to say to the prosecutor that “I want to have a reason."
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,742.083,743.166,"Well, now wait a minute."
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,752.893,754.94,Let me please try and explain that.
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,762.762,770.71,"Your law requires that a grand jury indictment can be dismissed only with consent of the court or does it not, first of all, just what the law provides?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,770.71,772.853,"The judge does have to pass on, yes."
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,800.819,802.104,But you do not know of any?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,804.349,805.037,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,810.382,811.483,Nor ever heard of it?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,811.483,812.646,"No, Your Honor, I can say that."
1977.76-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,956.59,975.181,"What would happen if the prosecutor said “we have got overwhelming evidence of you uttering the $88-check,” and you are indicted for that“ and we also have overwhelming evidence that you also embezzled $460."
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,980.532,987.015,"If I understand your question correctly, we are talking about completely unrelated offenses, not arising out of the same conduct."
1977.76-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,987.015,988.714,It is okay.
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,988.714,990.123,"No, I am not saying that is okay."
1977.76-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,995.064,997.524,I said it is entirely different?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,997.524,997.636,"Yes, sir."
1977.76-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,997.636,1005.001,"Would you find anything wrong with that, where you were using some pressure?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1005.001,1010.046,"No, I do not find pressure as being in violation of due process at the plea bargaining stage."
1977.76-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1018.732,1025.747,Suppose he says “we also have an overwhelming evidence that your wife also stole $180.
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1028.583,1036.525,"I think and certainly we recognize, as this Court recognized, as Mr. Chief Justice Burger indicated in the Santobello case, there are limits."
1977.76-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1046.352,1047.951,We will go back to my original one.
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1071.206,1073.914,I think that is very legitimate plea negotiation.
1977.76-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1132.295,1139.759,Some will not agree that you can have “legitimate pressure?”
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1139.759,1140.764,"Yes, I understand that."
1977.76-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1140.764,1143.409,One means apples and the other means rocks?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1143.409,1146.098,That there cannot be that.
1977.76-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1151.924,1154.033,They are not saying it here?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1154.033,1163.836,"Yes, that may be so, but yet and still, clearly to say that there are people having different viewpoints on various aspects arising out of it --"
1977.76-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1163.836,1167.263,"There are limits that the prosecutor could go to, if you say that."
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1167.263,1167.575,Sure.
1977.76-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1167.575,1169.679,Everybody agrees on that.
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1169.679,1173.707,"We would be very, very foolish to say otherwise of course."
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1254.219,1261.642,"The point is, first, that this Court has explicitly approved the procedure of plea bargaining?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1261.642,1262.427,Of course.
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1262.427,1271.1,"And secondly, that the very concept of plea bargaining like the very concept of any bargaining involves the use of leverage or, if you will, a pressure on both sides?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1271.1,1283.11,"Very much so, except that the prosecutor probably has an unequal amount of power at that stage."
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1294.757,1304.286,"What the defendant has to offer, first of all, is that there is always a risk from the prosecutor’s point of view of a jury finding him not guilty?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1304.286,1306.431,Sure.
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1306.431,1318.987,"Secondly, there is always the certainty of a not guilty plea of expending the time and resources of the prosecutor and of the court and of the judge, that is what the defendant -- those are the tools in his hands, are they not?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1318.987,1330.086,"Those are factors of that enter into the very decision of the prosecutor to select, to go forward with some kind of plea negotiation hoping to get a plea arrangement."
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1336.519,1341.575,"But that it is perfectly permissible constitutionally, plea bargaining as such?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1341.575,1347.575,"Yes, that it is not per se unconstitutional while recognizing, in response to Mr. Justice Marshall, that there are limits."
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1347.575,1349.381,There can be an abuse?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1349.381,1351.257,"Sure, there can be an abuse."
1977.76-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1447.059,1450.073,"Mr. Attorney General, may I ask a question."
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1509.605,1522.685,I believe not because the same possibility is going to exist if the prosecutor in the very beginning indicts on that substantive offense in the non-substantive offense enhancement and says “I am willing to give that up.”
1977.76-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1522.685,1523.426,I agree.
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1544.224,1548.598,"Five years recommended, 2-10 on the substantive charge of going to trial."
1977.76-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.878,1563.091,I understand your argument about that.
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1586.443,1612.29,"I think there are limits, but I do not think that is one of them because if we are talking about that, which is not an aspect of this case, but certainly an aspect of plea negotiation, we are talking about that possibility of bringing multiple substantive offenses by their sheer number and offering to enter into a plea negotiation for a plea of guilty on only one of those, but that is a possibility the prosecutors have utilized often."
1977.76-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.29,1620.23,"In answer to Mr. Justice Marshall, I understood you to say it does not matter whether the charges are related or unrelated. That is not the touchdown."
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1624.464,1631.45,"I think unrelated substantive offenses or they may be related, but separate elements substantive offense."
1977.76-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1631.45,1636.705,"What, if any, is the limit on their discretion which should guide the prosecutor in this kind of negotiation."
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1644.669,1647.921,That is the concern of plea negotiation period.
1977.76-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.921,1650.402,But is there any limit to the discretion that you are saying?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1650.402,1651.968,Sure.
1977.76-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1651.968,1652.423,Where is it?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1653.374,1654.742,Where do you draw the line?
1977.76-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1660.59,1664.887,I understand that you do not offer any alternatives?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1664.887,1665.903,It is very difficult.
1977.76-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1683.511,1686.624,I understand that you do not suggest any limit either.
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1689.87,1694.967,"There is some limit, but there is not a limit in this case with the facts that we are talking about."
1977.76-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1694.967,1702.513,You never had a limit based on the disparity between the charge that he is asked to plead to and the charge you will have to go to trial if he does not plead?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1702.513,1703.614,I will say that.
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1703.614,1713.654,"So far in the cases in this Court, rather than limits the Court has been concerned with assuring that the bargain is kept, is that not correct?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1713.654,1715.296,"That is correct, Santobello is the very prime example of that."
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1715.296,1720.845,Santobello and the case last term?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1720.845,1722.104,Blackledge v. Allison case written by Your Honor.
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1722.104,1740.446,"Yes and the Court, while it may have and probably has talked about the fact that there are some limits, it has not in any way tried to define the meets and bounds of those limits, rather it has been concerned with assuring that the promise be kept, is that not correct?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1740.446,1748.206,"As you indicated, Your Honor, in the Allison case is that we are just getting this plea negotiation thing out on the table, so to speak."
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1764.209,1765.965,"If the bargain is struck, it must be kept?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1765.965,1769.679,That is correct.
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1769.679,1775.218,"I suppose if there is actual coercion, then it is not bargaining anymore."
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1786.934,1793.922,"Mr. Chief Justice very much indicated that there was and I think we go back to McCree Brady which Your Honor also wrote, that we talk about that."
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1793.922,1797.401,"But if it is fair bargaining, the Court so far has not defined any limits?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1797.401,1801.972,"Fair bargaining, that exactly is what we say. Clearly, here, it is fair bargaining."
1977.76-1334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1804.546,1814.823,"I suppose the concepts of the Federal Labor Laws are not very helpful, although you have used the same word or I did?"
1977.76-1334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.823,1843.329,"Mr. Chenoweth, is it not one of the consequences of a habitual offender statute the fact that the crime which finally brings the person within the terms of, say a four-time offender statute itself may carry a fairly light sentence, whereas the habitual offender statute simply by virtue of the number of crimes may carry a very severe sentence?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1843.329,1845.118,Very definitely so.
1977.76-1334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.703,1884.204,By virtue of a habitual offender?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1884.204,1891.181,"By a virtue of a persistent felony offender, habitual offender type."
1977.76-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.181,1911.945,I suppose that any plea of guilty is subject to collateral attack or a direct appeal on the grounds that it was not voluntary and I suppose another limit is that the defendant should have the adequate counsel?
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1911.945,1913.132,"Of course, always."
1977.76-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.132,1917.618,And that the negotiation is really with counsel as much as with anybody.
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1917.618,1928.161,"Well, the American Bar Association standards very definitely say “yes, you have counsel there when you enter into plea negotiations” and I think, yes, that is one of the hallmarks of a prosecutor that he does want to do."
1977.76-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.161,1932.625,"Is there a claim in this case, as a matter of fact, the plea was coerced?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1932.625,1937.417,Coerced from the standpoint of the procedure that was used.
1977.76-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.417,1943.906,"I know, but it is just a conclusion."
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1956.355,1977.542,"Yes, and again, I had a great deal of trouble with that word “coercion” from the standpoint of the types of procedure that we are dealing with here versus the way I see coercion when we are talking about what Mr. Justice Stewart is discussing and which was discussed in Santobello where you have physical coercion or overbearing mental coercion."
1977.76-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1977.542,1988.166,"Tell me again, perhaps you have already -- tell me again why a prosecutor would not say “bring the habitual criminal charge in the first instance?”"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,1988.166,1993.56,"Because if he does that he is doing a vain act, he is really performing a charade."
1977.76-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.279,2048.146,"Well substantively the habitual criminal statute represents rather serious judgment I suppose as to what should happen to a person and if the Court of Appeals thought that if the prosecutor thinks society’s interest demands prosecution for the more serious offense, they ought to put it on the indictment?"
1977.76-1334,0,38962,robert_l_chenoweth,,2048.146,2056.467,But I think that that is an incorrect conclusion that you make the decision as a prosecutor when you are faced with an enhancement possibility on a substantive offense.
1977.76-1334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2105.695,2118.271,Mr. Aprile?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2118.271,2121.814,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2163.055,2167.395,That is true if it serves to flaw the trial or appellant process?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2167.395,2168.88,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2168.88,2191.158,North Carolina against Pearce held that vindictiveness or the threat of vindictiveness would impair the absolute right that was accorded by the state to appeal or to collaterally attack a conviction and thereby impaired and impeded and flawed the appellate process or the collateral attack process.
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2197.912,2218.054,"Of course, if we look at it in a three-fold analysis we would see first, under the prophylactic rule of North Carolina v. Pearce, the intention is to prevent the apprehension or the fear of some sort of retaliation from stopping or chilling anyone from exercising a constitutional right."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2218.054,2218.947,Or a statutory right or appeal?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2218.947,2231.437,"Or a statutory right or a procedural rule right perhaps, but the point there was that the man had the opportunity to do something that was legitimate."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2277.301,2288.191,"If that is the case, what you describe always what the upshot of what happens when a plea bargaining is unsuccessful, always."
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2305.773,2306.563,"I do not believe so, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2316.064,2322.273,"Well, that is when a bargain is reached, but when a bargain is not reached, what you describe is always the result."
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2337.861,2343.59,I do not believe that it is always the result of the same magnitude and that is the difference in this case.
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2366.809,2370.185,"He was told in the process of the bargaining, what the result would be?"
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2370.185,2371.395,"No, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2390.261,2397.136,"And did the prosecutor not further say if you do not plead guilty, what is going to happen?"
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2397.136,2398.93,"No, Your Honor, not to that point."
1977.76-1334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2451.844,2468.434,"Well, if we uphold the Sixth Circuit here, every prosecutor faced with the situation as this one, this is going to indict for both the latest substantive offense and a habitual offense and the defendants are not going to be better off?"
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2468.434,2469.699,"Your Honor, I would --"
1977.76-1334,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2469.699,2470.902,This is also my question.
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2487.405,2502.218,"Your Honor, the first point I would make is to refer back to the footnote in Brady v. the United States where I believe this Court gave it at least the implicit recognition that you would find guilty pleas coerced if the charging power of the prosecutor was abused by overcharging when evidence did not support it."
1977.76-1334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2502.865,2505.67,"But here, just a minute."
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2513.151,2514.898,"Your Honor, that was not the response that I gave."
1977.76-1334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2535.119,2537.472,I am sure he can.
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2556.014,2588.228,"Because Your Honor, it is clear to people who are caught up in the criminal justice system that Paul Lewis Hayes and people in his situation when they exercise their constitutional rights to plead not guilty and turn down a plea bargain offer are punished for it and it would not appear that way Your Honor, if it was clear to people that this was the initial maximum punishment that a person faced. I believe this Court recognized that very real problem in North Carolina v. Pearce and Blackledge v. Perry when you said apprehension of this type --"
1977.76-1334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2588.228,2591.546,"Well, that is strictly a question of appearances?"
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2591.546,2596.087,"It was not to Paul Lewis Hayes, but it would be to many people within the criminal justice system."
1977.76-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2596.087,2603.681,Do you think your client knew what he faced under the law from his attorney?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2603.681,2606.303,"Your Honor, that is a very interesting point that you make."
1977.76-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.426,2643.137,Some of our cases say that certainly the adequacy of counsel issue survives pleas of guilty.
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2645.747,2647.975,"Your Honor, there is no plea of guilty in this case."
1977.76-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.267,2655.037,Do you think there was adequate counsel in this case here?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2655.037,2662.577,"Your Honor, since the issue was clearly preserved in the State Courts and raised on this particular issue, yes, I do not think that the adequacy of the counsel is the problem."
1977.76-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.008,2669.322,"If counsel is adequate, he can advise his client what kind of penalties he faces for his conduct."
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2676.773,2692.915,"Your Honor, I would submit that the Sixth Circuit was correct when they stated that when a prosecutor with knowledge of the facts of the crime seeks and obtains an indictment on a charge less severe than the facts warrant, he makes a discretionary determination that that is the appropriate charge."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2694.118,2699.299,Could I ask you if in Kentucky that plea bargaining goes on prior to indictment?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2699.299,2701.194,"No, Your Honor, plea bargaining does not go on prior to indictment."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2701.194,2703.101,Never?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2703.101,2703.636,Not to my knowledge.
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2703.636,2705.813,I am quite sure it does some places.
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2705.813,2706.862,"I would say this, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2730.095,2740.796,"I would suppose that if in those places where it does, if we we affirm the Sixth Circuit, no one could afford a plea bargain until after the grand jury met and the indictments came down?"
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2740.796,2764.987,"Your Honor, I think that the reality in this situation is that in Brady v. United States, as I recall you writing that opinion pointed out that it would be unconstitutional to hold that prosecutors could not extend as benefits concessions, dismissed counts and to allow pleas to lower lesser included offenses of the charged offense."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2776.962,2778.792,"Well, now that is important, Mr. Aprile."
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2869.588,2870.614,To a certain degree --
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2870.614,2872.243,"Now, what did happen in this case?"
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2872.243,2876.361,"In this case, the initial bargain did not involve any charge."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2881.277,2882.053,I understand that.
1977.76-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2884.174,2886.882,But that is not what the Court of Appeals opinion says?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2886.882,2887.066,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2887.066,2898.462,"It says that during this conference the prosecutor offered to recommend the five-year sentence if Hayes would plead guilty, petitioner was warned that if he did not plead guilty he will be charged under the habitual criminal statute?"
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2898.462,2911.963,The actual statement of the prosecutor in the record is that “is it not a fact that I told you if you did not intend to save the court the inconvenience and necessity of a trial and taking up this time that I intended to return to the grand jury and ask them to indict you based upon these prior felony convictions?”
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2919.1,2929.576,Does that imply that there was still an opportunity for the defendant to plead guilty and get a recommendation of the prosecutor of five years or was it too late?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2933.17,2934.211,I am sure.
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2934.211,2935.708,Those are two different cases?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2935.708,2937.624,"You are right, Your Honor and I say this."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2940.306,2942.616,When can it happen is my question?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2942.616,2959.7,"I am telling the Court, it is my understanding that the man was threatened after he turned down the original offer would be re-indicted as a habitual criminal and I am sure that had Mr. Hayes wanted to plead not guilty he would not have re-indicted him, but that was trying to make the threat work."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2959.7,2961.536,You do not mean if he wanted to plead not guilty?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2961.536,2963.721,"I mean, if he wanted to plead guilty, excuse me, he would have not --"
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2963.721,2966.352,And accept the bargain of a recommendation of a five-year sentence?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2966.352,2969.82,"Certainly, because that is threat, that is what he wanted to accomplish by the threat."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2969.82,2972.705,"My question is, factually, was there still an opportunity?"
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2983.318,2990.891,I would say that it was a punishment and a threat of punishment that could have been ameliorated by accepting the original bargain.
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2990.891,2992.425,That was still open to him?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,2992.425,2996.945,"I can speculate to that, yes, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2996.945,3000.25,Up here we do not generally have a dispute of facts.
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3002.864,3009.849,"Well, because Paul Lewis Hayes did not say “alright, let me plead guilty” the prosecutor never answered that question."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3021.175,3025.259,That is a different case than the one you presented?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3025.259,3041.101,"But I think the key point is that the intention was to make the threat work and if the threat worked by getting the man to plead guilty to the original charge, then he accomplished it and it was a penalty if the man continued to exercise his constitutional right."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3043.946,3048.459,What you just stated is always just describing plea bargaining generally?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3048.459,3058.405,"Well, Your honor, if I would just use the criteria that this court utilized in North Carolina v. Pearce and some of the other cases dealing with vindictiveness, you have always looked at these four major factors."
1977.76-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3071.039,3072.179,"Mr. Aprile, let me interrupt there."
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3109.649,3116.86,"Your Honor as this Court has recognized in many occasions, actual vindictiveness is normally very difficult to prove."
1977.76-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3117.241,3122.79,But could you not make a strong argument for the proposition that that would be actual vindictiveness?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3122.79,3125.044,"Yes, Your Honor, but again, it would be very difficult to prove."
1977.76-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.053,3135.073,It is overcharging in the sense that the prosecutor has no interest whatsoever in getting a conviction on the second charge.
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3136.947,3147.717,"But he can legitimately bring it, and therefore, what he does is he gives away a valid concession for his goal to get a guilty plea."
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3147.717,3156.645,"In this case, what we are saying is he already made an election that there was no interest of the state served by that habitual criminal statute indictment."
1977.76-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3156.645,3158.875,"Well, the same interest is served in both cases."
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3168.143,3178.957,Because the timing and the nature of the threat in the case is aimed at one thing and that is chilling the exercise of the constitutional right to plead not guilty and I think that if we look --
1977.76-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3178.957,3182.413,"Well, my case chills the constitutional right too."
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3205.381,3208.809,"You are getting inside the prosecutor’s mind, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3208.809,3209.861,I have made the assumption.
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3214.344,3222.908,"I understand that, but in one instance it was the original intention to prosecute the person under both charges at least --"
1977.76-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3222.908,3228.076,"In both cases, the intention is if you will plead guilty to the lesser charge, we will not prosecute on the other."
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3230.709,3242.035,"But there has been no attempt at that point by the defendant to exercise any right, and therefore, there is no retaliation that takes place for the exercise of the right to plead not guilty."
1977.76-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3274.233,3282.872,So what you are saying is that any inducement automatically becomes virtually a threat and a vindictive action?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3282.872,3286.514,"No, Your Honor, I certainly would not say that and I am sorry if I have misrepresented my position that way."
1977.76-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3286.514,3290.097,"No, I think misrepresentation is not the word."
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3291.966,3292.645,"No, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3292.645,3301.699,"What it ends up to is that when inducements are offered, if they are rejected, they are converted into threats?"
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3301.699,3302.079,"No, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3334.504,3337.393,Is that not true of every other plea bargain and it fails?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3337.393,3337.822,"No, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3382.905,3385.337,Then I come back to where I started.
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3397.238,3399.981,"I do not understand why it is a phyrric victory, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3401.547,3408.695,Because every prosecutor is going to indict all of your defendants on a habitual criminal charge?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3408.695,3421.943,"Well Your Honor as I understand the scenario that would follow if this court reversed and took the other position, then every prosecutor will not have to indict on a higher charge or an enhanced charge and he will still be able to threaten the same thing."
1977.76-1334,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3433.176,3437.452,"They are not only going to threaten, they are going to indict from here on in."
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3441.301,3455.704,But the position you are taking in this case would be that it would not make any difference whether he is indicted or not and that possibility of the re-indictment will always exist and will always be a valid type of leverage for the prosecutor to use.
1977.76-1334,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3474.026,3476.34,"Therefore, why leave it as an initial indictment?"
1977.76-1334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3482.61,3485.287,"Mr. Aprile, you keep saying re-indictment?"
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3485.287,3485.894,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3485.894,3489.636,"My brother Blackmun is not talking about a re-indictment, he is talking about original indictment?"
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3489.636,3491.073,"I understand that, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3493.204,3494.95,Let me put it separately.
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3505.041,3506.156,It has been four years.
1977.76-1334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3509.091,3513.639,I assume he will read the opinion of this Court?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3513.639,3527.532,"It is very obvious that they will charge, as most of them do in our state, they will go ahead and charge the habitual offender statute and it will be legitimate in that situation to offer concessions under that."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3606.792,3608.134,"What case is that, the Montana case in your brief?"
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3608.134,3609.66,"It is not cited in the brief, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3609.66,3610.528,Do you have a citation?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3610.528,3611.821,"Yes, I do."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3617.224,3617.63,Thank you.
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3617.63,3618.689,1977.
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3618.689,3620.005,1306?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3620.005,3622.171,"Yes, Your Honor, 564 Pacific 2nd."
1977.76-1334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3622.171,3625.075,Some states have abolished plea bargaining all together?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3625.075,3625.97,"That is true, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3685.963,3705.876,Would that still be here if the prosecutor says what he said here then gets the broader indictment after the defendant does not plead and then bargaining resumes?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3705.876,3726.174,"Obviously, there is a real question raised as to whether or not, in view of your trilogy, Brady, McMann, and that, if you inject the defense attorney’s aid and assistance into that bargaining under that situation then he enters a guilty plea, it may very well be that whatever coercion exists there could be cut off in a guilty plea."
1977.76-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3726.174,3734.933,Even though originally he had only a narrow indictment and he said “if you do not plead to his one I am going to get a broader one?”
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3734.933,3755.009,"As I stated in my brief, I believe that there is a distinct possibility that under McCree Brady v. United States where you noted that cognizable claim would be generated by a threat of additional prosecutions, that indeed it may very well be that in this circumstance you would have a coerced guilty plea."
1977.76-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3755.009,3760.951,"Well, if this situation had resulted in a guilty plea, the claim of coercion would still have been open?"
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3760.951,3762.092,"It would still be open, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3767.233,3780.921,In one district recently a study showed that there were great many cases where additional crimes were committed while the defendant was released on his own recognizance.
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3798.164,3798.548,"No, Your Honor."
1977.76-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3798.548,3800.182,Why not?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3801.228,3819.556,"I think the Sixth Circuit addressed this quite clearly and perhaps it has been a mistake on my part to not point this out, but always, the prosecutor is allowed, as under your decisions in Blackledge and North Carolina v. Pearce to demonstrate changes that account for why he did not obtain the original indictment."
1977.76-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3825.615,3832.126,He might have been able to get the indictments on the other charges before they reach the point of plea negotiations?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3832.126,3843.383,That would be perfectly acceptable because the original indictment could not have anticipated the subsequent conduct like your U.S. v. Paige analogy in North Carolina v. Pearce.
1977.76-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3850.179,3851.073,The Court did?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3851.073,3857.314,"I am sorry, that is correct."
1977.76-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3871.81,3881.164,Could I ask you if you would have a different position if there had never been any bargaining confrontations between the prosecutor and the defendant?
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3899.35,3908.85,"Yes, Your Honor, because of what we asked for in a way of the prophylactic rule where the Sixth Circuit recognized that there would be an apprehension generated in --"
1977.76-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3908.85,3916.711,"So the face-to-face confrontation and the oral threat as you call it, really is not determinative in the case?"
1977.76-1334,1,28760,j_vincent_aprile_ii,,3916.711,3918.859,"Yes Your Honor, it is determinative in two ways."
1977.76-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3933.203,3933.874,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
