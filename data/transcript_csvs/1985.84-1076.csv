1985.84-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,67.145,"Mr. Grower, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-1076,0,30660,john_marshall_grower,,67.145,71.049,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,200.17,204.809,"In other words, they couldn't sell it."
1985.84-1076,0,30660,john_marshall_grower,,204.809,206.09,"That is exactly right, Your Honor."
1985.84-1076,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,207.166,207.635,They could buy it.
1985.84-1076,0,30660,john_marshall_grower,,209.509,211.337,The pipe line is not the market.
1985.84-1076,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,349.517,355.828,"What is the effect of that state order, because I am not sure I understand it."
1985.84-1076,0,30660,john_marshall_grower,,366.339,375.585,"The effect of the order, Justice O'Connor, was to increase... take or pay payment for one thing."
1985.84-1076,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,382.379,386.829,"Well, if you could answer my question it would help me understand your response."
1985.84-1076,0,30660,john_marshall_grower,,399.825,405.464,The effect of it was to ultimately require the taking of more gas.
1985.84-1076,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,459.599,478.386,"Well, right now, I suppose, the court below remanded for a determination of what price ultimately would have to be paid for these other pool owners, so we don't even know what it would cost ultimately, I gather."
1985.84-1076,0,30660,john_marshall_grower,,478.386,482.261,"Your Honor, we know what it would cost from this standpoint."
1985.84-1076,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,499.269,520.557,"Well, maybe I misunderstand the order, but I thought that to the extent that the state interfered with your arrangement, it was on behalf of the other owners of the common pool and that the amount to be paid then was not the amount to be paid Getty under the contract--"
1985.84-1076,0,30660,john_marshall_grower,,520.557,521.135,"That is right, Your Honor."
1985.84-1076,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,521.135,527.18,--but some reasonable rate based on present or then current market.
1985.84-1076,0,30660,john_marshall_grower,,527.18,528.413,"That is right, Your Honor."
1985.84-1076,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,542.94,545.344,"Mr. Grower, what is a take or pay?"
1985.84-1076,0,30660,john_marshall_grower,,545.344,588.811,"Take or pay obligation is... For instance, in these contracts that were made after the NGPA when there was a severe shortage in the pipe lines needed gas supply, under their contract made in that context, they were required to purchase from 85 to 90 percent of the deliverability of those wells and if they did not purchase 85 or 90 percent, whichever the figure was in the contract, they would then have to pay... in a particular year, they would then have to pay for the gas not taken in addition to the gas taken."
1985.84-1076,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,609.943,613.239,"So, it can be recouped only by taking more than 85 percent?"
1985.84-1076,0,30660,john_marshall_grower,,613.239,616.145,Only by taking more than 85 percent.
1985.84-1076,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.51,640.383,"Well, what are today's market conditions compared to what they were when this problem arose?"
1985.84-1076,0,30660,john_marshall_grower,,640.383,643.507,"Well, it has gotten worse, it has gotten worse."
1985.84-1076,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,658.142,661.953,Incurred.
1985.84-1076,0,30660,john_marshall_grower,,667.294,668.059,All right.
1985.84-1076,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1057.669,1061.543,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1076,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1215.138,1217.949,Would you fit this under the fraud or abuse section?
1985.84-1076,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1217.949,1222.089,--I don't know if... My point is the power exists.
1985.84-1076,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1227.414,1230.272,The power only exists if it does amount to that.
1985.84-1076,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1230.272,1234.412,"--Well, the power to impose denial to pass through exists."
1985.84-1076,2,26173,glenn_gates_taylor,,1571.135,1574.259,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1076,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1818.628,1822.346,"But, Mr. Taylor, as I understand this case, the conservation power is not implicated."
1985.84-1076,2,26173,glenn_gates_taylor,,1825.08,1825.955,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1076,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1825.955,1827.735,"They just relied on fairness, didn't they?"
1985.84-1076,2,26173,glenn_gates_taylor,,1827.735,1833.622,The unfairness was that because of these discriminatory takes drainage would result.
1985.84-1076,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1841.698,1846.821,"And, they expressly disclaimed, did they not, reliance on conservation as the motivating force for the regulation?"
1985.84-1076,2,26173,glenn_gates_taylor,,1846.821,1848.726,"No, Your Honor, they did not."
1985.84-1076,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1913.841,1926.633,"Mr. Taylor, Justice Stevens asked you a couple of moments ago whether the Supreme Court of Mississippi hadn't disclaimed reliance upon the conservation element."
1985.84-1076,2,26173,glenn_gates_taylor,,1966.055,1966.352,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1076,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1967.008,1971.084,Is there some place else where they say that it is conservation?
1985.84-1076,2,26173,glenn_gates_taylor,,1971.084,1971.49,"--Yes, sir."
1985.84-1076,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1999.463,2000.995,Is that a conservation concern?
1985.84-1076,2,26173,glenn_gates_taylor,,2000.995,2003.525,Absolutely it is a conservation concern for this reason.
1985.84-1076,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2003.525,2007.304,"We are just not talking about the same thing, I guess."
1985.84-1076,2,26173,glenn_gates_taylor,,2007.304,2008.179,"Your Honor, we are."
1985.84-1076,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2060.361,2065.375,"Mr. Taylor, it seems to me that you are arguing fair share, not conservation at all."
1985.84-1076,2,26173,glenn_gates_taylor,,2065.375,2068.92,They are part and parcel of the same thing.
1985.84-1076,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2087.427,2095.019,"You may deem that conservation, but it doesn't sound like the Mississippi Supreme Court thought that, what conservation was."
1985.84-1076,2,26173,glenn_gates_taylor,,2095.019,2096.205,"Your Honor, they did."
1985.84-1076,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2110.809,2114.339,"Mr. Taylor, your definition is quite different from the Mississippi Supreme Court."
1985.84-1076,2,26173,glenn_gates_taylor,,2129.411,2130.505,"--But, if you don't--"
1985.84-1076,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2130.505,2131.083,Do you disagree with that?
1985.84-1076,2,26173,glenn_gates_taylor,,2131.083,2149.372,"--I don't disagree with that but you have got to read the tail end of the opinion in which... First, they consider the constitutional questions, then they move to the legitimate state interest in connection with the commerce clause and there is no way to separate... Waste is defined under Mississippi law as the non-ratable or disproportionate taking of gas so as to cause drainage."
1985.84-1076,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2174.799,2180.515,"That is only drainage as among owners, not drainage which would result in waste."
1985.84-1076,2,26173,glenn_gates_taylor,,2180.515,2181.327,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1076,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2332.375,2340.138,"I am a little slower, I think, perhaps than you are, but I think you are arguing just commerce now and not pre-emption at all."
1985.84-1076,2,26173,glenn_gates_taylor,,2340.138,2342.293,--That is what I am bringing it all down to.
1985.84-1076,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2342.574,2344.651,Do you think the two arguments merge or are quite the same?
1985.84-1076,2,26173,glenn_gates_taylor,,2347.415,2348.978,--Peerless had nothing to do with it.
1985.84-1076,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2727.375,2735.277,Mr. Noble?
1985.84-1076,3,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2735.277,2738.65,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1076,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2928.528,2930.728,That is even though there is no contract?
1985.84-1076,3,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,2930.728,2934.352,"--That is if there is no contract, that is correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1076,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3072.594,3073.547,May I ask you one question?
1985.84-1076,3,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,3086.369,3086.791,"--No, sir."
1985.84-1076,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3086.791,3090.649,You can have a price discrimination and there is no state problem with--
1985.84-1076,3,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,3090.649,3091.196,That is right.
1985.84-1076,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3109.968,3115.982,"--Well, does it at least insist that the price paid to the non-contract purchaser be the fair market price?"
1985.84-1076,3,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,3115.982,3122.448,"If there is no contract, there is no take or pay."
1985.84-1076,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3122.448,3131.632,"I understand, but could they... Say the market price is $1.00 a thousand cubic feet or whatever it might be, could they just pay a nickel and would that satisfy the--"
1985.84-1076,3,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,3131.632,3132.82,"No, sir."
1985.84-1076,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3159.043,3165.04,"--Well, the Supreme Court of Mississippi remanded the case to the trial court for determination of that issue, didn't it?"
1985.84-1076,3,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,3165.04,3166.571,"It did, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1076,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3166.571,3171.413,"So, we really don't know what price will finally be determined by the Mississippi State Court."
1985.84-1076,3,22902,ed_davis_noble_jr,,3171.413,3174.224,"That is correct, sir."
1985.84-1076,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3287.35,3291.771,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Grower?"
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3291.771,3295.301,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I am afraid I do."
1985.84-1076,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3335.442,3348.467,Why should the validity of the state's ratable take policy turn on the fortuity of whether your company enters into a take or pay contract?
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3348.467,3364.804,"Justice O'Connor, the take or pay contract has been a part of the regulatory scheme for almost 50 years, since 1938 when the NGA came into effect."
1985.84-1076,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3383.782,3394.323,"But, you are not required today, are you, to enter into a take or pay contract for this kind of gas by any federal requirement that you do so?"
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3394.323,3409.209,"Your Honor, that is correct, but at the time these contracts were entered into it was still part of the regulatory scheme recognized by the FERC and they had regulations dealing with the manner in which take or pay, the costs were passed on to the consumer."
1985.84-1076,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3409.209,3417.768,"Well, would the question be different here if these contracts, these take or pay contracts had been entered after the time that the FERC ceased to require them?"
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3417.768,3438.525,"Well, if these contracts had no take or pay obligation, then there would be nothing to prevent the pipe line, if they had no minimum take requirements... You also may have minimum take requirements which require you to buy a certain amount of gas or pay for it, period, with no right to ever recoup it."
1985.84-1076,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3447.771,3457.111,What if they had take or pay contracts and there were clauses that were voluntarily entered into by the pipe line without any requirement that it do so from the federal government.
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3457.111,3470.543,"Well, if the Court please, the take or pay problem today has been made a serious problem because of the extreme prices we have in the market."
1985.84-1076,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3470.543,3471.479,Are you trying to answer my question?
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3471.479,3472.823,"Yes, sir, I am."
1985.84-1076,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3494.736,3503.764,My question to you was if there were take or pay contracts voluntarily entered into by the pipe line company without any requirement they do so from the federal government.
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3503.764,3505.809,"Well, yes."
1985.84-1076,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3509.871,3513.479,"What do you mean, part of the regulatory scheme if it is not a requirement?"
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3513.479,3520.196,--It has been recognized as part of the regulatory scheme because the producers wanted to be assured that they would have a share of the market.
1985.84-1076,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3520.196,3522.241,"So, all you are saying is it was permitted?"
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3522.241,3534.049,It was permitted because the producers wanted a share of the market and there would be no reason for a producer to enter into a contract without some minimum take obligations because they would never have any assurance that the gas would ever be produced.
1985.84-1076,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3541.483,3544.466,Your time has expired.
1985.84-1076,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3544.466,3546.481,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I ask a question?"
1985.84-1076,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3546.481,3546.902,Yes.
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3549.262,3549.619,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1076,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3549.619,3553.541,"I think you undoubtedly, counsel, have answered this, but I am not entirely clear about it."
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3569.348,3572.331,It removes the price regulations.
1985.84-1076,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3572.331,3573.128,Well--
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3573.128,3590.433,"It removes the price regulation, but it does not remove the regulation over the pipe line concerning the transportation and resale of that gas in interstate commerce and this was made clear, if the Court please, in Mid-Louisiana by Justice Stevens."
1985.84-1076,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3590.433,3604.865,"--The Solicitor General's brief says the NGPA makes clear that Congress, in removing certain well head sales from the Commission's regulatory jurisdiction, intended that they be deregulated."
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3604.865,3606.568,As to price.
1985.84-1076,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3607.629,3610.112,"Well, it doesn't say anything at this point in the brief about the price."
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3610.112,3610.581,It changed--
1985.84-1076,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3610.581,3612.55,Let me follow up with another question.
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3612.55,3612.877,"--Yes, sir."
1985.84-1076,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3612.877,3622.451,"If it is deregulated, is it your position the state has no authority whatever to regulate this gas?"
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3622.451,3623.545,"Yes, sir, and that has been so held."
1985.84-1076,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3623.545,3629.386,"Well, will that result in Transco being able to drain gas--"
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3629.386,3630.683,"No, sir."
1985.84-1076,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3630.683,3633.432,--as it has been done in the past?
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3633.432,3634.042,"No, sir."
1985.84-1076,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3634.042,3635.337,Who will control that?
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3635.337,3639.664,The state still controls that because they control what can be produced by these wells.
1985.84-1076,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3644.724,3652.581,"If the ratable take rule doesn't apply, what will keep Transco from taking gas only from parties with whom it had contracts?"
1985.84-1076,4,30660,john_marshall_grower,,3652.581,3657.906,Transco does not determine how much gas is delivered to it.
1985.84-1076,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3714.305,3717.601,May I repeat it once more?
