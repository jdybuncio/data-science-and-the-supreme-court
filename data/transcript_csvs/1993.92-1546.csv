1993.92-1546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.039,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 92-1546, United States v. John Irvine and First Trust National Association."
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,11.949,15.521,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-1546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,212.561,214.001,"What section are we talking about here, Mr. Jones?"
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,214.001,215.454,What section of the Internal Revenue Code?
1993.92-1546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,215.454,226.399,"Yes, where... that the court of appeals relied on, the fact that it was not created by that particular date."
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,226.399,252.657,"The section of the code that is relevant would be section 2511, but I think that the answer to your question is that in the enactment of the Federal gift tax there was a provision that says that this statute will not apply to any transfer prior to the date of enactment, and so it was that retroactive... it was that feature of the statute that the court had in mind."
1993.92-1546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,252.657,258.75,"Well, the Eighth Circuit also relied on one section or subsection that talked about something being a taxable transfer, didn't it?"
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,258.75,263.035,"Well, that was a different portion of the court's rationale that I haven't yet discussed."
1993.92-1546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,263.035,263.973,Okay.
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,264.654,265.285,"Yes, sir."
1993.92-1546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.285,265.976,Okay.
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,265.976,275.961,"At this point, what I'm pointing out is that the court's analysis ultimately rests upon its acceptance of a legal fiction about disclaimers."
1993.92-1546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,322.473,330.808,"But under State law principles, it would be treated as having occurred back in 1917?"
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,330.808,332.419,That is correct.
1993.92-1546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,338.773,350.45,"And in Jewett, did this Court indicate, the majority, that State law supplies the answer in cases before the promulgation of the 1958 regulation?"
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,350.45,370.235,"No, to the contrary, the Court held in Jewett that a disclaimer represents an indirect transfer and then looked to the regulation to determine the limitations on that analysis that the Secretary had reached in issuing the interpretive regulation that was in effect at that time."
1993.92-1546,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,370.235,379.151,Do you take the position that in light of Jewett there is no way that the court of appeals judgment here can be affirmed?
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,379.151,385.767,"I think Jewett and Jacobs, read together, answer all the questions in this case."
1993.92-1546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,421.378,425.792,"In your view, when did the taxable transfer take place?"
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,425.792,436.348,"Well, the transfer that is subject to tax in this case occurred in 1979, when Mrs. Irvine made a disclaimer."
1993.92-1546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,436.348,440.552,When did the taxable transfer within the meaning of the regulation take place?
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,440.552,450.59,"Within the specific words of the regulation, the taxable transfer referred to in the regulation is the initial, completed gift."
1993.92-1546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,450.59,453.441,So that's 1917?
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,453.441,456.522,"That would have been in 1917, with the gift in trust."
1993.92-1546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,456.522,464.257,So is it necessary for your case to say that the 1917 creation of the trust was a taxable transfer?
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,464.257,466.771,It is not necessary for our case.
1993.92-1546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,466.771,469.713,Is that your number 1 line of defense?
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,469.713,471.063,"No, not really."
1993.92-1546,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,535.08,536.52,May I just ask you a question there?
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,545.725,550.319,"--I thought I... well, I thought I said regardless of whether a tax is imposed, but--"
1993.92-1546,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,550.319,551.729,I thought you said was.
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,572.796,584.743,"--We... respondents properly took us to task for having a citation mistake at that page of our brief, and we discussed that citation mistake in our reply brief."
1993.92-1546,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,584.743,586.693,"The language came out of Ordway, is that correct?"
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,586.693,587.304,Yes.
1993.92-1546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,613.531,620.276,"I'm still not sure when, in your view, the taxable transfer within the meaning of the regulation took place."
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,620.276,623.348,Within the meaning of the regulation there are two relevant transfers.
1993.92-1546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,651.707,654.63,And in your view that is 1917?
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,654.63,676.365,"That was in 1917, and we know... the phrase, completed gift, comes out of this Court's decisions in Burnet v. Guggenheim and cases of that type, and what it... the completed gift is a gift made when the donor has parted with all control and dominion over the property, which Mr. Ordway did in 1917."
1993.92-1546,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,676.365,683.049,Do you still... do you take the position here that the disclaimer had to be made prior to the enactment of the gift tax?
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,683.049,690.063,"To be subject to tax, the disclaimer would have to be made after the date of the gift tax."
1993.92-1546,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,690.063,705.904,"No, but for the disclaimer to be effective to avoid the tax on this transfer, Mrs.... whatever her name was's transfer, do you take the position that she was required to make that disclaimer prior to 1932?"
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,705.904,713.971,"In all likelihood, we would take that position if the issue had arisen, but I want to amplify that in two ways."
1993.92-1546,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,713.971,718.222,"That was the position that the IRS took below, wasn't it?"
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,718.222,719.975,It was an answer to a hypothetical question.
1993.92-1546,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,719.975,727.689,"Is it an academic question, because in fact she did not disclaim after the gift tax came into effect?"
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,727.689,728.32,Yes.
1993.92-1546,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,729.64,736.296,"So you don't have to answer the question whether, and suppose she had done it in 1933 or 1934, because she didn't do it till '79."
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,736.296,743.923,"No, we don't have to answer that question here, because here we have a full half century that passed between the time she reached her age of majority and the time that she disclaimed."
1993.92-1546,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,743.923,747.846,Would you agree that if she had done it within a reasonable time of reaching her majority--
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,747.846,748.637,"Oh, yes."
1993.92-1546,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,748.637,749.268,--that that would have sufficed?
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,749.268,750.177,Yes.
1993.92-1546,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,766.089,768.69,But possibly it was unconstitutional not to give her the extra 3 years.
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,769.541,773.822,--I don't have any views on that.
1993.92-1546,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,773.822,775.114,You can concede that.
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,775.114,779.947,But I just want to point out that there isn't anything odd--
1993.92-1546,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,779.947,791.166,"Well, there's a decision of this Court... Stanton, I think v. Utah... that suggests that the differential in age of majority might be unconstitutional."
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,791.166,794.686,--I accept that fully.
1993.92-1546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,794.686,798.74,"Alternatively, it might be unconstitutional to give the men 3 more years."
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,800.392,801.982,I would leave that to you.
1993.92-1546,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,801.982,803.532,We'll argue--
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,803.532,814.631,"I really don't have an opinion on that at this time, but I wanted to point out in response to Justice Souter that there's nothing odd about saying that for her to make a tax-free disclaimer it might have been necessary to do it before the gift tax was enacted."
1993.92-1546,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,833.415,855.911,"--But the argument that's being made is that the disclaimer in effect precludes her acceptance of the gift in the first place, and if the reason she wants to preclude the acceptance is to avoid the gift tax, then it would be sort of unreasonable to say that she was required to make that act of refusal prior to the enactment of the tax which she's trying to avoid."
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,855.911,864.376,--There have been no cases that have really been at the border that test the... how you decide what a reasonable time is.
1993.92-1546,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,864.376,872.4,"But you could concede that if she did it a reasonable time from the effective date of the gift tax, that would be a different case."
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,872.4,876.414,"It might be a different case, but I doubt that we would take that position."
1993.92-1546,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,929.79,941.376,"So your position is it shouldn't be a decision driven by tax consequences, that what you're looking to see is if this person was... exercised control, or--"
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,941.376,949.053,"That is absolutely correct, because there's no... the gift tax doesn't apply only when it's a substitute for estate planning."
1993.92-1546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.053,952.055,"--Well, it can be driven by tax purposes."
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,965.724,967.056,As long as--
1993.92-1546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,967.056,968.305,You're just saying--
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,968.305,969.016,--As long--
1993.92-1546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,969.016,972.178,"--you shouldn't accept it first, and you accept it automatically if too much time passes."
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,972.178,976.56,--That is the analysis of the regulations which seems appropriate.
1993.92-1546,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,976.56,987.168,"Now, leaving aside the question of when the reasonable time would come, your position would be the same whether the reg... what is it, 2511... applies or not."
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,987.168,990.871,"Absolutely, and I do want to emphasize that point."
1993.92-1546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1061.249,1064.681,What precise regulation are we talking about here?
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1064.681,1072.846,The 1986 Treasury gift tax regulations in 26 C.F.R. 2511-1(c).
1993.92-1546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1072.846,1073.968,And where do we find that in the brief?
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1073.968,1080.703,"Those are quoted in full, both the '58 and '86 versions are quoted in the appendix to the petition in full."
1993.92-1546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1080.703,1083.064,At page 62-A in the petition?
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1083.995,1085.497,That's one of the pages.
1993.92-1546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1087.959,1094.134,"So you're just talking about interpretive regulations en bloc, kind of, here, if you're talking about two or three pages."
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1096.865,1097.596,"No, sir."
1993.92-1546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1122.853,1128.467,"And the term, transfer, refers to taxable transfers, which is the beginning phrase of that sentence?"
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1128.467,1147.367,"That is absolutely correct, and the definition of the phrase, taxable transfer, is contained in the cross-reference provisions of section 2518 of the regulations, and those, Chief Justice Rehnquist, are quoted at the beginning of our merits brief on page 2, where it says,"
1993.92-1546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1178.97,1189.418,"It seems to me a little odd to say a gift tax imposed or not imposed can be meaningfully applied in 1917, when there was no gift tax at all."
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1189.418,1206.939,"--It isn't the most felicitous phrasing... I'm not suggesting that it is... but it is phrasing that has been clearly articulated in the regulation to have this specific meaning, and I think there's a historical explanation for why they used this perhaps awkward term."
1993.92-1546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1239.891,1247.415,"Well, what would happen if we decided that this regulation was not applicable to her because it was not a taxable transfer?"
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1253.93,1257.673,"For two reasons, she would still... the transfer would be subject to tax."
1993.92-1546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1298.509,1306.154,"--Mr. Jones, you're relying on the definition of taxable transfer contained in 2518-2(c)(3)."
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1306.154,1307.846,"I think that's the right number, yes, sir."
1993.92-1546,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1307.846,1339.398,"But the problem with that definition is that it's... it really only applies to transfers or disclaimers that are made after 1976, transfers creating an interest in the person disclaiming that are made after 1976, so technically that... I mean, you may argue that it applies by analogy, but it seems to me you can't argue that it applies strictly speaking."
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1339.398,1356.9,I think what I mean to say in connection with that is that the history of the regulations as adopted leaves it clear that the terms were used in the same manner in both--
1993.92-1546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1356.9,1357.481,All right--
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1357.481,1358.252,--sets of regulations.
1993.92-1546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1358.252,1368.436,--but you don't... you do not assert that 2518-2(c)(3) defines the meaning of taxable transfer in 2511?
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1368.436,1372.209,In 2518 it defines it for purposes of 2518.
1993.92-1546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1372.209,1373.569,"Right, and you're saying--"
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1373.569,1374.21,And the same--
1993.92-1546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.21,1378.685,"--we can assume that it has the same meaning, although that definition doesn't technically cover 2511?"
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1378.685,1381.957,--Most of it does.
1993.92-1546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1381.957,1384.448,Most of it does.
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1384.448,1385.509,All of it except the date.
1993.92-1546,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.509,1387.741,It does not cover it to the extent that this case here is involved.
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1387.741,1390.452,"Well, it covers it to the extent of this case here."
1993.92-1546,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1396.887,1397.866,Okay.
1993.92-1546,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1415.917,1423.624,"That is our argument, and the facts of this case are really, I mean, perhaps one of the strongest settings in which this issue could arise."
1993.92-1546,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1450.962,1452.534,"Very well, Mr. Jones."
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1454.625,1456.936,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1546,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1495.033,1496.045,You're not contending--
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1496.045,1496.545,--of those beneficiaries.
1993.92-1546,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1496.545,1500.318,--that it didn't have value because it was continent... could have been valued?
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1500.318,1502.068,"We're not contending that it didn't have value, no."
1993.92-1546,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1514.168,1519.209,So she had something that she was capable of conveying or relinquishing.
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1519.209,1520.19,She had something.
1993.92-1546,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1530.716,1546.768,"If you don't exercise that right until decades later, then aren't you holding the control rein in the interim, as you would not if you relinquished control within... if you said, no I don't want it, within a reasonable time."
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1546.768,1550.381,"Well, I think the passage of time is also misleading."
1993.92-1546,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1597.624,1602.465,"When did she first become entitled to receive the income, at what age?"
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1602.465,1604.497,1966.
1993.92-1546,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1606.259,1607.12,1966.
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1607.12,1610.932,"1966, yes, on the death of her father."
1993.92-1546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1610.932,1616.506,"Mr. Martin, on the timing, can I ask you one question?"
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1631.147,1636.57,"I think under the rule of Brown v. Routzahn, she definitely... we definitely would have prevailed."
1993.92-1546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1643.916,1646.097,Assume also Jewett had been decided at that time.
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1646.097,1647.837,The--
1993.92-1546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.837,1648.588,Assume it's correct.
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1653.621,1654.933,"--Well, yes, Justice Stevens--"
1993.92-1546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1654.933,1655.714,--avoiding the tax?
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1655.714,1656.533,--she would.
1993.92-1546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.322,1674.825,"In other words, you really... this is a question of whether Jewett is retroactive or not, I guess."
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1674.825,1676.087,It's a question of whether--
1993.92-1546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1676.087,1677.697,The basic position--
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1677.697,1679.058,--it's a question of whether the gift tax was--
1993.92-1546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1679.058,1681.39,"--The basic position is inconsistent with Jewett, and maybe Jewett's wrong."
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1690.006,1691.946,--That's exactly what we do say.
1993.92-1546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.946,1692.928,Yes.
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1692.928,1703.744,"In Jewett... in Jewett, they acknowledge that Brown v. Routzahn not only controlled that state law was controlling, but they also said that State law was controlling as to the timeliness."
1993.92-1546,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1706.845,1710.859,"Help me out on that, will you, and I should know this, but I'm not sure."
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1732.815,1752.186,"The effectiveness... as we use the term effectiveness in our brief, we're talking about an effective disclaimer for tax purposes, one that is recognized by the tax law as being a refusal to accept property."
1993.92-1546,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1752.186,1755.037,"But that is, of course, ultimately a Federal question."
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1755.037,1783.677,"That is ultimately a Federal question, and the question is whether, when Congress enacted the Gift Tax Act in 1932, did they intend to disturb the preexisting rights under existing instruments such as Mrs. Irvine had under the Lucius Ordway Trust, or did they intend to apply a brand new rule which, as Justice Stevens pointed out, this Court interpreted in Jewett."
1993.92-1546,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1799.046,1815.949,"It's not at all unusual that you have one set of consequences for State law purposes, a transaction is regarded as one way, this is retroactive for State law purposes so creditors can't reach it, and a different result for Federal income tax purposes."
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1817.269,1818.02,That's--
1993.92-1546,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1818.02,1818.691,--quite common.
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1818.691,1821.893,"--That's right, it is not unusual, and we're not saying that that's the difference here."
1993.92-1546,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1832.941,1833.77,But isn't it applied when--
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1833.77,1834.721,--to disturb the existing rules.
1993.92-1546,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1834.721,1840.325,--there's no... nothing retroactive to the original donor?
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1847.541,1858.52,"That's right, but the right that Mrs. Irvine took in 1979 was based on a right that was existent back in... when the trust was created."
1993.92-1546,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1911.185,1928.438,"Well, it seems to me the question is not whether they intended to be retroactive in 1932, but rather whether they intended, in 1932, to have State law govern at all for the purposes of whether there is a subsequent transfer, a subsequent gift."
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1928.438,1929.387,I think the question--
1993.92-1546,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.387,1936.113,"If they did not intend State law to govern at all when they enacted it in 1932, then there's nothing retroactive, right?"
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1936.113,1938.125,"--Well, that's right, Your Honor."
1993.92-1546,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1955.847,1957.256,Jewett said it was wrong.
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,1957.256,1964.371,Jewett said it was wrong... Jewett was interpreting the 1958 regulation.
1993.92-1546,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2052.183,2056.103,Where does that leave us as to the governing principle in this case?
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,2056.103,2060.016,"--Well, I think it leaves us back with where we were, where we started."
1993.92-1546,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2083.973,2088.868,Is there any indication in this record why it was five-sixteenths?
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,2088.868,2090.728,There is not... none.
1993.92-1546,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2184.271,2200.171,"You'd be on the same footing with Jewett, I suppose, if we took the position that her right to disclaim within a reasonable time was a right to do so within a reasonable time either of the enactment of the statute or of her attainment of majority."
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,2203.554,2207.137,"--I'm sorry, Justice Souter, I did not follow that."
1993.92-1546,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2207.137,2230.562,"I say, if we took the position that she had a reasonable... that she had a right to disclaim within a reasonable time, and that that time would be calculated either from the date of the enactment of the gift tax statute or from the date she attained her majority, that would put you in the same boat as the taxpayer in Jewett, wouldn't it?"
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,2230.562,2237.705,"The... well, I'm sorry, I must be missing something here."
1993.92-1546,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2237.705,2245.97,"Well, the... if we take the position... I guess you can have two arguments here, and I was assuming you were making one and maybe you're making the other one."
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,2291.771,2294.002,"Well, actually, Your Honor, we're making both arguments."
1993.92-1546,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2294.002,2294.543,Okay.
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,2318.499,2330.426,Which really is saying that there was some kind of a hidden grace period in the enactment of the Gift Tax Act to permit disclaimers even though the reasonable time had already expired.
1993.92-1546,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2330.426,2346.707,"Well, it's saying that reasonable time is to be determined with respect to the point of the disclaimer, and if the point of the disclaimer is tax planning, then reasonable time certainly couldn't start running before there was any tax."
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,2346.707,2356.984,"But in this case, the Government has conceded, has acknowledged that under their position of the case her right to disclaim expired before the enactment of the gift tax."
1993.92-1546,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2356.984,2359.855,I think Mr. Jones said it was an academic question.
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,2362.077,2386.244,"I'm... I'm relating what the Government conceded at oral argument in the Eighth Circuit, Justice Ginsburg, but that's right, he did... he did say that it would be academic, but I don't know that it is academic, because it points out the problem with the statutory construction here, that we have a statute which would apply to--"
1993.92-1546,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2386.244,2404.616,"Well, the Court could take the position, could it not, that even if there had to be... if the reasonable time had to run from the date the gift tax took effect, even if that were so, it wouldn't make any difference because here the disclaimer came over 40 years later."
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,2404.616,2415.823,"--Well, it... but that's the point, that she would never have had any notification that she was expected to disclaim at the time the gift tax was enacted."
1993.92-1546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2415.823,2423.46,"Isn't there an intermediate position, Mr. Martin, that... she began to get income in 1966, as I remember the facts--"
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,2423.46,2424.281,That's right.
1993.92-1546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2424.281,2426.985,"--when her father died, and she... and substantial income."
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,2433.157,2437.11,"Well, but, Justice Stevens, the Government acknowledges the fact--"
1993.92-1546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2437.11,2438.542,And I know the Government doesn't take that position at all.
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,2438.542,2442.593,"--Well, they not only don't take that... they've acknowledged that there is no acceptance here."
1993.92-1546,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2521.437,2526.028,"Mr. Martin, you're dead right that you've called our attention to things that were not before us at the time of Jewett."
1993.92-1546,1,38155,phillip_h_martin,,2541.399,2551.394,"--Well, I don't think that was true at all in the 1966 private letter ruling, where we had an inter vivos trust that was created in 1933."
1993.92-1546,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2633.099,2635.601,"Thank you, Mr. Martin."
1993.92-1546,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2637.461,2646.486,"With respect to the 1966 letter ruling that was just referred to, we've discussed this in our brief."
1993.92-1546,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2743.312,2748.214,I don't know why an effective disclaimer doesn't exercise effective control over the property anyway.
1993.92-1546,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2758.041,2760.863,You're saying a disclaimer made within a reasonable time.
1993.92-1546,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2782.826,2786.479,I understand Justice Scalia to be suggesting the Commissioner's giving away the Government's money when he does that.
1993.92-1546,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2786.479,2795.385,--I think that what the Commissioner is attempting to do is not to give away the Government's money but to come up with a sensible approach to this scheme.
1993.92-1546,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2815.459,2818.153,Why did Congress agree with it if it was wrong?
1993.92-1546,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2818.153,2822.865,"Well, I believe it also reflects that it was sensible and correct."
1993.92-1546,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2822.865,2834.453,"And I suppose there's no largesse involved, unless we assume that the Commissioner could redefine the very concept of gift in a way which certainly is not suggested by any act of Congress."
1993.92-1546,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,2834.453,2838.886,"Well, what's really at issue here is, when was the property transferred?"
1993.92-1546,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2853.375,2855.847,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
