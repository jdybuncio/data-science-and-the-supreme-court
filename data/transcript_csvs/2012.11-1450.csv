2012.11-1450,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.904,"We will hear argument next in Case 11-1450, the Standard Fire Insurance Company v. Knowles."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,7.92,10.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1450,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,57.77,63.906,Would your position be the same if the issue were not the amount sought but rather the substantive claims?
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,82.635,83.787,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
2012.11-1450,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,111.904,116.208,"Well, but you do seem to have a difficulty with your position about how far it goes."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,146.144,149.012,"That's really how it's been done, Your Honor, from day one."
2012.11-1450,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,163.356,180.882,"Yes, but under the traditional -- you surely don't want us to apply the rules of the traditional diversity statute to this case, because it's clear that under the traditional diversity statute, you -- you can waive excessive damages, right?"
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,180.882,181.651,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-1450,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,182.068,184.02,So you don't want us to apply that rule here.
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,184.02,194.458,"--I don't want you to apply that rule, Your Honor, because that rule applies to the individual who brings his own case in court and can say: I want to come into court and collect less than the amount that would give Federal jurisdiction."
2012.11-1450,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,201.195,210.051,"Well, why doesn't -- why doesn't the normal class certification process protect adequately the absent class members?"
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,221.876,228.464,"It wouldn't protect it -- protect from the problems and abuses that Congress was concerned about, Your Honor, and that are occurring here."
2012.11-1450,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,228.464,229.364,You haven't answered.
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,239.504,241.356,"It could be, Your Honor."
2012.11-1450,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,245.491,250.462,"And then they would get removed to the Federal court, which is what the statute was intended to do."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,250.462,263.52,"--But what Congress was concerned about in the text of the statute, and the Senate report makes this very clear, that with all the abuses that occur in the interim, discovery that has nothing to do with the case -- the discovery here goes back 10 years."
2012.11-1450,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,265.722,269.975,"Well, discovery vis a vis the certification of the class is going to happen anyway."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,310.85,312.118,--Your Honor -- excuse me.
2012.11-1450,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,340.37,343.738,You say what Congress is concerned about and point to the Senate report.
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,382.797,397.639,"--Your Honor, I think the text does take away the St. Paul rule that an individual can control what he seeks and go where he desires and do what he wants, or she, because it points to the claims of the individual class members and the text Congress could expect--"
2012.11-1450,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,397.639,399.222,"Well, if I said to you, Mr. Boutrous"
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,416.351,425.357,"--Well, Your Honor, I would think that I would answer you that it's worth as much as I can possibly obtain in court if I was seeking to adequately represent the class."
2012.11-1450,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,427.726,447.055,"Do you think that the word “ claim ” is not -- when you say Joe made a claim for $100,000, a claim is not what he asked for, but is instead some kind of law professor's view of what the best thing that he could have asked for?"
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,447.055,460.03,"--Your Honor, we've cited the Tohono O'odham Nation case, where the Court interpreted the word “ claim ” and said when a statute uses the word “ claim ” regarding claims that have not been brought, it's the operative facts and the right to recovery, not the demand."
2012.11-1450,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,461.815,468.969,"Mr. Boutrous, I thought at least as an alternative argument, you're saying: The statute itself is silent."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,526.055,527.488,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's absolutely right."
2012.11-1450,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,534.994,538.879,But he doesn't have power to affect those claims before the certification has happened.
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,538.879,539.696,--Exactly.
2012.11-1450,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,539.696,541.981,"Before the certification has happened, they can do whatever they want."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,570.048,575.202,"Your Honor, that's -- Smith v. Bayer says the plaintiff can't bind the class."
2012.11-1450,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,598.584,600.353,This is what I -- could you go back--
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,600.353,600.669,Yes.
2012.11-1450,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,600.669,602.805,--to Justice Kagan's first question?
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,683.673,688.975,"Your Honor, it's the other part that is extremely important, section 1332(d)(6)."
2012.11-1450,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,706.068,722.762,"As to what that looks like, “ shall be aggregated ”, again from the language, is it simply to make certain that Zahn does not require the individual thing to approach -- to count."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,729.999,738.938,"--Well, Justice Breyer, Congress could have said we're just getting rid of Zahn, or it could have said the aggregate amount being sought by the named plaintiff is going to take control."
2012.11-1450,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,739.738,744.259,"No, they rarely pass a statute that says: Let's just get rid of case X."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,777.647,780.182,"--It's really not the word “ aggregation ”, Your Honor."
2012.11-1450,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,807.313,815.4,"Mr. Boutrous, that form of argument -- Congress could have said -- does seem to me to be much worse for your position."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,831.461,835.213,"--Your Honor, it really goes to a fundamental issue of what a class action is."
2012.11-1450,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,849.806,872.838,"Let's get back to the Chief Justice's question, because there are a thousand ways in which we let the named plaintiff prior to certification construct a case, and then we ask, as Justice Sotomayor said, later we ask, is the way he's constructed a case adequate or not, and we allow him to go forward or not based on that."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,910.88,913.263,"--We don't stop them from doing all of those things, Your Honor."
2012.11-1450,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,918.134,923.354,What about specifically the question that the Chief asked about time?
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,956.992,958.694,"Your Honor, I believe you could."
2012.11-1450,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,981.358,985.076,Your approach leads to particularly perverse results.
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1007.441,1010.31,"It's an unusual position to be in, Your Honor, it's not quite what we're arguing."
2012.11-1450,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1036.86,1038.562,Is there a difference between what you're--
2012.11-1450,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1038.562,1040.562,But you -- you chimed into this discussion--
2012.11-1450,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1040.562,1040.829,I'm sorry.
2012.11-1450,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1040.829,1041.312,--I'm sorry.
2012.11-1450,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1041.312,1042.148,Let's go by seniority.
2012.11-1450,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1042.981,1059.226,--Is there a difference between what you are advocating and the approach that's now taken in the General Removal Statute as it's been amended recently under 1446(c)(2)?
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1080.906,1082.675,"--That's -- that's exactly right, Your Honor."
2012.11-1450,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1110.158,1114.794,It's binding if the class is certified and the case proceeds to judgment.
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1120.412,1126.852,"And that means that jurisdiction in the Federal courts exists, because we judge jurisdiction at the time of removal."
2012.11-1450,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1138.224,1154.419,"I think I don't understand that, Mr. Boutrous, because what you have, given that this is a State which says that these stipulations are binding if it proceeds, if there's certification and if it proceeds to judgment, you have a cap of $5 million."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1161.589,1164.541,"The problem, Your Honor, again and this isn't just me."
2012.11-1450,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1195.879,1213.291,"Even if this case were handled on remand to the Arkansas Supreme Court exactly like a Federal class action, I don't understand how absent class members would ever be able to -- to determine whether by failing to opt out, they had compromised part of their claim."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1240.791,1246.362,"--That's -- that's exactly right, Your Honor, and that's something page 3a of the addendum to our opening brief, the finding--"
2012.11-1450,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1246.362,1255.801,"Your concern is that the -- that the certification -- if the certification would occur in the Federal court, that's one thing."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1290.224,1293.16,"--Well, that's what Congress was concerned about, too, Your Honor."
2012.11-1450,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1304.051,1308.086,"Well, Congress was concerned about suits of over $5 million."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1348.663,1356.066,"We don't have a State court judgment yet, Your Honor, that -- and we judge the removal issues and the amount in controversy at the time of removal."
2012.11-1450,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1406.333,1410.837,"Well, you're assuming that it's a bad thing for the class members to have their claims limited."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1419.009,1422.211,"I'm not making a judgment on that point, Your Honor."
2012.11-1450,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1451.647,1455.849,"Mr. Boutrous, as you think -- you have to be careful about two different uses of the word “ binding ”."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1477.964,1484.451,"--But the question, Your Honor, is, is it binding in this case on anybody or anything other than Mr. Knowles?"
2012.11-1450,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1484.451,1495.141,It's binding -- it is binding on everybody if there's a finding of adequate representation and if this goes forward as a class action; then it's binding and you haven't been exposed.
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1495.141,1499.878,"But, Your Honor, again, under the jurisdictional approach -- and Your Honor cited St. Paul."
2012.11-1450,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1548.728,1568.772,"What do you do -- in the language in 1332(d)(1)(D), the term “ class members ” means the persons, named or unnamed, who fall within the definition of the proposed class, the proposed class, and that's what we have here."
2012.11-1450,0,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,1568.772,1579.83,"--That's -- that's what we're using, Your Honor, for our calculations, the proposed class, including the narrower time frame that we think is a manipulation, but nevertheless we've used that and the amount exceeds $5 million."
2012.11-1450,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1581.665,1582.432,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1592.388,1595.423,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1450,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1633.315,1638.036,Are you saying that (6) doesn't apply at this point?
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1638.036,1638.436,--No.
2012.11-1450,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1638.436,1643.355,"Because (6) talks about class action, and it says the duty of the district court--"
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1643.355,1645.322,What--
2012.11-1450,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1645.322,1649.593,--is to aggregate the claims of the individual class members.
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1649.593,1669.638,"--And what 1332(d)(1)(B) does, Justice Kennedy, is define class action in terms of the civil action that was filed so long as it was filed pursuant to Federal Rule 23 or an equivalent state statute."
2012.11-1450,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1682.897,1696.574,"And you -- I assume you agree that if at the adequacy hearing, if there ever is one, and it's demonstrated that well, in fact, the amount in controversy is $10 million, then you would be obviously not an adequate representative."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1696.574,1701.459,"Well, that would be one outcome that a state court could come to."
2012.11-1450,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1719.404,1725.491,"And they can remove no matter when that happen; is that right, as a result of CAFA, because CAFA took off the one year limit?"
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1725.491,1726.009,That's correct.
2012.11-1450,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1726.009,1739.484,Or the state court could find the claim is worth a lot more than 5 million but it's worth that amount to be in this generous court for these generous juries.
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1750.992,1761.516,"Well, what's very clear, Justice Scalia, is that Congress was not attempting to address the adequacy of class representation issue where it decided this statute and enacted it."
2012.11-1450,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1761.516,1774.49,"I understand it, but -- but I'm just addressing your point which you blithely say, if the representation is inadequate, if indeed it's worth a lot more, that will be handled."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1782.596,1794.821,A putative class representative makes all kinds of strategic judgments about how best to maximize value for his clients and for the class.
2012.11-1450,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1842.2,1854.173,"What if you had a case where a lawyer brings an action in Miller County and says: I want to represent the class of people with these claims and these claims, whose names begin with A to K."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1868.7,1883.693,"Well, my objection would be at the class certification stage, Mr. Chief Justice, where the requisite of locality, numerosity, the contrivances that are being done are -- are going to whether or not those represent -- representatives are adequate."
2012.11-1450,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1885.644,1887.261,That's the same question.
2012.11-1450,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1887.261,1897.719,"But is a counsel who proceeds on that basis, is there any reason to question his adequacy, let's say he's fully representing, bringing all the claims and all the damages."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1908.094,1909.477,"--I misunderstood, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-1450,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1919.166,1939.829,"If so, this is just a loophole because it swallows up all of Congress's statute, which is what their problem is, all you have to do, even if you were less obvious than the Chief Justice's example, what you do is you -- you file a complaint, you say it's for $4,900,000; in fact, it's worth 10 million."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1990.345,1990.595,--Sure.
2012.11-1450,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2048.032,2050.118,"Counsel, you realize, of course, you are on pretty thin ice."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2061.858,2073.583,And I'm telling you that his focus on the word “ claims ” is insufficient because there are no claims by absent members until there is a civil action that has been filed.
2012.11-1450,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2081.272,2086.926,"Under your argument, the amount that's demanded seems to be totally meaningless."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2116.462,2118.078,"No, the 5 million--"
2012.11-1450,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2118.078,2119.661,In practical terms.
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2119.661,2141.007,"--Well, Justice Alito, it means we have to determine and the district court has to determine whether or not the 5 million has been satisfied on the basis of the well pleaded complaint and an aggregation where, as a factual matter and as a stipulated matter in paragraph 11 of the complaint, the class representative here said: This case is not worth more than $5 million."
2012.11-1450,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2152.249,2152.699,Okay.
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2167.809,2175.415,"--Not so long as there is a binding stipulation that says so long as this civil action is in place, it is not going to be worth $5 million."
2012.11-1450,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2175.415,2183.953,"But what you said then in response -- we're on the same subject, and I'm drawing the conclusion from what you say that yes, we've found a way around this."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2247.177,2247.594,Yes.
2012.11-1450,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2280.867,2292.908,But what you're saying in your answer to Justice Breyer -- and I don't think you've really addressed his point -- that the statute number 6 says “ shall aggregate the individual claim ”.
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2307.251,2325.396,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, let me try it this way, which is that for the large case, the one that I gave in my hypothetical where there are a million class members, and each of them has a claim of $50,000, we know that prior to CAFA, that case was staying in State court because of this Court's Zahn rule."
2012.11-1450,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2348.142,2358.517,"But your theory doesn't depend on it being just a little over $5 million, the theory would hold whether it was $8 million, $9 million."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2358.517,2371.158,"--That's correct, because -- and Justice Ginsburg, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but that's precisely because we want the ability to make legal judgments and strategies to reside in the person who's bringing the complaint."
2012.11-1450,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2371.692,2394.023,"Even though you admit in your brief -- you agreed that the stipulation -- I didn't think that this is what you said on page 53, the stipulations that have no effect on absentees, until the Court finds at the certification stage that the stipulation was made in good faith and doesn't render the named plaintiff an inadequate representative."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2411.152,2415.854,--Not where there are allegations about what the aggregated damages are about.
2012.11-1450,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2456.447,2466.302,"Suppose this were an individual action, and the amount is -- an individual diversity action -- and the amount that is pled is under $75,000."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2482.764,2494.322,"Well, you were referring to a statute, Justice Alito, that was recently enacted, in which it does say that the presumption shall be that the amount pleaded in the complaint is subject to disproval."
2012.11-1450,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2551.908,2569.62,"Wouldn't it be perverse if the rule were that in an individual action where a plaintiff is simply stipulating how much he or she is demanding -- individually -- which the person can do, it's possible to look behind that number."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2584.464,2592.319,"Well, as a policy matter, we might have a debate about the various virtues of that, but they were not enacted in the same piece of legislation."
2012.11-1450,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2619.653,2625.307,How is it binding when you said in your brief it doesn't bind the unnamed class members?
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2625.307,2637.848,"--Justice Ginsburg, this is important that you and I understand each other on this point, because it is binding in the civil action filed for all purposes."
2012.11-1450,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2664.449,2670.085,"Can I ask you this, because I have been trying to figure out exactly what Mr. Boutrous is concerned about?"
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2740.582,2748.355,"Well, for two reasons, because there are protections that are in the statute that protect both defendants and absent class members."
2012.11-1450,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2762.095,2771.387,"But this is -- he's done the certification, now it turns out that the certification was wrong, that in fact, these claims are worth a good deal more."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2780.743,2804.524,"And -- and as a matter of judicial estoppel, what is absolutely clear in every State that I am familiar with is that it follows this Court's basic formula in New Hampshire v. Maine, which looks at whether or not a change in position would prejudice the interests of the other party if the Court had relied on the original position of the litigant, and that will estop that person."
2012.11-1450,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2817.999,2832.191,"Another thing he might be worried about is that if this actions is allowed to proceed, although on its face it's worth $4 million, they're going to have to make a determination whether to settle for a particular amount or not."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2861.961,2889.897,"Actually, I think Mr. Chief Justice, with all due respect, the economic incentives are completely reversed, because if a class representative is bound by a stipulation that this case is not worth than $5 million, the bidding starts at 5 million, but it goes down, it doesn't go north, because the defendant knows that no matter whether we go to trial or not, this case, this civil action is only going to be worth $5 million."
2012.11-1450,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2889.897,2896.868,"It's going to be worth a lot more, because if you go to trial, you're going to have a judgment that they should have been giving the general contractor whatever--"
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2896.868,2899.003,GCOP.
2012.11-1450,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2899.003,2901.772,--pickup it is in every case.
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2908.509,2923.601,"Well, certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, Congress could have drafted a statute that allowed for the removal of every State class action and dealt with that issue if it was deemed appropriate to have Federal courts decide all class actions, but that wasn't the statute that Congress enacted."
2012.11-1450,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2952.436,2958.941,"It's very difficult -- one reason, it's very difficult to speculate about Congress, what they speculate about what they would have intended."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2967.963,2978.319,"--Well, these kinds of stipulations are well known and in fact, as we quote on, I think it's page 5 of our brief, Congress was aware of factual stipulations."
2012.11-1450,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3030.888,3038.726,"What about -- what about, has anyone thought of this -- I hate to bring up sort of a new idea, but somebody may have thought of it."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3098.282,3105.752,"Well, there are two tools that -- that we describe in our brief and that I think are reasonable ways that Federal courts address these matters."
2012.11-1450,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3130.153,3137.307,"Justice Breyer's hypothetical would not come up on your theory, because the Federal court would never get the chance to make that determination."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3138.842,3139.459,No.
2012.11-1450,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3158.053,3162.707,So would that include the I'm suing for two years when I could have sued for five?
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3162.707,3180.919,"No, I don't think so, because there are lots of tactical reasons why litigants might want to limit their claims or might have a good faith basis for saying, I've only investigated this time period, I do not have a good faith basis for asserting claims in a different time period that I have not investigated that does not serve the court."
2012.11-1450,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3180.919,3203.332,"--Well, but there might be -- there might be ways of working with this notion, a little risky from your point of view, but there might be ways of working with this good faith notion so that some -- there would be some power in the Federal district court to set aside certain stipulations which were used for manipulative purposes and what definition that manipulative is something that isn't clear to -- to me at the moment."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3203.332,3219.377,"Well, the -- the -- the notion that I have distilled from St. Paul Mercury and the idea of good faith and looking at cases that have addressed bad faith, which is obviously the converse of good faith, is whether or not there is something misleading or deceitful in the way that this stipulation would be framed."
2012.11-1450,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3223.679,3237.672,"But it would never involve a judgment that a claim is really worth $50 million and just to defeat this statute, it's being limited to 5."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3237.672,3241.04,"There -- there could be a strategic reason, Justice Sotomayor, why--"
2012.11-1450,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3241.04,3245.492,"Well, the only strategic reason according to your adversary is they want to stay in State court."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3245.492,3250.313,"--Well, but there are reasons, because in Arkansas, for instance, there is a direct appeal for the State supreme court."
2012.11-1450,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3299.512,3302.114,Why did you decide to file in Miller County?
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3302.114,3310.887,"Because these are Texarkana lawyers who filed on behalf of all Arkansas residents and Texarkana, Arkansas is a jurisdiction in Arkansas."
2012.11-1450,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3310.887,3322.509,"Mr. Frederick, your answer just doesn't deal with the component that's been troubling, which is that it doesn't protect the absent class members."
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3338.454,3338.754,Well--
2012.11-1450,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3338.754,3339.854,--if it would go your way?
2012.11-1450,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3339.854,3340.237,--Sure.
2012.11-1450,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3378.079,3379.448,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1450,2,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,3381.414,3383.566,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.11-1450,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3446.239,3449.091,So why can't the case be removed at that moment?
2012.11-1450,2,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,3449.091,3454.662,"Well, it theoretically could be, Your Honor, but that won't solve the problem of discovery."
2012.11-1450,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3459.131,3462.935,"Mr. Boutrous, you know, a lot of your brief talks about this problem of discovery."
2012.11-1450,2,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,3488.65,3489.918,"--That's incorrect, Your Honor."
2012.11-1450,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3555.361,3575.691,"Mr. Boutrous, the idea of master of the complaint is inherent in every class litigation because there could be no class action, there could be no definition of anything, of the claims, of the amount of damages, of the number of defendants, of the amount of time unless the plaintiff, the named plaintiff, had some ability to define the claim."
2012.11-1450,2,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,3580.576,3590.951,"Your Honor, on the amount in controversy, this Court has never held in a class action or otherwise that that's something that's subject to the well pleaded complaint rule or the master of the complaint doctrine."
2012.11-1450,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3597.938,3598.724,Okay.
2012.11-1450,2,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,3601.257,3601.759,"No, Your Honor."
2012.11-1450,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3601.759,3607.31,Because you're saying: Next time we will be back and tell you that the named plaintiff can't define the clans.
2012.11-1450,2,42418,theodore_j_boutrous_jr,,3610.531,3611.197,"No, Your Honor."
