1972.71-364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.802,"We’ll hear arguments first this morning in number 71-364 and 71-373, consolidated cases in Mahan against Howell and Virginia Beach against Howell."
1972.71-364,0,16592,andrew_p_miller,,19.048,23.037,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-364,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1222.153,1224.601,Mr. Frazier.
1972.71-364,1,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1224.601,1228.347,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-364,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1375.694,1388.893,"Mr. Frazier, wouldn’t there be some questions as to the propriety of the District Court being a source of policy judgments as to what factors are to be considered other than numbers?"
1972.71-364,1,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1388.893,1403.228,"Very definitely, we feel that this Court has leaned over backwards on occasion after occasion to say that policy decision is one for the legislature, not for the District Court at all."
1972.71-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1457.006,1494.927,"As I understand, in your position, Mr. Frazier, it is that there is a substantial difference between what is constitutionally required under Article I, Section 2, with respect to congressional apportionment or districting, from what is required under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution and specifically, the Equal Protection Clause with respect to reapportionment of state legislatures and that this Court has consistently recognized that difference."
1972.71-364,1,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1496.216,1497.586,That is our position--
1972.71-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1497.586,1515.489,"And the Wesberry against Sanders which was based on Article I, Section 2 illustrates that in particularly when one reads Mr. Justice Clark’s opinion different from the Court saying that in Wesberry against Sanders, he would apply the different test of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment."
1972.71-364,1,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,1515.489,1528.403,"And as that is brought down today in Kirkpatrick, the phrase as nearly as practicable appears whereas in Reynolds, construing the Equal Protection Clause, it is substantial equality."
1972.71-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2090.172,2100.97,"(Inaudible) I have read the brief of the City of Norfolk, who is an appellee in this case."
1972.71-364,1,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,2108.252,2111.028,I understand that it is not being represented.
1972.71-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2113.229,2115.29,Right and it is an appellee --
1972.71-364,1,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,2115.29,2115.7,It is indeed.
1972.71-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2115.7,2119.077,"-- on an amicus, but it's not going to be represented in oral argument today."
1972.71-364,1,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,2133.487,2139.022,I think they have sort of turned around and joined our team.
1972.71-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2139.208,2142.765,(Inaudible) in an appellee’s brief just for the position of taking.
1972.71-364,1,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,2144.663,2150.928,"Well, I think the reason they’re not being represented orally is the limitation on the number of counsel permitted to argue."
1972.71-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2150.928,2151.139,Oh!
1972.71-364,1,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,2154.939,2157.864,"Well, I interpreted it to mean this."
1972.71-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2168.176,2169.586,"That’s quite understandable, of course."
1972.71-364,1,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,2169.586,2193.849,"Quite understandable, but they also recognize the importance that we lay stress on for representation of local government in the lay -- in one House of the legislative body and they are pointing out in an effective way the particulars in their case where interest of Virginia Beach and Norfolk are so different."
1972.71-364,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2195.61,2200.768,"And what is their position as to what they think the Court ought to do, that it thinks Norfolk, you know?"
1972.71-364,1,26984,harry_frazier_iii,,2200.768,2220.996,"Well, I think their position is that the General Assembly’s plan was acceptable and should have been upheld and this is a justification in terms of their particular circumstances for upholding the General Assembly’s plan and reversing the District Court."
1972.71-364,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2338.206,2345.387,"Thank you, Mr. Frazier."
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,2345.489,2364.334,"Mr. Chief Justice and justices, I represent the plaintiffs in the suit that was filed on March 3rd challenging the validity of a certain portion of the Senate reapportionment of council as Senator Peter Babalas of Norfolk."
1972.71-364,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2457.143,2460.575,"Here with the Virginia Constitution, we are dealing here with the Federal Constitution, so then can you say --"
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,2460.575,2461.526,I understand.
1972.71-364,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2461.719,2463.14,Any case is the right case.
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,2467.755,2486.905,"If Your Honor, please but Judge Albert Bryan pointed out that the Fourteenth Amendment mandate in Virginia had been underscored so that in our constitution we have anticipated and adopted a majority opinion in the Preisler Kirkpatrick gainst --"
1972.71-364,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.905,2498.131,"(Inaudible) the constitutional, federal constitutional validity of what's your legislature did, isn’t that correct?"
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,2498.131,2529.087,"If Your Honor, please, I am submitting that when our Constitution says that the House of Representative of the United States and the members of the Senate and the House of Delegates shall be elected from the districts established and every district shall be composed of contiguous compact territory and shall be so constituted as to give us nearly as practicable representation in proportion to the population of a district that in that State, there can be no constitutional difference in what measures up to the test of nearly as practicable."
1972.71-364,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2529.087,2537.624,(Inaudible) in understanding that the issue here is the federal constitutional validity of what your Virginia legislature did.
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,2543.343,2548.76,"Right, we will not chase that rabbit if Your Honor please because it is not necessary."
1972.71-364,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2614.488,2615.271,(Inaudible)
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,2615.271,2617.727,Excuse me Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-364,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2842.152,2866.973,"How far would your argument Mr. Howell, your claim here is that it was unconstitutional to accept census figures for the reason that you have explained that census figures with respect to a certain district in Norfolk were invalid and unsound and inaccurate because the census with respect to that district delegated the job to the navy which did it by counting the number of men on the ships."
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,2894.312,2903.391,"If Your Honor please, the enumeration of the total number of inhabitants was sufficient for the purpose of the census."
1972.71-364,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2967.708,2976.444,I understand your argument but I wonder where it leads. You say it’s -- a State is not constitutionally permitted to use the figures of the United States census?
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,2976.444,2978.001,Not when they are artificial.
1972.71-364,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2979.199,2983.411,Can any litigant come in and say these census figures are artificial or inaccurate?
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,2983.411,2984.041,Not any.
1972.71-364,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2984.041,2989.703,And require a Court to make its own census or a State legislature to make its own census?
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,2989.703,2991.021,Not any.
1972.71-364,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2991.021,2992.029,"What is that, what is the US Department of Census for?"
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,2992.029,3024.537,"Mr. Justice Stewart, but in a case where we established the opinion of Judge Albert Bryan which I don’t believe can be blinked away, said that if Your Honor please, the remainder with their families reside for most part and other sections of the City of Norfolk, he stated that it was factually without dispute that only 8,100 of the 36,693 were within the Fifth Senatorial District."
1972.71-364,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3121.155,3125.933,"Mr. Howell, do you agree that this constitutes a collateral attack on the census figures?"
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3125.933,3127.386,No sir.
1972.71-364,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3174.765,3180.015,"Mr. Howell, In this case doing exactly or aren’t you, what the Chief Justice’s question suggests."
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3188.028,3189.03,Absolutely not.
1972.71-364,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3189.03,3190.677,"Now, tell me why I was wrong?"
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3190.677,3212.561,"It's just as you would with the walk out here to get a little breath of air following this hectic day here in this distinguished tribunal and you saw a black round sphere laying in a field and wanting to play a little touch football with Justice Byron White, you picked it up and threw it to him and then he caught it, it exploded."
1972.71-364,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3216.819,3220.515,"Well, that really doesn’t impress me.[Laughter]"
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3220.515,3226.563,"Now, let me get that right on point, if Your Honor please."
1972.71-364,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3259.885,3279.498,"(Inaudible) the Virginia legislature have done the congressional districting, so that the line between say the second district and its adjoining district were the same as between the fifth and sixth state district that you are talking about, the same fallacy would have been true for congressional apportionment, wouldn’t it?"
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3279.498,3292.253,"Well, that could not happen because you know it takes 46000 tenant to -- takes 465,000 people to get a Congressman."
1972.71-364,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3292.253,3303.92,"But it’s up to the legislatures to where they draw the line between the districts and conceivably if they had drawn the congressional line at the place that they drew the state district line here, you could have the same problem?"
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3303.92,3305.345,It’s nearly impossible to do so.
1972.71-364,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3320.145,3327.876,"How many of your navy people Mr. Howell, actually resided outside the fifth, sixth and seventh districts?"
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3327.876,3331.722,"Just a scintilla, if Your Honor please, it was not 50%."
1972.71-364,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3341.445,3353.481,"But to the extent that this variation does exist, then Court’s own plan is not in mind with its own theory, so far as the census figures are concerned?"
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3353.481,3368.515,"I suggest if the record is read with the care which characterizes this Court, you will find that there’s no evidence to show that any recognizable number of people lived outside of five, six and seven."
1972.71-364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3385.457,3389.304,I take it you are saying that you don't attack the census figures at all.
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3410.095,3412.884,Insofar as military would concern.
1972.71-364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3412.884,3413.864,Yes.
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3413.864,3420.669,"They counted the wife of this sailor in her home in district six, but they counted the sailor."
1972.71-364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3447.393,3468.376,"Well, why wouldn’t that have been sensible for the District Court to have allocated between the three districts a certain proportion of the sailors who were said not to live where the census put them."
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3468.376,3476.682,"Because, if Your Honor please, we did not have sufficiently precise enumeration on a house-by-house basis."
1972.71-364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3499.251,3502.761,Would you have objected if the Court had said we are going to split these military people equally between the three districts?
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3502.761,3506.152,Yes.
1972.71-364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3506.152,3506.778,Why would you have?
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3506.778,3513.54,"In an area like Norfolk, I do not believe in single-member districts because --"
1972.71-364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3513.54,3517.448,You may not believe in them but the legislature did?
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3517.448,3519.652,"No, that’s -- you brought me to a very interesting point."
1972.71-364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3519.652,3522.858,"Yes, very interesting point as to what the District Court was permitted to do."
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3530.46,3533.635,I want to say that there was no legislative policy.
1972.71-364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3534.288,3539.522,"Well, what was the legislative plan that said single-member districts?"
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3539.522,3541.713,"If they had said it, then --"
1972.71-364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3541.713,3545.156,"Well that was the plan was, wasn’t it?"
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3545.156,3549.226,That’s the plan they came up with in about 35 minutes figuratively speaking.
1972.71-364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3553.51,3554.758,"Whatever it was, the plan --"
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3554.758,3556.223,It's politics behind it --
1972.71-364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3556.223,3560.907,"The legislative plan that was declared unconstitutional, opted for single-member districts in the Senate?"
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3560.907,3573.568,"Well, we would have come here and said that in Norfolk where the blacks are a minority and where they do not constitute a majority in either one of the three senatorial districts."
1972.71-364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3615.82,3628.301,The argument that as the legislature -- but what about the relevance of this to the constitutional question of whether the District Court was applied to do what it did rather than --
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3628.301,3647.32,"I’d say that single-member districts would dilute the black vote in a city like Norfolk, if you know the balance because you’re going to get two white senators who are not going to a single Black lodge or church and they are going to have a deaf ear to every black request that comes as we try to appeal to the majority of all."
1972.71-364,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3662.862,3674.742,"I take it then, even if they have done anything wrong with the single-member district seem so far as the allocation of the military was concerned, you would have argued that single-member districts in that area was unconstitutional anyway?"
1972.71-364,2,27297,henry_e_howell_jr,,3674.742,3677.496,Yes sir my time is up and I do not wish to trespass.
1972.71-364,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3714.881,3716.845,Mr. DuVal.
1972.71-364,3,18813,clive_l_duval_ii,,3716.845,3719.845,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-364,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3796.037,3797.543,The basic state reapportionment?
1972.71-364,3,18813,clive_l_duval_ii,,3797.543,3799.515,The basic state reapportionment cases.
1972.71-364,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3919.547,3921.431,What does the Court plan do for you?
1972.71-364,3,18813,clive_l_duval_ii,,3921.431,3924.717,A Court plan reduces the -- by about half.
1972.71-364,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3933.546,3935.194,"And you are underrepresented, under the --"
1972.71-364,3,18813,clive_l_duval_ii,,3935.194,3955.499,"We are underrepresented by a small amount as of the 1970 census but because of our very rapidly growing population, our population as of August 1 actually would have entitled less to 21 delegates, not just 20 or 19 but 21 under the 46,485 ideal population."
1972.71-364,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4046.163,4047.243,Mr. DuVal.
1972.71-364,3,18813,clive_l_duval_ii,,4047.243,4047.452,Yes sir.
1972.71-364,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4047.452,4054.131,How did you determine what counties and cities comprise Northern Virginia for the purpose of your decision?
1972.71-364,3,18813,clive_l_duval_ii,,4054.131,4064.814,"It is a -- for a number of purposes, it is a state planning district, it’s the counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William and the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax and Falls Church."
1972.71-364,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4069.145,4071.609,They’re under state legislation?
1972.71-364,3,18813,clive_l_duval_ii,,4071.609,4073.323,"Yes, under state legislation."
1972.71-364,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4073.323,4080.797,And that is the principal reason for your suggesting that these be treated as a group for comparison with other areas?
1972.71-364,3,18813,clive_l_duval_ii,,4080.797,4087.489,"Yes, it was a convenient way of considering Northern Virginia as a district already regularized by state law."
1972.71-364,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4145.839,4157.386,"Following up my brother Rehnquist’s question, does Tidewater have a specific kind of definition or meet some bounds on identity just as Northern Virginia does?"
1972.71-364,3,18813,clive_l_duval_ii,,4157.386,4157.85,Yes sir.
1972.71-364,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4707.451,4715.808,"Mr. DuVal, couldn’t we count on that new General Assembly if it decided that it no longer wanted to prosecute this appeal, that so advised the Attorney General?"
1972.71-364,3,18813,clive_l_duval_ii,,4715.808,4718.262,I think it might well do so.
1972.71-364,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4773.107,4789.073,"Mr. DuVal, if you assume the Court thought that the particular variations in this case were justified by respect for county lines or something like that."
