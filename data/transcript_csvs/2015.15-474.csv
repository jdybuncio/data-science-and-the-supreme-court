2015.15-474,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.535,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 15-474, McDonnell v. United States. Mr. Francisco."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,9.535,20.755,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government argues that in quid pro quo bribery, ""official action"" encompasses anything within the range of official duties."
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,43.12,46.79,"And that's the Sun-Diamond case, the 9-0 case that you refer to."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,46.79,49.435,"Yes, Your Honor, the Sun-Diamond case, the 9-0 case."
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,61.81,71.63,"I take it all parties concede that the act of the university official to undertake or not to undertake a research study would be an ""official action."""
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,71.63,72.765,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,80.95,94.75,"Can you tell me the posture of the case with reference to under Virginia law, the government -- the Governor's authority or lack of authority to tell the university, you will engage in this research or you will not engage?"
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,94.75,95.23,"Sure, Your Honor."
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,95.52,100.12,"What is the state of the law, and do -- do the parties agree on this point?"
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,100.12,110.405,"Your Honor, I think that the parties agree that the Governor at least had a bully pulpit authority, but he had very little authority to actually direct any university researcher to do anything."
2015.15-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,123.165,130.375,Would it have made a difference if the medical faculties had agreed to the testing?
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,130.375,140.915,"Your Honor, if they had agreed to the testing, I still don't think it would have made a difference in terms of whether Governor McDonnell tried to influence their decision on that, because he didn't."
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,153.635,175.705,"Mr. Francisco, could I ask -- the line you're drawing between exercising influence and providing access, just to sort of test that with a hypothetical, suppose that somebody knew that there was a -- a contractor who was going to award a very large contract to one of two or three firms that the -- that he was meeting with."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,184.83,184.92,Sure.
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,184.92,191.4,-- an official in order to become one of those two or three firms from which that was the pool from which --
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,191.4,191.635,Right.
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,191.635,195.86,"-- this billion-dollar contract would emerge, would that be sufficient?"
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,195.86,205.2,"Your Honor, I think that probably would be ""official action"" because there the only way you can even get a decision in your favor is by being one of three people on that list."
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,236.76,237.025,Can I --
2015.15-474,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,237.025,241.86,Let me -- let me just change the hypothetical a little bit.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,269.1,269.54,Sure.
2015.15-474,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,278.035,279.2,Just a payment to sit in.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,279.2,298.355,"To sit on the -- I think it would violate a whole lot of other laws, but I don't think, unless there was any kind of indicia that you were trying to influence the outcome, you would cross that line into prohibited ""official action"" corruption. After all, these laws are not meant to be comprehensive codes of ethical conduct as this Court said in Sun-Diamond."
2015.15-474,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,303.95,312.775,What if it's not just sitting in? Maybe I wasn't -- I should sharpen this. Supposed the party is allowed to speak and present its point of view.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,312.775,320.88,"Your Honor, again, the more facts that you put on to suggest that it is more of an attempt to influence the decision, it's not just a meeting."
2015.15-474,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,323.7,349.06,"So tell me, what do we do with the evidence in the case that the university individuals who were assessing whether or not to do these studies themselves felt pressured? There is both testimony and documents in which the pros and cons of accepting these studies was discussed."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,349.06,349.52,Right.
2015.15-474,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,349.52,355.395,"And in the pro and con, it was, the Governor really wants us to do this."
2015.15-474,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,355.395,359.045,The Governor is pressuring us to do this.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,373.67,377.65,"I have two responses, Your Honor, a legal one and a factual one."
2015.15-474,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,387.25,417.49,"But why? Isn't this -- I thought that this crime was taking money knowing that it was being paid to influence an ""official act."" So aren't all of these examples of ""official acts"" whether they are or they aren't irrelevant? The question is, what was his intent at the moment he took the money? And why couldn't --"
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,417.49,417.56,Yeah.
2015.15-474,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,417.56,426.87,"-- a jury infer at that moment that he took it with the intent to commit an ""official act"" the way Mr. Williams wanted it committed?"
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,426.87,429.025,"So again, Your Honor, two responses."
2015.15-474,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,437.965,438.22,Well --
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,438.22,439.0,Understand --
2015.15-474,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,439.0,442.64,-- to study these dietary supplements.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,442.64,448.77,"Well, to -- to actually, you know, conduct tobacco commission-funded State studies, but you still need to tell them what that is."
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,480.49,499.365,"And so is it your position at page 60 of the supplemental Joint Appendix -- the instructions aren't numbered, which makes it a little hard, but the judge instructs the jury that ""official actions"" are set forth in the five paragraphs of the indictment."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,507.23,528.23,"Yes, Your Honor, and certainly the five things that were proved in this case are not ""official acts."" And likewise, I don't think any of those things, as they actually came into evidence, demonstrated ""official acts"" because in none of them did Governor McDonnell cross that line in trying to influence the outcome of any particular decision. And just as critically, the jury was never told it had to find that."
2015.15-474,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,539.46,540.19,The matter --
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,540.19,565.03,"Well, this gets back somewhat to Justice Alito's hypothetical about arranging the meeting, and we -- and we can up the ante to see how -- how close the meeting came to be an -- an ""official act."" But I -- I take it that at some point your position is that a governmental -- that an ""official act"" must be the exercise of governmental power."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,566.87,591.45,"Well, Your Honor, it's either making a decision on -- on an exercise of governmental power, trying to influence it, as in the Birdsall case, where the defendants there were trying to persuade the grant of clemency. But if you're simply setting up a meeting so that somebody can appeal to the independent judgment of an independent decisionmaker and you're not trying to put your thumb on the scale of the outcome of that meeting, then that simple referral can't possibly be official action."
2015.15-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,598.27,606.845,Do you -- do you concede that there is sufficient evidence in this record -- let's say we accept your argument about the charge being insufficient.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,618.87,621.74,"Your Honor, we don't concede there was sufficient evidence."
2015.15-474,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,658.09,662.885,"Well, suppose arranging a meeting could be official government action, if that were your job."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,678.93,680.92,"I think that's possible, Chief Justice."
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,692.56,703.47,"Well, can I follow up on that? Because what you just suggested, right, is that you could -- suppose that there were a scheduler for a Governor or for the President or whatever, and that scheduler was selling meetings."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,710.75,711.35,"No, Your Honor."
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,755.84,759.045,"It seems to me when you say ""urging"" -- now, wait."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,809.845,810.4,Yes.
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,810.65,811.05,But wait.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,866.14,866.625,Right.
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,866.625,871.97,"Like award a contract, like vote, like -- et cetera."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,876.545,877.26,"Sure, Your Honor."
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,887.92,890.98,"You want to use ""attempt to influence""? My goodness."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,897.18,897.445,Right.
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,897.445,914.55,"-- of -- of HHS, to the secretary or the assistant secretaries, and they say, my Constituent Smith has a matter before you that has been pending for 18 months; we would appreciate it if you would review that and take action."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,923.275,923.64,Right.
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,923.64,926.1,A crime? My goodness.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,926.1,927.08,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,927.08,927.26,All right.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,927.42,927.95,Absolutely not.
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,927.95,930.15,"You say ""absolutely not."" That's what I thought that you would say."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,930.15,930.64,And I think that --
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,930.64,942.19,"So I want to know -- but the words you used were ""attempt to influence."" And so -- though I don't think that's the right word, and I want to know what the right words are --"
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,942.19,942.45,Sure.
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,942.45,947.34,-- in the instruction that the judge is going to give.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,949.0,949.885,Um-hmm.
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,949.885,951.44,-- but in general.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,951.44,958.1,"Well, can I give you an example from another case that, although I do think instructions are generally tailored to the case, an example --"
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,958.1,959.09,Of course they are.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,964.575,965.39,Sure.
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,965.39,969.85,-- from the one who does it criminally and the one who doesn't.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,969.85,974.65,"And in the Ring case, I thought that Judge Huvelle had some very useful instructions --"
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,974.65,974.96,Mm-hmm.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,974.96,994.62,"-- where she wrote -- and this is at page 1083 of the Joint Appendix -- ""Therefore, 'official action' includes the exercise of both formal official influence, such as the legislature's vote on legislation, and informal official influence, such as a legislature's behind-the-scenes influence on other public officials in the legislative or executive branches."""
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,994.62,996.31,"Well, there we have it. There we have it."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1001.375,1001.89,And --
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1001.89,1004.94,"Mrs. Smith, who, by the way, took me to lunch last week. (Laughter.)"
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1004.94,1008.44,"And I completely agree, Your Honor, which is why in our proposed instruction --"
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1008.44,1009.19,That won't do it.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1010.5,1015.94,"Well -- well, and that's why in our proposed instructions, I think it needs to be tailored further to the facts of the case."
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1025.79,1026.05,All right.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1029.62,1030.29,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1030.29,1031.895,Because sometimes it could.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1031.895,1032.58,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1032.58,1039.74,"And somebody might have the embarrassing question, merely when it can or merely when it can't."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1041.415,1068.64,"Your Honor, I think that the answer is, if -- if the evidence shows that there was -- and I hate to go back to the word that I -- I know you don't like here, but if the evidence shows that there really wasn't attempt -- an attempt to try to push the separate decisionmaker that you're supposedly trying to influence one way or another, but you really are just sending it over for a meeting, and -- and that independent decisionmaker is left to their independent judgment, then you haven't crossed that line."
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1068.82,1069.22,Mr. --
2015.15-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1069.22,1087.615,"The word -- the word that Justice Breyer is concerned about comes from Birdsall, with intent to influence their ""official action."" So we can hardly fault the district judge for using in Ring the same words that this Court used in Birdsall."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1087.615,1088.7,"I -- I agree, Your Honor."
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1119.33,1123.99,"Where can we find the best definition, in your view, of an ""official act""?"
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1123.99,1131.9,"Your Honor, I think that the best definition of an ""official act"" is -- is essentially the one that I tried to articulate at the outset."
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1146.85,1147.01,"Well, I --"
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1147.01,1147.15,Can I --
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1147.15,1148.17,I agree with Justice Breyer.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1151.1,1160.28,"Your Honor, I think in many -- in some cases, I think the limiting principle might be difficult; it's not a perfect and precise formulation."
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1179.58,1181.57,I'm -- I'm not sure -- I'm not sure that's right.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1195.615,1197.56,"I -- I completely agree with you, Justice Kennedy."
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1197.56,1207.79,"Under your view, under the hypotheticals that have been thrown around, the janitor who gets the bottle of beer in order to clean your classroom first, I mean, is that -- is that a governmental act?"
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1207.79,1209.66,"Certainly not in my view, but the government --"
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1209.66,1210.575,"Well, what's the difference?"
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1210.575,1215.28,"The difference is, one -- one is you're exercising power on behalf of the government as a whole."
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1254.0,1254.28,Can I ask --
2015.15-474,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1254.28,1254.87,Sure -- sure.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1275.925,1280.455,"Two things, Your Honor. First, you still do need to tell the jury that that's what they have to find."
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1334.91,1335.38,Mr. Francisco --
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1335.38,1336.97,-- to exercise appropriate judgment.
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1336.97,1340.52,"-- if -- you said something before, and I might have misunderstood you."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1352.245,1353.06,Two answers.
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1355.98,1356.18,Okay.
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1357.05,1357.88,But secondly --
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1357.88,1358.405,"Go ahead, please."
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1358.405,1362.5,"But secondly, the jury could have agreed with us on that, given the evidence we put forward."
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1381.52,1381.73,Okay.
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1395.195,1396.88,They're -- they're at page 60 of the --
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1396.88,1398.495,The 6091.
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1398.495,1399.865,Middle of the appendix.

2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1426.1,1429.66,"So on something like that, your argument is a sufficiency argument?"
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1429.66,1430.14,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1430.14,1433.83,"Rather than this was -- this is not an ""official act""?"
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1433.83,1434.9,"And -- and -- yes, Your Honor."
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1454.66,1468.845,"Well, just to be clear, you -- you said at the outset you don't think any of these are ""official acts,"" but then I thought I heard you say that, third, contacting other government officials as part of an effort to encourage State research is not an ""official act""?"
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1468.845,1470.39,"That's the indictment, Your Honor."
2015.15-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1471.96,1475.355,"What was -- Justice Kagan is asking, is that an ""official act""?"
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1475.355,1476.2,If it actually --
2015.15-474,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1476.2,1476.58,"If it's true, but --"
2015.15-474,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1476.58,1478.54,"If he had tried to encouraged them to do it, yes."
2015.15-474,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1525.425,1530.95,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1530.95,1552.49,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner seeks a categorical carve-out from the concept of an ""official act"" for things like meetings, phone calls, events, that, in his view, do not further or advance or attempt to influence a particular government action, but simply provide somebody with access to the government."
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1552.49,1554.49,"Well, he's not -- he's not the only one."
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1588.27,1597.74,But -- but to agree on something as sensitive as this and to be willing to put their names on something that says this -- this cannot be prosecuted conduct.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1599.14,1602.86,"It may be extraordinary, Mr. Chief Justice, but that doesn't make it correct."
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1642.36,1642.45,You're --
2015.15-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1642.45,1643.44,I don't know --
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1643.44,1652.165,"It's -- it's somebody in the government whose client comes to them and says, we'd really like the Solicitor General's Office to file a brief in our case."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1662.135,1665.91,"But getting in the door, Mr. Chief Justice, is one of the absolutely critical things."
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1665.91,1667.85,"So is your answer, yes, that that's a felony?"
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1667.85,1669.69,If somebody pays me --
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1669.69,1669.99,"No, no."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1671.79,1672.05,Yes.
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1672.05,1674.87,I'm talking about the pro side in the quid pro quo.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1674.87,1679.29,"Taking a meeting, yes, I think taking a meeting is absolutely government action."
2015.15-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1679.29,1693.24,"So if -- so if the President gives special access to high-dollar donors to have meetings with government officials, that is a felony?"
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1693.24,1695.52,"Certainly not, Justice Kennedy."
2015.15-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1695.69,1696.66,Why certainly not?
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1696.66,1701.12,Because the critical issue there is whether the government can prove a quid pro quo.
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1709.17,1711.06,It's not a campaign contribution.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1855.37,1855.82,So --
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1855.82,1890.165,"I appreciate your help on what the right words are, and I'll tell you right now if those words are going to say when a person has lunch and then writes over to the antitrust division and says, I'd like you to meet with my constituent who has just been evicted from her house, you know, if that's going to criminalize that behavior, I'm not buying into that, I don't think. So -- so I want some words that will help with what I see as as naughty and complicated and difficult and basic a problem as I can think of."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1890.165,1908.92,"Justice Breyer, let me first argue the position that I came here to argue, which is that ""official action"" is not limited by some arbitrary litmus test that was proposed by Petitioner that would exclude things that he calls ""access."" I don't think that that's the right way to look at it."
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1926.39,1927.525,"No, no one said it is."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1939.95,1940.74,Justice Breyer --
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1940.74,1942.2,But -- but you understand that --
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1942.2,1943.03,-- I -- I don't -- I don't go --
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1943.03,1943.23,-- side.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1945.27,1954.825,"I understand, Justice Breyer. But what -- I would think it would be helpful for the Court if I could lay out the multiple elements that are at issue here because ""official act"" does not have to do all the work."
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1984.49,1985.2,Of course it isn't.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1985.2,1994.58,"-- many regulations that carve out permissible gift situations and create the fourth element issue that I think is an important protection, which is mens rea."
2015.15-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1994.58,2002.61,"But the problem is, and as you set forth in your brief correctly, you can imply an agreement over time."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2023.35,2024.74,So I agree with you --
2015.15-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2024.74,2025.375,We're in agreement.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2025.375,2026.86,"I do agree with you, Justice Kennedy."
2015.15-474,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2053.04,2055.46,I don't see what the relevance of those regulations is.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2066.89,2068.51,"Well, they don't, Justice Alito."
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2097.16,2098.05,"Yeah, but how -- but you're asking --"
2015.15-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2098.05,2106.76,"But then this -- this doesn't answer Justice Breyer's basic question and ours. You're going to tell the Senators, the officials with the lunches, that, don't worry."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2111.82,2112.54,Well --
2015.15-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2112.54,2115.335,That was your answer. That was your answer.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2115.335,2122.62,"Justice Kennedy, I do think that the requirements of the criminal law in proving something by beyond a reasonable doubt are a substantial --"
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2122.62,2129.395,"What is it they're trying to prove? Now, of course, this is a State case, not a Federal case."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2162.505,2163.27,So --
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2163.27,2165.95,But that's a matter for campaign laws. Wait.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2241.275,2241.78,"Well, Justice --"
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2241.78,2244.27,That -- that's what I want your view on.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2244.27,2272.93,"Justice Breyer, I'm going to push back, because I think that the line that Petitioner has urged is one that is a recipe for corruption, not a recipe for drawing a safe harbor for public officials. What he has basically urged the Court to hold is that paying for access, if somebody does not put a thumb on the scale of decision -- if I, for example, tell the criminal division, take the meeting, make whatever recommendation is in your best judgment, just take the meeting, I can take money for that."
2015.15-474,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2292.655,2295.57,"Well, what I think we're looking for is some limiting principle."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2299.1,2299.25,Correct.
2015.15-474,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2299.25,2302.755,-- and I know that this case doesn't involve campaign contributions.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2306.305,2307.215,Certainly.
2015.15-474,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2307.215,2307.97,All right.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2321.3,2329.72,"So, Justice Alito, gaining access and ingratiation and gratitude as a result of campaign contributions is not a crime."
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2333.285,2333.58,That's --
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2333.58,2334.11,That is not the --
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2334.11,2334.66,"That's what I want, your view."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2334.66,2336.04,"That is not my view, Justice Breyer."
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2336.04,2336.4,"But, I mean --"
2015.15-474,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2336.4,2375.55,"Mr. Dreeben, if I could just follow up on that. If a -- a Senator writes to a Federal agency and says, this union or this company is, you know, critical to the economy of my State, and, by the way -- he doesn't say this, but, by the way, they are the biggest contributors to his campaign -- would you please meet with them? What would not make that a crime? The fact that the jury might not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the reason why he was urging this meeting was because these people, this entity, happened to be a very big supporter? That would be the only thing separating lawful from unlawful conduct there?"
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2375.55,2377.52,"Well, let -- let me say two things in response to that."
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2524.29,2524.52,So --
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2524.52,2525.36,And that's what --
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2525.36,2545.31,"-- if you have a governor whose priority is jobs for his State, and there's a CEO who's thinking about locating a plant in his State, but he can only do it, he says, if he gets tax credits from the State. So the governor is talking to him, and he says, look, why don't you come down to my, you know, trout stream and we'll go fishing and we'll talk about this."
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2559.64,2565.925,"-- accepted an afternoon of trout fishing, and he discussed official business at that time?"
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2565.925,2578.32,"I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, but if you change the hypothetical and said instead of an afternoon of trout fitting -- fishing, I'll fly you out to Hawaii and you and your family can have a vacation, and during that time we can go over my policy --"
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2578.32,2587.085,"But I thought -- I didn't think the government put any weight on the amount of the quid; in other words, you know -- okay."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2603.11,2603.81,Yes.
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2603.81,2621.115,"And -- and so if all he's doing is talking about ways to get jobs for Virginia, and he's talking with the person who's going to make that decision from the private sector, based in part on whether or not he gets, you know, tax credits, it would seem to me that under your definition, that governor is guilty of a felony."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2621.115,2623.32,I'm not sure that he is guilty of a felony.
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2642.56,2643.865,But that's the point.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2675.03,2675.63,It's not the government's --
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2675.63,2682.12,"What is the government's position -- what -- you tell me I'm wrong, in for a penny, in for a pound."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2695.15,2697.93,"It's tempting, Justice Breyer, but I'm not going to --"
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2697.93,2698.54,Exactly.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2698.54,2700.455,-- exempt from the corruption laws --
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2700.455,2700.74,Okay.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2700.74,2702.15,-- certain types of quids. But --
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2702.15,2702.645,But now --
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2702.645,2706.58,"-- Justice Breyer, you do need to run this through all the elements of the offense."
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2723.88,2727.48,You tell me -- that's why I asked you at the beginning.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2757.175,2757.68,So I think --
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2757.68,2764.03,"I dissented in -- in Citizens United, so whatever that said there, but -- (Laughter.)"
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2764.03,2770.53,The -- the -- but the point is the one I raised at the beginning that every single one of us has raised.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2800.905,2801.35,So --
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2801.35,2802.42,That's too specific.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2807.225,2810.49,"Well, I don't think you and I agree on where the line should be, Justice Breyer."
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2821.41,2822.29,"No, no, no."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2823.63,2824.81,You did suggest it.
2015.15-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2824.81,2825.67,I did -- (Laughter.)
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2825.67,2840.41,"I think that it's too narrow. I think that if the Court is going to reject the government's submission, which is that when the governor calls his Secretary of Health and says, take the meeting with my benefactor, he doesn't disclose it's his benefactor."
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2895.29,2896.52,There -- there is --
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2896.52,2896.58,Now --
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2896.58,2910.45,"Given the difficulty that we're having in settling on what these words in the statute mean, there is a -- an argument in the Petitioner's brief that you have responded to in yours that the statute is unconstitutionally vague."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2910.45,2914.11,I -- I do not think it is unconstitutionally vague.
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2951.42,2952.05,"Well, yeah."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2972.41,2986.03,"Well, I think it would be absolutely stunning if this Court said that bribery and corruption laws, which have been on the books since the beginning of this nation, and have been consistently enacted by Congress to combat both Federal, State, and local corruption --"
2015.15-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2986.03,2986.42,Would it be --
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2986.42,2986.57,And --
2015.15-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2986.57,2990.77,-- absolutely stunning to say that the government has given us no workable standard?
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2990.77,2992.85,"Well, we have given you a workable standard."
2015.15-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3007.81,3011.48,Perhaps what you're talking about is how evil the conspiracy is.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3019.84,3032.62,"I think what I'm trying to say, Justice Kennedy, is that it's going to be extremely difficult for anyone to really believe that you could buy a Governor's position on a multimillion-dollar tax support for an afternoon of trout fishing."
2015.15-474,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3039.09,3045.525,"Can I ask you a narrower question, Mr. Dreeben? So one of the ""official acts"" here -- I'll just read it to you."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3054.415,3054.7,Yes.
2015.15-474,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3054.7,3060.425,So that's essentially hosting a party and allowing Mr. Williams to invite some people.
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3065.275,3067.79,"So, Justice Kagan, it wasn't hosting an official party."
2015.15-474,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3083.62,3098.595,"So here's, I guess -- I mean, I guess, my question is this: The -- the ""official act,"" the statute, the definition, I mean, requires that there be some particular matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy, correct?"
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3098.595,3099.27,Yes.
2015.15-474,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3099.27,3112.925,"And if I understand the theory of this case, the matter, suit, cause, proceeding, or controversy here is the attempt to get the University of Virginia to do clinical studies of this product; is that correct?"
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3112.925,3117.73,"It's narrower than our whole scope of the charge, but it's essentially correct."
2015.15-474,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3117.73,3118.86,That's the gravamen of the thing?
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3118.86,3119.48,Correct.
2015.15-474,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3119.48,3141.95,"So if you had just -- if -- if the indictment, and then the instructions that were based on the indictment, had said the ""official act"" is getting the University of Virginia to do clinical studies, right, that reads very differently from the way this indictment was structured."
2015.15-474,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3192.105,3216.72,"So, Justice Kagan, what the crime was here was the Governor accepting things of value in return for being influenced and taking ""official actions"" to legitimize, promote, and secure research studies for Anatabloc and Star's products. That's at Supplemental JA 14. It then alleges that he would do this as opportunities arose in the course of his official actions."
2015.15-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3348.28,3352.12,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Francisco, five minutes remaining."
2015.15-474,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3352.12,3415.22,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I have three basic points I would like to make. First, I'd like to start out with the government's argument that a lot of the problems with its theory are solved by the quid pro quo requirement. Well, in fact, the gratuity statute, the Federal gratuity statute, has the exact same ""official act"" requirement, but no quid pro quo requirement at all. So what that means is that if you take somebody to a fancy lunch with a -- I can't remember the name of the bottle of wine you mentioned, Justice Breyer, but if you took them to that fancy lunch to thank them for referring you to a meeting with a mid-level staffer, even if there was no suggestion at all that you were going to do anything other than call that staffer and say, hey, can you take a meeting with this guy, hear him out, and exercise your independent judgment, that would be a violation of the Federal gratuity statute. And, indeed, under the government's broad theory that anything within the range of official duties counts, that means that if you took the person out to that lunch as thanks for giving you a tour of the Capitol Building, you would likewise have violated the Federal gratuity statute, because there, there is no quid pro quo requirement at all. Point two, Justice Breyer --"
2015.15-474,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3415.22,3437.19,"There is a difference between someone saying, thank you for a decision you made independent of the gift -- that's the Sun Growers case -- and someone buying you an expensive lunch and saying, I'm paying for this lunch, but make sure I get a tour."
2015.15-474,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3438.68,3469.76,"Not under the Federal gratuity statute, Your Honor, because the Federal gratuity statute is meant to prohibit thanking somebody for giving you an ""official act."" And so if an ""official act"" is, in fact, a tour of the Capitol Building or a meeting with a staffer, then you have, in fact, violated the Federal gratuity statute when you take them to lunch as a thanks for that particular act. Second point, Justice Breyer, in trying to figure out the right verbal formulation, the first point I'd like to make is, if we can't figure out a proper verbal formulation, then I think there are some ver serious vagueness problems with the statute --"
2015.15-474,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3469.76,3470.555,It's Birdsall.
2015.15-474,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3470.555,3471.1,You --
2015.15-474,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3471.1,3472.605,It's Birdsall.
2015.15-474,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3497.345,3497.84,And --
2015.15-474,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3497.84,3515.315,"Now, my problem is with Birdsall and how do we write those words so that they do catch people who are doing this dishonest thing without, as I've said five times, allowing the government the freedom to go and do these ridiculous cases."
2015.15-474,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3515.315,3517.84,And -- and I think the D.C. Circuit's en banc decision --
2015.15-474,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3517.84,3520.355,"Not saying this is a ridiculous one, by the way."
2015.15-474,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3520.355,3521.635,"Understood, Your Honor."
2015.15-474,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3527.33,3527.53,Uh-huh.
2015.15-474,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3527.53,3529.735,"-- question, matter, suit, cause proceeding."
2015.15-474,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3550.46,3584.85,"What do you say to Mr. Dreeben's argument that if we read this statute as you are urging, then every government official can say, you want to have a meeting? Pay me a thousand dollars. The corruption that's inherent in the position that says it's okay to facilitate a meeting, it's okay to say, I'll do it for you if you pay me a thousand dollars. That's your view, that that would be okay?"
2015.15-474,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3584.85,3597.15,"Your Honor, and, frankly, this was leading to my third point, which is, if there is absolutely no way that -- if there's no indicia that you're actually trying to influence the outcome, and it really is just a meeting, yes."
2015.15-474,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3609.215,3612.31,That hasn't happened in quite some time. (Laughter.)
2015.15-474,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3612.31,3612.84,Justice Ginsburg.
2015.15-474,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3616.5,3626.61,"Justice Ginsburg, my apologies. There are lots of other statutes that would prohibit that precise conduct, and you don't need to take statutes like the Hobbs Act and honest-services statute."
2015.15-474,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3626.61,3641.395,"Well, what would -- Mr. Francisco, just take Mr. Dreeben's own example, which is the example of somebody -- he's running a business, and he's taking $5,000 at a pop every time he arranges a meeting with the criminal division for somebody."
2015.15-474,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3641.395,3642.18,Sure.
2015.15-474,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3677.2,3678.73,Why aren't they any less vague?
2015.15-474,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3678.73,3679.51,Excuse me?
2015.15-474,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3679.51,3694.76,"Why aren't they any less vague? And what you're saying is that holding a meeting, taking a phone call, having a party is not illegal, that that is something that you're entitled to do."
2015.15-474,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3698.475,3709.55,"They may well be in certain circumstances, but I think that the ones that are simply saying -- for example, the civil service statutes that simply say, you can't take anything from anybody who is a covered person."
2015.15-474,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3737.5,3747.355,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben, could I invite you to return to the lectern? Our records reflect that this was your one-hundredth oral argument before the Court."
2015.15-474,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3781.21,0.0,Thank you.
