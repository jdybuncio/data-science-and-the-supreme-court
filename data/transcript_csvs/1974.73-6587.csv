1974.73-6587,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.536,"We'll hear arguments next in 6587, Herring against New York."
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,41.822,45.021,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-6587,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,152.084,156.795,How long should the summation be allowed Ms. Steele?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,156.795,167.963,"Well, I think that the court has discretion to stop closing argument and I think that his discretion is reviewable on appeal."
1974.73-6587,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,210.768,218.532,Are you saying that there's no right of review under the New York system as a matter of discretion?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,218.532,225.051,"Now under the New York statute, an abuse of discretion would be reviewed."
1974.73-6587,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,225.051,226.046,It is reviewable?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,226.046,228.118,"It is reviewable, yes."
1974.73-6587,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,248.48,251.017,We will resume at that point at 1 o'clock Ms. Steele.
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,268.634,273.102,May it please the Court.
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,297.122,302.214,"Ms. Steele, is this statute applied to all arguments in the appellate courts?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,302.214,303.314,"No, it does not."
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,303.426,307.067,And it did the difference?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,307.067,307.277,Yes.
1974.73-6587,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.611,355.866,That isn't entirely true here though is it?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,371.232,378.556,"It was after -- everything was elicited that he was -- that in effect, the guiding hand of counsel was withdrawn."
1974.73-6587,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,380.852,394.671,"There's quite of difference between a trial and an appellate procedure in that at the trial, particularly in a bench trial, there's no questions of law really, the factual issues to be resolved?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,394.671,395.858,"Yes, that's right."
1974.73-6587,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,395.858,400.364,And just the offset in the appellate process?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,400.364,400.684,Yes.
1974.73-6587,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,401.681,403.338,"I don't know which way it cuts, but that issue --"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,403.338,416.462,"Well, the appellate court I think jurisdiction to -- in New York at least can we determine facts, but they don't redetermine them with the same -- with the same standard that the trial court does."
1974.73-6587,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,420.749,425.896,"They sometimes consider sufficiency of the evidence when its urged it on, do they not?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,425.896,426.14,Yes.
1974.73-6587,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,428.743,430.284,What about the Courts of Appeals?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,442.266,447.061,"Well, I think that when you have a brief, I think you're in a different position."
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,471.525,480.403,"And yet I suppose Ms. Steele at least for some judges, it's easy to hear and put all that listening than they do at reading?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,480.403,481.058,Yes.
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,481.748,486.735,-- with that kind of judge you just have in plea?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,486.735,489.175,"Well for that kind of judge, yes."
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,498.798,503.359,That's why you're here for the statute?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,503.359,513.76,"It wouldn't satisfy me, no because I think that in a summation, particularly in a non-jury trial, there is an opportunity for give and take."
1974.73-6587,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,520.909,522.607,"Well, how much rapport are you going to have it?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,533.884,544.362,"Well, I think that that would be something in the judgment of counsel I think that he would -- to judge the effectiveness of his summation in that situation."
1974.73-6587,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,596.231,598.184,Is it -- excuse me.
1974.73-6587,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,598.184,601.842,What if the judge said I have many other things to do.
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,610.913,613.31,I think that would put me in a different position.
1974.73-6587,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,631.039,639.145,"Is it customary in the New York trial courts to have trial memoranda, some jurisdictions -- some never heard of it."
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,639.145,649.741,"On issues of law I think it is, but on summations, not on issues of fact I don't believe."
1974.73-6587,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,649.741,652.036,"Ms. Steele, what about the different kind of case."
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,664.499,679.066,"If counsel wanted to be heard, I think he would have a right to be heard on certainly in the jury trial context, regardless of the weight of the evidence, counsel would have a right to present a summation."
1974.73-6587,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,690.234,697.147,"Even assuming that the judge could not remember a whole day, what happened?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,697.147,698.05,I think that there are two --
1974.73-6587,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,698.05,716.531,"If the judge did get that from the lawyer, I think the judge was given this bias attention and let him argue, and I did make a mistake in the word I use, his biased attention."
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,716.531,716.876,Well --
1974.73-6587,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,716.876,720.715,Can you tell the judge he doesn't remember what happened a half hour ago?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,720.715,726.121,"Oh, I think that there are two reasons that we must require closing argument in a non-jury trial."
1974.73-6587,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,733.694,736.573,But he's not taking notes?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,736.573,737.946,"Yes Your Honor, but --"
1974.73-6587,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,737.946,739.731,Doesn't he have to make findings?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,740.597,741.104,No.
1974.73-6587,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,751.928,754.033,"But the rule, but he can request it?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,754.033,756.499,"He can request that, but there is no assurance that he would get it."
1974.73-6587,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,756.499,760.01,"But suppose he got it, then would he still have to have argue it?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,760.01,777.538,"Yes, I think that he would because while findings of facts in conclusion of law protect the accuracy of the judge's memory because it ensures that he goes over the evidence, there's also another basis for requiring closing argument, and that is --"
1974.73-6587,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,777.538,780.043,"It was a lawyer himself, you know, he can --"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,780.043,780.975,"Yes Your Honor, but I --"
1974.73-6587,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,780.975,785.804,"He can't remember like a lawyer, that's a tried in the case, can he?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,785.804,787.998,"Yes, but I think it's critical that the defense get its --"
1974.73-6587,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,787.998,793.429,But he shouldn't have the biased opinion of the lawyer?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,793.429,803.573,"Well, I think that another prong of this argument is that the defendant is entitled to have his theory presented to have --"
1974.73-6587,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,803.573,806.657,His theory is that he wasn't there.
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,813.266,821.996,"Yes, he has but I think that the defendant is entitled to have his attorney draw the inferences, favorable to the defense on that evidence."
1974.73-6587,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,843.016,853.701,Judge says “It's a very simple case and I don't you see why you need to argue” and the lawyer says “But I insist on arguing.
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,866.836,879.721,"That maybe true Mr. Justice Marshall, but I think that counsel is entitled to make the decision that this will not help the defendant at all and waive closing argument."
1974.73-6587,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,885.927,893.101,If the judge says “I don't want any closing argument” and counsel said “But I insist you have closing argument.
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,896.604,897.508,"Yes, I do."
1974.73-6587,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,897.508,900.997,-- along with his client's throat?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,900.997,901.264,Yes.
1974.73-6587,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,950.253,958.359,"Mr. Adams really didn't press his point very much, it strikes me from reading page 92 of the transcript."
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,977.821,986.728,"Well, under the New York statute, the judge did have the discretion, and I think there wasn't too much more for counsel to say."
1974.73-6587,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,998.351,999.699,He made his record?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,999.699,1001.968,"I think he did make his record, yes Your Honor."
1974.73-6587,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1001.968,1017.481,"Could I go back to while this maybe repetitious and the Chief Justice may have asked it, but if there is a right to summation, is there a right to a minimum time to summarize?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1017.481,1020.837,I think to that would vary on a case-to-case basis.
1974.73-6587,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1068.792,1076.333,"So, there is a standard of discretionary review then, so long as there is some time granted, but not --"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1076.333,1086.635,"Yes, that's right because I think in the very different position when the court has said “I've heard enough” from when the court says “I don't want to hear anything.”"
1974.73-6587,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1086.635,1090.692,"Of course, he'd been listening to counsel for several days in this case?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1090.692,1090.871,Yes.
1974.73-6587,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1106.921,1123.69,"But what you're saying is that even though a judge is satisfied from hearing counsel over this period of time that counsel couldn't materially assist him in reaching a just decision on the facts, nonetheless, he's got to hear him?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1123.69,1144.547,"I think that it is counsel's decision at the end of the evidence to consider whether he can assist the fact finder, whether his theory of the defense has been presented adequately to ensure that the judge will consider all the evidence."
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1246.358,1255.584,"Ms. Steele, I gather from your reply brief that it is a non-jury misdemeanor type of trial to which this statute applies?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1255.584,1256.743,"An identical statute applies to it, yes."
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1256.743,1259.487,"Yes, another but same kind of statute?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1259.487,1259.857,Yes.
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1259.857,1264.664,"But tell me in this case, there was of course a waiver of jury trial, was there not?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1264.664,1264.922,Yes.
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1265.918,1281.337,"Now, the state argues that that waiver of jury trial because this statute was on the books at the time when the waiver subsumed, and I gather you could waive jury trial without the assistance counsel, can't you in New York?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1281.337,1283.429,"Yes, I believe you can."
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1283.429,1294.848,"And that this waiver subsumes also where the discretion is exercised against a summation, a waiver of the right to some of it?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1294.848,1295.919,"Yes, that is --"
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1295.919,1296.665,What do you say to that?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1296.665,1297.59,-- the state's position.
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1300.469,1301.183,Why?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1301.183,1309.222,Because I think that it's putting in impermissible condition on appellant's statutory right to forgo a jury.
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1312.584,1315.403,But what -- how is that a constitutional argument?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1323.486,1324.03,"Well, yes."
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1345.195,1354.179,Are there cases we've had are burden on the constitutional right to jury trial?
1974.73-6587,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1354.179,1354.854,Jackson?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1357.935,1358.806,"Yes, yes."
1974.73-6587,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.057,1367.692,"It's a burden on your state rights, it's a burden on your state rights the way."
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1372.166,1390.604,"Yes, but I -- well, as in North Carolina versus Pearce and in Green versus United States, that was the statutory right to appeal and yet, the Court didn't permit penalizing someone for electing to exercise that statutory right."
1974.73-6587,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.306,1405.543,For what the statute on its face that you may waive the jury trial if you also -- if you also waive the right to summation?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1405.543,1411.758,"Well, if you assume that these two can be tied in together --"
1974.73-6587,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1411.758,1422.826,"Well, suppose the statute had said on its face, “you may waive the jury trial if you waive the right to summation, but not otherwise?”"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1422.826,1425.698,I think it would still be an impermissible condition.
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1425.698,1427.805,You'd be here attacking the statute on its face?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1427.805,1428.733,Yes.
1974.73-6587,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.733,1433.124,"You mean, you have -- that the constitutional right to waive the jury trial, or you tell there is?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1433.124,1433.285,No.
1974.73-6587,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1459.517,1464.774,"At least, I suppose you would say the first person has the right to the argue --"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1464.774,1464.854,Yes.
1974.73-6587,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1464.854,1471.905,-- that you have the right to say I never -- I never -- I have the right to claim that this was unconstitutional.
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1486.527,1486.845,No.
1974.73-6587,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1522.862,1535.805,"Ms. Steele, is this the only kind of case in the New York system where a statute provides for absence of a right to summarize?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1542.811,1549.703,I do not know in the civil cases in New York --
1974.73-6587,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1549.703,1552.599,I thought your brief for summary in the briefs it said so.
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1552.599,1561.592,"Well, I think that two states have held that the right in the non-jury trial is absolute in the civil context."
1974.73-6587,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1567.773,1573.866,But there were a statute from the civil side similar to the one under attack here.

1974.73-6587,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.258,1601.631,Are there any of the cases in other states or federal courts that agree with the decision at all?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1601.631,1601.83,Yes.

1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1615.821,1618.308,How close is that division?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1618.308,1622.754,There are nine jurisdictions that are hold that it is a fundamental right.
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1622.754,1623.962,On constitutional grounds?
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1623.962,1625.739,On constitutional grounds.
1974.73-6587,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1639.825,1644.103,"And holding, it is not a constitutional right?"
1974.73-6587,0,21573,diana_a_steele,,1644.103,1644.403,Yes.
1974.73-6587,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1721.384,1725.459,Very well Ms. Steele.
1974.73-6587,1,37196,norman_c_morse,,1728.716,1736.173,Mr. Chief Justice and the Court -- may it please the Court.
1974.73-6587,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1822.402,1826.355,"Mr. Morse, assure me as to one thing."
1974.73-6587,1,37196,norman_c_morse,,1853.419,1867.203,"There is -- this question was reviewable in the state court, that's correct."
1974.73-6587,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1867.203,1877.801,"And on the statute as my brother Blackmun suggests in his question, I suppose that the standard would be whether or not the trial judge abused his discretion in cutting off --"
1974.73-6587,1,37196,norman_c_morse,,1877.801,1878.906,That is correct.
1974.73-6587,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1878.906,1879.501,That would be --
1974.73-6587,1,37196,norman_c_morse,,1879.501,1881.066,-- that is reviewable.
1974.73-6587,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1881.066,1883.181,But that would be the standard of review.
1974.73-6587,1,37196,norman_c_morse,,1883.181,1883.856,That's right.
1974.73-6587,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1883.856,1890.589,Not whether -- and that's rather as he goes now of rather strict standard.
1974.73-6587,1,37196,norman_c_morse,,1890.589,1892.175,"Now, --"
1974.73-6587,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1892.175,1895.766,Is that correct that the standard would be whether or not there was an abuse of discretion --
1974.73-6587,1,37196,norman_c_morse,,1895.766,1908.987,"An abuse of discretion in this instance and had this been a protracted trial, involve issues, perhaps that you could say that it had been an abuse of discretion, but it was not a protracted trial."
1974.73-6587,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2074.656,2076.694,Did the judge tell him?
1974.73-6587,1,37196,norman_c_morse,,2076.694,2081.409,There was no comment made one way or another with respect to summation.
1974.73-6587,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2084.38,2087.98,That's an intelligent waiver?
1974.73-6587,1,37196,norman_c_morse,,2087.98,2091.11,I say that's an intelligent waiver.
1974.73-6587,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2259.312,2261.091,No.
1974.73-6587,1,37196,norman_c_morse,,2266.194,2266.829,Yes.

1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2680.216,2680.466,Yes.
1974.73-6587,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2683.91,2689.631,Would you disagree with your colleague as to what the division is among the states on this question?
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2689.631,2690.379,No.
1974.73-6587,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2698.592,2699.362,Is against you.
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2699.362,2702.429,"Is against us, both pre and post and --"
1974.73-6587,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2702.429,2706.292,And on what federal constitutional ground are those concerned?
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2706.292,2709.769,They just talk about the Due Process Clause Mr. Justice Brennan.
1974.73-6587,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2710.204,2711.506,Not the Sixth Amendment?
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2711.506,2711.656,No.
1974.73-6587,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2719.633,2723.457,"Because it's even before, we extended the Sixth to the states to sum up --"
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2723.457,2731.891,"Well, to settle this, I'm thinking of the Florida case which was pre-Gideon and I believe, that was decided in --"
1974.73-6587,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2731.891,2733.176,Finally in cut?
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2733.176,2750.718,"19 -- it was 1956, Boyd against State, that was decided, yes, in 195 -- no, I take it back."
1974.73-6587,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2822.349,2824.915,"How about civil cases, is there -- will be --"
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2824.915,2834.713,I know of no statute Judge White which provides for summing up in a civil case as such in New York.
1974.73-6587,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2834.713,2838.526,"But nevertheless, do you have the right?"
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2838.526,2840.502,By custom of usage.
1974.73-6587,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2878.273,2882.564,"Of course, there you need a transcript don't you if you're going to brief the facts?"
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2882.564,2889.188,"By law in New York, there must be a transcript prepared, taken down in every case."
1974.73-6587,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2895.868,2898.726,You mean a daily --
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2898.726,2899.944,"No, no, no, no, no."
1974.73-6587,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2919.305,2921.594,But sometime when he lapse?
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2921.594,2923.756,"Several days, depending -- I would assume -"
1974.73-6587,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2923.756,2928.002,"From a court reporter, you could get a transcript in several days?"
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2928.002,2932.65,This was only a 90-page transcript Your Honor.
1974.73-6587,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2941.661,2950.19,How does this suggestion for briefing on the factual issues in a non-jury criminal case usually come about?
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2956.961,2960.382,I'm just talking about on a hypothetical question.
1974.73-6587,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2981.86,2986.413,And that's when it freshest in the judge's mind is right after --
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2986.413,2988.907,That's correct.
1974.73-6587,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2988.907,2998.055,"As I recall it on Monday, he modified if not reversed ruling on evidence that he made on Friday."
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,2999.18,3000.938,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.73-6587,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3067.619,3068.9,You keep saying about all.
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,3076.053,3076.685,That's correct.
1974.73-6587,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3076.685,3079.182,"Confession, why are you bringing those up?"
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,3079.182,3080.445,I'm not.
1974.73-6587,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3080.445,3083.833,Ah.
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,3083.833,3087.163,I'm not bringing those up Justice Marshall.

1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,3087.871,3088.512,I promise.
1974.73-6587,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3088.512,3098.883,Okay.
1974.73-6587,2,25652,gabriel_i_levy,,3098.883,3117.808,"And basically, there is no fundamental federally protected constitutional right to sum up in a non-jury case, and the entire argument of the appellants here is that such right exists."
