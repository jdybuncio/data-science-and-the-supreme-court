1965.412,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,10.159,"Number 412, Salvatore Shillitani, Petitioner versus United States."
1965.412,0,16373,albert_j_krieger,,21.152,27.476,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.412,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.013,451.044,That's --
1965.412,0,16373,albert_j_krieger,,451.044,451.93,-- administration of justice --
1965.412,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.93,465.891,"-- that distinction counsel goes to the question of whether it should be in the federal system, at least a 42 (a) procedure or 42 (b) procedure which was the subject of the Court's recent decision in Harris, doesn't it?"
1965.412,0,16373,albert_j_krieger,,465.891,465.914,No sir--
1965.412,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,465.914,467.573,The sanction you've just made.
1965.412,0,16373,albert_j_krieger,,467.573,485.844,"No, I don't believe that -- that applies Mr. Justice Stewart necessarily because just because there was a hearing, I do not state that the court is authorized to impose a sentence in excess of six months."
1965.412,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,493.143,494.402,Yes.
1965.412,0,16373,albert_j_krieger,,494.402,500.235,-- the court imposes a sentence in excess of that reserve for petty offenses.
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1530.58,1532.889,I think that there were arrangements to these --
1965.412,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1532.889,1533.492,I beg your pardon.
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1533.492,1535.287,I think that there were arrangements that (Voice Overlap) --
1965.412,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1535.287,1537.558,"Yes, alright."
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1552.354,1553.001,Pappadio.
1965.412,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1553.001,1557.113,"Pappadio, very well."
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1557.113,1559.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1681.719,1683.102,"Now, may I ask you Mr. Kossman."
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1683.102,1683.599,Sure.
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1683.599,1688.258,Is this order in the same form of that involved in the Shillitani?
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1688.258,1690.037,It is and it isn't.
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1691.034,1693.661,"Oh well, let me ask more directly counsel."
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1700.461,1702.7,It has.
1965.412,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1758.797,1759.314,Who made that suggestion?
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1759.314,1760.743,The Assistant District Attorney.
1965.412,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1760.743,1762.622,Yes.
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1762.622,1768.798,"The Assistant District Attorney was the one who suggested, “By rule of the show cause, let's have a hearing 42 (b).”"
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1804.474,1816.332,"But Mr. Kossman, I thought something you just said, indicated that the form of order entered here is the same as a form of order entered to the court."
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1818.529,1819.123,I beg your pardon.
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1819.123,1826.397,Can't we -- can't we suppose that the interpretation of that order would be that given in the Shillitani case.
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1826.397,1828.614,"I would say so, no question about that."
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1828.614,1832.701,"Well again, let me ask you what I asked Mr. Krieger."
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1835.518,1841.935,"No, my man spent 20 days in jail and our argument on the reasonableness is he shouldn't have spent two days in jail."
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1841.935,1843.474,"Well I know, but he spent 20?"
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1843.474,1844.064,He spent 20 days.
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1844.064,1860.663,But if we -- if we should conclude that this really is nothing more than a civil contempt order and washout the two-year thing on the ground that it's maximum limit had to be the life of the grand jury.
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1863.629,1870.968,"Well, if Your Honor please, it's a practical proposition representing an individual suffering from a two-year (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1870.968,1875.87,"Well, it's gone -- my hypothesis is that it's gone."
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1875.87,1883.752,"If you -- if this Court puts it that way that they wish to do it, then I'll forget all about the jury trial."
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1890.114,1890.752,"Oh, I see."
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1890.752,1890.839,I don't --
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1890.839,1892.594,You don't think we do?
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1894.232,1903.578,"I mean that you can reduce it on the grounds that the reasonableness I mean, but you can't call this a civil contempt because this is a criminal contempt proceeding."
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1904.332,1905.507,"Well, that's the label on it."
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1906.548,1907.957,"Well, it's more than the label."
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1915.18,1918.365,"In other words, you -- you just want us to decide the jury trial question?"
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1918.365,1920.227,No -- no.
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1922.497,1926.261,I think it would be a lot more interesting in getting your client a relief from the effect of this order.
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,1926.261,1933.835,"I say this, if Your Honor wishes to do that, I mean I have -- that's the end of the argument."
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2344.272,2346.66,Does that brief argue that that was significant?
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,2346.66,2347.386,I beg your pardon?
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2347.386,2349.577,Does that brief argue that the dropping of the --
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,2349.577,2349.605,No.
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2349.605,2351.317,-- indictment is significant?
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,2351.317,2351.709,No.
1965.412,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2369.328,2373.21,"You mean, you see there's sort of psychological approach to us in the way they've handled it?"
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,2373.717,2376.067,"Well, I don't want to read -- I'm grateful."
1965.412,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2615.513,2619.137,"May I ask you, are you still arguing the question of reasonableness of the punishment?"
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,2619.137,2620.02,Yes.
1965.412,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2644.651,2665.382,"Well, assuming -- assuming that the judges found a legitimate way to do it, that this is a proper prosecution, and the man is willfully and deliberately decline to answer questions, on what basis can you argue that two years is an unreasonable punishment to this."
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,2665.382,2668.992,On what basis can I argue that two years is an unreasonable sentence?
1965.412,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2669.869,2676.718,"Suppose he just deliberately made it up, committed to -- decided that he will not answer any question."
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,2680.266,2683.84,"Well, leaving aside the jury trial portion where that --"
1965.412,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2683.84,2684.872,What I'm asking is --
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,2684.872,2687.306,"-- leaving aside the Barnett, I'm coming to that next."
1965.412,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2687.306,2688.425,--used about that.
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,2688.425,2689.083,Oh yes.
1965.412,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2689.083,2694.963,Why are you saying that this is an unreasonable punishment if he's guilty of what they found him to be guilty of?
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,2694.963,2708.309,"But there's no -- but the point is I go back to the good words, to the noble words that Justice Harlan -- I have to address myself to the four justices who subscribed to the (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.412,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2708.309,2711.588,But did they indicate that you couldn't give a man two years punishment --
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,2711.588,2711.823,Oh --
1965.412,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2711.823,2716.67,"-- who was deliberately thrown in the court, decline to (Inaudible)?"
1965.412,1,31311,jacob_kossman,,2716.67,2724.255,"Yes, but it's been brought out in this particular case just like in the Harris case, there were -- there was no grace and effort here."
1965.412,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3322.677,3326.482,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.412,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3397.441,3399.524,Reduced or terminated?
1965.412,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3399.524,3406.249,Reduced in effect -- in effect call it to reduce to the portion already served.
1965.412,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3437.272,3440.048,"Well, may I ask you that Mr. Spritzer."
1965.412,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3448.081,3471.445,"Well, I construe this as a criminal contempt judgment Your Honor because if there should be a refusal to comply with the order, I take it that under the terms of the judgment, the sentence would be two years and not the duration of the grand jury which was then in session."
1965.412,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3476.352,3477.619,"Well that -- then, that is to say --"
1965.412,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3477.619,3477.981,I think it is (Voice Overlap) --
1965.412,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3477.981,3482.088,"-- initially, we must reach the constitutional question?"
1965.412,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3482.088,3482.762,Yes.
