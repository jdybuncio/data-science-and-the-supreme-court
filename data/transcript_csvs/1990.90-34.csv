1990.90-34,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.019,"We'll hear argument next in Number 90-34, the Exxon Corporation v. Central Gulf Lines, Inc.--"
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,43.861,47.531,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-34,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,117.228,121.439,"Mr. Pare, before you go any further, do you... what do we have before us here?"
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,129.884,133.317,"Your Honor, the primary question is whether there is admiralty jurisdiction."
1990.90-34,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,133.918,139.072,Can I find that there is admiralty jurisdiction and say that I don't know whether there's a lien or not?
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,140.043,143.284,"--It is possible to find that, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,160.816,171.843,"Well, will there be cases in which there is admiralty jurisdiction but no lien when the cause of action is to recover for the furnishing of money or supplies?"
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,171.843,173.204,--For the furnishing of--
1990.90-34,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,173.204,175.166,Of money or supplies.
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,175.166,192.677,"--There, in such cases there will be, presuming the necessary ingredient is admiralty jurisdiction, but whether there is a lien will depend perhaps on, to some extent on the status of the party providing the lien involved."
1990.90-34,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,208.227,210.959,"No, because there are admiralty collision cases, et cetera."
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,224.787,238.798,"Your Honor, I could certainly conceive of... I would believe that in the area of physical supplies of necessaries to vessels, in most cases that I can conceive of right now that should probably give rise to a lien."
1990.90-34,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,238.798,246.572,Of course they could recite in the contract I am relying exclusively upon the solvency of the owner.
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,249.454,250.175,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,250.175,252.016,But it would still be an admiralty contract.
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,252.016,252.817,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.817,254.837,So it would be resolved in an admiralty court--
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,254.837,255.869,That is correct.
1990.90-34,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,255.869,256.389,--but without a lien.
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,256.389,257.6,"That is correct, and there is--"
1990.90-34,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,257.6,265.704,Is it a correct... is it a correct statement of the law to say that not every maritime contract action gives right... gives rise to a maritime lien?
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,265.704,266.535,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,274.321,277.702,Nonetheless admiralty jurisdiction would entertain that sort of suit?
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,277.702,278.343,Absolutely.
1990.90-34,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,380.979,391.838,"Well, why isn't the preliminary contract rule adequate for differentiating contracts within and without admiralty jurisdiction?"
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,391.838,392.589,Your Honor--
1990.90-34,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,392.589,397.2,It seems to have been employed quite extensively.
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,397.2,407.098,"--I think a redefined preliminary contract rule, as apparently exists in Bodena, would be an acceptable way to delimit admiralty jurisdiction."
1990.90-34,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,450.125,456.569,"Well, that's kind of a modification, is it, of that preliminary contract rule."
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,470.328,483.376,"Well, Your Honor, we submit that the essence of what is going on in here, as this Court has recognized, you don't look to what is going on physically on the vessel but you look at the essence of the transaction in a maritime contract."
1990.90-34,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,514.207,523.732,"Well, I wanted to ask you, you want the Court to overrule Minturn, but I'm curious exactly what rule you would have us adopt?"
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,539.293,539.673,"No, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,540.114,541.184,--a more specific rule in mind?
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,541.184,549.739,"--In fact, your Honor, we believe that rejecting the Minturn rule itself should enable any general agent to have admiralty jurisdiction."
1990.90-34,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.536,582.641,What about a travel agent who gets the passengers for a cruise line?
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,605.896,609.919,"Well, Your Honor, the devil that we do know has led to mass confusion--"
1990.90-34,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,609.919,610.75,"--He's a pretty bad devil, yes."
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,610.75,611.809,--as we have indicated in our brief.
1990.90-34,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.32,662.302,"Well, Mr. Pare, you say some agents would be kept out by your rule, the general agent would be put in."
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,666.587,673.051,"Well, Your Honor, it's almost by definition that a general agent performs key services on behalf of the vessel."
1990.90-34,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,679.566,687.17,"Well, is that actually how a general agent is defined, is that he performs services that are essential to the voyage?"
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,690.411,692.844,There are several definitions of what a general agent is.
1990.90-34,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,714.749,725.274,"If the general agent in a particular case did not provide services that were essential to the operation of the voyage, would that part of the general agent's services nonetheless be subject to admiralty jurisdiction?"
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,725.274,726.884,"It would depend on what they were, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.884,732.658,So the fact you have a contract of general agency doesn't get you an admiralty jurisdiction automatically?
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,735.742,746.599,"I would think so, but certainly in the normal course of the way the steamship business runs, as I say, I cannot conceive of a situation where a general agent would be performing services which were not essential to the voyage."
1990.90-34,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,746.599,748.249,"May I ask you a question, Mr Pare?"
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,751.251,763.348,"Well, that certainly was something that we opposed at the court of appeals level, but lost, and we take that finding for what it is."
1990.90-34,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,763.348,768.291,So all the talk about general agents doesn't really decide this case if Exxon is not a general agent?
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,768.291,780.072,"No, Your Honor, but the corollary or the other part of what we're arguing here is really one and the same, because if... certainly Exxon is performing an essential maritime service."
1990.90-34,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,781.281,789.306,"Well, I can understand an argument that an agent that performs... services essential to the voyage be the kind of relationship that supports admiralty jurisdiction."
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,796.081,801.324,"--Well, simply because the finding, the final finding in this case, is that Exxon was a general agent."
1990.90-34,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,801.324,802.215,Was a general agent?
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,802.215,802.646,Yes.
1990.90-34,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,803.955,807.988,Holding of Minturn that general agents are per se excluded from admiralty jurisdiction.
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,808.339,810.089,"--That is the per se rule of Minturn, yes."
1990.90-34,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,810.089,813.762,"Well, was this case even within the Minturn rule?"
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,813.762,815.542,"Well, that's what the court of appeals found, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,815.542,817.245,"Well, do you agree with that?"
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,817.245,833.014,"Well, if you take the proposition that a general agent is one who provides continuity of service, which is what the restatement on agency provides, then we are a general agent and we are therefore covered by the Minturn rule."
1990.90-34,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,833.014,838.78,"You couldn't make the argument that in Minturn there was a wide variety of services, and here just the supply of fuel?"
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,838.78,841.481,We made that argument in the court of appeals and we lost.
1990.90-34,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,841.481,848.033,The court of appeals really thought that if you supplied napkins to the ship regularly for 20 years you become a general agent?
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,851.586,858.332,"Well, I perhaps would be not speaking fairly about the court of appeals if I were to say that they would agree with that."
1990.90-34,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,879.006,885.43,Under Minturn we know that general agents are excluded from admiralty jurisdiction.
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,893.615,896.226,It does not follow a fortiori.
1990.90-34,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,910.124,917.02,So your position would be that you're not asking us to move admiralty jurisdiction outward all the way in a sense?
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,917.02,917.661,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,939.754,955.455,"The thing that bothers me is I don't understand, you are not arguing that even if Minturn continues to state the correct rule for general agents, you should nevertheless win because you're the kind of agent that provided essential services and therefore should support admiralty jurisdiction?"
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,955.455,959.578,If it were still within our power to argue that we weren't a general agent we would certainly argue that in the alternative.
1990.90-34,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,959.578,960.437,I see.
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,964.091,965.192,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1024.03,1029.262,It isn't entirely clear to me that you have even raised the lien question in your questions presented for certiorari.
1990.90-34,0,16694,armand_maurice_pare_jr,,1031.503,1049.315,"Well, Your Honor, for purposes of judicial economy and also for purposes of clarity in this confusing area, we respectfully submit that it would be appropriate and in keeping for the Court to pass on the lien question and direct the lower court below to enter judgment in favor of Exxon."
1990.90-34,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1052.548,1054.23,"Very well, Mr. Pare."
1990.90-34,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1055.841,1063.394,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-34,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1106.193,1112.158,"Well, what is the label that is given to the firm that is allowed to recover in your two examples?"
1990.90-34,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1112.158,1117.373,"Your Honor, we believe that the test should be--"
1990.90-34,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1117.373,1119.343,"No, I'm not asking what the test should be."
1990.90-34,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1133.742,1136.744,"--Your Honor, this case is the perfect example."
1990.90-34,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1137.295,1138.086,"Well, this person lost."
1990.90-34,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1138.086,1146.03,"--Exxon, with respect to one of the deliveries at issue, the New York delivery, it was characterized as a seller and it won."
1990.90-34,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1155.968,1158.52,"So it's the intervention of an agent, basically."
1990.90-34,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1158.52,1158.91,That's correct.
1990.90-34,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1180.923,1191.859,"Now, normally someone who supplies necessaries to a vessel in reliance on the credit of the vessel is entitled to a maritime lien?"
1990.90-34,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1191.859,1196.914,"--That's correct, Your Honor, with this qualification."
1990.90-34,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1209.931,1218.116,But because of the application of Minturn that relief is denied if the supplier is characterized as a general agent?
1990.90-34,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1218.116,1222.56,"--That is true, again, I'm sorry, with one qualification."
1990.90-34,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1252.751,1255.292,And what do you think the test should be?
1990.90-34,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1256.922,1265.36,"--We believe that the test should be, should depend on the nature of the goods or services furnished, regardless of the legal label."
1990.90-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1285.362,1291.838,"Would that include some general broker in the oil business who could just buy and sell oil all over the world, and just happened to fill a contract in one place?"
1990.90-34,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1291.838,1301.912,"My understanding, Your Honor, is that the admiralty jurisdiction extends only to those contracts providing goods or services for a particular vessel."
1990.90-34,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1314.571,1316.611,What about a spot purchase just for a particular vessel?
1990.90-34,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1326.619,1339.876,"An owner engages someone to make a spot purchase, that person pays for the fuel, puts it... it is put aboard the vessel, whether by the spot purchaser or someone else, we believe that's within agency... I mean within, excuse me, admiralty jurisdiction."
1990.90-34,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1350.795,1351.464,I take it--
1990.90-34,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1359.15,1362.022,"I don't understand there to be any differences, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1391.16,1392.851,Tell me if I'm right.
1990.90-34,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1426.824,1428.093,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.984,1431.647,"They don't really care what court they get into, whether it's a maritime court or not."
1990.90-34,1,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,1432.678,1435.42,--In this particular case it's essential.
1990.90-34,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.033,1642.715,"Thank you, Mr. Nightingale."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1645.337,1650.991,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1691.607,1693.71,Why can't... wow.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1713.792,1719.325,"--Your Honor, we submit that an agency contract is, by its very nature, a preliminary contract."
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.318,1722.649,Why?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1722.649,1724.769,--It is no different from any other non-maritime contract.
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1771.549,1786.061,"I take it, would you say that the... when Exxon itself is furnishing the fuel, such as in New York, would that contract to that extent be within maritime jurisdiction?"
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1786.061,1798.106,"At that... in their status as a physical supplier in New York, our position was that they were not entitled to a lien, but as far as being a maritime contract, as a physical supplier, as Justice O'Connor said--"
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.106,1798.577,So that you think--
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1798.577,1799.268,--They had the--
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1799.268,1803.602,--that contract to that extent would be within maritime jurisdiction?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1803.602,1805.002,"--When they had that hat on, yes."
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1810.245,1812.218,"Well, didn't they do a little bit more in this case?"
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1830.588,1831.539,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.053,1842.666,"Well, yeah, but... it may not buy it, but it became necessary for Exxon to pay the supplier itself."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1842.666,1846.068,"That was part of their longstanding relationship, their agency relationship--"
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1846.068,1852.554,"Well, I know, but nevertheless Exxon in this case paid the supplier for the fuel that the supplier furnished to the vessel."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1852.554,1854.194,"--Eventually, yes, Your Honor, they did."
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1854.194,1856.978,"Well, eventually, just as soon as it was billed it paid."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1856.978,1857.415,Yes.
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1861.229,1866.342,You think that's legally a distinction from what its status is in New York?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1866.342,1867.563,"--Yes, I do, Your Honor."

1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1884.714,1886.486,From a direct supplier.
1990.90-34,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1886.486,1891.96,From someone who has a direct contract with the ship or the ship's owner?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1891.96,1898.374,Direct contract... contact with the navigational operation or a direct juridical contact with maritime commerce.
1990.90-34,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1898.993,1903.467,"Well, what does a direct juridical contact with maritime commerce mean?"
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1903.467,1906.629,"--I had to look up juridical myself, Your Honor."

1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1910.361,1910.741,I understand.
1990.90-34,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1911.212,1912.684,--but I don't understand what the phrase means.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1912.684,1917.555,It means that they had to be involved in the maritime environment.
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.721,1925.66,Like selling oil to the ship.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1925.66,1926.191,--Pardon me?
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1926.191,1927.733,Like selling fuel to the ship.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1927.733,1929.884,"They were not selling it, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1931.524,1932.866,"I know, but in New York they are selling it."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1932.866,1933.676,"Yes, Your Honor, they were."
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1933.676,1938.61,And that is a direct enough connection with the ship to--
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1943.682,1945.884,"And then bills directly for that, yes."
1990.90-34,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1945.884,1946.485,--and bills direct.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1949.086,1950.428,"That is a supplier, yes."
1990.90-34,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1950.428,1951.029,Supplier.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1951.029,1952.388,There's a direct relationship.
1990.90-34,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1952.388,1956.001,But an agent is someone who is a step removed from that?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1956.001,1956.733,"A step removed, yes."
1990.90-34,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1978.274,1979.626,"May I ask this question, Mr. Montbach?"
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1987.563,1988.004,Arabian Marine.
1990.90-34,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1988.004,1991.546,--Would Arabian Marine have had a lien on the ship?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,1991.546,1995.638,"It is my understanding that they would have, possibly under Saudi law."
1990.90-34,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1995.638,2010.917,"So if looking at it from the point of view of general creditors wondering when the ship is subject to a lien, they could assume normally the supplier would have a lien, but then they'd realize they'd have these cases where there's an indirect relationship which would be excluded from what would otherwise be the general lien for fuel?"
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2010.917,2018.541,"As far as Saudi is concerned, they would not have a lien under the U.S. lien statute, because they specifically relied... I mean, Arabian Marine--"
1990.90-34,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2018.541,2019.883,Because they relied on Exxon.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2019.883,2021.204,--They relied on Exxon's credit.
1990.90-34,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2021.204,2028.73,"But it's only the terms of the contract between Arabian and Marine and Exxon that brings that about, something which the other general creditors wouldn't be aware of."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2028.73,2035.846,"Well, Your Honor... that's true, Your Honor, but also Arabian Marine specifically in this instance said they would not supply the vessel--"
1990.90-34,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2035.846,2036.724,Without getting paid first.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2036.724,2040.678,--They would not supply it at all unless Exxon said we will guarantee.
1990.90-34,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2040.678,2041.199,"Yeah, I understand."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2041.199,2044.5,So they specifically relied on the credit of Exxon.
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2044.5,2047.54,"Eventually they did, in your own words."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2047.54,2048.451,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2048.451,2051.273,Eventually they relied on--
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2051.273,2055.577,"No, they came to Exxon and said we will not supply this vessel."
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.577,2056.426,--Exactly.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2056.426,2061.371,"And then Exxon said we will take over the credit, the guarantee."
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2066.112,2071.299,Originally Arabian was furnishing oil directly to the vessel--
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2071.299,2071.466,"Yes, they were."
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.466,2073.268,--without relying on Exxon's credit.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2073.268,2075.239,For about a year-and-a-half period.
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.239,2075.69,Yes.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2078.272,2080.822,"No, it turned out that Waterman--"
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.822,2081.214,Yeah.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2081.214,2082.716,--They thought Waterman was not good for it.
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.716,2083.384,"Yes, yes."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2085.286,2086.005,Yes.
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2086.005,2088.989,"And Exxon said, well, so we'll pay you."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2088.989,2089.708,Yes.
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2089.708,2090.369,And they did.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2090.369,2091.551,"And they did, yes."
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2091.551,2096.223,And you say that doesn't change the situation at all--
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2096.223,2097.454,"Well, it doesn't change the--"
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.454,2098.485,--with respect to Exxon?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2098.485,2100.427,"--With respect to Exxon, no, Your Honor, it doesn't."
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2106.599,2108.302,"Yes, but you haven't made anything about that."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2152.17,2155.953,"If they had paid for it, Your Honor, then they would possibly fall within--"
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2155.953,2156.504,Possibly?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2156.504,2158.555,--within the advance theory.
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.555,2162.708,"I thought it's just general agents that are covered, and I wouldn't consider that a general agent."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2163.927,2166.869,"No, as a one term, as a one shot, one vessel--"
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2166.869,2167.36,--Right.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2167.36,2173.184,"--one port proposal, there have been some exceptions to this Minturn rule on the basis of the--"
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2173.184,2176.836,So it doesn't have anything to do with proximity.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2178.216,2182.791,--It has to do with whether the contract that is entered into is a maritime contract.
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.282,2204.633,Yeah.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2213.909,2221.356,"--Some courts have held it as the exception under the preliminary contract doctrine which is part of this general agency rule, or the general agency rule is subsumed within it."
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2245.579,2246.651,--What do you want us to do?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2249.102,2251.165,--We want you to reaffirm Minturn.
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2251.165,2253.096,"--Well, but that's not the rule you have been talking about."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2254.636,2256.509,"Minturn, as it is part of the preliminary contract rule, yes."
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.509,2263.853,"--Well, you don't have to be... it can be a preliminary contract so long as you're not a general agent, so long as you don't do this regularly."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2266.544,2272.288,"Preliminary contracts do not of necessity have to be general agency rules, but general agency rules, contract, excuse me, are preliminary contracts."
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.288,2272.769,That's true.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2272.769,2277.183,Just as you can have... if you don't have a maritime lien you don't have admiralty jurisdiction.
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2325.481,2326.293,How can Congress change it?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2327.164,2330.296,Congress has looked at this area four times.
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2334.388,2338.701,There's no equation between what the Constitution means by admiralty jurisdiction and what the statute does?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2338.701,2341.274,"Your Honor, there is an equation, yes."
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2351.649,2357.533,You don't expect Congress to pass a statute... would Congress responsibly be passing a statute that ignores Minturn?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2358.625,2372.355,"--If Congress wants to change the rule, as they did in 1910 and in 1920 to allow beneficiaries... in this instance change the Minturn rule, allow general agents to have liens... they can do so."
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2372.355,2373.113,To be within admiralty jurisdiction?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2386.583,2387.583,Yes.
1990.90-34,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2415.112,2417.843,"We're not talking the lien act, we're talking about admiralty jurisdiction."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2417.843,2419.613,--I think they're mixed.
1990.90-34,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2448.744,2457.78,Are agency contracts somehow to be discouraged because they are not promotive of sound growth for admiralty and for maritime commerce?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2457.78,2458.76,"No, they are not, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2472.671,2479.664,"Well, it's a secret lien, but the last in time always prevails, this odd rule in admiralty, so that it's not really so bad either, is it?"
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2479.664,2482.065,"--It does, but it's still secret to anyone who isn't aware of it."
1990.90-34,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2483.838,2486.979,"Well, if anybody provides services and they're last in time, then they collect."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2486.979,2495.454,--If the vessel was sold subsequent to that last provision of services the new buyer has no idea that there is a lien on this vessel.
1990.90-34,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2508.192,2510.825,It's an in rem against what?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2510.825,2515.507,"Against the vessel, but it does not follow the vessel once the vessel is sold."
1990.90-34,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2521.301,2525.204,"Would our courts have authority to do that, or would that contradict the existing statute?"
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2525.204,2530.527,"I think the courts would have the... not the courts, Congress would have the ability--"
1990.90-34,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2530.527,2531.749,"No, would our courts have the authority to--"
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2531.749,2532.907,--To create a lien?
1990.90-34,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2532.907,2539.423,"--adopt such a rule that the lien is in rem but doesn't follow the vessel, or would that contradict the existing statute?"
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2539.423,2541.053,I think it would contradict the existing statute.
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.98,2554.334,"Counsel, what's the significance of any, of the provision in the contract for a lien?"
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2557.255,2565.21,"Well, Your Honor, there is a general provision in Exxon's boilerplate contract which says that they reserve a right to lien--"
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.21,2565.771,For what?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2565.771,2568.302,"--For the provision of fuel, themselves."
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2568.302,2572.064,And so you think that provision would only apply to situations like in New York?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2572.064,2578.108,I think as far as Exxon is concerned it applies to them when they supply themselves.
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2582.591,2586.484,So does that add anything to maritime law?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2586.484,2588.404,"I don't think so, no, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2589.175,2590.026,Then you might as well leave it out?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2590.026,2592.338,"In this instance, yes."
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2592.338,2595.92,"Yeah, but here they say they would have a lien on the vessel, wouldn't they?"
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2597.172,2597.923,They say they have a lien on the vessel.
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.923,2604.778,"And that seems... they certainly were contemplating... both sides were, I suppose, that this would be subject to maritime law."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2604.778,2607.778,I don't think both sides were contemplating that.
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2617.915,2618.495,I see.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2618.495,2624.83,"Central Gulf Lines had a contract with Waterman that said don't put any liens, we prohibit you from putting any liens on this vessel."
1990.90-34,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2793.14,2812.322,"Mr. Montbach, supposing they had constructed a little different kind of legal relationship between the marine company in Saudi Arabia and Exxon pursuant to which they had said we, Exxon, want to buy 100,000 gallons of oil to be resold to the ship owner of the ship--"
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2812.322,2813.073,--To Waterman.
1990.90-34,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2813.073,2824.941,"--and then in effect said well, title will pass to us as soon as you pump it through the pipe and then it will pass from us to the ship owner 10 seconds thereafter, and you will be our agent for delivering our oil while we own it and while you're delivering it to the other."

1990.90-34,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2861.095,2863.676,Yeah.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2863.676,2864.835,Even though it is for 10 seconds.
1990.90-34,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2864.835,2865.887,Yeah.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2865.887,2870.449,So that we feel that this rule should be upheld.
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2914.32,2920.114,"Well, do you really think that all the courts of appeals that have dealt with this matter see eye to eye with you?"
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2920.114,2923.657,"I think as far as the general agency rule is, yes."
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.757,2927.598,"Pretty good ones, too."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2927.598,2931.451,"--The exceptions, Your Honor, have to do with--"
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2931.451,2932.633,I mean pretty substantial ones.
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,2932.633,2940.537,"--The exceptions have to do with entities that are involved with the operation, the physical operation of the vessel."
1990.90-34,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3012.034,3014.545,What are the time limitations on enforcing a lien?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,3014.545,3015.605,--There are none.
1990.90-34,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3017.618,3019.768,"Just laches, or--"
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,3019.768,3021.669,"I think there is some laches, yes."
1990.90-34,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3037.339,3049.828,--Is it your submission that overruling of Minturn would be detrimental to the commerce of the purchase and sale of vessels?
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,3049.828,3051.889,I think it would be detrimental to that area.
1990.90-34,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3073.553,3076.105,"Well, I don't know that that's the submission of the other side."
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,3089.964,3099.16,"If you overrule Minturn you're still going to have the vessel seized and an action in the admiralty courts, and then you would have the sorting out of the preliminary contract."

1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,3151.093,3154.134,"Yes, Your Honor, if we limit ourselves to the statute."
1990.90-34,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3160.159,3167.775,"And you do argue, don't you, that even if there's maritime jurisdiction that the terms of the lien act don't cover this particular facts?"
1990.90-34,2,24331,francis_a_montbach,,3167.775,3168.256,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-34,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3176.471,3177.452,Or for this agent even.
