2006.05-1382,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.224,"Now we'll hear argument in 05-1382, Gonzales versus Planned Parenthood Federation of America."
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,13.574,16.193,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
2006.05-1382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,72.262,76.214,"But the problem with this is that there... well, some doctors absolutely agree."
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,165.539,183.333,"Well, Justice Breyer, let me take as a point of departure the specific risks that you associated with the injection that induces fetal demise, because if there isn't a significant risk to that injection, then all the other benefits that are associated with the D&X procedure don't matter because they can perform the D&X procedure."
2006.05-1382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,197.427,211.001,"Is there a definition in the law of significant risk, other than doctors saying, I've been trained to try to save life and I want to perform the safest possible way?"
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,216.739,229.279,"With all respect, I think if a single injection that doesn't take any particular risk other than the fact that it's an injection, if that counts as a significant risk, then we might as well strike the word ""significant"" from the discussion in Stenberg."
2006.05-1382,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,237.402,240.687,"Well, my question is the same as Justice Breyer's."
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,263.202,267.671,"Well, it's a very difficult question to evaluate in the abstract, Justice Kennedy."
2006.05-1382,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,335.481,345.837,"Well, but there is a risk if the uterine wall is compromised by cancer or some forms of preeclampsia and it's very thin, there's a risk of being punctured."
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,345.837,360.114,"There is a risk, Justice Kennedy, but I think that, first of all, that even in those limited circumstances, that the marginal risk between the D&X procedure and the D&E procedure are really as far as I can tell nonexistent."
2006.05-1382,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,459.545,463.247,May I follow up on a question the Chief Justice asked you during the last argument?
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,477.691,483.245,"Well, justice Stevens, let me answer it this way and maybe if you want me to take you specifically to the text, I can do that."
2006.05-1382,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,532.159,543.365,"Would you measure the mens rea at the outset of the procedure when they begin the dilation a day or two before the actual operation is performed, or is it at the time of beginning the operation?"
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,543.365,545.817,I think you could measure it from either time point.
2006.05-1382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,628.868,630.07,I think you're wrong about... you're probably wrong about this.
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,653.251,654.984,"Oh, but can I respond to that specifically?"
2006.05-1382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,654.984,655.984,He says It is not always possible... what?
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,655.984,657.203,Can I respond to that specifically?
2006.05-1382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,657.203,659.238,"Well, he then goes; he tells you why."
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,677.449,679.985,"Justice Breyer, if I could respond to that."
2006.05-1382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,679.985,680.185,Yes.
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,680.185,683.77,"I mean, there are certain situations where the injection is contraindicated."
2006.05-1382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,721.145,726.364,"It's bothering me, why I'm using this as an illustration is that there are so many of these things."
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,758.151,767.941,"--Justice Breyer, I wish we were talking about just a few rare cases because I think if we were, there would be, the statute would be amenable to not being applied in those rare cases."
2006.05-1382,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,836.603,862.653,"Suppose the doctor has the intent, the good faith intent to perform a standard in utero D&E, and he knows because of what's happened in the last three months, with women with this particular shaped fetus and particular position of the fetus, that the chances are 50 percent, 60 percent that it's going to be an intact delivery, at which point he is presented with the problem."
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,873.71,875.978,I don't think so.
2006.05-1382,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,890.422,893.79,"Well, that's important to me because you seem to think that there is a standard D&E."
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,904.665,915.103,"--With respect, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's born out in this record, it's the other way, which is doctors who want to perform a D&X, often, in a majority of the cases end up performing a D&E."
2006.05-1382,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,926.845,932.649,"And I gather your submission is that we can tell who is setting out to perform which, by the dilation protocol."
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,935.851,936.117,Yes.
2006.05-1382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1043.57,1052.427,"Yes, once you're making a point of that study, I think it was also the case that the ones that had the intact were older or rather further along in pregnancy; isn't that true?"
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1052.427,1052.877,--That's right.
2006.05-1382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1052.877,1054.713,Therefore the risks were greater.
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1054.713,1055.429,Well if I could just--
2006.05-1382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1055.429,1059.748,"And therefore since the risks were greater, the other side says that this actually shows it was safer."
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1061.449,1071.555,"--I think it's even more complicated than that, Justice Breyer, because in fact, you're right that the D&X patients were at a further gestational age, but the D&E patients were actually older."
2006.05-1382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1072.59,1074.006,I missed that.
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1074.006,1074.706,--Right.
2006.05-1382,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1104.209,1105.061,General Clement--
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1105.061,1106.011,"Well, what did he find when he studied that?"
2006.05-1382,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1108.763,1122.771,"--Because your time is running out I did want to ask you about a feature of this legislation that hasn't come up so far, and that is perhaps stimulated by Stenberg."
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1160.096,1164.498,"Well, I mean I don't think it should figure in this Court's decision."
2006.05-1382,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1186.279,1188.465,"Well I know, when it is a question of funding--"
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1188.465,1192.417,"Well but also access to clinics, in the the face act, which is also--"
2006.05-1382,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1192.417,1198.171,The best example where the federal government has gotten involved in overriding what the states want to do is Casey.
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1204.908,1210.31,--Well... it's certainly true that abortion has been dealt with at a Federal level one way or another since 1973.
2006.05-1382,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1220.084,1222.201,"General Clement, That brings up a question I was intending to ask you."
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1238.712,1242.847,"--Justice Stevens, I don't think we have taken, the Federal Government hasn't taken a definitive position on that."
2006.05-1382,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1254.822,1259.476,But how could the Commerce Clause justify application to a free clinic?
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1260.376,1271.95,"Well, I think by, I mean, you know, the Court's precedents in other areas has suggested it's just not a matter of whether the ultimate service is provided in commerce but in order to get the services they have to take--"
2006.05-1382,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1271.95,1272.783,Activities that--
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1272.783,1273.433,--Yes.
2006.05-1382,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1394.51,1401.414,Could you address the question I asked respondent's counsel in the last case about the availability of other facilities?
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1409.103,1409.936,"Right, I... I--"
2006.05-1382,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1409.936,1416.423,"So it doesn't make much sense to say well, there is an alternate procedure if you can't be admitted to the facility."
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1416.423,1416.774,--Sure.
2006.05-1382,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1458.866,1468.738,But then you pin your whole case on the availability of D&E even though D&Es sometimes inadvertently turn into intact D&Es.
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1468.738,1486.016,"Well, but, Justice Kennedy, I think we have our answer to that, which is the best reading of the statute requires the intent at the outset of the procedure, and therefore nobody... in the 99 percent of the cases that Dr. Crainer sets out to performs a D&E and succeeds, there's no issue in the world because everybody would look at that and say that's a D&E."
2006.05-1382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1486.899,1508.363,"How do you do that, because I looked at that part of the statute and, comparing it with the statute in Cathcart, the statute in Cathcart, the relevant part forbid a doctor from doing this for the purpose of performing an abortion that the doctor knows will kill the fetus."
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1535.93,1541.417,"--Well, Justice Breyer, it's because of the addition of the anatomical landmark language to the Federal statute."
2006.05-1382,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1541.417,1546.988,"Well, I'll grant you that in respect... if what Cathcart was worried about I guess was you didn't know what the words"
2006.05-1382,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1582.561,1589.148,"Well, only with the caveat, though, is that I think this Court really didn't have to confront the second concern because it had the first concern."
2006.05-1382,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1632.244,1633.327,"Thank you, General Clement."
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,1634.696,1644.902,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1873.597,1877.366,"Do you... I think this question was asked earlier, but I want your position."
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,1883.622,1904.718,"--Your Honor, two, two doctors in particular, Dr. Chasen and Dr. Hammond, testified that they have used in their practice the vertex presentation to treat women who, as Ms. Smith indicated, the fetus suffered from a serious lethal anomaly that involved a greatly distended abdomen."
2006.05-1382,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1947.378,1970.227,"Miss Gartner, with respect to your argument that the statute here did not track what you have described as the characteristics, the hallmarks, I think the answer from the other side is that the, the theory of this statute is a theory of a clear line between a legitimate abortion and infanticide."
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,1977.547,1980.099,"Well, two answers, Your Honor."
2006.05-1382,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2005.214,2008.249,"Well, we said that that would be an appropriate line."
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2019.057,2047.557,"--Your Honor, I would agree that of the three hallmarks that the Court recognized in Stenberg, the breach delivery is probably the least, the least central; that the other two hallmarks, the extraction to the head followed by a completely intact delivery after demise, were absolutely the hallmarks that everyone on this Court understood in Stenberg, and those, those lines, are nowhere in the statute that Congress enacted."
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2099.242,2108.798,"--I understood the statute here to apply only when the, in the words of the statute, that the partially delivered infant is killed after passing the anatomical landmark."
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2108.798,2109.665,"--Well, that's right, Your Honor."
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2109.665,2115.452,So we just say your hypothetical about extraction of the leg it seems to be would not be covered by the statute.
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2115.452,2117.054,"Absolutely, Your Honor, that's right."
2006.05-1382,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2124.474,2126.076,But we don't talk about a leg dying.
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2131.396,2141.602,"--I think the important point is that the government acknowledges that in a standard D&E, what it calls standard D&Es, the fetus can be extracted past the anatomical landmark."
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2154.425,2161.729,Where does the government concede that in a standard D&E the living fetus is extracted past the anatomical landmark?
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2161.729,2162.395,--It does so--
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2162.395,2167.833,I thought that was... I thought their position was that that was not the standard D&E.
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2167.833,2168.333,--Right.
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2225.604,2239.429,"I thought their answer on that was that sometimes the D&E procedure will lead to a D&X procedure, but that the requirement of deliberately and intentionally removes those situations from the scope of the statute."
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2239.429,2243.166,"--Well, I think that's not how I understood it, Your Honor."
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2258.658,2259.808,Prior to demise?
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2259.808,2260.86,"That's right, Your Honor."
2006.05-1382,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2260.86,2273.685,"Did you understand the government's argument or answer to that to be, well, if the intent did not exist, if there was not an intent to do that, then the doctor is not liable?"
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2273.685,2303.854,"Well, Your Honor, I think this gets to the point I was going to make about the safety of doing abortions in a way that would be banned by the law, and that's that in every D&E, regardless of whether the intent is to do an intact D&E or not an intact D&E, the intent is to minimize the insertion of instruments into the uterus and to extract the fetus as intact as possible, because each insertion of the instruments increases the risk of causing harm to the woman's uterus."
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2381.037,2385.175,My concern with your argument is it's not just the anatomical line.
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2409.874,2430.137,"--Well, Your Honor, I guess to some extent it comes down to what intent means but if what it means that the doctors would prefer, would like it to come out as far as possible before they have to take any, any kind of action to clear an obstructing part, that's, that's what they intend."
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2437.208,2437.624,What about the--
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2448.432,2450.284,"--Well, two points on that, Your Honor."
2006.05-1382,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2475.047,2482.07,"No, but the dilation protocol certainly would be relevant on the question of intent which this statute does refer to, wouldn't it?"
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2482.07,2489.407,"I think it would be relevant, Your Honor, but I think it's not... it really can't be dispositive of the physician's intent be--"
2006.05-1382,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2489.407,2489.79,Because?
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2489.79,2494.894,"--Some doctors use a one day protocol, some doctors use a two day protocol but that in of itself isn't--"
2006.05-1382,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2494.894,2507.201,But you're telling us that some do this and some do that and the question is why wouldn't following one protocol rather than another protocol very significant evidence of what was intended?
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2507.201,2512.505,"--Because some doctors use a two day protocol, Your Honor, even if they don't expect to get an intact D&E."
2006.05-1382,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2532.317,2549.394,"Do we have any indication in the record in your case about the effect on safety of any other aspect of this procedure if these doctors would change their, their method of operation and go to a one day protocol?"
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2549.394,2552.646,"--In terms, one day protocol?"
2006.05-1382,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2552.646,2553.146,Yes.
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2553.146,2561.066,Some doctors... I think one thing is that doctors perform abortions most safely when they do them in a way that they are most accustomed to.
2006.05-1382,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2563.085,2570.672,I don't want to cut your answer but I want to know whether there is anything specifically in the record in your case that bears on my question.
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2570.672,2573.909,There is nothing specific about doctors changing protocols.
2006.05-1382,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2585.765,2588.967,"Well, do you mean stop when they have started with a different intent?"
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2588.967,2590.417,"That's right, Your Honor."
2006.05-1382,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2590.417,2595.052,As opposed to adopting a completely different procedure entirely... a different protocol entirely.
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2595.052,2612.413,"Well, no actually even the other government witness, Dr. Cook, agreed that... and the other government witness, Dr. Lockwood, agreed that removing the fetus as intact as possible in any D&E is the safest way to perform a D&E procedure regardless of whether the intent was to do an intact D&E procedure."
2006.05-1382,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2612.413,2649.502,"For such a doctor, a doctor who thinks that what I'm trying to do is remove, in this emergency situation, as much of the fetus as possible as quickly as possible, would such a doctor often, never, sometimes be thinking what I think is likely to happen here, I'll make a pass at the fetus, try to draw it out, and what's most likely to happen is that the trunk, a lot of it will come out and then the head of the fetus will dismember, after a lot of the trunk comes out."
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2650.136,2653.454,I would say it certainly is not never and it's not always.
2006.05-1382,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2654.538,2665.062,"--So if a doctor is being honest about that, is there any way that such a doctor could escape the language of the statute on the government's interpretation?"
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2665.062,2671.965,--I think not Your Honor because the intent is to extract the fetus as intact as possible.
2006.05-1382,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2704.371,2705.821,Would you clear up one thing for me?
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2721.832,2740.527,"Well, Your Honor there is testimony in our case, in the California case, that a few doctors that testified said the beginning at approximately 22 weeks of pregnancy, they offered women the option of undergoing a fetal demise injection before the procedure began."
2006.05-1382,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2759.739,2764.992,From the point of view of the doctor it would be the safest thing to avoid criminal responsibility.
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2764.992,2772.746,"--It... but the problem is, as the district court found, it's an unnecessary medical procedure that subjects the woman to additional risk."
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2773.748,2777.3,Why would the doctors in that case propose that option to their patients?
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2777.3,2789.274,"--At 22 weeks and later, as the abortion is getting closer to the viability line, the doctors feel that some women would feel more... it's for psychological reasons for the woman."
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2791.376,2794.412,"Well, what... what are the psychological reasons?"
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2794.412,2801.066,"If she would prefer that the fetus undergo demise before the extraction begins, some women may feel better about that."
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2843.309,2849.563,"Well is there a difference between, in your view, in the constitutionality, marginally safer and significantly safer?"
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2868.376,2871.245,"Yes, Your Honor, it does matter."
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2884.736,2892.592,"Well, do we just look at the averted harms, or... or do we, or Congress, also look at the incidence of the averted harms?"
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2900.781,2904.899,"Well, Your Honor, I think it can't be a quantified, quantified inquiry."
2006.05-1382,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2926.563,2929.182,Doesn't the answer to my question turn largely on the age of the fetus?
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2937.852,2939.888,"Well, I'm not sure if that's."
2006.05-1382,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2939.888,2946.358,"For example, one of the congressional interests described in the finding is avoiding fetal pain to the fetus."
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,2958.416,2973.225,"For the woman, but I think the important point, Your Honor, is that this, that the intact D&E procedure, and the testimony was overwhelming to this effect, that... in some cases this procedure averts catastrophic health consequences for the woman."
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2983.614,3001.009,"If... if the woman can take into account the impact on the fetus at a certain point in time, and your option, as you said some physicians give, of fetal demise prior to the procedure, why is that beyond the scope of things that Congress can take into account?"
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,3001.009,3009.781,Because what Congress has done here is take away from women the option of what may be the safest procedure for her.
2006.05-1382,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3037.549,3043.086,"Well, but we have... we have said that that judgment has to reflect some kind of substantial medical judgment."
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,3047.224,3049.057,"Absolutely, Justice Souter."
2006.05-1382,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3049.057,3049.474,So to that extent--
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,3049.474,3053.21,And that's... and I take that... and maybe that was my... and I take this as a given here.
2006.05-1382,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3099.941,3108.797,"I don't want to misinterpret the Attorney General, the Solicitor General's remarks but he indicated in those case there could be an as applied challenge."
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,3108.797,3113.099,"Well, I think, Justice Kennedy, you answered that question as well as I could."
2006.05-1382,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3125.572,3133.928,"Well, the answer that the Solicitor gave... General gave to that was, you could have a preenforcement proceeding."
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,3136.53,3137.014,Right.
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3391.942,3395.744,"Thank you, Ms. Gartner."
2006.05-1382,1,22383,eve_c_gartner,,3395.744,3397.044,"Thank you for your consideration, Your Honor."
2006.05-1382,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3397.044,3399.696,"General Clement, you have three minutes remaining."
2006.05-1382,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3399.696,3403.415,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2006.05-1382,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3572.156,3573.572,"Thank you, General Clement."
