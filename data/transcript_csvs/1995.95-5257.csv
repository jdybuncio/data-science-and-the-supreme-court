1995.95-5257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.69,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-5257, Saul Ornelas and Ismael Ornelas-Ledesma v. The United States."
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,22.606,24.769,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1995.95-5257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,51.367,60.503,"Mr. LeBell, it seems to me in... either the magistrate or the district judge made a finding of fact as to credibility."
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,65.656,66.597,"No, Justice Rehnquist."
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,83.027,90.323,We believe that there are three sound reasons why de novo review should be accorded warrantless Fourth Amendment cases.
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,149.151,150.761,That is correct.
1995.95-5257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,155.584,157.216,This is a direct appeal.
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,157.216,158.167,--That is correct.
1995.95-5257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,169.274,180.761,"Well, I can see why you argue naturally for plenary review, but I don't see how you could derive much support from a holding that was based on the Federal habeas statute, which this isn't."
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,180.761,185.052,I believe I'm looking at the words that were enunciated in that decision.
1995.95-5257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,193.871,196.321,"Maybe those would be better cases for you to rely on, then."
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,196.321,196.86,--Certainly.
1995.95-5257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,260.964,266.788,You... what court made the determination of clearly erroneous in Cortez?
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,266.788,267.539,The lower court.
1995.95-5257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.539,269.949,"The district court, or the court of appeals?"
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,269.949,281.327,"No, the court of appeals, and upon reviewing the district court's decision determined that there was no clear error, and therefore it affirmed the decision, and this Court then reversed, showing, in essence, no deference to the decision by the court of appeals."
1995.95-5257,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,281.327,304.863,"Well, surely there are no aspects of Fourth Amendment doctrine, be it the lawfulness of the stop, the lawfulness of the search that follows the stop, that couldn't and wouldn't have been developed had we used the de novo... pardon me, a clearly erroneous standard of review in the circuit courts all this time."
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,304.863,310.004,It is our position... you're correct that certainly the law will develop.
1995.95-5257,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.72,316.409,"Well, doesn't it develop in the same way?"
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,328.027,329.987,I believe it would look differently.
1995.95-5257,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,329.987,332.401,"Why is that, and in what respects?"
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,332.401,359.227,"I can point the Court to this particular case, where the circuit, or the circuit court of appeals specifically said, we find this to be a close case, but because we are bound by the clearly erroneous standard, we're going to have to affirm, and that was in light of the fact that on two occasions the district court reversed the finding of the magistrate judge, who had listened to 4 days of testimony, reversed the finding of probable cause."
1995.95-5257,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,359.227,378.76,"But that's going to be the case where there are multifarious factors, and there, a court of appeals may well reverse the district court, but to assume that that's of any use to the system you have to posit a following case that has the same multifarious factors, which doesn't very often happen."
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,408.981,410.16,I do not believe so--
1995.95-5257,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.16,410.861,Why not?
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,410.861,417.617,--and I don't believe so because it's my understanding and my concept of Fourth Amendment development that there's a waxing and a waning.
1995.95-5257,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,430.553,436.457,"Well, tell me... tell me how the turntable case could not have been decided just as well under a clearly erroneous standard."
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,436.457,442.341,"If the court had, I assume in that particular case looked at the facts and determined that those didn't satisfy probable cause."
1995.95-5257,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.341,461.274,"Well, the lower court simply held that if... that the police officer is lawfully in the room, this isn't a search and seizure because it's a minimal disruption, and whether you apply clearly erroneous or de novo, the fact is that it's clearly erroneous to say that a minimal disruption is not a disruption."
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,461.274,463.315,That is correct.
1995.95-5257,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.892,490.853,"It really seems to me that the only advantage for making law that de novo review contains is an advantage when you assume that the very same multiplicity of factors will be replicated in the future, which doesn't very often happen, it seems to me."
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,490.853,506.883,"--Justice Scalia, I would disagree with that proposition, because I believe that each of these cases, while they are specific and of paramount importance to the litigants, ultimately have a place in the compendium of cases that result in changes in the Fourth Amendment."
1995.95-5257,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,506.883,507.864,"Well, take this case."
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,526.477,531.049,"My response would be, I don't know, because he was bound by the clearly erroneous standard."
1995.95-5257,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,555.426,557.246,Well... sorry.
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,557.246,558.047,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
1995.95-5257,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,558.047,558.928,Were you finished?
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,558.928,559.499,I'm done.
1995.95-5257,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,559.499,577.512,"The... what I thought... I agreed with Justice Kennedy, I thought where the issue is one of elaborating the law, elaborating it, there, certainly the court of appeals, apparently, as Judge Posner did, feels free to do that under the deferential standard, and that's certainly appropriate."
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,589.57,592.22,We're talking about a situation--
1995.95-5257,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,592.22,594.223,The application of a legal label to a set of facts?
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,594.223,594.952,--That's correct.
1995.95-5257,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,594.952,613.125,"Well, in that respect, should we not pay more attention to district courts that deal with these things regularly, that understand the sort of impossible-to-set-down-in-writing factors, and try to prevent too many absolute elaborations by appeals judges, who know less about it?"
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,613.125,614.497,I would like to reserve 2 minutes.
1995.95-5257,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,622.02,625.564,"If you want to go ahead, you go ahead, because there's other people who could answer that, I realize, if you don't want to--"
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,625.564,626.375,--I can answer the question.
1995.95-5257,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.122,680.942,--Absolutely.
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,684.074,684.825,"Yes, it is."
1995.95-5257,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,684.825,692.91,"But you take some offense at the district court reversing de novo the magistrate, but you want the court of appeals to reverse de novo the district court."
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,692.91,693.601,Well--
1995.95-5257,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.601,694.943,I find that... you know.
1995.95-5257,0,39809,robert_g_lebell,,694.943,714.264,"--I think that when you talk about a de novo review that's allowed under the Magistrate Act, I think it is assumed that there's going to be full compliance, and clearly, the first time round, when Judge Randa reviewed the appeal by the petitioners, there was not a de novo review as it was contemplated by the Magistrate Act."
1995.95-5257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,716.434,717.846,"Very well, Mr. LeBell."
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,719.176,727.634,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-5257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,760.345,763.745,"Well, why do we need specific content to be given?"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,772.381,774.734,"--I think there are two reasons for that, Justice Rehnquist."
1995.95-5257,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,827.038,835.344,"Oh, undoubted... I mean, if you say, you know, whether once in a blue moon you wouldn't get clearer guidance, I'm sure you would, but that argues for de novo review in every case."
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,839.676,846.74,"--We think that it's worth the effort that in de novo review you do get clearer guidance and that, in fact, the experience of law enforcement--"
1995.95-5257,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,846.74,849.803,"You do that for all constitutional issues, is that the position you take?"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,849.803,864.642,"--We're here arguing that you do this for reasonable suspicion and for probable cause, for the reasons that this Court has used in analyzing the standard of review question, that we think there is important precedent to be generated, and that the guidance that that gives to law enforcement is very helpful."
1995.95-5257,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.544,874.86,"Well, I suppose that just as the courts of appeals have to bring some unity to the district courts, we have, you know, a lot of courts of appeals."
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,897.154,900.326,--We're not arguing for a change in the certiorari standard.
1995.95-5257,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.105,917.116,"That's a simple, isolable issue which would come up under clearly erroneous review--"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,917.116,918.108,--Well--
1995.95-5257,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.108,919.35,--like the turntable example.
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,924.582,934.51,"--It's true that some general rules, under the outlines of the Fourth Amendment standard will emerge under the clear error standard, but the plain review doctrine is a much more distinctly legal doctrine."
1995.95-5257,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,965.178,968.069,"Well, you could have done that with Judge Posner's opinion in this case, could you not?"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,968.069,971.723,"--You could, but the precedential value would be clearer."
1995.95-5257,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,981.661,983.971,"You would use that for FBI agents in the Fifth Circuit as well, as I assume, right?"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,983.971,986.122,"--This... these are national standards, and the--"
1995.95-5257,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.122,987.963,The Seventh Circuit promulgates national standards?
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,987.963,992.207,--The probable cause and reasonable suspicion do mean the same thing.
1995.95-5257,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,992.207,1001.031,"But I mean, my point is, you're still telling the FBI agents to take a chance that what the Seventh Circuit has said will be applied in the Third Circuit."
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1001.031,1006.835,"You are, but the circuits in fact are very much guided by one another."
1995.95-5257,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1024.837,1025.417,"You're right, I--"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1025.417,1028.23,That's the standard form of reasoning in these cases.
1995.95-5257,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1028.23,1037.176,"--I think you're right that if the Seventh were talking solely about the application of a label to a set of facts, if circuit courts do it you will get better precedent."
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1087.622,1096.848,"In the context of the Fourth Amendment of searches and stops, there's a Fourth Amendment requirement of articulation of the reasons for the stop and the search."
1995.95-5257,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1102.94,1106.623,"He says, look, there is a screw here, and there wasn't that much rust on it."
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1129.768,1154.285,"Well, given, in particular in this area, that the norm of requiring articulation, I think that that's something that is going to be less likely to be lost here in the translation, and you know, the countervailing concerns are that these are followed as precedent and that, yes, there will be bases for distinguishing, and you see courts all the time saying yes, this looks close, but we have more here, or we have less here."
1995.95-5257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1166.253,1172.757,"--Well, Ms. Pillard, take probable cause, which is certainly very much tied up with the Fourth Amendment."
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1180.952,1182.504,"--Well, I would beg to differ."
1995.95-5257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1184.936,1185.436,We've--
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1185.436,1186.936,--given definition to probable cause--
1995.95-5257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1186.936,1187.237,--Well--
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1187.237,1188.419,--in certain fact settings.
1995.95-5257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1188.419,1193.881,"--In certain... but what, in your view, is the way this Court has defined... how have we defined probable cause?"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1193.881,1197.525,In a case-by-case elaboration process.
1995.95-5257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1198.073,1205.87,"Well, but you agree, then, that there has been no overriding or sweeping definition of probable cause, just in words."
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1205.87,1217.146,"--Well, there have been subrules, for example, that the inferences should be drawn from the perspective of a reasonable law enforcement officer rather than from the perspective of a law person or law professor--"
1995.95-5257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1217.146,1217.507,"Yes, but--"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1217.507,1218.185,--and those kinds of rules--
1995.95-5257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1218.185,1221.178,"--has this Court said, what is probable cause?"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1222.52,1223.391,--I don't think so.
1995.95-5257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1223.391,1223.939,"No, I don't think--"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1223.939,1225.952,I think it's answered it in a bunch of fact patterns.
1995.95-5257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1225.952,1231.856,"--Well, very fact-specific ways, and is there any reason why we just shouldn't keep on doing that in the area of probable cause?"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1231.856,1267.669,"I think that we should and we will keep on doing that, and the question is whether, when the Court does that, for example as it did in the Carroll case dealing with the illegal transportation of liquor, and then came up with a fact pattern in Brineger which the Court viewed as indistinguishable from the Carroll case, in Brineger the Court said if probable cause is to mean the same thing from one courtroom to another, we're going to have to reverse the district court's finding of no probable cause in this case and follow Carroll, and that's the kind of development of the law that we think the de novo standard facilitates, and we think the Court should continue to carry on in that case."
1995.95-5257,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1267.669,1273.223,Is it relevant for us to consider the present work load of the court of appeals in deciding this case?
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1273.223,1279.298,"Well, we don't think that it would be appreciably more work to have--"
1995.95-5257,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1279.298,1281.03,Suppose we disagree with that.
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1282.56,1285.131,"--No, I don't think it's a relevant--"
1995.95-5257,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1285.131,1297.819,"In other words, we decide this case quite without regard to the comparative efficiencies of requiring either the court of appeals or the district courts to write all these things out, as Justice Breyer has explained."
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1297.819,1307.487,--It's worth note in that regard that in my most recent check I think every court of appeals except for the Seventh Circuit in their most current statements of the rule are applying the de novo--
1995.95-5257,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1307.487,1311.74,"Well, I assume that's because they think that that's what we would require, but the question--"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1311.74,1312.81,--I think they often find it useful.
1995.95-5257,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1322.147,1327.189,"--Ms. Pillard, you said there were two other reasons, and your time is running out, so perhaps you might mention them."
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1327.189,1328.611,I've had some opportunity to cover them.
1995.95-5257,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.255,1349.274,The last reason surely proves too much.
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1358.33,1359.201,"--Yes, but--"
1995.95-5257,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1359.201,1360.854,--and therefore they should all be reviewed de novo.
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1360.854,1362.333,--Not exactly.
1995.95-5257,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.044,1377.715,"And concluded that it was okay if it meant different things in different courtrooms, right?"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1377.715,1385.679,"--Well, determined really that you don't have the kind of VP fact patterns that create any kind of meaningful disuniformity from courtroom to courtroom."
1995.95-5257,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1410.726,1412.597,I don't know what you mean by the same groups of factors.
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1413.649,1415.178,"--Well, for example--"
1995.95-5257,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.178,1423.393,"--If, indeed, the fact of a rusted screw is not enough, you know, then you can say in the clearly erroneous review, a rusted screw is not enough."
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1423.393,1426.996,--Particularly when the screw turns out not to have been rusted.
1995.95-5257,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1426.996,1427.707,Right.
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1427.707,1430.849,But we do see examples of VP factors.
1995.95-5257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1461.0,1461.448,"Well, Ms. Pillard--"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1461.448,1461.838,--And--
1995.95-5257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1461.838,1468.854,"--Ms. Pillard, why is it that we need to either opt for de novo review or deference?"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1476.628,1484.214,"--I think this Court has been exercising de novo review, so to that extent I think that the Court should continue to do what it's been doing."
1995.95-5257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1484.214,1488.986,"Well, we've certainly never said we exercise de novo review in Fourth Amendment, in particular Fourth Amendment cases, have we?"
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1488.986,1505.847,"Well, in Carroll and in Beck the Court did say that independent and plenary review was the standard, and I think in practice you see in analyzing the cases that the Court has exercised its own judgment and not referred to the need to defer to any district court, or--"
1995.95-5257,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1505.847,1513.302,Is it different from the standard that's used when the Court is determining whether a warrant was backed by probable cause?
1995.95-5257,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1513.302,1514.123,--It is different.
1995.95-5257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1551.758,1553.007,"Thank you, Ms. Pillard."
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,1554.129,1561.853,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-5257,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1644.467,1648.43,But the legal errors are going to be rather few and far between.
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,1656.906,1659.888,"--Well, I think that's correct, Justice Souter."
1995.95-5257,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1659.888,1673.058,"Isn't the case that when we say, as some people here have suggested, and I suppose as I have on some times, that you can still give your views as a court if you're applying a clearly erroneous standard?"
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,1727.802,1732.076,"Well, it's certainly possible that you could get that kind of review."
1995.95-5257,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1758.744,1777.626,"Yes, but the question in that case was the degree of intrusion, and you're going to say, well, there was just a wee bit of intrusion when he looked under it, and therefore it was clearly erroneous to say that you had not sort of departed from your reasonable standard."
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,1784.279,1797.75,"Well, you... there may be a distinction between whether something constitutes a search for purposes of whether you pick the de novo or clearly erroneous review versus probable cause or reasonable suspicion determinations."
1995.95-5257,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1840.155,1868.926,"But that gets us into the different issue which Ms. Pillard raised, and that is, there is a good reason to have a more intrusive review standard when one is reviewing a warrantless search than in the case of a search with a warrant and therefore, even though it may in fact, and I'm not sure I am convinced of this, but even though it may, in fact, be more difficult, really, to do de novo review, there's a good reason to do it in order to preserve that distinction, isn't there?"
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,1868.926,1869.556,"Well, I--"
1995.95-5257,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1869.556,1870.667,You want to encourage warrants.
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,1870.667,1885.956,"--I think that there's a point that is lost in that argument Ms. Pillard made, and that is that nobody is talking about adopting the clearly erroneous standard of review on appeal, of deferring to the actions of a police officer."
1995.95-5257,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1933.638,1943.793,"Mr. Isakoff, this is a typical sort of a mixed fact-law matter, isn't it, probable cause and reasonable suspicion?"
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,1943.793,1944.725,--Yes.
1995.95-5257,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1944.725,1954.893,And we certainly have traditionally at least said that mixed questions of fact and law will be reviewed by the appellate court on a de novo standard.
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,1954.893,1957.976,"Well, I think that that's not quite correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-5257,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.053,2052.563,"I had thought that our Bose line of authority on the First Amendment, where we said that in that area we will review these mixed questions de novo, I had thought that was somewhat by way of exception, that we at least implied that ordinarily that would not be the case."
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2052.563,2074.63,"Certainly the Bose and the Hardhanks decision that followed it and Justice Stevens' very clear language was that this was a unique interest that's being protected by the actual malice standard, that this Court in particular has an obligation to be sure that this core value of being able to criticize public officials be given the fullest protection."
1995.95-5257,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2095.523,2102.409,Is it... this is... I can't work out how this makes any difference whether it's decided one way or the other.
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2120.97,2121.51,Correct.
1995.95-5257,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2121.51,2121.891,--de novo.
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2164.947,2165.348,"Well, the--"
1995.95-5257,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2165.348,2169.281,"In the one case you're... because they don't write out all the facts, that's true."
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2169.281,2170.503,"--No, they--"
1995.95-5257,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2170.503,2170.971,What's the difference?
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2175.346,2175.826,"--Well, I--"
1995.95-5257,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2175.826,2177.246,What's the difference?
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2177.246,2192.146,"--Well, I think the difference is in the case where the court of appeals gets to the bottom line, they've looked at the historical facts as they've been found or conceded to be and where there is more than one permissible view, where the question is close, that that's the case you leave it to the district court."
1995.95-5257,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2192.146,2198.992,"Of course, the difficulty, and the whole thing that leads them to want the review is, in most instances the judges just write, he looked nervous."
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2205.964,2206.955,"Well, in fact--"
1995.95-5257,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2206.955,2210.779,"--in writing, and then as long as that's true, we defer anyway at the court of appeals."
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2224.207,2242.339,"--Well, the difference, I think, Justice Breyer, is that the... you're supposed to be reviewing a totality of the circumstances kind of a judgment, and it seems to me that the district court is in the best position because he's at least had the chance to ask how askew, or even look at how askew, and then weighing all of that together--"
1995.95-5257,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2242.339,2245.472,"So you think it's more honest, in other words, to say--"
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2245.472,2256.02,"--I think that the district court really is in the better position to do it, and then these cases that are close, you're not really getting the precedentially significant decisions out of the court of appeals."
1995.95-5257,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2256.02,2268.325,"--Well, courts really were never troubled with this problem until either some appellate judges school said let's figure out what the standard of review is, and then we say, well, it's deferential, or it's de novo."
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2271.558,2279.823,"Well, it's interesting, Your Honor, because I think that courts of appeals, whether prompted by this Court or otherwise, have been paying much more attention to standard review issues."
1995.95-5257,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2309.174,2314.097,"Mr. Isakoff, doesn't this very case, though, illustrate that the court of appeals sometimes is?"
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2345.988,2352.303,"Well, I think what's deferential is when you get to the bottom line, because the bottom line in this case I think is arguably close."
1995.95-5257,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2380.009,2392.077,"Do you think maybe something like this has been going on at least before we got the courts of appeals got to the point of articulation, that in most cases they did engage in deferential review?"
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2442.092,2450.905,"Well, the only problem with picking one out, Your Honor, is that I don't think the courts of appeals have the luxury that this Court does of picking and choosing the cases that come before it."
1995.95-5257,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2450.905,2463.675,"No, I'm not saying that they pick and choose the cases that come before them, but they do seem, I think... I'm guessing... that they really did exercise some discretion in deciding just how picky a standard to apply when they did review them."
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2487.411,2502.33,"Well, I think Your Honor makes a good point that, whether you call it clearly erroneous or de novo review, the ultimate bottom line is, are you going to... do you think that the district court's in the better position or not."
1995.95-5257,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.782,2539.704,"Mr. Isakoff, can I ask you a question that occurred to me listening to your opponents?"
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2566.823,2592.509,"Well, I think that... I think there's some truth to that, particularly when you go back to cases as far as Brineger and before you had the history that led up through Aguilar and Spinelli to Illinois v. Gates, where I think there may have been a recognition that the probable cause and reasonable suspicion determinations were really not susceptible of the kind of precedential significance that I think in Brineger the majority of the Court found, and in that case, it was different from that, Justice Stevens."
1995.95-5257,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2675.673,2688.593,"Mr. Isakoff, do you think it's appropriate to have a different standard, whatever the label is, to review more closely in a case where there is no warrant?"
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2688.593,2703.932,"I think that the district court, in reviewing the case where there is no warrant, is not going to be applying nearly the same kind of standard that you would be doing on review of a magistrate's order."
1995.95-5257,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2712.317,2722.964,"But once you get past the district court level, it should make no difference whether it's a warrant case or a warrantless search."
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2722.964,2724.076,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-5257,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2754.804,2768.514,"Mr. Isakoff, this case presents a situation where the magistrate made one finding of fact and the district court on review, without having heard the evidence directly, made a different one, changed the result."
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2768.514,2769.604,Well--
1995.95-5257,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2769.604,2771.768,To whom should the appellate court defer?
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2771.768,2775.448,--The appellate court should defer to the district court for the following reason.
1995.95-5257,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2815.448,2824.903,"Is there any split of authority in the circuits, to your knowledge, that turns on this peculiar situation of the district court differing from the magistrate?"
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2824.903,2830.777,"Not that I'm aware of, because... and I honestly don't know the answer to that."
1995.95-5257,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2830.777,2840.712,"There's a lot of authority in the agency context, Universal Canberra, and so the question, did the district court on remand hear any of the witnesses?"
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2840.712,2841.984,"No, Your Honor--"
1995.95-5257,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2841.984,2842.545,No.
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2842.545,2842.985,--because the only--
1995.95-5257,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2842.985,2868.831,"So that would... I mean, if you use the analogy, you'd say look, the reason that one wants to defer to a district court in the legal task of applying a legal label to facts as given is that the district judge has heard, not necessarily just credibility, but he sat there, and he listened to the story unfold, and that gives him a degree of expertise in these matters, but there's none here."
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2868.831,2870.193,"--Well, there's two points."
1995.95-5257,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2889.345,2893.259,"But as a court of appeals in this case you'd say, what in heaven's name does the district judge know that I don't know?"
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,2898.202,2915.451,"There's no question that when you look at this particular case you could reach that conclusion and decide that, well, we ought to maybe have one standard for when the district court hear's the testimony and another standard for when the magistrate hears the testimony, and yet another standard for when they disagree with one another only on the label but not on the credibility."
1995.95-5257,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2941.799,2943.772,"Mr. Isakoff, help me out on this."
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,3009.262,3009.903,"Oh, I--"
1995.95-5257,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3009.903,3012.756,As... do you understand that to be the process of deference that goes on?
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,3012.756,3022.683,--I certainly do not... I'm not aware of any decision of this Court that has suggested that the deference is limited in the manner Your Honor suggests.
1995.95-5257,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3039.813,3042.235,"But that was a different policy, wasn't it?"
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,3048.289,3050.872,"--Well, I'm not sure it's a different policy because I--"
1995.95-5257,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3050.872,3051.452,Maybe you can't draw the line.
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,3051.792,3053.525,--It seems to me that it's the same policy--
1995.95-5257,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3053.525,3053.785,Yes.
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,3053.785,3061.559,"--that in both cases the Court was coming very strongly, as it has historically, in favor of encouraging people to get warrants."
1995.95-5257,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3061.559,3062.57,"No, wait a minute, maybe I misspoke."
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,3076.929,3078.69,Yes.
1995.95-5257,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3078.97,3079.391,Okay.
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,3079.391,3084.083,"--I think at that point, if you're looking at a police officer who knows that he has lied to the magistrate--"
1995.95-5257,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3084.083,3084.524,Right.
1995.95-5257,2,38027,peter_d_isakoff,,3084.524,3094.01,"--that that would be a different thing, but I think in both cases that there's no suggestion that the type of deference that Your Honor was suggesting has been limited to simply filling in the blanks."
1995.95-5257,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3104.416,3105.968,"Thank you, Mr. Isakoff."
1995.95-5257,3,39809,robert_g_lebell,,3110.419,3131.714,"It was suggested by Justice Souter that in the past the practice has been by the circuit courts of appeal that basically it's an ad hoc basis, and that the determination whether it's going to be clearly erroneous, or where it's going to be de novo, is sort of on, we're going to call them as we see them, and I think that's... and the question was posed, why couldn't that just continue to work."
1995.95-5257,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3135.447,3137.979,Has... do you think that's what has been going on--
1995.95-5257,3,39809,robert_g_lebell,,3137.979,3138.65,--As a practical matter?
1995.95-5257,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3138.65,3139.09,--prior to the labeling era?
1995.95-5257,3,39809,robert_g_lebell,,3139.09,3140.52,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1995.95-5257,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3225.525,3226.326,But it's not his decision.
1995.95-5257,3,39809,robert_g_lebell,,3242.948,3262.51,"--I believe that when the Court based Gates on the belief that law enforcement officers were, in fact, going to rely on warrants because they had been given deference, I believe that principle was appropriate, and I also conversely believe that the exact opposite message is going to be disseminated by police officers."
