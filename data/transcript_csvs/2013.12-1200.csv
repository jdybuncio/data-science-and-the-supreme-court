2013.12-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,14.591,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-1200, Executive Benefits Insurance Agency v. Arkison, the Chapter 7 Trustee of the Estate of Bellingham Insurance Agency."
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,16.026,18.812,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2013.12-1200,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,73.129,93.443,"Why should that matter given that, after the bankruptcy judge ruled, the U.S. District Court gave de novo review to this case and entered a final judgment that met all the requirements of Article 3?"
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,93.443,102.132,--The judgment that was entered by the district court was not an exercise of original jurisdiction but rather appellate jurisdiction.
2013.12-1200,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,118.577,119.71,Here's something -- I'm sorry.
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,147.01,156.702,"Your Honor, the entry of judgment is the act of the judicial branch that carries the force of law."
2013.12-1200,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,169.91,172.212,Are you talking about a mere formality?
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,184.552,185.72,"--It -- yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1200,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,185.72,187.671,That's the essence of your argument.
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,187.671,188.354,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1200,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,190.539,205.982,"So if we vacated and remanded, and the district court looked at this, because it's already seen it, and basically just signed below the line that the bankruptcy judge signed, you would be okay?"
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,205.982,208.501,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1200,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,257.764,258.616,It reviewed this case de novo.
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,258.616,259.899,That's true.
2013.12-1200,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,259.899,267.555,"And it decided that there were no issues, no factual issues in dispute and that the law clearly applied the way it did."
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,272.191,277.411,"On appellate review, it had two options: Affirm or reverse."
2013.12-1200,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,288.469,299.524,"Why would the -- why would the district judge do that when the district court said that there are no disputed issues, no relevant disputed issues of fact and it's a pure legal question?"
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,299.524,313.934,"--Well, Your Honor, I truly believe that on this record, where there clearly were disputes between the two affidavits, that an Article 3 judge would not have entered summary judgment as an original matter."
2013.12-1200,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,341.253,349.091,"Will it be conceded, so far as you know, by your friends on the other side that this was appellate?"
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,349.091,351.393,"--Well, I don't know--"
2013.12-1200,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,351.393,352.895,What is it that makes it appellate?
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,352.895,362.434,"--Well, Section 158(a) speaks in language of the district court exercising appellate jurisdiction."
2013.12-1200,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,392.536,394.555,It uses the word “ appellate ”--
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,394.555,395.538,--It uses--
2013.12-1200,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,395.538,397.94,--in 158?
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,397.94,402.076,"--Yes, 158(a) says--"
2013.12-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.076,402.976,Which is where?
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,403.594,410.082,"--I'm using the government's amicus brief, the statutory appendix that's on page 4a."
2013.12-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.082,412.367,I don't know why it wasn't in your brief.
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,412.367,413.55,It is in our brief.
2013.12-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,491.802,504.376,"But then there is a -- I want you to get on a bit, because I'd say the question that we're, at least for me, is one of congressional intent, not in necessarily your case but in future cases."
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,587.613,593.95,"To be clear, Congress designated fraudulent conveyance actions as core."
2013.12-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,593.95,595.95,"I know that, and I would have said they were right."
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,617.233,621.784,"Well, I think that what's constraining the court is the language that Congress enacted."
2013.12-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,623.119,628.371,"If I find an ambiguity in that language, then you would say I would be sensible to read it contrary to what you want."
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,628.371,631.975,"--I -- I don't believe there is an ambiguity, Your Honor."
2013.12-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,631.975,632.475,"Well, okay."
2013.12-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,649.871,651.871,What is the ambiguity we are talking about?
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,651.871,656.275,"Well, the ambiguity -- I actually think there is no ambiguity because--"
2013.12-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,656.275,659.642,What is the non-ambiguity we are talking about?
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,660.126,675.752,--Congress -- Congress very clearly distinguished a dichotomy between those cases in which the bankruptcy courts were to issue proposed findings and rec -- conclusions and those that it was to hear and determine.
2013.12-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,684.875,685.244,I've got it.
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,697.585,699.385,"--There are -- there are several, Your Honor."
2013.12-1200,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,744.498,746.498,"Well, why would we have to do that, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier?"
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,769.048,777.037,"--It's -- unfortunately, the statutory language does not admit of severance of the kind that Respondents suggest."
2013.12-1200,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,796.612,798.981,But the definition -- the definition was linked to a purpose.
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,862.823,870.51,--I -- I don't think that 157(b) envisions that the district court could do that.
2013.12-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,885.254,907.519,"If -- if -- if we believe that the word “ determine ” means make a final judgment, which you assert it means, so that there's no ambiguity, it seems to me you have a statute in which the bankruptcy judge is only authorized to make recommendations in some situations and to make final judgments in others."
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,913.006,914.106,That -- that's right.
2013.12-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,914.106,920.093,"--by just saying, oh, I know you're supposed to make a final determination, but just for fun, give me your recommendation."
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,923.212,925.147,That's clearly not what Congress provided.
2013.12-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.364,930.368,"Congress might have -- might have provided that if it had known about Stern, right?"
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,930.935,931.601,--That's -- that's true.
2013.12-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,931.885,935.903,But do we sit here to write the statutes that Congress would have written--
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,935.903,937.689,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,937.689,939.355,--if they knew about some future events?
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,940.041,942.124,"And -- and, in fact, there are a number of--"
2013.12-1200,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,942.124,951.681,"Well, we do try though, again, to apply severability principles to write the statute that Congress would have written if it had known about a constitutional ruling."
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,954.966,957.935,"--I think, Your Honor, there are two problems with that."
2013.12-1200,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1063.186,1064.772,But none of that is involved in this case.
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1090.939,1093.707,But the formalities matter.
2013.12-1200,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1093.707,1096.007,"Well, why do they matter for Article 3?"
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1108.998,1113.633,"Well, I -- to begin, I think the formalities do matter and not only do I think so."
2013.12-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1125.44,1130.078,"Counsel, is Article 3 not violated so long as the parties are happy?"
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1130.078,1131.43,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1131.43,1143.404,"Can the parties agree to have a -- an Article 3 court decide a case it has no jurisdiction to decide, and so long as no harm is done to the parties, it's okay?"
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1143.404,1145.188,"Quite -- quite the contrary, Your Honor."
2013.12-1200,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1153.86,1156.912,I thought there were two aspects to the Article 3 problem.
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1186.931,1202.526,"To the contrary, Your Honor, in Schor, the Court made clear that where the structural features of the Constitution are at issue, that is precisely where parties cannot be depended upon to assert the interest, and it cannot be joined by consent."
2013.12-1200,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1248.755,1254.075,"Well, couldn't you say the same thing once again about magistrates, the exact same arguments would apply to them?"
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1254.075,1256.594,I think in large part they do.
2013.12-1200,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1269.252,1277.008,"Well, I don't see why that would make a difference if you say the problem is congressional aggrandizement or congressional encroachment of a certain kind."
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1282.394,1284.544,"You're absolutely right, Your Honor."
2013.12-1200,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1354.175,1358.06,Can I ask you to clarify what you're saying about the constitutionality of the Magistrates Act?
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1380.742,1382.594,"Only -- only the former, Your Honor."
2013.12-1200,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1382.594,1384.977,The former is not implicated in this case.
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1384.977,1386.979,That -- that's right.
2013.12-1200,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1388.581,1389.064,I see.
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1389.064,1390.964,--about the logic of the argument and how far it went.
2013.12-1200,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1441.23,1448.317,"So are you saying, contrary to our case law, that you can never have implied consent?"
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1452.369,1465.612,"I'm not arguing that there cannot be implied consent, but in Roell, as -- as a construction of the Magistrates Act, the Court held that consent must be knowing and voluntary."
2013.12-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.032,1473.868,You're confusing me.
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1483.524,1484.874,I'm -- I'm sorry.
2013.12-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1496.062,1496.429,Express or implied.
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1496.429,1497.83,Express or implied.
2013.12-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1499.047,1499.497,I thought that's what--
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1499.497,1518.227,"So this is the subsidiary argument, our, really, fallback argument, which is to say, even if consent could play a role, it would only be where that was part of the statute, and thus, part of the Court's analysis of whether this statute was constitutional."
2013.12-1200,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1518.227,1518.494,I'm a little confused.
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1518.494,1519.511,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2013.12-1200,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1519.511,1520.513,Let's just save your time.
2013.12-1200,0,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,1521.779,1526.85,"So there -- there were two cases that the other side had cited, Roell and McDonald, for that point."
2013.12-1200,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1538.224,1538.907,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1545.644,1549.613,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1200,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1649.296,1651.481,Does this bear on the question whether this is appellate?
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1656.652,1662.538,"--So if there is a judgment, I would concede that we then have an appeal that occurs, Justice Kennedy."
2013.12-1200,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1665.907,1672.661,"If there is a judgment in the bankruptcy court, you would concede there is an appeal to the district court?"
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1672.661,1675.446,"--If there is a district -- for example, in a noncore proceedings--"
2013.12-1200,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1675.446,1675.913,Yes.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1675.913,1676.413,--I'm sorry.
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1684.219,1700.996,"So you -- you read me -- want me to read that -- that when a district judge refers the matter to a bankruptcy judge to hear and determine and to enter an appropriate order, the bankruptcy judge can say, you know, I'm just too busy."
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1700.996,1701.313,No.
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1701.313,1709.017,"I'm on Easter vacation and I may hear and determine it, and I may enter appropriate orders, but I don't feel like it."
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1709.017,1709.334,No.
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1716.773,1718.292,It doesn't say that it may refer.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1720.775,1722.694,At the instruction of the district judge.
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1727.062,1729.681,How do you bring the “ may ” over to the district court?
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1729.681,1737.02,"In the order of reference, so we have to go back to 157(a), which is what -- what starts with the whole reference of cases from district courts."
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1753.898,1758.35,"Then the “ may ” that you're concerned with is the “ may ” in (a), not the “ may ” in (b)."
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1758.35,1761.302,"--I -- I use both of those “ mays ” if I may, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.244,1803.229,"And what the other side says is that's very nice, but that's not what the statute says."
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1831.831,1835.1,I think it has to come from a textual disagreement with my friend.
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1851.379,1852.362,"No, that's not my problem."
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1861.584,1864.286,"Oh, because I don't think--"
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1864.286,1865.502,Where does that come from?
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1870.44,1870.706,--I see.
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.931,1883.331,"Oh, really?"
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1894.222,1895.574,--But with consent of the parties?
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.574,1898.124,"Yes, even with the consent of the parties."
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1898.124,1899.893,"That would be a special master situation, I think, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1905.696,1906.629,To a special master.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1906.629,1907.146,Yes.
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.146,1910.25,But it has statutory authority to do that.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1921.823,1930.997,And -- and our position would be that the issuance of a report does not require a statutory authorization the way the entry of a judgment requires a statutory authorization.
2013.12-1200,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1936.233,1946.773,"You're saying basically, I think, that the words are, for core proceedings, it gives the power to the bankruptcy judge to hear and determine."
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1946.773,1947.123,--Yes.
2013.12-1200,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1947.123,1962.033,"And if I tell the assistant chef, you deal with orders for bacon and eggs, that might mean that the assistant chef can deal with eggs orders alone, or it might mean only those that order both."
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1962.033,1962.633,Yes.
2013.12-1200,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1962.633,1964.302,That's why I thought perhaps it's ambiguous.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1964.302,1964.735,Yes.
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.758,1980.612,"So it can do that for core -- for those core proceedings that were not held unconstitutional under Stern, right?"
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1980.612,1980.878,--Yes.
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.312,1983.195,It can just refer them and say just give me the eggs.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1983.195,1983.747,"--Yes, that's right."
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.747,1984.697,I don't need the bacon.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1984.697,1985.647,And that was the practice--
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.647,1988.116,You don't have to determine it; just give me your recommendation.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,1988.116,1988.482,--Yes.
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.188,2007.027,It seems to me the dichotomy set forth in the statute disappears once you say “ hear and determine ” means either “ hear and determine ” or “ hear or determine ”.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2007.027,2008.012,--But I don't think--
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2008.012,2009.612,The whole dichotomy of the statute disappears.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2009.612,2011.147,"--Justice Scalia, I don't think -- I don't think it's a dichotomy."
2013.12-1200,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2026.841,2027.307,All right.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2029.026,2029.376,Yes.
2013.12-1200,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2029.376,2031.895,"Because let's deal with statutory language, okay?"
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2048.922,2049.439,Yes.
2013.12-1200,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2049.439,2053.224,--we should treat them as noncore proceedings.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2055.76,2056.86,Yes.
2013.12-1200,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2064.547,2065.682,So if we're going to accord them the same treatment--
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2065.682,2066.016,Yes.
2013.12-1200,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2066.016,2072.386,--what do I do with Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012--
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2072.386,2072.853,Yes.
2013.12-1200,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2072.853,2075.505,"--which explicitly states, quote:"
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2119.95,2120.45,I think--
2013.12-1200,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2120.45,2134.793,"That -- that makes very -- I understand treating it like noncore proceeding, but if we're going to treat it that way, then I think you have to treat it that way for all purposes, not pick and choose the ones you want."
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2134.793,2143.466,"--I -- first of all, I'd like to give you some hope, Justice Sotomayor, which is there is amendments to Rule 7 012 that's percolating up to this Court for -- for consideration to address the issue."
2013.12-1200,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2174.603,2186.661,"The language of Roell, the magistrate judge's language didn't use the word -- the language in Roell, the magistrate judge's language didn't use the word “ express consent ”."
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2195.267,2195.801,"--No, but--"
2013.12-1200,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2195.801,2198.719,So the word “ express ” was not in the magistrate judge's act.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2198.719,2199.985,"--No, no, no, no."
2013.12-1200,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2207.825,2209.225,"No, here you have to express consent."
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2209.225,2209.991,--Yes.
2013.12-1200,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2215.245,2216.279,Got it.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2216.279,2216.847,--Okay.
2013.12-1200,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2216.847,2217.331,Okay.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2217.831,2226.136,"May I -- if I may, I'd like to go back to the question that Justice Kennedy raised and also back to Justice Alito's and Justice Ginsburg before."
2013.12-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2293.21,2299.38,You would concede that your case would be -- you would not have a case if we were dealing with factual findings?
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2299.38,2307.052,"Yes, that is -- I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, this is a unique factual posture, because other -- you can't have de novo review of a fact that there'd be a clearly erroneous standard."
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2346.929,2356.552,I want to go back to your statement that the district court here has both original and appellate jurisdiction because it can recall the reference to the bankruptcy judge.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2363.389,2364.475,--I don't--
2013.12-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2364.475,2366.358,Has entered a judgment in the case?
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2366.358,2370.629,--I think that would be -- I don't have any case authority for whether they can do that or not.
2013.12-1200,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2423.946,2435.069,But she did say that EBIA had the burden to demonstrate error in bankruptcy courts.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2435.069,2438.121,That -- she does say that at one point in her opinion.
2013.12-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2501.446,2501.913,I'm sorry.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2502.496,2511.669,"I was going to say, that's belied by the pleadings in his -- in his answer to the complaint, which is at page 8 0 of the Joint Appendix on the jurisdictional allegations of the Trustee, this is a core proceeding."
2013.12-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2514.704,2515.106,You're right.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2526.831,2536.787,"I would -- I would -- I would slightly rephrase that, Mr. Chief Justice, and say what Stern defined as the problem was the adjudication of the private right without the consent of the parties."
2013.12-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2538.47,2539.404,"Well, I guess that's my question."
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2547.994,2553.062,"--Well, in the Heckers case, which we cite in our material, the old -- the old Special Master's case, that's what happened."
2013.12-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2571.791,2582.065,"We've already told the district court, haven't we, that its Article 3 status is infringed when he refers or when there's a reference to a non-Article 3 tribunal?"
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2582.065,2586.467,"No, in -- I -- that's why I said I think it's two necessary conditions."
2013.12-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2592.487,2604.512,"So if the district court refers the case to his law partners, and that's fine with the parties, that law partner can enter a final judgment in the case subject only to appellate review?"
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2604.512,2605.764,That's what Heckers said.
2013.12-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2607.081,2607.781,Is that what you're saying?
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2607.781,2609.149,"--Yes, that's a Special Master."
2013.12-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2610.833,2615.637,The Special Masters do not enter final judgment subject only to appellate review.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2615.637,2627.027,"Well, technically if we want to go through the procedure of what these equity officers did, was they would prepare their report, and because they're acting as officers of the court, and then the clerk of court enters judgment."
2013.12-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2628.694,2630.312,But the appellate review is the important thing.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2646.589,2649.876,--That -- that is the current system under the magistrate judges under 636.
2013.12-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2649.876,2652.276,"Well, I know it's the current system under the magistrate judges."
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2655.128,2658.648,"No, you held it unconstitutional regarding an objecting defendant."
2013.12-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2749.921,2750.621,Finish your sentence.
2013.12-1200,1,32329,john_pottow,,2750.621,2755.575,I was going to say is that his codefendant won before the very same bankruptcy judge.
2013.12-1200,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2759.293,2760.378,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1200,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2771.502,2773.536,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2830.723,2834.775,"It's true, but if you were in the Ninth Circuit, and I would have -- you would have thought this was a core proceeding."
2013.12-1200,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2834.775,2836.293,You might have thought the same thing.
2013.12-1200,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2836.293,2840.512,"So he says, you know, of course I didn't object."
2013.12-1200,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2848.184,2853.154,"If there was true futility -- and I'm not talking about the consent argument now, Justice Breyer."
2013.12-1200,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2879.722,2885.809,And the answer suggested it because we he was claiming the fraudulent conveyance claim in his answer was noncore.
2013.12-1200,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2888.275,2900.219,"--Yes, I think it's -- he certainly did, as my colleague already pointed out on page 8 0 of the Joint Appendix and paragraph 2.1 of the answer denied the allegation that this was a core proceeding."
2013.12-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2947.364,2949.464,That's what I thought severability was.
2013.12-1200,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2957.235,2960.704,"I don't think any rewriting is required here, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3021.845,3029.682,Or it may be because the particular claim at issue in Stern was one that wasn't expected to arise in the normal course in bankruptcy proceedings.
2013.12-1200,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3029.682,3033.136,"Well, that -- that may be something the Court was thinking."
2013.12-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3105.932,3115.957,"Your -- your position is -- I mean, the authority to decide cases, which is our Constitutional birthright, we said in Stern that Congress can't take that away from us."
2013.12-1200,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3121.041,3121.891,Depending.
2013.12-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3154.526,3156.295,"No, it's the parties, the parties who are--"
2013.12-1200,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3156.295,3157.812,--It's not the parties that are choosing.
2013.12-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3157.812,3158.195,"--You said,"
2013.12-1200,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3164.901,3170.454,"You determined that it was unconstitutional in the absence of consent, and it's not just the consent of the parties."
2013.12-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3205.043,3208.428,"The point of everything that you said is, they do not comply with Article 3."
2013.12-1200,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3208.428,3211.531,"--They themselves are not Article 3 judges, that is certainly true."
2013.12-1200,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3226.374,3226.991,Mr. Gannon--
2013.12-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3226.991,3229.493,Does the district court have that authority after the entry of judgment?
2013.12-1200,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3229.493,3244.086,"--I -- I don't think as a statutory matter that 157(d), which is the provision that allows the district court to withdraw the reference, it's possible that that can't be done at that point, but I think that it is sensible as a matter of constitutional remedy."
2013.12-1200,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3272.687,3275.372,"--Mr. Gannon, could you say a word about the relevance of arbitration here?"
2013.12-1200,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3291.064,3304.058,"I -- obviously, we don't think that -- that these schemes here in the bankruptcy judge context and the magistrate judge context, which are -- which are hedged around with lots of procedural protections and statutory protections, rise to that level."
2013.12-1200,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3325.205,3335.679,"Yes, but that would suggest that arbitration is more constitutionally problematic because it -- it extends -- you know, it goes -- it's further away from the supervisory authority of the district court."
2013.12-1200,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3335.679,3343.033,--I'm -- I'm loathe to say that it's further away because I think that there may be a separation of powers distinction between--
2013.12-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3343.033,3347.168,Arbitration is a matter of contract between two parties.
2013.12-1200,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3357.026,3358.109,"--Well, I do--"
2013.12-1200,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3358.109,3360.911,A matter of contract versus a matter of consent?
2013.12-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3364.447,3367.565,"But you -- I'm posing a question to you, I guess."
2013.12-1200,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3380.891,3383.243,"--That's true, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-1200,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3399.87,3401.205,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1200,3,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,3403.657,3406.007,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-1200,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3443.899,3446.517,What are we supposed to assume here on this point?
2013.12-1200,3,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,3488.994,3497.599,"--Although Northern Pipeline, because the party had objected, did not address the question whether consent--"
2013.12-1200,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3497.599,3499.532,"Now, you heard what I read from Thomas."
2013.12-1200,3,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,3512.107,3512.823,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-1200,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3519.111,3529.15,"My question is are we supposed to go into that or do we just take as assumed what Thomas said and Stern said, and I think -- you know what I said."
2013.12-1200,3,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,3530.002,3533.37,"--Well, Thomas certainly does not foreclose the argument that I'm making because--"
2013.12-1200,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3533.37,3537.338,They didn't say that it's okay without consent.
2013.12-1200,3,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,3537.338,3537.638,--Right.
2013.12-1200,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3537.638,3539.19,They just say it is okay with consent.
2013.12-1200,3,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,3540.524,3541.709,"That's right, Your Honor."
2013.12-1200,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3541.709,3544.828,I think we should have briefing on the point if we are going into it.
