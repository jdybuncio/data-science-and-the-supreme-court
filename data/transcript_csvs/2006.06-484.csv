2006.06-484,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.376,"We'll hear argument this morning in case 06-484, Tellabs, Inc. versus Makor Issues & Rights."
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,8.986,11.55,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-484,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,53.646,71.718,"At some point during your argument... and I know you only have 20 minutes... will you tell me whether or not in your view the pleading standard that the judge must follow is equivalent, is the same as the instruction that's given to the jury?"
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,76.99,80.433,I think the answer to the question is that it does not have to be the same.
2006.06-484,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,96.485,105.02,"Well, in writing... I take it, so far as the jury, it's just whether it's more likely than not, preponderance of the evidence."
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,105.02,107.912,"--That's what the Court held... held in Huddleston, yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-484,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,107.912,124.061,"So your submission is, maybe not in this case, but insofar as your theory of the case, that the trial judge can, and in fact must basically apply a standard of fact... standard of proof that's higher than that what the jury would."
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,124.061,135.231,"Well, it's important as a standard of allegation, because what we're talking about here is an analysis of the allegations of the lawyers, and not any kind of an evidentiary showing by any of the plaintiffs."
2006.06-484,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,174.266,187.083,"Mr. Phillips, the Seventh Amendment or not, the question in 12(b)(6) is has the plaintiff stated a claim, and at the end of the line it's has the plaintiff proved a claim."
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,200.363,207.766,"I don't know that there are any other instances in which that's true, Justice Ginsburg, but I don't think it's a constitutional problem."
2006.06-484,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,220.826,233.225,"I wasn't asking it as a matter of constitutional law but I'm thinking, how do you construe these words, what is it, ""strong inference""?"
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,261.072,263.345,"--Well, I'm not sure that's 100 percent true."
2006.06-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,291.483,292.014,"Mr. Phillips, can I ask this question?"
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,292.014,292.264,--I'm sorry.
2006.06-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.264,301.29,"One of the amicus briefs talks in terms of the percentages, how likely the inference, the word strong inference means 50 percent, 30 percent, 60 percent."
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,312.086,318.31,"I think it would have to be stronger than that, although I don't know how to translate that into percentages, Justice Stevens."
2006.06-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,318.31,328.559,A civil case would impose a higher standard for getting discovery in a civil case than they would for getting access to a citizen's private papers and the like?
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,328.559,337.064,"I think the use of the language ""strong inference"" carries with it a very significant burden that has to be demonstrated by the buyer."
2006.06-484,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,337.064,337.825,A burden of over 50 percent?
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,337.825,338.875,"Oh, to be sure."
2006.06-484,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.875,354.845,"In a criminal case, the person seeking that action is a government officer who presumptively is not acting out of selfish motives, whereas we're talking about private suits and some private litigants are selfish."
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,354.845,356.985,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-484,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,368.273,369.705,I just have to make it clear.
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,379.323,379.991,Yes.
2006.06-484,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,381.944,387.978,Doesn't the... doesn't the standard at the pleading stage have to be the same as the standard at the summary judgment stage?
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,405.319,407.059,--I think at the end of the day I would make that argument.
2006.06-484,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,440.502,457.114,"But isn't the difference between Matsushita and this particular case at least as you are presenting this case, the... the... focused on the strength of this exclusion of innocent conduct?"
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,487.001,513.457,"I think there may be a slight semantic difference there, but the truth is at end of the day all we're asking for the Court to do is to evaluate the complaint, taking both the positive and the negative inferences from it, excluding ambiguities, interpreting them not in favor of the plaintiff, as you traditionally do, take into account whether there is an allegation of motive, and say at the end of the day whether or not that reaches a... rises to the level of a strong inference."
2006.06-484,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,513.457,519.342,But... but Matsushita as I recall did not require it to rise beyond the level of a plausible inference.
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,540.156,545.86,"Well, if I'm going to err on either side, I obviously prefer that the Court carries out Congress's intent."
2006.06-484,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,579.191,591.43,"Is it fair to say at the pleading stage it's the equivalent of a clear and convincing standard, whereas at the end of the road it would only be more probable than not?"
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,591.43,605.21,"Well, again, I think it... I think it puts an issue... and we raised this in our reply brief, whether or not Huddleston should be reconsidered in light of this sort of basic change in the way Congress is approaching private securities litigation."
2006.06-484,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,607.04,608.111,So you do--
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,608.111,609.031,--There are a number of ways to go at it.
2006.06-484,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.677,614.874,Yeah.
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,641.491,661.845,"All I'm suggesting is that if the Court were concerned that somehow there is a disconnect between the pleading standard and the ultimate standard of proof, the way to resolve that incongruity... if it is one... would to be reconsider the ultimate standard of proof, not to throw out the clearly congressionally approved baby as part of that bath water."
2006.06-484,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,661.845,665.488,Can you tell me a little bit of how... how this should work in your view?
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,674.484,674.935,Right.
2006.06-484,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,674.935,681.729,Can we make a strong inference that a CEO knows what his own earnings reports are?
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,681.729,689.854,You mean with a specific earnings report rather than just simply sort of sales projections and demand?
2006.06-484,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,689.854,694.826,Can we make a strong inference that a CEO knows the status of current earnings--
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,694.826,695.577,"Well, my guess is they--"
2006.06-484,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,695.577,697.298,"--when he makes, when he makes a statement."
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,697.298,705.685,"--Well, I think they would have to make an allegation that the... that the CEO routinely is provided with that information rather than simply assume it."
2006.06-484,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,718.583,720.075,How about just saying that he knew it?
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,720.075,720.746,I'm not--
2006.06-484,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,720.746,721.624,Just saying that he knew it.
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,741.229,746.612,"--I don't think that's sufficient, because it requires for the facts that particularly show--"
2006.06-484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,746.612,757.538,"But suppose it says, which I think it did say, that Mr. Notebaert typically stayed on top of the company's financial health by having weekly conversations with other executives."
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,769.296,782.106,"--But the... but the problem with that allegation, and we're talking about the 6500, the Titan 6500 product specifically, in that context, the report is, there's nothing in there that says what those reports say about the 6500."
2006.06-484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,798.455,811.053,"Well, I thought they alleged at least that for about a year previously in respect to the 506500 that it was wrong known throughout the company that the 6500 had been delayed."
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,812.854,817.799,Right but that's... that being delayed for a year is not the basis for the claim.
2006.06-484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,836.43,839.011,The 6500 has long been delayed.
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,844.025,844.605,--I think--
2006.06-484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,844.605,846.937,Then what he says is it is being shipped and delivered.
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,847.888,853.192,"--But Justice Breyer, that... that long been delayed period runs all the way back to 1998."
2006.06-484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,893.307,897.351,"April '01, he says everything we can build we are building, and shipping."
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,909.649,911.089,"But you... you... Justice Breyer, you make a leap there."
2006.06-484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,911.089,911.39,Oh.
2006.06-484,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,911.68,912.9,Is that they all knew that.
2006.06-484,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,935.295,936.377,Thank you Mr. Phillips.
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,945.704,948.946,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,983.878,992.276,Do you have a position on Justice Alito's earlier question about whether the standard at the summary judgment stage is the same as the standard at the pleading stage?
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,992.276,1002.981,"--First of all to be clear, Mr. Chief Justice, we don't believe that the Court needs to address that question in this case, because we don't believe that that sort of disparity would present any Seventh Amendment concerns."
2006.06-484,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1040.785,1044.999,And by the proof stage you mean both summary judgment and submission to jury?
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1044.999,1047.232,"I think that that is right, Justice Kennedy."
2006.06-484,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1070.927,1072.998,What would you think about the following--
2006.06-484,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1072.998,1074.799,"May I just... may I just, very briefly."
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1083.665,1087.037,"--Well, again, we don't believe that the Court needs to address that question."
2006.06-484,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1087.037,1087.288,I understand that.
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1088.249,1090.4,And the statute by its terms only--
2006.06-484,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1090.4,1092.23,It is either a yes or no question.
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1092.23,1096.504,"--Well, I think that the answer is yes if the Court feels it needs to address that question."
2006.06-484,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1102.748,1108.581,"--there was a pleading stage, I would like your clear view on how much that changes."
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1135.61,1139.533,"--I think that it is, Justice Ginsburg, to this limited extent."
2006.06-484,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1196.989,1212.66,"Why don't we simply assume that the read most favorable to the plaintiff rule is still in place, but that reading it most favorably to the plaintiff, it must rise to the level of supporting the strong inference?"
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1212.66,1219.834,"I guess, Justice Souter, that I would wonder what it would mean to say that you read the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff."
2006.06-484,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1245.051,1251.576,"Well, but I was using the word inference to... to refer to some reasoning process based upon what is stated."
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1281.643,1297.165,"--I think our only concern, Justice Souter, would be that where a plaintiff includes ambiguous allegations in the complaint, a court should consider the possibility that those ambiguities work to the defendant's favor as well as working to the plaintiff's favor."
2006.06-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1320.76,1333.019,"Mr. Shanmugam, could... could I get you back to... to your, your assertion of we don't have to reach in this case the question of whether the same standard applies at trial as, as at the pleading stage?"
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1358.835,1365.74,"--Well, that is certainly correct, Justice Scalia, but in our view, there is no constitutional problem here."
2006.06-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1379.268,1382.26,But you're getting to the merits of the constitutional problem.
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1390.397,1413.061,"Well, to the extent that the Court views the constitutional issue in this case as sufficiently substantial to trigger the canon of constitutional avoidance, then we do believe that the better view, the view that is more consistent with Congress's intent, is that if the Court is choosing between raising the standard at the pre stage and watering down the standard at the pleadings stage, we believe that the former is more consistent with Congress's--"
2006.06-484,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1413.061,1421.937,"Even if there is no Seventh Amendment problem, what sense would it make to have a regime that says plaintiff has to plead more than the plaintiff has to show at summary judgment or prove at trial."
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1421.937,1426.88,"--Well, Congress was concerned, Justice Alito, with the problem of abusive pleading."
2006.06-484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1457.96,1460.131,What do you think in writing this opinion?
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1478.972,1488.96,"Justice Breyer, our primary concern in this case is with the way that the Court of Appeals articulated the applicable standard, which we believe may have pernicious effects in future cases."
2006.06-484,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1496.005,1498.406,You said the Court of Appeals to apply it.
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1507.393,1514.088,"--In our view, Justice Ginsburg, applying the correct standard, the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case should be reversed."
2006.06-484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1521.11,1523.802,"You had something else to say in answer to my question, which I would like to hear."
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1523.802,1535.22,"I think it was just that point, Justice Breyer, namely, that if the Court believes that it would be useful to provide guidance to the lower courts by applying the standard itself in this case, we do believe that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed rather than vacated."
2006.06-484,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1535.22,1537.971,"--Is the requisite standard, knowledge of falsity."
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1537.971,1545.818,"The requisite scienter is either intent or recklessness, with regard to the underlying conduct at issue, in effect--"
2006.06-484,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1545.818,1547.087,Intent to make a false statement?
2006.06-484,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1547.087,1548.088,"--Yes, that's right."
2006.06-484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1552.323,1554.414,Thank you Mr. Shanmugam.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1558.664,1561.676,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court?"
2006.06-484,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1618.204,1623.848,Do we take judicial notice that a CEO knows these things and that's the strong inference.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1623.848,1633.073,"--Again, you have confidential sources in this case, and in the case, Notebaert is hands on, he's talking to people, he's on the phone all the time."
2006.06-484,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1635.934,1637.667,But you agree you have to have that?
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1642.44,1646.843,--I would think you should be able to infer it with the CEO.
2006.06-484,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1656.829,1670.958,"The most suspicious thing in the complaint that I could find was where you say there's an internal market report, and it revealed demand for the 5500 was drying up, and revenue would decline by 400,000,000."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1683.389,1683.977,--If we knew.
2006.06-484,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1683.977,1692.682,"Yeah, and therefore, there's quite a good chance here that this report was written after he made the statements."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1698.677,1699.047,Yes.
2006.06-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1756.105,1759.639,You're arguing the facts and the inferences.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1780.582,1783.506,We believe two propositions.
2006.06-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1789.568,1791.971,I don't understand the Seventh Amendment argument here.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1808.591,1811.093,"--That is correct, Chief Justice."
2006.06-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1823.311,1830.467,"Well, but Congress just established an entry qualification for getting into court."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1859.748,1867.653,"I think that is absolutely correct, and indeed rule 9(b) has been an entry qualification since 1938."
2006.06-484,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1893.929,1898.373,What's the difference between what Justice Scalia was just saying?
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1926.621,1929.333,--And did Congress raise the burden--
2006.06-484,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1929.333,1929.633,No.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1933.397,1954.721,"--The entry points you referred to, the so-called pleas in abatement, to put on my common law hat, a jurisdiction venue, et cetera, they may raise issues of fact and Congress, in control of the Federal courts, can calibrate it any way they want."
2006.06-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1970.23,1980.927,"I thought you told me that Congress could set a high level of burden on factual issues, and that that wouldn't intrude upon the Seventh Amendment."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1980.927,1986.4,"--I'm distinguishing, Mr. Chief Justice, between the merits and the entry point."
2006.06-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1986.4,1995.406,Are you saying that Congress can not set a fact burden on the merits that is different than preponderance of the evidence.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1995.406,1996.067,No.
2006.06-484,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2001.471,2010.747,"So you would say that you could have a beyond reasonable doubt standard that must be met at the pleading level, but more likely than not at the jury level?"
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2010.747,2011.086,No.
2006.06-484,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2015.589,2017.84,We want to know what the rule is.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2017.84,2020.171,--I'm not sure it's the rule.
2006.06-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2073.295,2084.145,"If I'm with you so far, why would you suppose that Congress would create a different standard on the motion to dismiss than they meant to apply at the merits standard?"
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2084.145,2086.054,I don't think Congress would.
2006.06-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2122.989,2126.311,"Well, then what was Congress trying to do when they said strong inference?"
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2137.968,2142.172,What you have to show at proof is preponderance.
2006.06-484,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2142.172,2147.816,Then it seems to me that you have the meaning of strong inference and reasonable inference.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2147.816,2150.928,"Our standard, as proposed, and we think--"
2006.06-484,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2150.928,2153.238,You don't want to answer yes or no there?
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2153.238,2166.578,"--is reasonable jurors, who are finders of fact, could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants acted with scienter."
2006.06-484,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2166.578,2171.311,"So you're saying those words, strong inference, mean essentially the same thing as reasonable inference."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2171.311,2171.871,No.
2006.06-484,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2177.664,2190.574,"That's true, but imagine a case where the plaintiff with tremendous candor sets forth every bit of testimony that's going to be heard on both sides."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2222.415,2224.024,If--
2006.06-484,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2224.024,2226.406,Because they certainly didn't intend the weak inference standard.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2226.406,2258.078,"--If you follow petitioners in their attempt to deconstruct not simply Rule 8's construction, but hundreds of years of what this Court in Jones versus Bock referred to as usual procedural practices which are not to be lightly departed from, the historic notion is you look at the complaint and in a curious way, you have blinders on."
2006.06-484,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2273.556,2283.814,How can you assess the strength of the inference that can be drawn from the facts alleged in the complaint without considering all the inferences that could be drawn from those facts?
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2314.305,2319.959,"As the Seventh Circuit did, we agree, you look at the totality of the complaint."
2006.06-484,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2350.286,2360.915,"Well, let's take one specific example that the petitioners did, and that is this matter of the channel stuffing."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2396.609,2415.228,"The Seventh Circuit reached that conclusion, I think, by looking at some of the confidential sources which sort of indicated that there was channel stuffing in the sense of pushing product out which was coming back."
2006.06-484,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2465.131,2474.668,Are you entitled to consider the brush strokes that are not there as well as the subsidiary brush strokes that are?
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2490.298,2494.87,"Obviously, if it's something you can take judicial notice of, then yes."
2006.06-484,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2494.87,2495.431,Okay.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2502.106,2507.549,But it's within the realm of what courts have done for the longest of the time.
2006.06-484,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2511.253,2512.355,What do you think about that?
2006.06-484,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2512.355,2526.273,"There are at least some circumstances, then, in which there this is kind of critical assessment function that you concede must go on, rather than simply a piling favorable inference onto favorable inference to see if it gets to the strong points."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2526.273,2529.936,"I repeat what I said a couple of minutes ago, Justice Souter."
2006.06-484,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2560.947,2568.401,That is... that is an argument for the weight of considering motive rather than the relevance of the motive consideration per se.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2568.401,2571.884,--I think it is a tough line.
2006.06-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2596.371,2603.914,"But all of those cases were before the PSLRA where Congress, it seems to me, established a very different standard."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2606.426,2607.788,A strong inference.
2006.06-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2609.688,2614.991,"Strong inference was not the test that was being applied in Anderson, Liberty Lobby, in any of those cases."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2614.991,2626.672,"But can't... but strong inference, as Justice Ginsburg said much earlier, was the standard not only in the Second Circuit but in the First Circuit and in the Third Circuit."
2006.06-484,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2626.672,2630.643,What do you think about the approach... because I have had some of these cases.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2656.318,2659.741,Live to fight another day?
2006.06-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2659.741,2660.472,Right.
2006.06-484,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2676.534,2681.125,And I hope we're going to recognize that Congress thought it was doing something.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2683.877,2685.399,Excuse me.
2006.06-484,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2685.399,2689.991,"--You indicated that the... you know, the plaintiff had to do all this investigation."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2694.065,2697.826,Look at the statute in its entirety.
2006.06-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2728.245,2733.719,How does that change how we should read strong inference in the statute?
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2753.862,2769.292,"--The notion of strong inference starting with the Second Circuit doctrine, as used in many other circuits, was actually a much lower standard than what we are recommending."
2006.06-484,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2800.405,2812.731,"Mr. Miller, going back just to the word strong, forgetting the particularization from it, do you think you can categorize the strength in percentage terms?"
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2821.268,2824.32,--I have... forgive me.
2006.06-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2839.33,2841.403,I think it's 66 and two-thirds.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2843.504,2847.958,--Is that because you never met a plaintiff you really liked?
2006.06-484,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2848.269,2855.131,At least we know that in the probable world--
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2855.131,2858.043,I took a liberty there with the Justice.
2006.06-484,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2862.266,2867.209,"Well, I think more likely than not, most people think of 49, 50 percent."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2872.434,2873.864,--I do not believe it is.
2006.06-484,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2887.074,2887.982,--Let me just reclaim the question.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2891.365,2894.076,"--Oh, I would hope it's stronger."
2006.06-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2897.259,2898.641,What about clear and convincing?
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2922.027,2924.378,And--
2006.06-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2924.378,2925.77,You don't think they mean anything?
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2925.77,2952.016,"--No, I think they mean what a district judge honoring his Article III commission concludes after an intensive evaluation of the entirety of the complaint, looking for that strong inference, putting on his sort of motion to dismiss 12(b)(6) hat, says okay--"
2006.06-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2952.016,2954.497,Just okay?
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2954.497,2957.028,"--No, I did not mean that."
2006.06-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2963.223,2963.944,Let me write that down.
2006.06-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2966.826,2971.117,"Okay, you two are even now."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,2971.427,2982.334,"Understand, you keep asking, quite properly obviously, how does strong inference change anything?"
2006.06-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3037.592,3043.265,Trial worthy under preponderance standard or trial worthy under the strong inference standard?
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,3043.265,3049.961,"Oh, I think he is becoming slightly schizoid, he is saying, I'm looking at strong inference."
2006.06-484,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3076.077,3077.648,It sounds to me like--
2006.06-484,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3077.648,3080.96,"It's not trial worthy, but rather discovery worthy."
2006.06-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3080.96,3081.34,I'm sorry.
2006.06-484,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3083.221,3086.373,"I think the question is not whether it's trial worthy, it's whether it's worthy for discovery."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,3088.824,3095.569,"Well, the realities out there are they built a wall."
2006.06-484,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3137.496,3139.527,"--I want, I want to be fair."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,3165.126,3172.079,"The way you state it, Justice, is something very hard for me to respond to."
2006.06-484,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3234.129,3249.35,"Yeah, and so I think we have to reach it, because it can't possibly be you would instruct the jury you need a strong inference, and it couldn't possibly be that a predominance standard if imported into the pleading would always mean a strong inference."
2006.06-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3270.424,3275.998,"Mr. Miller, suppose Congress set up a entirely separate cause of action."
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,3305.917,3313.833,--Why do I feel wind whipping past my ears as I go through a trap door?
2006.06-484,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3336.098,3341.962,Surely it could prohibit discovery altogether which it did before they adopt in 1938.
2006.06-484,2,16545,arthur_r_miller,,3341.962,3342.863,--That is correct.
2006.06-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3370.639,3372.582,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
2006.06-484,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3375.534,3377.987,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-484,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3430.151,3437.206,But then you're doing away with reading the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.
2006.06-484,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3437.206,3437.437,--Absolutely.
2006.06-484,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3466.055,3470.607,"But Mr. Phillips, you don't look at these things one at a time."
2006.06-484,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3472.66,3473.609,"--Well, that is--"
2006.06-484,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3473.609,3474.82,Is the statute all you had?
2006.06-484,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3474.82,3477.872,"--Justice Ginsburg, I couldn't disagree with you more about that."
2006.06-484,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3486.688,3490.1,It says you must plead the facts with particularity.
2006.06-484,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3490.1,3491.14,--Yes.
2006.06-484,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3491.14,3501.047,"But when one judges the adequacy of the complaint, one looks at all the facts pleaded with particularity, not just one."
2006.06-484,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3501.047,3506.721,But the strong inference of scienter is not pled on a group basis.
2006.06-484,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3512.404,3514.275,"Well, I think that this case was a good example."
2006.06-484,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3517.407,3517.697,"--Well, there were a lot more than that."
2006.06-484,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3517.697,3522.001,"--Well, to take the two that were at issue in this opinion."
2006.06-484,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3542.414,3560.806,"Well, I... I... I mean, I was commenting primarily on Professor Miller's decision to just sort of sweep everything in and say look, back in 1999 and 2000 when the Seventh Circuit itself specifically said that the knowledge, for instance, of the 5500 decline didn't happen until March of 2001."
2006.06-484,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3580.391,3586.155,What do you do with a report that you know exists because you had one of these 26 confidential people tell you?
2006.06-484,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3601.904,3614.023,--I think you better make an allegation with particularity that that date was at a time when the individual would know that the... that the information that he was conveying was... was wrong.
2006.06-484,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3615.954,3616.574,But you... if the plaintiff--
2006.06-484,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3616.574,3617.436,--scienter otherwise.
2006.06-484,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3617.436,3624.679,--The plaintiff can't know for sure without seeing the document with a date on it.
2006.06-484,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3624.679,3633.375,"Well, the plaintiff can ask the confidential informant as much as, as he wants about the information; and if he can't come up with it, that's the price you pay."
2006.06-484,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3643.332,3645.653,"Congress... Congress used words, ""strong inference""."
2006.06-484,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3658.643,3660.133,I could be flip to say it's the right way.
2006.06-484,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3676.127,3677.439,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
