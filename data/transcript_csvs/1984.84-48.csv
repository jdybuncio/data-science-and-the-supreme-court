1984.84-48,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.82,The Court will hear arguments first this morning in United States against Bagley.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,9.856,41.141,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in this case the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit awarded respondent a new trial on the ground that the government had not disclosed to respondent certain documents in its files that respondent claims he could have used to impeach two government witnesses."
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,225.927,227.196,"Mr. Strauss, may I interrupt?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,237.052,239.254,"That is right, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,254.863,256.429,Not even the name Mitchell?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,256.429,258.798,There was no finding about the name Mitchell.
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,261.267,269.856,"The language that he will provide information regarding T1 and other violations committed by Hughes A. Bagley and so forth, that was typed in after the trial?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,269.856,271.389,That is the finding.
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,271.389,272.275,I see.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,275.177,279.979,"I believe the testimony of the supervising ATF agent, named Prins."
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,279.979,285.033,"And I notice it is signed by three officers of ATF, and they all signed after the trial, too?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,285.033,285.799,"Yes, that is right."
1984.84-48,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,370.885,380.408,"Mr. Strauss, the government here doesn't challenge the application of the Brady doctrine to purely impeaching materials, I take it."
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,380.408,387.062,We do not dispute that there are some circumstances in which the prosecution has an obligation to disclose purely impeaching material.
1984.84-48,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,388.095,390.847,And this case is one of them?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,390.847,393.716,"No, this case, we would submit, is not one of them."
1984.84-48,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,393.716,401.671,Can you imagine any way this case could have gone the other way and for the Judge to say I was wrong?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,401.671,407.141,You mean for Judge Vorhees to say?
1984.84-48,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,410.593,412.527,"I mean, I think it is a horrible burden to put on somebody."
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,412.527,425.37,"Well, I can understand, Justice Marshall, where a judge might in fact have an overreaction the opposite way and be incensed that this material was not brought to his attention."
1984.84-48,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,425.37,432.607,"When you were told to explain why you did something six years ago, your subconscious tells you to defend it."
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,432.607,438.428,"Well, I think that is certainly right, Justice Marshall, and there are decisions of this Court predicated on that, but Judge--"
1984.84-48,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,438.428,439.613,But was he--
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,439.613,441.097,"--I am sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-48,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,459.157,466.328,"--When the case was tried before the court without a jury, was any of this information before the court?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,466.328,469.097,These form contracts were not before the court.
1984.84-48,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,469.097,471.632,"Yes, and that is the only issue in the case, isn't it?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,471.632,473.084,"That is right, is whether those had been--"
1984.84-48,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,473.084,475.702,So this was in effect something newly discovered.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,475.702,478.002,--That is exactly right.
1984.84-48,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,478.002,487.51,"In making the judgment he made, Judge Vorhees did not have to review any judgment or decision he had previously made on the issue involved here, did he?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,487.51,487.976,That's right.
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,487.976,495.597,"But, Mr. Strauss, wasn't there an affidavit or something denying that anything like this occurred that Judge Vorhees had?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,495.597,506.905,There were affidavits that Judge Vorhees had that the respondent but not the Court of Appeals has made quite an issue of.
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,512.959,514.928,"I know, but did Judge Vorhees have those?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,518.529,524.449,He could not have understood that there were no such contracts in those affidavits because the affidavits made no such representation.
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,524.449,526.885,What did the affidavits show?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,526.885,542.728,"The affidavits were long, detailed recountings of the undercover dealings between the witnesses and the defendant, and they concluded with a recital that said, I have made these statements free of threats or promises or promises of reward."
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,546.447,549.501,And O'Connor and the other officer signed those affidavits?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,549.501,550.401,They signed those affidavits.
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,550.401,552.184,And Judge Vorhees had those?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,552.184,553.286,It is not clear.
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,561.724,568.128,"But those statements were clearly false when they said they were free of promise of reward, because there is a promise of reward in these form contracts."
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,568.128,570.794,"No, that is not right, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,583.804,590.641,"Yes, but might not the Judge have concluded that based on that statement that Justice Stevens referred to in those affidavits?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,590.641,595.778,The judge who concluded that was the judge on habeas proceedings--
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,595.778,596.495,I see.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,596.495,598.328,--who had before him... the entire record before him.
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,598.328,599.128,Not the trial judge?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,599.128,603.315,"Not the trial... he was the trial judge, but he was the trial judge sitting in the habeas proceeding."
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,607.101,615.473,"The form document says, the United States will pay to said vendor a sum commensurate with services and information rendered."
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,615.473,629.049,"The testimony, Justice Stevens, that they gave was that while they were conducting this investigation, they were busy signing a lot of forms that were shown to them by the case agent, and they basically didn't know what the forms were for."
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,629.049,631.682,"They gave that testimony before the magistrate, not before the judge."
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,631.682,632.084,That's right.
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,632.084,633.501,They never said that to the judge.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,633.501,635.953,"That's right, but the judge upheld the magistrate's finding."
1984.84-48,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,635.953,637.686,When was that?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,644.142,646.678,That was in the habeas proceeding in 1981.
1984.84-48,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,646.678,647.744,This is five or six years later.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,647.744,648.228,Yes.
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.228,654.682,So the judge's decision did not involve in any sense reviewing his own prior judgment.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,654.682,655.7,That is right.
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,655.7,657.417,How can you say that?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,662.953,667.674,The prior judgment was based on different evidence from the evidence that was before him at the--
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.674,671.309,"But it involved a complete review of the prior judgment, did it not?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,672.826,678.197,--I don't know whether that constitutes review of the prior judgment or not.
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.732,685.184,How could he have said he would have made the same decision without knowing what he decided in the first place?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,685.184,700.877,"Well, of course he knew what he decided in the first place, but the point is that the judge had no... the factors that operate in cases like Santa Pella to cause judges to have a commitment to the decision they previously reached so that they will be unwilling to overturn that decision do not operate here, because there is new evidence."
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,709.732,710.934,May I... just one other question.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,717.822,722.642,I am not sure that the government would have had an obligation.
1984.84-48,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,728.962,733.681,Did this material relate to the narcotics charge or the firearms charge?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,733.681,739.318,"The witnesses testified on both, but their testimony was primarily on the firearms charges."
1984.84-48,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,739.318,743.305,And they were acquitted on that charge?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,743.305,744.338,They were acquitted on that charge.
1984.84-48,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,744.905,749.04,"Once again, why isn't it Jencks Act?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,749.04,752.992,"It is not Jencks Act, Justice Marshall, because it is not a statement."
1984.84-48,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,762.867,767.401,I thought you said that the government apologized for not knowing it was there.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,767.401,770.186,The United States attorney said that if he had had these documents--
1984.84-48,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,770.186,772.972,"Well, why would he do that if he wasn't required to produce it?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,772.972,777.09,--I think it would have been very good practice for him to do it.
1984.84-48,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,799.04,826.19,"Well, Mr. Strauss, it is your position that the request of the defense counsel when requesting prior criminal records of witnesses to be called by the government and any deals, promises, or inducements made to the witnesses simply didn't cover the document that had been given to the witnesses to sign?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,826.19,831.677,"We think that is right, Justice O'Connor, although that is not the argument we are primarily relying on."
1984.84-48,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,851.507,854.126,"That is a pretty fine line you are trying to draw, isn't it?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,854.126,860.863,"I think there is a difference in the effect that would have on the credibility of the witness, but I would add that that is not... our primary argument is not--"
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,860.863,874.688,"The fact finder would certainly regard as rather substantial evidence that a government witness was being paid, whether in return for a promise or anything else, wouldn't he?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,874.688,875.771,--I think--
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,875.771,878.806,"Attorneys would love to have evidence like that, wouldn't they?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,878.806,880.373,"--I think that is probably right, Justice--"
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,880.373,884.21,And you suggest it is not good impeachment material?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,884.21,887.996,--I think a defense attorney probably would want to inquire into that.
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,889.329,889.948,Would want to?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,893.066,907.159,"--Well, one of the findings that the District Judge made in this case was that the defense attorney's cross examination tactic was not to try to undermine the witness's credibility, but to try to enlist them on his side."
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,907.159,910.611,But he didn't know of the existence of these contracts when he was cross examining these witnesses.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,910.611,912.261,He didn't know of the existence of these form contracts.
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,912.261,914.646,"If he had, he would certainly have been after them, wouldn't he?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,914.646,917.865,"There is no finding to that effect, and there is no reason to think that."
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,917.865,919.383,Common sense would tell you that.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,919.383,920.333,"Well, I think--"
1984.84-48,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,920.333,921.999,"He asked for them, didn't he?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,921.999,931.872,"--He asked for deals, promises... he made an omnibus request for deals, promises, or inducements in exchange for the testimony, not for anything specific like this."
1984.84-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,941.846,962.493,"Mr. Strauss, the judge on habeas certainly wouldn't have gotten to a harmless error analysis unless he thought there was error, and he couldn't have found that there was error unless he thought there had been concealment of material information."
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,962.493,964.543,"--I think, Justice White--"
1984.84-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,964.543,967.228,And you suggest that it wasn't even material.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,967.228,975.234,"--I think, Justice White, that the judge on habeas found there was harmless error in order to avoid having to rule whether it was even material or within the request at all."
1984.84-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.638,989.993,"Well, I know, but identifying material to show possible bias, I think that is enough of a finding of materiality."
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,989.993,1006.689,"These were blank... the finding was, these were blank contracts with only the witnesses' signatures on it, that no promises of any kind were made to the witnesses, and that ultimately the witnesses were paid some money, well after the trial."
1984.84-48,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1016.961,1021.199,Didn't the government furnish these documents?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1036.274,1039.66,"Essentially, that's right, Justice O'Connor."
1984.84-48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1039.66,1042.195,How much did they get paid?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1042.195,1043.611,$300 apiece.
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1043.611,1045.647,Plus expenses?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1045.647,1046.813,Plus expenses.
1984.84-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.813,1057.788,You don't seem to... you just wouldn't be satisfied with winning this case on the basis that you won it before the habeas judge?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1057.788,1061.007,We would be more than satisfied to win this case on that basis.
1984.84-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1061.007,1062.858,"Well, that is just on a harmless error basis."
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1070.195,1083.086,"The question we presented concerned the harmless error issue, and we would be more than happy just to get rid of the Ninth Circuit's automatic reversal rule, which we think is completely unfounded."
1984.84-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.086,1088.307,"Well, if we disagreed with that, wouldn't we remand to have them review the District Judge's determination of harmless error?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1088.307,1090.676,"I think that is right, Justice White."
1984.84-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.728,1098.346,You certainly go much farther than that in the brief.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1108.119,1110.304,"Well, than the constitutional harmless error rule."
1984.84-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.163,1130.551,"Well, you think it is unnecessarily strict, but it certainly is indicated by our prior cases, isn't it?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1130.551,1132.503,"--I don't think that's right, Justice White."
1984.84-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1144.311,1147.013,Constitutional error.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1149.981,1153.332,--It is the standard that applies to constitutional error.
1984.84-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1153.332,1157.784,But we shouldn't review that on the ordinary harmless error basis.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1157.784,1162.372,The failure to disclose these documents is not constitutional error.
1984.84-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.544,1176.18,"Well, if there isn't any error... what kind of an error is it if it isn't a constitutional error?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1176.18,1178.798,It is an error if it leads to the trial being unfair.
1984.84-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1180.067,1182.269,That isn't a constitutional error?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1182.269,1184.785,--If the trial is unfair it is certainly a constitutional error.
1984.84-48,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1195.91,1201.997,What case is it that requires the government to turn over statements that are merely impeaching as opposed to exculpatory?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1201.997,1207.134,The Court has never squarely held that the government has to turn over such material.
1984.84-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.502,1221.458,You want us to decide that they really do have an obligation under Brady to turn it over?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1221.458,1224.929,"--We, as I said, don't dispute that in some circumstances--"
1984.84-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.929,1229.98,"If we judge the case on that basis, then, then we are assuming a constitutional error."
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1229.98,1233.432,"--I don't follow that, Justice White."
1984.84-48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1252.913,1254.781,But then what?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1269.557,1275.028,"I don't see why this... the assumption is not that there was constitutional error, Justice White."
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1343.439,1348.826,"May I ask you a factual question, Mr. Strauss, on this question of whether it was a general request or a specific request?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1365.219,1367.569,"--I think they are, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1367.569,1371.623,And so wouldn't this have also been responsive to that paragraph?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1371.623,1378.943,"If it was responsive to Paragraph 6, which is the one we are disputing, then I think it would be responsive to that as well."
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1381.329,1387.215,"The reason I raised it, it seems to me this may be relevant to the specificity of the request, whether it is covered by more than one paragraph."
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1387.215,1390.934,--The respondent has never relied on Paragraph Eleven as a basis for this.
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1390.934,1392.536,"I realize that, but I don't know why."
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1392.536,1403.677,"Well, I think probably, Justice Stevens, because it was understood that this had to do with collateral proceedings attacking the search warrant, and not with the trial in chief, but that is speculation."
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1403.677,1404.26,I see.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1404.26,1413.199,"As I said, the Agurs standard applies in cases where there has been a general request, and this really follows from Justice Stevens's last question."
1984.84-48,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1489.283,1498.472,"Well, suppose he had had a request for the names of any proposed witnesses who would be paid for their testimony."
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1501.091,1503.374,Who would be paid for their testimony?
1984.84-48,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1504.959,1507.744,"Really, that is what they wanted here, wasn't it?"
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1507.744,1508.894,"No, Justice Marshall."
1984.84-48,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1511.279,1515.748,It is just that they testified and they were paid.
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1515.748,1523.52,"They performed undercover operations over a period of several months, and then were compensated for that."
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.372,1526.622,May I ask just one other factual question?
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1541.049,1541.866,0 [Generallaughter.]
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1541.866,1547.886,Would this not be a standard thing that a prosecutor would inquire about if there are that many of them floating around?
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1547.886,1550.321,"I don't know, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-48,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.308,1559.26,"Well, I don't know how many people you have at $300 apiece providing information."
1984.84-48,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1560.379,1561.112,Contracts.
1984.84-48,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1562.112,1569.968,Mr. Hillier.
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1569.968,1571.034,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1639.11,1640.293,Were you trial counsel?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1640.293,1641.795,"I was not, Your Honor."
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1641.795,1644.414,Were you counsel in the habeas?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1644.414,1648.216,"An assistant federal public defender in my office was, Your Honor."
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.216,1648.599,I see.
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1648.599,1653.436,"I have represented Mr. Bagley on prior occasions, but I was not counsel in this case."
1984.84-48,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1913.889,1926.197,"Mr. Hillier, it seems to me another fact you have got to contend with since you are stressing the facts is that we are not here just judging the conduct of some particular government witness."
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1948.128,1965.34,"Well, Judge Vorhees, when this case... if this case is returned to Judge Vorhees, will probably preside over a jury trial, I would expect, Your Honor, so I don't think, and your cases suggest, Clancy, Goldberg, and the like, that we can't speculate as to what is going to happen again."
1984.84-48,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1967.757,1977.998,"No, but we can speculate as to whether this error that you see would have had any effect on Judge Vorhees' deliberation in this case, and I would think he is a pretty good witness for that."
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,1977.998,1991.741,"Well, Judge Vorhees made a determination based upon what the Court of Appeals suggested was an improper constitutional analysis, and also his factual basis was undermined."
1984.84-48,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1991.741,1997.543,"But he does say, this wouldn't have made any difference to me in trying the case."
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2012.286,2016.773,"Justice Rehnquist, you are correct, that is what he said, but why did he say that?"
1984.84-48,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2018.392,2019.875,Does it make any difference why he said it?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2019.875,2030.799,"--Well, I believe it does, because it goes to the factual underpinnings for his decision, the facts which you must analyze now when you are independently reviewing the constitutional basis for his decision."
1984.84-48,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2062.302,2068.389,Was there other evidence other than the testimony of these two witnesses that would have established--
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2068.389,2071.341,--The government... excuse me.
1984.84-48,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2071.341,2072.309,--the defendant's guilt on the drug counts?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2072.309,2073.293,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1984.84-48,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2087.703,2096.475,"I mean, there were no statements or confessions or admissions by the defendants themselves that were in evidence relating to the drug counts?"
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2096.475,2105.665,"--As to the nine counts that were reduced down to simple possession, there was contradictory evidence to the agents in the record."
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2126.761,2128.611,Deliveries of what?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2128.611,2136.95,"Of controlled substances, prescribed, controlled substances, his own controlled, prescribed... prescribed, controlled substances."
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2136.95,2138.569,What was his testimony again?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2138.569,2154.928,"His testimony was that he did not make the deliveries as urged by the prosecution in the case, but he acknowledged that he had prescribed drugs himself that he had given to individuals in the past, including these two agents."
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2162.184,2166.069,Was that cumulative testimony or otherwise?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2166.069,2167.769,--The defendant's testimony?
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2167.769,2170.004,"No, the government's testimony."
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2171.123,2185.8,"Well, the government's testimony, of course, came first, and our argument here is that the defendant was denied the opportunity to prepare a defense which contemplated effectively cross examining these individuals in anticipation of discrediting them."
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2190.767,2198.457,Would his own admissions and his own testimony be sufficient to support Judge Vorhees' decision?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2198.457,2211.015,"Your Honor, I think that in order to answer that question, you have to presume that the error which occurred did not constitutionally impact the defendant's rights."
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2211.015,2213.95,"Well, no, that is going around in a circle."
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2229.643,2233.613,"I think the simple answer to that is, I am not entirely certain."
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2253.242,2255.36,"He testified voluntarily, didn't he?"
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2255.36,2262.431,"--Well, he did, but the strategy employed there was, there was a need to confront the credibility of these witnesses."
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2272.505,2287.848,"Are you suggesting that if they had... if the defense had been able to have this material so as to challenge the credibility of the two government witnesses, that then he might not have taken the stand and disclosed his guilt?"
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2287.848,2295.271,"That is entirely possible, Your Honor, and again, what your teachings have been, this Court's teachings are that we cannot speculate as to what might have happened."
1984.84-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2328.075,2330.61,Let me go back to Justice Rehnquist's question.
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2358.177,2359.394,"Well, I--"
1984.84-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2359.394,2360.879,On habeas?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2362.429,2362.998,--Yes--
1984.84-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2362.998,2364.648,Would that stand up?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2364.648,2366.7,--Perhaps I am misunderstanding your hypothetical.
1984.84-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2370.652,2371.652,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2371.652,2378.906,"And the court said, I appreciate the impeachment effort concerning these witnesses, I find their testimony compelling nonetheless."
1984.84-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2378.906,2379.674,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2379.674,2391.565,"I think that we would have a hard time arguing that that case ought to be reversed, because we would be arguing that the factual basis for the court's decision was improper, and of course the court--"
1984.84-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2391.565,2392.931,So you admit you could not reverse it?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2392.931,2395.35,"--Well, if there were a factual basis."
1984.84-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2403.706,2405.573,The exact same facts of this case.
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2410.527,2411.81,--Yes.
1984.84-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2411.81,2416.697,"And the judge said, despite these, I still find you guilty."
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2416.697,2426.537,"Then we would be arguing to the Court of Appeals that the court was in error in reaching the decision it did, and we would have a difficult time doing that, Your Honor."
1984.84-48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2576.268,2582.405,"Mr. Hillier, if we should agree with you, what about the holding that this required automatic reversal?"
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2582.405,2591.695,"Your Honor, as we indicated in our brief, that holding is effectively dicta, and I don't believe I am any happier with it than the Solicitor General is."
1984.84-48,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2642.128,2649.198,"Well, I know, but do we do it, or do we say they were wrong to require automatic reversal?"
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2650.048,2652.666,"That is not necessary, Your Honor."
1984.84-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2824.028,2826.247,"May I just ask one question, Mr. Hillier, there?"
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2839.823,2840.54,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-48,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2840.54,2846.144,"So there was some material that could have been used for cross examination purposes, even though they could not have made this particular--"
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2846.144,2852.381,There was the ability to cross examine the agents as to the factual basis for their conclusions.
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2858.368,2858.718,--Why not?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2858.718,2866.206,Because there was an affirmative representation by the government that they had had no promises for payment.
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2866.206,2877.328,"Yes, but if there hadn't been those representations, you normally would have asked them... the trial counsel would normally have asked if they had been paid or if any promises had been made to them."
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2877.662,2880.28,"Your Honor, you are shooting in the dark when you are doing that."
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2880.83,2885.501,"Well, so isn't a lot of cross examination shooting in the dark?"
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2885.501,2893.789,"--I suspect you are correct, Chief Justice, but in this case we have had a representation from the government that nothing had been made."
1984.84-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2908.366,2913.937,I can tell you what the answer would be if they had been paid and it was known they had been paid.
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2917.805,2919.341,"--Well, that's correct."
1984.84-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2919.341,2920.807,Isn't that the way it is done?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2920.807,2921.757,That is the way it is done.
1984.84-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2922.543,2928.279,"And if it is not done that way, the defendant automatically asks, are you paid?"
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2928.279,2929.512,"--Well, I think--"
1984.84-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2929.512,2930.129,Isn't that true?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2930.129,2941.004,"--in the federal court we rely upon the federal prosecutor, and when he said he wasn't paid, we accepted that response, to our detriment, and as indicated in Barbie, we don't even know if the U.S. attorney knew."
1984.84-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2941.004,2943.206,Is that the adversary process?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2943.206,2955.93,The adversary process does not require that an attorney ask every question if the question does not appear to be relevant or that a response will not be favorable to the accused.
1984.84-48,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2992.687,2996.757,"If the first one had been turned over, you wouldn't have gotten those affidavits."
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,2996.757,3020.539,"--Well, the affidavits would have had to have been produced under Jencks, because they were statements of the accused, or of the witnesses, so the possibilities for cross examination, as I have indicated, are tremendous, and they are even more tremendous because there was no actual amount set forth, so we are dealing with a person who is testifying and hopes to get the most amount he can possibly get."
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.539,3031.597,"Mr. Hillier, what do you think is the standard for judging the materiality of this failure to produce?"
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3034.549,3036.166,It is the Chapman standard.
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.166,3037.749,Why Chapman?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3037.749,3047.855,"Well, because we are dealing with... Agurs simply states that when you deal with constitutional error, then you analyze it on the basis of whether it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3052.509,3059.679,"Well, I know, but beyond a reasonable doubt, that is a harmless error standard, isn't it?"
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3059.679,3062.297,--It is a constitutional harmless error standard.
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3062.297,3073.772,"I mean, it says there is an error, but under Agurs there is no constitutional error at all unless the omitted evidence creates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist."
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3090.767,3092.836,The Agurs standard which you have just--
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3092.836,3093.619,Isn't that the Agurs standard?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3093.619,3102.441,"--That is the non-constitutional Agurs standard which applies in general or unspecific, or general or no request situations."
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.424,3107.012,Where do you get out of Agurs that there is a different standard for a specific request?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3107.012,3116.551,"--Agurs states where there has been a specific request, then these kinds of situations will seldom if ever be excusable, and if there is a possibility that it might--"
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3116.551,3123.788,All that means to me is that seldom if ever would there not be a reasonable doubt.
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3123.788,3134.913,"--Agurs went on to indicate that if it might have affected the jury's verdict, then it is reversible error under the strict disclosure standard."
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3136.864,3140.899,That is the same... is there any difference between that and just reasonable doubt?
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3140.899,3141.983,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3152.957,3161.08,"What do you think this standard, this reasonable doubt standard I just read to you is, a constitutional error standard?"
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3168.401,3178.524,"--Within the context... ours is a constitutional error, Your Honor, because there was a failure to provide specifically requested evidence."
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3178.524,3184.178,I am asking you now under the test in Agurs for a general request.
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3184.178,3184.495,Yes.
1984.84-48,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3232.759,3259.477,"Well, Mr. Hillier, even in Strickland, which involved a Sixth Amendment right to counsel, the standard applied was the Agurs standard of establishing a reasonable probability that but for the error, the result would have been different, and I wonder if that isn't the appropriate standard here if you are correct that there was an error."
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3259.477,3268.016,"No, Your Honor, it would not be, because Strickland was referring to the non-constitutional error aspect of the Agurs decision."
1984.84-48,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3276.955,3278.974,Strickland was a state case.
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3282.342,3294.834,"Your Honor, in order to get here, of course, we have to urge that there is constitutional error, but in reaching the determination of whether there was constitutional error, there are various standards which apply."
1984.84-48,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3317.349,3325.753,"It would still have to be a constitutional issue to reach any state case, or a federal case either."
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3325.753,3326.003,--Sure.
1984.84-48,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3327.003,3332.407,It sounds to me like you are putting the cart before the horse.
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3349.199,3349.784,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3349.784,3352.986,Let me see if I have your position clear.
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3373.399,3387.89,"Your Honor, under that hypothetical, we would have difficulty, but that is... that presumes that there was not the constitutional violation, the confrontation which existed--"
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3387.89,3388.659,It presumes nothing.
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3403.519,3408.471,"--Well, I guess--"
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3408.471,3409.489,In a legal sense.
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3411.774,3420.111,--I think that again the counsel always has a difficult time assailing the verdict of a trier of fact.
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3427.534,3429.25,That is not in my hypothetical.
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3429.25,3430.586,"--I understand that, Your Honor."
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3443.144,3447.531,"Now take the same hypothetical, but not a jury, a judge makes that finding."
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3451.983,3459.987,"Yes, Your Honor, in the absence of a constitutional error which affected that decision, then we would--"
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3459.987,3462.289,"Well, in my hypothetical there is no constitutional question."
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3462.289,3464.374,"--I understand that, and in response to your hypothetical--"
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3464.374,3464.957,A pure factual question.
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3464.957,3465.507,--Yes.
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3465.507,3466.659,Thank you.
1984.84-48,1,42824,thomas_w_hillier_ii,,3466.659,3467.243,Thank you.
1984.84-48,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3467.243,3468.676,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Strauss?"
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3468.676,3472.312,"One or two brief points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-48,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3493.893,3512.521,"So the evidence supporting the drug charges other than the testimony of the two witnesses at issue here consisted of testimony of the defendant himself by way of some admissions, and physical evidence obtained in a search of his residence?"
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3512.521,3512.854,--That is right.
1984.84-48,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3516.473,3521.793,"Weren't there two groups of drug charges, and weren't their testimony important on the ones he went to jail on?"
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3521.793,3525.679,I don't think it is clear which ones he went to jail on.
1984.84-48,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3638.418,3645.358,So the Agurs-Strickland test or standard is the appropriate one in your view?
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3645.358,3645.808,Yes.
1984.84-48,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3645.808,3652.095,"The brief was a little vague that the government filed, and I didn't understand what the government thought."
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3652.095,3661.383,We think there are some true specific request cases where you have a truly focused specific request where an argument can be made for a more exacting standard than Agurs.
1984.84-48,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3661.383,3679.429,Do you understand Agurs and Strickland to say that there is no constitutional violation at all unless what was done or not done would have created a reasonable doubt that otherwise would not have existed?
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3679.429,3680.095,That is right.
1984.84-48,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3680.095,3689.051,"And so if such a doubt exists, there is no occasion or reason to reach the harmless error."
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3689.051,3692.487,"That's right, because then you know the trial was unfair, and you have to have a new trial."
1984.84-48,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3692.487,3692.803,Exactly.
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3692.803,3694.053,"I think that is exactly right, Justice White."
1984.84-48,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3703.325,3720.286,"Well, now, tell me what... I thought I understood your brief to say that Agurs and the government would... well, you say Agurs did not establish a different standard for a specific request."
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3720.286,3721.453,That is right.
1984.84-48,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3722.738,3730.076,"Well, and I thought your brief said that the same standard should apply to specific requests."
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3730.076,3746.771,"We left open the possibility, as Justice O'Connor noted, that there may be some true specific request cases in which a standard more exacting than Agurs would be appropriate, although not a beyond a reasonable doubt standard, which we think should be reserved for truly egregious cases like the--"
1984.84-48,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3746.771,3753.758,"Well, what if it were perfectly true in this case that the government committed... they just perjured themselves in these affidavits?"
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3760.095,3762.547,--I think it is clear they did not perjure themselves.
1984.84-48,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3762.547,3763.982,"Yes, but what if it was clear that they did?"
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3763.982,3767.184,"If they perjured themselves in the trial, then Giglio and Napue--"
1984.84-48,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3767.184,3768.367,"No, no, in these affidavits."
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3768.367,3774.421,--I think that would probably not even be a Brady question.
1984.84-48,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3787.662,3790.614,Would you approach it from the standpoint of a fair trial issue?
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3790.614,3790.864,Yes.
1984.84-48,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3791.814,3792.514,"You would, still would?"
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3792.514,3793.247,Yes.
1984.84-48,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3793.247,3800.636,Not just some supervisory way of censoring the prosecutor?
1984.84-48,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3800.636,3804.188,It might be appropriate to censor the prosecutor as well.
1984.84-48,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3812.826,3813.426,"Thank you, gentlemen."
