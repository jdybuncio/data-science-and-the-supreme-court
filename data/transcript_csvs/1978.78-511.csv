1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.932,"We'll hear arguments next in 78-511, Lo-Ji Sales, Inc. against New York."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,78.056,82.019,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,156.725,169.409,"Well, if you say that the presence of the magistrate on the premises didn't even nil, it didn't cure the problems to which you've alluded but actually intensified them."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,173.894,175.914,"Well, the state went about handling it --"
1978.78-511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,175.914,178.714,How would it I said in the constitutional means?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,178.714,198.72,"Well, it would seem to me that the entry onto the premises assuming no further rights than any customer might have the purchase or the observation of material which would not involve the authorization of an invalid warrant to search and to seize and without the massive seizure that took place here."
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,219.144,245.357,"Are you suggesting that the proper procedure was for the officer, for an officer not a judge but an officer to go on the premises of the store and buy selective pieces of material, books and films than take them back, show them to the magistrate or the judge as the basis for getting a warrant at a later point?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,245.357,251.967,"As I read your decision in Heller, Your Honor, it seems to me that that might have been appropriate but there are a number of other ways in which a prosecution ---"
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,251.967,257.616,"No, that is if you concede that's an appropriate way under Heller and other cases."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,257.616,258.757,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,281.989,294.637,I'd understood that the magistrate's premise -- that the magistrate's presence here was in order to assure that before seizure some neutral and detached magistrate would have examined the material.
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,297.107,303.282,"Well, Your Honor, there are a couple of things wrong with the position which has been taken by the State of New York."
1978.78-511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,357.744,365.629,When the magistrate's presence was neither improves nor detracts from your case.
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,365.629,403.39,"I only say Your Honor, that if that may well be true, but the problem is that when somebody who appears to be a magistrate or judge and someone to whom in ordinary citizen might go for constitutional relief actually appears on the scene as an executing officer and to a warrant which he himself has issued you have problems of perhaps and even more serious kind when he goes beyond the role that the judge assumed in the Heller case by merely going on to the scene viewing the material and not exercising his prerogative as an authority to make such a search."
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,403.39,420.78,"Would you have any problem whether it was 11 or 22 or 33 officers entering the premises buying books, films, and then appear all together or one by one leaving the premises and taking them to a magistrate?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,420.78,424.36,"Your Honor, I think the facts would depend on each particular circumstance."
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,431.995,443.256,"Well, let me -- what's the impact, let's assume there's that a proprietor is somewhat intimidated, what's that got to do with what they buy and take to the magistrate?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,443.256,452.085,"Well, I think that if they make a purchase and if they act in -- with no greater act then a customer might, then that might be appropriate."
1978.78-511,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,474.55,483.932,"In this connection, it does not count to relate in part at list to the two films that one officer had purchased?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,483.932,485.255,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,485.255,487.688,"Well, does that stand up?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,487.688,494.595,"No, Your Honor, it seems to me that the entire search has got to be looked at under circumstances in which the entirety is considered."
1978.78-511,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,494.595,499.299,"Yes, the searched films -- those films were purchased before the search ever took place."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,499.299,503.548,"But Your Honor, there were other copies of the same film which were actually acquired during --"
1978.78-511,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,503.548,507.473,"I am speaking about the two that were taken, that were purchased by the officer."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,507.473,517.308,"Yes, Your Honor, and I'm suggesting that there were additional copies of those very same films seized in the raid which of which we complained."
1978.78-511,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,517.308,521.28,"Well, suppose we invalidate that seizure."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,524.77,543.854,I would urge not Mr. Justice because it seems to me that if you have a massive seizure then there is no deterrent or prophylactic effect at all if you merely invalidate that part of it which is -- which goes beyond the appropriateness.
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,572.621,583.05,"But Mr. Berkman suppose after this case is over, the same two policemen go in and buy two film, could he be prosecuted?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,583.05,584.59,"Two -- I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,584.59,587.376,Two policemen go in and buy two more films?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,587.376,588.556,Two more films.
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,588.556,590.154,Could he be prosecuted?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,590.154,599.057,"It would seem to me that if those films are then focused searchingly on by a detached and neutral magistrate, then perhaps that might go --"
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,599.057,604.889,"I said, they give to this any magistrate, I don't have to -- any magistrate."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,604.889,605.885,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,605.885,610.341,"Well, then why is the original seizure good?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,610.341,619.739,"Well, it seems to me Your Honor that there has to be an arrangement in which there is a focusing upon the material --"
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,619.739,621.15,"Well, I thought we had it here?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,621.15,621.695,In --
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,621.695,624.744,The two policemen brought in two films --
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,624.744,625.477,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,625.477,629.157,-- and said we want action to magistrate.
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,633.817,635.015,"Well, the --"
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,635.015,636.82,Or do I misquote you?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,636.82,638.0,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,642.506,644.454,"No, on the record of this case?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,644.454,646.32,Yes.
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,646.32,648.603,Does that count stand?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,648.603,650.081,"It seems to me that it cannot, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,650.402,651.27,Because of the?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,651.27,652.336,Because it is a --
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,652.336,653.568,What happen after that?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,653.568,655.305,It is all partial of the --
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,655.305,659.536,"Yes, but now if it's done afterwards, it's alright?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,659.536,660.765,It may be if assuming --
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,660.765,665.297,"Well, I want another difference between pro and after."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,665.297,671.525,"Well, when you have a mass seizure such as took place here, my understanding of the teaching of the cases here --"
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,671.525,673.988,That cleans the whole slate?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,673.988,674.79,It seems to me that --
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,674.79,677.248,Does that clean the whole prior slate?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,677.248,679.899,"It seems -- yes, sir, I think it does."
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,680.113,681.644,"Well, why didn't it clean the future slate?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,682.374,686.405,"Well, I think that this case has to stand on its own, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,686.405,688.681,"But under my brother Marshall's question, --"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,688.681,689.58,Yes.
1978.78-511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,689.58,695.507,"-- had there just been a purchase of two items, it wouldn't have needed to be a magistrate at all."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,707.682,709.841,"That's quite right, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,709.841,730.787,"And I don't really -- what was the purpose do you suppose of this warrant which was signed on the morning of June 25, 1976 even providing for the seizure of items 1 and 2 since those two items are already been purchased and we're in the possession of prosecuting authorities?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,730.787,731.615,"Your Honor, quite right."
1978.78-511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,735.883,737.666,"Which were already in their possession, wasn't it?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,737.666,738.104,Pardon?
1978.78-511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,738.104,739.756,It was already in the possession of the prosecuting authority.
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,739.756,755.529,"Of course it was and it seems to me that the only purpose that there could have been for seizing multiple copies of that film and for seizing other things in the store was to actually close the operation, prevent the exhibition and to block distribution of materials without a prior adjudication."
1978.78-511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,755.529,755.63,And it doesn't ----
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,755.63,759.039,"In our judgment, it seems to us that the record demonstrates."
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,759.039,760.653,"That's not this case, isn't it?"
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,760.653,761.234,"Yes, it is."
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,761.234,763.884,"He was convicted, was he?"
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,763.884,765.263,"No, he pleaded guilty."
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,765.263,767.342,"Yes, Your Honor, he was convicted but that is this case."
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,771.702,780.848,I think the example can see that you have made a very good argument for action for damages.
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,784.887,785.673,"Well, Your Honor, it seems --"
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,785.673,787.209,"Now, straighten me up."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,787.209,794.375,"Well, it seems to me first of all that in this case, there was a search and seizure which followed the purchase of two films."
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,858.904,862.109,"Now, how did the conviction come about?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,863.254,872.17,The conviction occurred after the motion to suppress was denied and the parties pleaded guilty.
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,880.484,906.598,"Now, then going back to the suggestion or questions of several other of my colleagues, suppose we agreed with you as to Count I and III and disagreed with you as to Count II which, if I had the numbers correctly as the one, Count II rests on two films which is standing alone, you don't question."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,906.598,908.156,"Your Honor, Count II --"
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,908.156,909.112,Is that so?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,909.112,913.276,-- Count II rests on those two films plus hundreds of others.
1978.78-511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.276,913.932,400.
1978.78-511,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,913.932,914.337,472.
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,914.337,914.384,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,914.384,914.974,472.
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,914.974,927.27,"And so consequently, we are saying that those are among them but it may well be that those that were taken were the ones upon which the conviction was based and so it seems to me that they are inseverable."
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,927.27,945.845,"Well, wait a minute now if we -- if they tried this case, there'd be more of a problem but if they're going to a jury verdict based on all the films, the two plus all the hundreds of others, there's a guilty plea with respect to the two plus others under Count II, is there not?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,945.845,946.837,Yes.
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,947.196,958.317,"And how -- then how can you, how do you justify challenging the two that they were properly in the possession of the police?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,958.317,966.348,Because the count itself for reasons which I do not know and which were based upon determinations of the law enforcement authorities of New York.
1978.78-511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.23,977.465,Where is the count you're talking about?
1978.78-511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,977.465,978.493,2 (a) and 3 (a).
1978.78-511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,978.493,979.736,So is it 3 (a)?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,985.583,990.346,"Well, they were identified in the seizure materials."
1978.78-511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,990.346,994.561,"Well,doesn't the guilty plea waive any defect in the information or indictment?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,994.561,997.631,"Well, we're not claiming that there's a defect in the information or indictment."
1978.78-511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1014.363,1017.89,"But you can see that two items were not, I take it."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1017.89,1029.433,"The two -- two of the hundreds of items in Count II had been acquired by a purchase of the police officers and had been viewed in advance by the magistrate prior to the seizure involved here, yes."
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1029.433,1033.943,And he pleaded guilty with respect to those two along with others?
1978.78-511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1033.943,1034.94,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1046.054,1063.368,"And in addition to the two individual items that have been purchased, I suppose under the purported authority of the search warrant, several duplicate copies were seized under paragraph 1, 2 of the search warrant, with the --"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1063.368,1063.675,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1063.675,1064.54,-- with the same items?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1064.54,1065.224,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1065.224,1073.147,The search warrant does by using the plural reels in both cases authorize the seizure of duplicate copies.
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1073.147,1073.454,Right.
1978.78-511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1079.467,1088.005,Where -- where do you find that the two copies that were purchased are included in Count II?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1088.005,1096.534,"Well, the films were appeared in Count II and the books appeared in --"
1978.78-511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1096.534,1106.518,"I know but tell me how do you know that among the 474 movie reels mentioned in Count II, how do you know that --"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1106.518,1106.769,I cannot.
1978.78-511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1106.769,1108.521,-- the two that were bought were --
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1108.521,1109.965,"I cannot tell that, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1109.965,1112.06,Suppose they weren't?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1112.06,1112.819,"Well, then --"
1978.78-511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.819,1114.001,Then you have no problem?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1114.001,1114.944,None at all.
1978.78-511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.944,1116.215,"Well, how do you know they are even in there?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1116.215,1116.852,I don't know that.
1978.78-511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1116.852,1120.866,I thought you could do that by process of going over the inventory?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1120.866,1123.985,"Only by going over the inventory but it is true, Your Honor that in so far as --"
1978.78-511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1123.985,1126.177,But how would you know which is which?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1126.177,1127.213,You can't tell it.
1978.78-511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1131.575,1136.133,And if the officer bought them and they were his.
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1145.182,1145.78,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1152.591,1152.919,Right.
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1152.919,1160.998,And we've said before that that's the one appropriate way to go about it to seize a sample of the particular item.
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1167.098,1167.994,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1167.994,1169.313,It is not?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1169.313,1190.076,I don't think that is clear because what happen is a result of this was that the entire inventory of the store was ransacked on the basis of what we can't contend to have been an excuse employed in order to make it appear as though there was a search under a warrant.
1978.78-511,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1198.216,1202.979,"Well, unless you want to charge him of the crime of possession because if you have him, he no longer possesses them."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1202.979,1203.269,Yes.
1978.78-511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1220.303,1244.605,"Well, there's nothing wrong with him, nothing wrong with him going back and buying either 10 more books and I suppose that if the search warrant procedures were valid there'll be nothing wrong will properly carried out, there would be nothing wrong with seizing him under a search warrant if the post procedures were proper."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1244.605,1245.394,I think that's right.
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1297.743,1305.066,"Suppose this had been done by one officer? Well, without the 10 --"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1305.066,1307.582,It seems to me that depends upon what it did.
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1307.939,1312.52,Suppose one officer did everything that the 11 officers did?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1312.52,1315.447,"It would seem to me then that it would still not be sufficient, Your Honor for the reason --"
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1315.447,1319.338,Because the 11 is -- 11 or 1 is not really crucial to the case?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1319.338,1331.03,"No, I think that the massive number only has to do with the -- with part of the facts involving the pervasive seizure and control and domination of the entire enterprise."
1978.78-511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1429.427,1467.633,"Well, do you think that if a magistrate accompanies an investigator to a store and he examines books on the shelves and looks at them as much as he wants and then goes back to the office and issues of search warrant to seize one copy of each of the following titles as evidence and he says I have searchingly focused on the issue of obscenity and think there's probable cause to believe they're obscene."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1467.633,1474.121,So long as he does not use his judicial authority to effectuate the search during the time that he's examining the material.
1978.78-511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1501.357,1512.105,"Yes, but if he comes to the store and if he does nothing in the store that any other member of the public could not do."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1517.42,1522.122,And he has not use the force of judicial office and he has not effectuated the search.
1978.78-511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1522.122,1526.779,"Your client told he didn't have to put a quarter in the movie reels, didn't he?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1526.779,1533.196,"Well, as a matter of fact, that is what the record does reflect Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.78-511,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1585.674,1592.435,But that wouldn't be -- that wouldn't reach taking the cellophane or the plastic wrappers of it?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1592.435,1609.711,"There was never any purported consent of any kind to that, they just came in and took the merchandise off the shelves, piled it on the floor, tore of the coverage because there was a cellophane seal on them which prevents anyone from opening the package and looking inside."
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1622.932,1661.401,"Mr. Berkman, for the constitutional purposes of this case and laying aside for the moment this special consideration given to books as we've indicated in our opinions, is this case any different from what it would be if a warrant had been issued for to pick up two sample cans of spinach on the ground they have information or reason to believe that they might be contaminated and the two cans of spinach were seized and then all the things that happened here with reference to the other merchandise occurred."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1670.326,1673.168,"Well, it would seem to me it's fundamentally different because of the First Amendment --"
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1673.168,1675.941,"Well, I said except for that, they never signed."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1675.941,1683.907,"And also, it is unclear when a criminal prosecution occurs as to whether or not the cans of spinach are even involved."
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1700.137,1704.606,"But the Food and Drug Administration does make seizures at times, do they not?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1704.606,1705.485,I understand that.
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1706.312,1716.507,But I take it from your point of view they can't seize all the spinach in the store until they determine on the basis of sampling that some of it is contaminated.
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1716.507,1725.211,"Well, except for the considerations are probable cause in particularity, Your Honor, which are requirements with respect to all Fourth Amendment seizures."
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1731.472,1734.582,"But so far the Fourth Amendment concerned, there is no difference, is it?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1734.582,1741.183,"So long as the particularity and specificity and probable cause requirements have been met, it would seem to me."
1978.78-511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1749.382,1756.586,One of the reasons -- isn't the principle is that they have cellophane wrappers or the books to prevent freeloaders from reading them and without buying them.
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1756.586,1760.966,"Well, there's nothing in the record on that subject but I would suppose that that might be affected."
1978.78-511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1760.966,1767.87,"Well, are you saying then that a police officer has to buy the book before he can inspect it?"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1767.87,1780.554,I think that either he has to acquire in some lawful way or it may well be that a customer or somebody else has acquired certain material.
1978.78-511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1780.554,1787.7,But you say a police officer can inspect the book -- cannot inspect the book on the premises by tearing the cellophane coverall.
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1787.7,1804.202,"It seems to me that he's limited to performing in the way that a customer will be permitted to conform if he exceeds that then he's acting as a policeman and not as a customer and exceeds any such responsibility, and I think that becomes a seizure."
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1805.683,1808.732,The mere tearing of the wrapper becomes a seizure?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1808.732,1820.613,"Yes, I think that as this Court has indicated in Terry and recently in Delaware against Prouse, very little is required in order to effectuate a seizure either of a person or --"
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1820.613,1825.054,"In fact, it could be like breaking the can of spinach open with a can opener and --"
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1825.054,1831.461,"A can of spinach could be, Your Honor or opening the trunk of Mr. Chadwick in the Chadwick case."
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1834.452,1840.408,The real difference between a customer and a policeman is the customized money.
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1840.408,1841.386,"Well, --"
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1841.386,1842.952,Isn't the real difference?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1842.952,1843.537,"Well, I apparently --"
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1843.537,1847.34,The customer buys something and pays for it?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1847.34,1847.977,"That's right, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1852.405,1855.584,(Voice Overlap) you said it is law but it is not but it is warning.
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1858.705,1862.287,"Well, except for the two books that they originally purchased."
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1862.287,1864.876,"No, I mean when the others went in with the magistrate."
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1864.876,1866.146,"That's right, they didn't know --"
1978.78-511,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1866.146,1869.196,Nobody then -- isn't that the real difference?
1978.78-511,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1869.196,1878.863,"Well, I think that the difference is because of legal acquisition and acquisition by something other than the authority of the state which makes the constitutional difference."
1978.78-511,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1898.788,1902.758,"Very well, Mr. Berkman."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,1905.92,1908.659,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1996.819,1997.918,Where do you see that?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,1997.918,1997.992,No.
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1997.992,1999.48,Where do you see that charge in the appendix?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,1999.48,2003.277,"No, that's a footnote I believe in my brief."
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2005.326,2005.961,I see.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2005.961,2008.272,"He subsequently pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, was given a conditional --"
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2008.272,2008.347,I see.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2008.347,2009.062,-- that was given a conditional --
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2009.062,2011.136,For possessing those two items on the day they were purchased?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2011.136,2014.1,"Well, promoting those two items on the day they were purchased."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.518,2017.754,"So, they aren't included in these 400 and some films?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2017.754,2020.139,They are -- the same films are included but those two items are --
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2020.139,2021.443,How do you know they are?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2021.443,2023.312,From the inventory.
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2035.985,2047.318,And you certainly wouldn't list these two items that have been bought on the search warrant or an inventory of things that have been seized in the search warrant cause they weren't seize in the search warrants before.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2047.318,2049.303,"No, but other copies of the -- that were --"
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.303,2052.452,I know but I'm talking about these two copies.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2052.452,2052.949,"No, right."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.909,2055.623,Is that so -- so that those are out?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2055.623,2056.784,Yes.
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.784,2058.094,That's all I wanted to know.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2058.094,2059.554,"Yes, I want to clarify that."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.554,2067.844,So the only ones -- so the only ones on which this conviction rest are the ones that receives in the search and seizure under the warrant.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2067.844,2076.616,"Yes, and if you look at the criminal charges, the basis of these charges are promoting the items on June 20th the date of these seizure."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.616,2095.01,"Now say, let's assume that when these two films were bought and they were brought back to the judge, suppose the judge had look at and them and said I have now focused on the nature of these articles."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2113.269,2115.544,I don't believe any case in this case Court would warrant that alone.
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.544,2118.94,"As a matter of fact, the client -- the cases that would say that would be forbidden?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2118.94,2130.02,"Yes, but I think there's an important distinction in this case and that was that when we went in to this bookstore and before there was any seizure, we entered the store was open to the public."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.02,2130.444,Yes.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2130.444,2140.613,"When we went in there, the clerk was given the warrant and was told that he had the right to an immediate adversary hearing as soon as he would be ready or the owner of those materials --"
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.613,2149.302,"Well, I know but before the hearing -- whenever the hearing was either that it was tomorrow or this afternoon, you took all copies out of circulation?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2149.302,2150.706,"Temporarily, we did, yes."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2150.706,2153.834,"Well, tell me some case that warrants that --"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2153.834,2155.74,"I believe under Kingsley Books, we can do that."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.24,2168.613,I thought there had to be an adversary hearing before you completely remove from circulation all copies of materials like this.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2168.613,2176.211,"Well, I don't believe, I believe Kingsley Books are the Court held that you could temporarily take those items and then hold an adversary hearing afterwards."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.211,2180.159,"Now, the Kingsley Books was interim in injunction, it wasn't seizure?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2180.159,2180.571,"Well, the --"
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.571,2183.651,Because what we're talking about is Marcus and Quantity of Books.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2183.651,2186.698,I believe this is different from Marcus and Quantity of Books.
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.698,2189.045,Different from what my brother White has just been suggesting?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2189.045,2189.595,Yes.
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.595,2190.384,How is it different?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2190.384,2202.162,"It's different because the items were taken as evidence, a judge had viewed the items and made a probable course determination plus it's different because after they were taken --"
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.162,2208.78,"No, but Marcus and Quantity of Books said you can't seize the whole group without having the adversary proceeding first."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2208.78,2212.904,"Well, I believe they said you cannot seize them for destruction purposes."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.348,2238.498,"Well, after you -- after you denied this motion to suppress you took advantage of your New York statute which spend them do that."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2238.498,2243.683,"That's right but under our New York statute, he could have a trial on the issue of obscenity and if he --"
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2243.683,2247.435,I know but New York statute permitted them to do just exactly what he did.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2247.435,2253.723,That's right but it certainly did in anyway inhibit from also having a trial as if he thought the items were not obscene.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2268.987,2276.298,"Well, the judicial officer at the -- spent six hours in there, was he still a judicial officer?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2276.298,2276.716,I believe he was --
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2276.716,2278.738,Or was he a bias person?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2278.738,2279.217,I think that --
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2279.217,2286.084,"That to be in there looking at the material for six hours, wouldn't he be influenced one way of the other?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2286.084,2287.462,"Oh, I believe the material may influence --"
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2287.462,2289.225,Wouldn't he be influenced one or another?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2289.225,2292.748,I think that material may influence but I don't think it changed his being bias.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2308.743,2311.235,If you had a hearing who decide over the hearing?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2311.235,2315.919,"There would have -- well at the hearing, there would have been a different judicial officer presiding this."
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2315.919,2319.669,"Oh, he authorized it after the fact, that's the problem."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2319.669,2320.992,"After -- well, I don't believe him."
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2320.992,2326.25,"They would break the cellophane and bring the book to him and he'd say okay, I had that today, yes, that's okay."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2328.065,2330.771,"No, I disagree that they had already seized anything."
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2335.715,2340.587,"Well, wasn't it, wasn't it testimony that he wasn't free to leave, he was under arrest?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2340.587,2344.685,The testimony was that he was told that there was award for his arrest.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2349.792,2353.488,"Well, what do you mean when you say you moved freely throughout the store?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2355.753,2358.364,"Yes, he would not have been free to move outside."
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2358.939,2361.932,"So there was a seizure when they walked in there, wasn't it?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2361.932,2364.773,There was a seizure of his person but not a seizure of the material.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2364.773,2367.192,"Well, what do you need 11 for?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2367.192,2367.588,"Well, the reason --"
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2367.588,2369.562,Was he a rough man or something?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2369.562,2373.63,"No, I think the reason that you had all these people here was to try to do the search."
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2373.63,2374.72,These weren't people.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2379.314,2381.773,"Oh, I have considered policeman a person, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2381.773,2385.643,They are different from the average person.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2388.152,2389.445,"Yes, they do."
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2389.445,2391.334,That's different from -- do you have a gun?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2391.334,2391.79,"No, sir."
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2391.79,2394.948,"Well, that's different, isn't it?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2401.806,2406.922,I think the reason you have the number of these people is so you can expedite the procedure as quickly as possible.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2422.863,2427.736,Well the things that they put together for the judge were they seized?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2427.736,2428.835,"No, they weren't, I don't believe."
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2428.835,2431.081,"What were they, detained?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2431.081,2435.403,"He makes -- well, they were in the store, they were left in the store, they were in a pile and they would --"
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2435.403,2438.364,They put it -- could the owner take them away from it?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2438.364,2439.958,I suppose he could of if he wanted to but --
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2439.958,2441.208,It would be big enough?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2441.208,2441.865,What?
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2441.865,2443.043,It was big enough?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2443.043,2444.861,I don't think they would afford them.
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2448.811,2456.953,But my problem is that a warrant by definition is a prior authorization.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2485.372,2486.574,"Well, I think if you look at it --"
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.574,2490.633,That's the problem because a warrant by definition is a prior authorization.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2490.633,2503.055,The State of New York has upheld this which is in effect an oral warrant and they have upheld under this circumstances where you're dealing with books and films and magazines where you have to have a judge go in and look at it prior.
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2504.802,2507.986,That's the reason this case is here because the New York courts upheld it?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2507.986,2508.603,"Yes, but they have --"
1978.78-511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2508.603,2516.006,"Mr. Parker, you -- when you're making a search incident to arrest and you find a gun on a man, you don't have to pay the man the price of the gun, don't you?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2516.006,2517.872,"No, you don't, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2524.457,2525.539,Is prior authorization.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2525.539,2532.747,If one foot have prior authorization of probable cause and to the limit the police discretion by particularly describing what they should take.
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2532.747,2533.29,Correct.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2533.29,2536.417,"This judge, looked at the material --"
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2536.417,2537.854,After it had been seized?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2537.854,2539.773,"Well, I submit it wasn't after it had been seized."
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2539.773,2540.569,"Well, --"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2540.569,2544.946,"Because I see -- in other words, I submit that there was no seizure of material that was left in the store."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2549.418,2552.886,"Now, how about looking in -- how about taking the cellophane off of the package?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2555.665,2556.678,In a way it's a search but --
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2556.678,2563.514,"But in a way, you certainly just can't pat it down like you can if you -- and tell if it's obscene."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2563.514,2565.227,"That's -- well, but you see these magazines --"
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.227,2572.543,"You know, sometimes you can pat people down and discover and see if the -- but you can't search them."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2576.306,2584.665,"Yes, but they were taking a cellophane off the books which had obscene photographs at the front of the books which is almost identical to seeing a bold outside someone in patting him down that."
1978.78-511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2592.442,2612.712,"We'll resume there at 1 o'clock, Mr. Parker."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2616.388,2619.396,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.69,2639.11,"That's an understatement seizing more than one, isn't it?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2641.056,2642.423,"No, we did not seize everything."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2643.417,2649.118,I know but did you seize all the copies in any magazine?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2649.118,2651.198,"Yes, any -- yes, anytime that --"
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2651.198,2653.942,So that was rather an understatement?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2653.942,2658.829,Anytime the judge after viewing the item felt that there was probable cause to believe --
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.829,2660.405,Do you seize all of the item?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2660.405,2668.998,He seize every copy in that store but there was never any claim made that this person did not have access to other items or could not bring him in the next day.
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.998,2671.306,But he could not sell those particular items?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2671.306,2672.625,He could not sell those items.
1978.78-511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2673.539,2678.785,Didn't that have some resemblance to prior restraint?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2678.785,2679.863,"Oh, obviously --"
1978.78-511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2679.863,2684.285,They took all the books of a particular category.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2685.502,2686.489,He could not sell them.
1978.78-511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2690.465,2692.9,But I'm talking about restraint on him.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2692.9,2695.279,"Yes, is it -- yes, there was but that --"
1978.78-511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2695.279,2695.474,Do you know?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2695.474,2707.512,"-- res -- right, but that restraint I submit was a temporary restraint because he had the right to a full hearing and also that restraint was for valid evidentiary purpose to show that he was promoting the item."
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2727.171,2733.842,"If you didn't have to seize them all to show that, they're actually been testimony."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2733.842,2739.522,"Well, obviously there could be testimony but the best evidence would be shown in the jury the fact that you have this many items."
1978.78-511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2739.522,2745.272,"Or if you want to be a little more sure, maybe it takes six plus, one plus six?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2745.272,2751.235,"Well, if you, as you can see for more brief, very few, I think only two or three case and they seized more than six."
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2787.732,2789.715,Could that be that there were no duplicate?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2789.715,2791.127,What?
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2791.127,2793.658,Could it be that there weren't any duplicates?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2793.658,2794.491,There weren't duplicates.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2795.83,2796.886,That's right.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2796.886,2797.035,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2797.035,2800.11,"So they didn't more able to seize, it wouldn't matter?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2800.11,2802.739,Probably.
1978.78-511,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2802.739,2804.082,And the projectors were seized?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2804.082,2805.336,"Yes, the projectors were seized."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.88,2871.128,What was the -- there was a plea of guilty?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2871.128,2871.606,Yes.
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2871.606,2873.258,What -- there never was a sentence.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2873.258,2876.73,"Yes, the sentence was a fine of $1,000.00 on each count."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2876.73,2877.833,On each separate case?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2877.833,2877.919,Yes.
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2877.919,2878.43,Separate count?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2878.43,2884.782,"Each separate count had a fine of $1,000.00 and that fine has been paid."
1978.78-511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2884.782,2886.12,And how many counts were there?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2886.12,2886.79,Three.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2887.607,2889.517,"So now you have $22,000.00?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2889.517,2890.752,What?
1978.78-511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2902.683,2903.433,Protects them?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2903.433,2903.853,Yes.
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2923.536,2925.259,After he rips it open?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2925.259,2927.266,"After -- yes, after it's been ripped open."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2938.218,2939.28,Eleven police officers?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2939.28,2943.936,"No, initially one police officer goes in, he brought a small sample --"
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2943.936,2946.248,He needed the support of 10 others?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2946.248,2948.618,"Well, to make the search."
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2969.941,2971.54,"But it took him six hours, didn't it?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2971.54,2972.858,It did take him six hours cause he had a --
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2972.858,2976.508,"Well, I guess if it was only one, it would be a couple of days, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2976.508,2981.418,"I believe it would take much longer, I can't tell you how long it would take."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2981.467,2990.471,"Off -- no, I get a new member of the public would have the privilege of going in and looking at all these movies and these machines."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2990.471,2992.915,"Certainly, they have the privilege of going and looking at the movies and the machine."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2992.915,2994.329,That's for a quarter?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,2994.329,2996.397,Yes.
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.498,3013.831,"So, you say that wasn't the search?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3013.831,3014.916,I'm saying that the viewing --
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3014.916,3017.926,That wasn't the search because any member of the public could have done it with the court.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3017.926,3028.998,"What I'm saying is that the viewing of the material which is openly displayed to the public, there is no reasonable expectation of this petitioner that the public will not see this material."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3030.424,3036.008,All there is on -- there is in the cellophane package with it unless the public buys it and pays the money?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3036.008,3036.319,Yes.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3062.059,3065.538,What happened to business records?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3065.538,3067.652,The business records were seized to show --
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3067.652,3067.976,But why they didn't
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3067.976,3068.086,-- to promotion --
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3068.086,3071.161,"I mean they were not in the public area, were they?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3071.161,3072.904,"They were behind the front desk, I believe."
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3072.904,3075.625,"Yes, I mean you said everything was out in the public area but --"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3075.625,3082.03,Everything that he was charged with possessing under this statute under this information was limited to public areas.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3082.03,3085.227,And -- but they did go into the private area?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3085.227,3086.898,"They went behind the counter, yes."
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3086.898,3088.975,But what right did they have behind the camera?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3088.975,3091.431,Cause that's where the clerk of the store had stationed himself.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3091.431,3097.858,Do I understand that the man you said the only thing they did and the only place they went was to ride a public land?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3097.858,3098.534,Yes.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3098.534,3102.187,"Now, you admit they did go to some place that the public didn't go."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3102.187,3102.986,The clerk was there --
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3102.986,3104.329,Is that right?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3104.329,3104.947,The clerk --
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3104.947,3106.013,Is that right?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3106.013,3107.506,They went behind to arrest the clerk.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3107.506,3109.183,And the public didn't go behind?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3109.183,3111.491,"No, I don't believe the public would go behind it."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3174.969,3176.798,"Now, let me get it clear."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3184.161,3185.026,Not all are different.
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3188.711,3195.095,"Well, anyone that he looked at that he thought was obscene he seized all copies of that film?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3195.095,3195.914,Yes.
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3195.914,3197.181,Okay counsel.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3197.181,3199.099,"Yes, he did."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3241.862,3260.574,"Are you -- are there any cases, I think there is a case that involves projector -- seizing projectors but do you know of any case that involves seizure of all projectors so that the person in the business of showing movies has to order a new projector in order to show anything?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3260.574,3261.003,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3262.454,3266.174,Because even -- I take it you left him some films didn't you?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3266.174,3267.952,I don't believe he was left any films.
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3273.28,3280.495,"So, but if he wanted to show some films that weren't obscene, he wouldn't still wouldn't have any projector, would he?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3280.495,3284.462,"He would not have, no."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3295.737,3298.325,He point down the moving picture part of the store for sure.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3298.325,3318.368,"We did do it temporarily but what -- the point was from the beginning, we try to do this in such a way that we could effectively carry out the legislative mandate to protect more of decency but we did it in such a way that this individual was first of all he was given written notification of his right to an immediate hearing before any seizure at all."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.017,3328.0,What did you have after you seized 400 films that you wouldn't have had if you'd only seize 10?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3328.0,3329.682,"Well, what you would it -- the diff --"
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3329.682,3336.249,So you'd seize 10 and one projector and then he went to trial on that. What would you have had --
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3336.249,3344.832,You would not have a judicial ruling on whether or not the other 390 or whether it is the other 208 different films whether or not those were obscene.
1978.78-511,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3346.746,3352.295,You ran the risk of those particular 10 would be found to be not obscene I suppose.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3352.295,3359.437,If they're found not obscene then we leave him and he can display them openly and promote them to the public if there's a ruling that they're not obscene.
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3396.808,3399.972,"On this thesis, you didn't need more than one copy of each --"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3399.972,3406.219,"Not, but you did need it because they are brought in for criminal purposes and the criminal law is not mere possession."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3412.075,3415.011,"Well, you can have evidence to how many they were."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3415.011,3415.318,That's true.
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3415.318,3418.521,"You don't always just believe witnesses there in Goshen, do you?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3418.521,3423.044,"No, they don't but the best evidence is always having the actual material there."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3511.972,3523.726,"Suppose you'd seize a copy of a book of which there were 100 copies in the store and you had a trial two days later, adversary trial that was determined to be obscene."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3525.773,3527.066,"That's correct, if they're still there."
1978.78-511,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3527.066,3529.82,And what would be the -- if they were still there.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3529.82,3533.278,"That is the problem, if they are still there."
1978.78-511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3533.278,3535.168,What's the harm if they're not still there?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3535.168,3539.645,"Well, the harm if they're not still there is that we've gone as we allowed the person --"
1978.78-511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3539.645,3541.683,Verdict convicted him now this two-day trial?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3541.683,3542.193,Okay.
1978.78-511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3546.035,3547.259,Immaterial this anymore.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3550.714,3551.563,What?
1978.78-511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3561.801,3564.472,"By changing the name, do they move the books?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3564.472,3567.984,"Well, now you have a new corporation that you have to go after."
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3573.088,3575.663,And you'd be inconvenienced?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3575.663,3576.697,I think that – I think that --
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3576.697,3578.016,And you would be inconvenienced?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3578.016,3578.758,"Yes, I think --"
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3578.758,3580.579,It means for prosecution?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3580.579,3581.862,It would be much difficult certainly.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3581.862,3583.088,"Yes, you'd be inconvenienced."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3583.088,3586.465,There's certainly be difficulties involved in that -- but I think --
1978.78-511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3586.465,3590.645,And consider civil remedies against this people or you get an injunction against operating?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3590.645,3609.881,"The getting an injunction would have been -- is completely analogous in order to insure that the evidence was there, you have to get a temporary restraining order to get the restraining order or to keep them there you would have to, I would submit bring the judge to the store to at least make an initial determination that there's reason to get the restraintor recieve a restraint --"
1978.78-511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3609.881,3612.858,Why don't you just subpoena the material if he's filed a civil suit?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3612.858,3624.642,"Because if you subpoena the material – well, if you subpoena the material, you have judicial delay, you have the problem that if you subpoena it, you have to have a reason to subpoena it so you have to have initial determination --"
1978.78-511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3624.642,3629.916,Or you when you -- why do you need a reason to subpoena if you got a couple of copies that are obscene?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3629.916,3639.848,But then you are going to have to subpoena the other copies which are in the store and you haven't review them initially yet unless you get a judge to go in and initially review them so you have probable cause --
1978.78-511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3639.848,3641.702,You don't have discovery in New York?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3641.702,3642.959,"Not, no, we could not."
1978.78-511,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3642.959,3644.17,If you don't have discovery in New York?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3644.17,3646.088,We couldn't discover it like that.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3659.692,3668.252,"In the State of New York, is there any other procedure that allows the magistrate to do what was done here?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3668.252,3671.196,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I don't follow when you say --"
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3671.196,3679.22,"Well, if you got a bucket shop running, can the magistrate go into the bucket shop and open up all the books and look at them?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3679.22,3683.336,I believe he have a booking shop the magistrate will not have to because the police officer could do that.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3683.336,3685.7,"I didn't say booking shop, I said bucket shop."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3685.7,3686.422,Bucket?
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3686.422,3689.491,"Yes, where you sell stocks and bonds over the telephone."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3689.491,3690.782,Okay.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3690.782,3691.735,Could he go in there.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3697.487,3700.168,I would think the judge would have --
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3700.168,3701.525,Give me one then.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3702.787,3705.112,There's noting written by statute but I think the judge --
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3705.112,3706.308,That's right.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3706.308,3707.069,That's correct.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3707.069,3707.577,That's right.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3707.577,3708.833,It's not written in statute.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3708.833,3713.414,"For example you wouldn't go in your racetrack in Goshen and do that, would you?"
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3713.414,3714.239,To go in there?
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3714.239,3719.342,"In Goshen, you wouldn't in that racetrack and go in there and seize all that books, would you."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3719.342,3723.016,If that -- if what I'm doing if there was probable cause to believe --
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3723.016,3725.585,That there were selling dirty books?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3725.585,3726.887,Or if there was --
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3726.887,3727.81,One other thing?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3727.81,3732.787,"Well, let's assume that the racetrack was illegally gambling, taking that's illegally --"
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3732.787,3735.242,Name me an instance where it happened?
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3735.242,3736.703,"I cannot name you another instance, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3736.703,3738.406,Any place in New York.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3738.406,3741.017,I cannot name you another state that I'm personally aware of.
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3741.017,3745.97,Any place else in the United States and then I'm going to the world.
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3745.97,3747.331,"I cannot name you an instance of that, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3747.331,3747.868,Thank you.
1978.78-511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3747.868,3749.873,"Your time has expired, counsel."
1978.78-511,1,40215,richard_l_parker,,3749.873,3750.511,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.78-511,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3750.511,3751.163,Thank you gentlemen.
