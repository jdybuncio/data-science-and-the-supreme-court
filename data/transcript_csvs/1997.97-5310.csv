1997.97-5310,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.408,"We'll hear argument now in Number 97-5310, David R. Beach v. the Ocwen Federal Bank."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,9.356,12.79,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-5310,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,33.115,42.231,"Is right of rescission in recoupment, is that a term peculiar to Florida law, or is that how we speak of it generally?"
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,57.742,71.012,"Justice Kennedy, rescission in this situation is statutory rescission, and I think it's important to note, too, that the right to rescind within 3 years is not an action in rescission under the truth-in-lending law."
1997.97-5310,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,75.026,80.98,"Well, can't we say that without coupling it with the term of recoupment, or does that somehow help your case to talk about recoupment?"
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,80.98,93.368,"It helps our case to talk about recoupment and, indeed, 1635(i)(3) talks about rescission in recoupment, a statute that the supreme court of Florida absolutely ignored in this analysis."
1997.97-5310,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,93.368,96.159,The statute itself talks about rescission in recoupment?
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,96.159,108.658,"Under State law, but the caption of (i)(3) is the right to recoupment under State law, and then the statute says, nothing in this section shall affect the right to rescission in recoupment under State law."
1997.97-5310,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.771,182.788,"Mr. Rogow, under the statute I guess, regardless of the timing of the discovery of a failure to comply with TILA, that the homeowner, your client, in effect, could in any event obtain damages that result from whatever failure to disclose was involved, is that right?"
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,182.788,183.379,--That is--
1997.97-5310,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,183.379,185.202,Without any time limit on that.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,186.962,190.775,"--You can get actual damages, Justice O'Connor, and statutory--"
1997.97-5310,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.775,193.517,And also twice the amount of any finance charge.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,193.517,205.704,"--A statutory penalty with a maximum... in this case it was $1,000, and there was $1,000, in effect a penalty under 1640, plus the overcharge, and plus another amount of--"
1997.97-5310,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.704,207.637,So that's available without time limit.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,207.637,209.437,--That is available.
1997.97-5310,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,209.437,224.398,"But your client asserts in addition a right to rescind and recover all of the interest paid for the period of time that the mortgage was in effect and payments were made on it, is that right?"
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,224.398,229.481,"That is right, Justice O'Connor, recover the interest paid, on the other hand have to pay back the principal."
1997.97-5310,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,230.112,230.323,Yes.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,234.987,236.376,--It could be--
1997.97-5310,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,236.376,240.31,--when you discover there's some $7 deficiency here.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,240.31,241.882,"--Well, a $7 deficiency--"
1997.97-5310,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.882,243.335,"I mean, that would be enough, wouldn't it--"
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,243.335,243.422,"--No, it would not--"
1997.97-5310,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.422,244.183,--under your theory?
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,244.183,251.619,"--It wouldn't be enough, Justice O'Connor, because under Congress' construct it would have to be more, but I think the answer to this is... because I understand--"
1997.97-5310,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,251.619,270.69,"Well, no matter how small the failing, and this was pretty small, and no matter how much time has elapsed, it's your position that there's this indefinite right of rescission to get back all of the interest paid, in addition to the damages and in addition to the statutory penalty, right?"
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,270.69,275.655,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor, because Congress has said that is right, because the remedy--"
1997.97-5310,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.655,276.837,"Well, that's what we're here to decide."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,280.46,285.936,"--That is our position, Justice O'Connor, but we think it's informed by how one construes these statutes."
1997.97-5310,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,293.572,296.545,"Mr. Rogow, can I ask just one other detailed practical question?"
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,301.787,301.987,--Yes.
1997.97-5310,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,301.987,305.181,"And your client is here in forma pauperis, as I understand it."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,305.181,305.561,Yes.
1997.97-5310,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,305.561,307.23,Does he have the money to do that?
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,307.23,321.76,"Well, at this moment, of course, he doesn't have the money to do that and what happens in these cases generally is, is that if the right to rescission is invoked, then the borrower is entitled to the return of the interest, but the borrower has to pay the principal back."
1997.97-5310,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,321.76,321.95,Right.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,321.95,329.276,"And in some situations, indeed, if one's house has appreciated in value, you can then refinance your house and pay back the principal."
1997.97-5310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,346.318,360.686,"Mr. Rogow, you are so stressing the word rescission... you say that's used over repeatedly, and yet Congress used such distinctly different language in dealing with the 1-year time limit for damages."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,397.631,399.363,"Two ways, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.97-5310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,414.189,433.93,"Well, you say so, but what is there in the statute that indicates that, and anything that indicates that it's only... the same thing... what you're saying is, it is the same thing as the extension of the statute of limitations, which doesn't count if you're seeking only to recoup."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,433.93,450.621,"Justice Ginsburg, (i)(3) says the right to rescission in recoupment shall not be affected and is available under State law, so even if one looks at 1635(f), the shall expire language, that is revived by (i)(3)."
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,450.621,452.484,"Mr. Rogow, can I ask you about that?"
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,466.517,467.597,"No, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.597,469.159,You would want us to remand--
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,469.159,469.718,Yes.
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.718,471.811,--to let the Florida supreme court decide that?
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,471.811,472.411,"Yes, because--"
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.411,473.912,So is that the most you're asking for?
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,473.912,474.332,--It is.
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.332,480.165,"A right to remand to let the Florida court decide whether, under Florida law, there is such a right?"
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,480.165,486.339,"To let the Florida court decide whether or not, under Florida law properly applying Federal law."
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.813,490.503,"Well, wait, wait, wait."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,497.309,503.703,"--It says the right to... the caption of it says, the right to recoupment under State law."
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,513.149,524.476,"But I mean, Florida may decide that this is a peculiar sort of an action, this rescission action, for which it will not allow recoupment."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,530.29,533.285,--It is not if it misapplies Federal law.
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.516,535.488,"Well, why would it say under State law, then?"
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,535.488,536.568,"--Well, because--"
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,536.568,545.394,"I mean, if it's a matter of Federal law they could have left out the phrase in (i)(3) nothing... it could have just said, nothing in this subsection affects a consumer's right of rescission and recoupment, period."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,545.394,550.208,"--In (i)(3), the caption, I come back, that says the right of recoupment under State law--"
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,550.208,550.997,I don't care about the caption.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,554.402,561.948,"--And the right of rescission, Justice Scalia, is the right of rescission... TILA rescission and State law rescission."
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.391,581.562,I understand that.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,603.106,609.002,"Not if they applied neutral principles of Florida law, because Florida law permits rescission in recoupment--"
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,609.002,609.421,Okay--
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,611.784,615.366,It's an ultimate question of Florida law applying--
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,615.366,620.67,And what you say is neutral principles of Florida law may not be what the Florida supreme court thinks are neutral principles.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,620.67,624.673,--And they would not be if the Florida supreme court properly addressed 1635(f).
1997.97-5310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,643.857,648.229,"May I clarify one thing, Mr. Rogow, because I think we lost a piece of this that's essential."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,658.647,658.825,--Yes.
1997.97-5310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,658.825,660.958,--But solely under State law.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,689.478,690.66,That is exactly right.
1997.97-5310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,698.436,708.073,"But if you're right about TILA having this right of rescission in recoupment, then why do you need the provision that talks about State law?"
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,728.288,737.955,"--It makes it clear that Federal law is not preempting the field, but rescission in recoupment under State law would also be available for fraud, duress, or coercion."
1997.97-5310,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,737.955,739.636,--It's not a matter of preemption.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,752.147,753.579,"It does, Justice Kennedy."
1997.97-5310,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,753.579,760.345,"And it's for that Federal law Congress has provided a remedy for breach, rescission, but it says it can only be for 3 years."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,760.345,762.105,It says it can only be--
1997.97-5310,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,762.105,771.781,"So it seems to me, as Justice Ginsburg is indicating, you're trying to have it both ways, but that's quite different from saying that there is simply a State law cause of action."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,771.781,781.896,"--Well, what we're saying, Justice Kennedy, is... and the supreme court of Florida came to the conclusion that there is no Federal right to rescission after 3 years."
1997.97-5310,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,789.913,803.441,"But certainly section... subsection, or double subsection (3) of 1635(i), which says nothing in this subsection affects a consumer's right of rescission in recoupment... that does not give any Federal right."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,803.441,806.222,It leaves open the door to the Federal right.
1997.97-5310,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,806.222,811.357,"It leaves... well, it leaves open the possibility that the State may give you a right."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,811.357,820.662,"It certainly leaves open the State giving you a right, but it does not preclude, and I think that's the key to this case, is it does not preclude the use of the Federal right."
1997.97-5310,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,820.662,828.408,"No, but it seems to me that your Federal right of rescission goes when it says an obligor's right of rescission shall expire 3 years after the date of consummation."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,828.408,831.371,That's 1635(f).
1997.97-5310,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,831.371,836.793,"Well, and that is your right of rescission under this statute."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,836.793,838.926,That is your right to affirmatively--
1997.97-5310,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,838.926,840.306,"What do you mean, affirmatively rescind?"
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,840.306,840.516,--By--
1997.97-5310,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,840.516,842.138,It doesn't say affirmatively rescind.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,842.138,852.204,"--When one reads 1635(a) and 1635(b) in that section, they're talking about sending a notice of rescission within 3 years, affirmatively rescinding."
1997.97-5310,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.318,859.81,And that's a State law right.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,859.81,873.671,"That is, if State law permits recoupment, then there is a right to rescission and the question is, which right to rescission, State law rescission, or State law rescission and the Federal TILA rescission?"
1997.97-5310,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,873.671,884.336,"Mr. Rogow, did the petitioner ask for a rescission remedy as a matter of State law in the proceedings below?"
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,884.336,889.541,"As a... the petitioner raised 1635 rescission, which was Federal rescission."
1997.97-5310,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,889.541,891.221,But not State law--
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,891.221,891.942,At the... that's right.
1997.97-5310,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,891.942,892.433,--rescission.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,894.105,912.268,"It was not, and at the time (i)(3) was not in existence when the petitioner filed his... his and her affirmative defenses, so they were relying upon the right to rescission, which every court that had addressed this since 1984 found that there was a right to rescission in recoupment after 3 years."
1997.97-5310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,912.268,913.059,Why is--
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,948.882,949.333,No.
1997.97-5310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,974.18,978.334,"Well, but my question is, why shouldn't it make some difference?"
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1000.277,1015.897,"I think, Justice Souter, that the answer lies in (i)(3), that if one views, as is right, as having expired, then (i)(3) revived it by its language that leaves open the notion that there can be rescission in recoupment."
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1015.897,1017.279,"Well, (i)(3) doesn't have to be read that way."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1054.885,1055.136,But the question--
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1055.136,1057.059,Violation of the act is also a fraud.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1057.059,1061.259,"--But the question, Justice Scalia, is whether or not it can only be read that way."
1997.97-5310,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1062.731,1064.344,"No, it need not only be read that way."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1076.532,1082.958,"--But the supreme court of Florida said it can only be read one way, and that, we think, is their error."
1997.97-5310,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1092.874,1095.025,But Mr. Rogow why isn't the word expire here?
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1121.906,1151.873,"--And (i)(3) addresses that when it says that nothing in this section, which includes the 3-year limitation which is referred to in section (i), shall affect the right to rescission in recoupment under State law, so while that... your reading would be the usual reading, the fact that (i)(3) is added to this changes this from being that kind of statute of repose where the right has expired, died as often is suggested, into something that now has been revived."

1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1238.416,1243.048,"--Well, in terms of how Congress voted, obviously the end result was (i)(3)."

1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1478.134,1478.565,No.
1997.97-5310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1497.707,1501.53,But it's referring to the right which occurs at the time of foreclosure.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1501.53,1501.991,Yes.
1997.97-5310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1501.991,1512.148,So it's a defensive... I assume it's a defensive right which functionally is being employed in the same way that you're arguing the general rescission right should be employed.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1512.148,1516.432,"It is, within 3 years, but that doesn't address recoupment, and recoupment is addressed in (i)(3)--"

1997.97-5310,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1517.443,1519.184,--I have a technical question.
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1529.542,1532.326,"--Well, there are equitable principles here, and the court could adjust the--"
1997.97-5310,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1532.326,1541.911,"Well, when you say... in other words, is it possible that 30 years later the homeowner comes back and says, yes, you are entitled, bank, to my original principal, $100,000."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1551.853,1553.505,--There is no record of that happening.
1997.97-5310,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1553.505,1554.466,"No, ever in the country?"

1997.97-5310,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1557.38,1564.175,"--So they'd actually have to have the $100,000 and give it back to the bank, otherwise they couldn't do the rescission."
1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1564.175,1566.699,The rescission requires a give-and-take.

1997.97-5310,0,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,1581.808,1594.187,"Because if that were a strategic default, then under equitable recoupment principles and even, indeed, under the rescission principles, the court could take into consideration if there were some bad faith in the way the borrower had addressed this."
1997.97-5310,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1594.187,1606.575,And I take it the court could also take into consideration the fact that there's a provision in here that mere computational errors in fact do not support any rescission right at all.

1997.97-5310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1663.225,1663.976,Why would that be?
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1677.356,1681.069,--As I under... because the principal of the loan is essentially an unsecured debt--
1997.97-5310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1681.069,1686.353,"No, but tendering back, I take it, means like you have a certified check and you hand it to the bank, and--"
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1686.353,1698.14,"--Well, the question is going to be then, as a matter of equity, whether the tender-back rule has to be applied in the first instance or whether the bankruptcy protections ought to apply in the first instance, and I think a lower court's probably divided with respect to that particular question--"
1997.97-5310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1698.14,1699.38,--That's what I found out.
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1702.311,1703.663,"--Well, we know in the Bothelo case--"
1997.97-5310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1703.663,1705.543,"--and it doesn't sound to me as if people know, particularly."
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1705.543,1705.744,--Right.
1997.97-5310,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1802.652,1803.931,"His argument I think was, look at the language."
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1829.439,1846.362,"Justice Breyer, I can't improve on your characterization of what probably happened in Congress, which is that somebody identified the possibility of a State law right in rescission and recoupment and the Congress quite rightly reacted negatively and said, wait a second, in this subsection we certainly don't mean to withdraw any of those kinds of State remedies."
1997.97-5310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1851.007,1851.648,--Florida--
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1858.915,1859.275,"--Well, I--"
1997.97-5310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1859.275,1861.075,--make perfect sense if it said rescission or recoupment.
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1861.075,1864.618,"--Well, I think it would have made more sense if they had simply said State law rescission and recoupment."
1997.97-5310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1868.351,1869.943,But is there such an animal in State law as rescission in recoupment?
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1869.943,1889.184,"There is a reference to that language in one of the... actually, one of the earlier Florida cases, where... it's not actually that language, but there is recoupment action, and they do talk about rescission, but you know, our footnote 6 in our brief goes to great lengths... we looked in vain for this to try to figure out where Congress came up with this particular animal and frankly couldn't find it."
1997.97-5310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1889.184,1891.957,Nobody thought of the possibility of a scrivener's error?
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1891.957,1895.95,"Well, I'm always reluctant to press that as the basis for interpretation, Your Honor."
1997.97-5310,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1897.57,1899.092,If it said or--
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1899.452,1901.445,[Laughter]
1997.97-5310,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1901.445,1904.917,--How would the case come out if it said or?
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1904.917,1907.951,Rescission or recoupment under State law?
1997.97-5310,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1912.105,1913.127,And what's the answer to that?
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1913.127,1918.162,"--Well, I still think that Congress would have meant for State law to apply to both, so it wouldn't have made a difference."
1997.97-5310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1918.162,1930.451,"But Mr. Phillips, as I understand your position, you're just saying there's no Federal right here, but I don't think you take the position that if Florida said we're going to treat even a trivial violation of TILA as a ground for State law rescission, you aren't saying that it would be preempted--"
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1930.451,1940.415,"No, I'm not arguing it would be preempted, but I do think it's important in that regard, a la Justice Scalia's question about a remand in this case, is that the first half of the Florida supreme court's opinion analyzes the Federal statutory issue."
1997.97-5310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1959.419,1963.222,"--Well, that's the other point I was going to ask is, when did their claim for a State law recoupment first assert itself?"
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1965.343,1966.745,"It never asserted itself, to this day."
1997.97-5310,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1985.728,1993.043,"But you think that nonetheless, as you read the opinion of the Florida supreme court, it rejected any State law recovery, right?"
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1993.043,1993.442,--Absolutely.
1997.97-5310,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1994.744,1996.206,Even though it wasn't requested.
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1996.206,2021.473,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor, because the question that was certified to the Florida supreme court was whether or not there was this kind of a right under State law, and if you look at the joint appendix on 164 to 165, the last line of 164 says, after analyzing all of the traditional grounds for statutory interpretation as to why this provision doesn't grant a Federal right it says, but that does not end our inquiry, and then it turns, in Florida, and I take the rest of that analysis really--"
1997.97-5310,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2021.473,2034.601,And you don't think that the Florida court thought that it was simply not at liberty to confer some State law right of rescission on the theory that TILA had preempted State law.
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2034.601,2038.744,"--I don't see anything in the Court's opinion that remotely suggested that to be the case, Justice O'Connor."
1997.97-5310,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2038.744,2053.695,"Well, the question presented here is, may an action for the statutory right of rescission provided by TILA be revived as a defense in recoupment beyond the 3-year limit on the right of rescission set forth in section 13... 1635(f)."
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2057.117,2061.529,"Well, I... no question about it, Mr. Chief Justice, it doesn't include that question, and--"
1997.97-5310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.529,2064.303,That certainly wasn't... that wasn't the question framed in the petition.
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2064.303,2064.763,--I'm sorry.
1997.97-5310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2064.763,2065.755,We rewrote the question.
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2065.755,2066.025,Right.
1997.97-5310,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2067.157,2068.607,So that's not what they present... yes.
1997.97-5310,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2068.607,2079.303,"Right, but the bottom line is, in terms of I think what is before this Court, is simply a question of Federal law and I think, based on all that's happened today, the question... the Federal question of law is unmistakable."
1997.97-5310,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2111.876,2113.368,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
1997.97-5310,2,17968,bruce_s_rogow,,2115.641,2117.642,Several things.
