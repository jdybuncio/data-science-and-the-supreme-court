1988.87-1383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,20.426,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1383, United States v. Irwin Halper."
1988.87-1383,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,22.886,26.058,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1243.618,1249.581,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1337.99,1341.112,"How did the district court reach that conclusion, Mr. Roberts?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1341.112,1343.543,"Well, it did the best it could on what the government gave it."
1988.87-1383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1352.609,1356.081,"Well, did the district court hold a hearing and give the government an opportunity to present evidence?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1356.081,1359.124,"--Well, I think in... in any particular case where the district--"
1988.87-1383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1359.124,1361.205,"I mean, did the district court do that here?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1361.205,1362.096,"--No, it didn't."
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1374.524,1377.226,"Well, he... he just talked about investigation."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1377.814,1380.077,The costs of investigation and prosecution.
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1380.077,1381.417,Of the whole criminal case?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1381.417,1383.718,Investigating the fraud.
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.84,1390.894,"Well, I can't imagine that it only cost the government $16,000 to prosecute the criminal case."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1390.894,1392.874,"--Well, this was actually a fairly easy case."
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1413.219,1417.941,"Well, it started... I suppose it started in the... in another department?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1420.253,1424.887,It started as a... as a criminal investigation.
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.436,1427.997,"I know, but wasn't it referred to Justice by somebody else?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1427.997,1430.17,--I'm not aware that it... it was.
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1434.522,1435.784,"I would suppose it would, wouldn't you?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1435.784,1441.528,"If it had been, I would suppose that would reduce even further the costs of investigation and prosecution."
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1441.528,1441.938,I don't know.
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1442.559,1453.485,"Well, if they have a set unit there who looked... presumably which looks at the... the claims that are... are submitted as a... as a routine... that's their... their job... it wouldn't be very hard to pick Halper out."
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.485,1457.328,And then it's referred to the Justice Department and then it goes to the U.S. Attorney?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1457.328,1458.087,Yes.
1988.87-1383,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1467.133,1487.697,"Mr. Roberts, do you take the position that the court in every case brought under this False Claims Act has to force the government to litigate the specific cost to the government of prosecuting and investigating that case to see if it bears a rational relation to the amount of the fine?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1487.697,1489.84,"--Well, I think as an initial matter, the Court can assume--"
1988.87-1383,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1489.84,1495.891,That... that just seems like... a... a... an unusually complex burden to place on the government.
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1495.891,1503.217,"--Well, I think it would really only come into play when you have a disproportion between penalty and actual damages as stark as it is in this case."
1988.87-1383,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1521.68,1530.045,Do you think the government can win its case just by producing average costs of investigation and prosecution of civil fraud?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1530.045,1531.314,"--No, I don't, Your Honor."
1988.87-1383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1574.563,1587.741,"Well, supposing in this case, Mr. Roberts, the district court had found through whatever method he used that the costs were $16,000 and the statute required the imposition of a penalty of, say, $40,000."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1594.777,1595.929,"No, Your Honor, it cannot."
1988.87-1383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1605.994,1607.727,"So, there's no play at the joints."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1611.099,1613.968,"--Well, plus the actual damages."
1988.87-1383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1613.968,1615.49,Plus the actual damages.
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1615.49,1628.149,"There is play at the joints, and... and the district court recognized that in arriving at that $16,000 figure, it did have to take into account the difficulty of calculating the costs and... and... and the damages."
1988.87-1383,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1629.99,1635.443,What about... what about this Medicare fraud unit that is over there in... in HHS?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1655.295,1661.79,"--Well, I don't think the... the defendant in any particular case has to pay for the wasted efforts going after others."
1988.87-1383,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1661.79,1662.491,Why not?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1662.491,1668.976,"He should certainly be made to pay for the costs that he caused, in other words, the time spent investigating his case."
1988.87-1383,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1668.976,1670.976,"Well, he caused the whole year's worth of work."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1676.52,1689.71,"Well, I think there's a point at which the rational in Hess, in other words, compensating the government for its losses... there has to be a point at which... certainly he doesn't have to pay his share of the overhead on the... on the national debt."
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1720.338,1721.75,Was there an indictment here?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1721.75,1723.992,"--In the first case, yes."
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.992,1725.093,In the criminal case?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1725.093,1726.422,"In the criminal case, yes."
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1726.422,1728.055,Do you know how long that took?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1728.055,1730.486,Before the grand jury?
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1735.418,1739.671,"Only... only one government attorney before the grand jury, or do you know?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1739.671,1744.594,--The indictment was signed by one assistant United States attorney.
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1760.065,1766.981,Did the government have to go before a judge during the grand jury proceeding to... for some rulings or not?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1766.981,1769.081,--I'm not sure.
1988.87-1383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1772.293,1776.444,"They have five going at one time in the Southern District, don't you?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1776.444,1778.567,Five grand juries?
1988.87-1383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1778.567,1779.576,"Yes, at the same time, don't you?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1779.576,1780.047,"I think that's right, Your Honor."
1988.87-1383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1780.598,1782.348,"Well, how can you keep track of all five?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1782.348,1789.694,"Well, I think when they get to the point... in a case that shows the disproportion, as in this case, 220 times the actual damages--"
1988.87-1383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1789.694,1791.887,You're not going to charge him for all five grand juries.
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1791.887,1801.532,"--No, and not all the time of the one, just... just the time spent in this particular case because the issue concerns the rights of this particular defendant in this case."
1988.87-1383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1860.57,1869.516,"Supposing this were a criminal prosecution and exactly the same facts were shown, but the statute, after a criminal conviction, provided for a fine of $1 million."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1875.3,1882.116,"The only issue would be whether it violated the Eighth Amendment, the excessive fines or cruel and unusual punishment provision."
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.787,1903.7,Why did he say this was a criminal prosecution?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1903.7,1905.76,"--Well, he did say this was a criminal penalty, but he--"
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.76,1912.556,"Well, I... I can't imagine why you'd come out differently if there hadn't, been another criminal... if there hadn't been a criminal prosecution--"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1912.556,1913.695,"--Well, it would be--"
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.695,1914.256,--preceding it.
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1924.534,1926.013,"--That may be, but he--"
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1926.013,1930.769,And I can't imagine that he would... he would... he would say you'll have... we want to try this like a criminal case.
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1930.769,1945.327,"--But in terms of the holding, I think it's a different question whether this on its face is a criminal prosecution because, after all, the district court did allow the proceeding to continue to the extent of awarding the government it double damages and all the costs of the... of the prosecution."
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.327,1947.609,"Well, you... do you think we'd have to overrule Rex Trailer?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1947.609,1948.74,Not at all.
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.035,1963.87,"Well, yes, but it also... but the Court also said that there is no requirement, statutory or judicial, that specific damages be shown."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1963.87,1977.628,"And the Court specifically noted that the government, while it had not shown the amount of its damages, it didn't doubt that the government had been injured, and it was simply saying liquidated damages of $10,000 is close enough in this case."
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1985.452,1998.172,"So, should we... our inquiry here is... is that we look at the $132,000 and try to speculate what the government... whether the government spent that much in HEW and everything else?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2000.803,2002.313,"Well, it's not... it's not speculation."
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2011.579,2012.64,Two hundred and twenty times what?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2012.64,2016.844,"--Times its actual damages, the $585 in false claims."
1988.87-1383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2035.645,2040.119,At what point in the trial does the government come in and make this sort of a showing?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.119,2055.717,"I think at the end of the proceeding after liability has been established and the statutory penalty is set, if there is a disproportion, in this case, the $130,000 versus $585, then the district court says this doesn't look like compensation."
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.608,2079.884,You mean you... this... you... can the government... can the court transform a criminal proceeding into a civil one just by reducing the fine?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2079.884,2081.336,Absolutely.
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.596,2105.55,"Well, yes, that's a double jeopardy solution, but it still was a criminal prosecution."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2105.55,2107.392,It was a criminal prosecution.
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.392,2116.819,And you're saying we... we reduce it... we can... we can change a case that should have been tried as a criminal case into a civil case just by reducing the fine.
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2116.819,2120.082,I don't think he's saying it should have been tried as a criminal case.
1988.87-1383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2218.026,2225.069,"Well, what does your argument do, Mr. Roberts, to the punitive damages that... that are awarded in many civil actions?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2225.069,2230.953,"Well, I think in a typical civil action where it is brought by a private party, it wouldn't implicate the Double Jeopardy Clause at all."
1988.87-1383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.328,2246.116,"So, the... the action of a governmental court in awarding the damages does not make it subject to any sort of a--"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2246.116,2249.407,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think that would be enough to trigger the Double Jeopardy Clause."
1988.87-1383,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2249.407,2260.355,"--Well, suppose the city is injured in an antitrust action, and there's a criminal antitrust prosecution, and then the state or the city sues and gets triple damages."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2261.664,2268.63,"It would depend, Your Honor, on whether the triple damages exceeded the costs of investigating and prosecuting the violation."
1988.87-1383,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2270.14,2280.808,"So... so, in your view antitrust damages under the... under the Sherman Act, when the city is injured, cannot be tripled automatically."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2288.222,2298.54,"--It the only rationale that can be advanced on the facts for the triple damages is punitive, punishment, then the same analysis would apply because the defendant would already have been punished--"
1988.87-1383,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2298.54,2302.47,"Well, what is their rationale for triple damages under... under the Sherman Act?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2302.47,2303.571,--[inaudible].
1988.87-1383,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2303.571,2310.207,"It's... there's a large deterrence rationale that has a civil... that has a civil consequence, isn't there?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2310.207,2311.877,I think so.
1988.87-1383,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2334.453,2342.397,"No, but an antitrust suit's triple damages can be astronomic and generally, I... I would assume, are well in excess of the costs of investigation and prosecution."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2345.78,2346.549,Under the... under the Sherman Act.
1988.87-1383,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2355.665,2363.422,But you're willing to make your case here rise or fall on the... whether or not triple damages can be granted to a government after a criminal prosecution?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2363.422,2365.503,"Well, I think the analysis does apply."
1988.87-1383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2397.783,2401.827,"Mr. Roberts, isn't there another difference too on the triple damages setting?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2408.881,2413.936,"--Well, in that... that's true, and that might further support a remedial rationale."
1988.87-1383,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2423.87,2428.054,Doesn't this statute permit private suits for recovery?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2428.054,2430.645,There is a qui tam provision--
1988.87-1383,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2430.645,2431.176,All right.
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2431.176,2432.165,--in which--
1988.87-1383,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2432.165,2440.322,And so what happens if a private person were here instead of the government seeking triple the penalty?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2440.322,2442.353,"--Well, the analysis would still be the same."
1988.87-1383,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2444.543,2452.38,"So, if a private person brings it under this statute, you would still be arguing that it's invalid and the court has to look at the amount."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2452.38,2455.222,"--Well, it... it may be distinguishable."
1988.87-1383,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2474.253,2482.32,"It's rather odd to apply a double jeopardy analysis if... if the suit is brought by a private person, isn't it?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2482.32,2494.457,"--I think so, and I... and I don't think, for example, it would apply in a case in which a private individual brings the antitrust action after a government prosecution under the Sherman Act."
1988.87-1383,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2509.946,2524.446,"That would have the quixotic effect of if the government brought the civil penalty action and... and sought the statutory amount of the penalty, you would urge a double jeopardy application."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2530.19,2542.107,--I think that conclusion follows from the assumption that the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't... is an inhibition on government action and doesn't preclude private actions for... for damages.
1988.87-1383,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.73,2552.426,"Then you'd say that there may be other limitations on the level of private actions that may be allowed, but not the Double Jeopardy Clause."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2552.426,2553.645,"--Well, that's right."
1988.87-1383,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2565.232,2574.599,The fine can be a fine even though not assessed in a... it possibly can be a fine for that purpose even though not assessed in a criminal proceeding.
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2574.599,2586.416,"That's the... the argument I think in the... in the Browning-Ferris case, yes, which depending on how it comes out, would make... could lead to a curious result here."
1988.87-1383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2797.976,2806.581,"It would also mean that the civil proceeding wouldn't be a civil proceeding, wouldn't it, that you have to have a reasonable doubt standard and all the safeguards that apply in a criminal trial?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2806.581,2808.642,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think it means that."
1988.87-1383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2829.966,2832.327,That would be a rather strange animal.
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2832.327,2833.828,Well--
1988.87-1383,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2833.828,2836.9,It's a strange dichotomy you're giving us here.
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2853.522,2854.281,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1383,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.281,2855.082,That wouldn't be cruel or unusual.
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2858.795,2859.797,And the government makes that argument.
1988.87-1383,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2859.797,2863.197,"--But... but only because he has been convicted criminally already, it's bad here."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2872.503,2874.386,I... I think it... it may well have.
1988.87-1383,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2875.154,2875.595,That's strange.
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2876.306,2884.101,--below that... you don't have to conclude that this proceeding is inherently criminal to recognize that it does impose a second punishment.
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2892.826,2903.535,"If there hadn't been a... if there weren't a prior criminal case, you wouldn't say that the government could collect this $132,000 in a civil case."
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2903.535,2906.637,It would be a very different question because you--
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2906.637,2909.038,I didn't... I didn't want to... what would be your answer?
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2910.498,2911.499,--I think--
1988.87-1383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.499,2914.571,"--Wouldn't... wouldn't the court say, well, this is punishment and you can't collect it?"
1988.87-1383,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2914.571,2921.155,"--I think that would be a very reasonable conclusion on the facts, given the disparity between recovery and... and punishment."
1988.87-1383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2977.413,2978.863,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
1988.87-1383,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2983.267,2983.888,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1988.87-1383,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3040.282,3046.416,--It... it is true what... what amicus says that the Double Jeopardy Clause applies to the government--
1988.87-1383,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3046.416,3047.548,That's correct.
1988.87-1383,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3047.548,3049.23,--and not... not to private parties.
1988.87-1383,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3049.23,3060.916,"That's true, but the punishment in this case, if there is some, would be awarded by the court pursuant to a statute passed by Congress, and there's no reason why the Double Jeopardy Clause would not be concerned with it."
1988.87-1383,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3073.284,3085.162,"In other words, any civil plaintiff who obtains punitive damages from a court is perhaps violating the Double Jeopardy Clause?"
1988.87-1383,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3085.162,3099.291,"No, Your Honor, we don't believe that it does violate the Double Jeopardy Clause for any civil action to follow a criminal one even if there is a recovery above and beyond actual damages because that is not the line that the Double Jeopardy Clause draws."
1988.87-1383,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3115.361,3126.579,Isn't there another factor in the... in the qui tam action and in the treble damage antitrust actions that the extra recovery is partially justified as an incentive for the third private party to bring the action?
1988.87-1383,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3133.584,3146.424,"Yes, it does, Your Honor, but in... in the case where a criminal conviction has already happened and the private plaintiff brings the treble damages action, he's entitled to rely on the facts established in the criminal trial."
1988.87-1383,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3152.198,3152.866,"No, that's true."
1988.87-1383,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3158.339,3172.831,"--That's true, Your Honor, but the same incentives exist in this case because if the government did not have the opportunity to recover penalties, it would be virtually incapable of prosecuting small frauds like this because the costs of prosecuting them would far outweigh the costs of investigating."
1988.87-1383,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3172.831,3174.982,But what is the maximum criminal fine you could recover?
1988.87-1383,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3174.982,3180.315,"There is a $250,000 per count penalty that could be--"
1988.87-1383,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3180.315,3182.076,You could recover a lot of money in the criminal proceeding.
1988.87-1383,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3182.076,3189.461,"--That's correct, but under the Sentencing Commission guidelines, the fine would be assessed by looking in part at the actual damage to the government."
1988.87-1383,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3189.461,3190.212,Well--
1988.87-1383,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3190.212,3192.864,"So, it's a very different formula that has been prescribed."
1988.87-1383,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3206.251,3215.027,--Does the Sentencing Commission consider civil penalties in... in formulating its guidelines for... for criminal fines?
1988.87-1383,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3215.027,3216.489,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1988.87-1383,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3241.304,3247.438,"That... that discretion will presumably be... be limited by the... by the Commission, the Sentencing Commission, won't it?"
1988.87-1383,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3247.438,3253.983,"Under the False Claims Act on the civil side, the Sentencing Commission would not have jurisdiction over it, only on the criminal side."
1988.87-1383,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3297.881,3306.657,"But if all that has been done under the criminal case, it's hard to see how... how the costs would be substantial for the civil prosecution... the civil action."
1988.87-1383,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3306.657,3310.901,"--The civil action's costs are less than the criminal prosecution, but there were still costs of--"
1988.87-1383,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3310.901,3314.273,And you can rely on... on the conviction obtained--
1988.87-1383,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3314.273,3315.171,--Yes.
