1996.96-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.82,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-6298, Aaron Lindh v. James P. Murphy."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,8.637,12.224,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,115.872,119.426,"It made any exception, did it not, for jurisdictional rules?"
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,119.426,124.978,"Your Honor, I don't think that there is an exception under Step 2 per se for jurisdictional rules."
1996.96-6298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.93,162.084,"Well, Mr. Liebman, what rights are we talking about, the Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses?"
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,162.084,162.5,--No.
1996.96-6298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.118,175.824,"All right, so you're not relying on Lindh's right to confront witnesses, but just the statutory right to habeas relief."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,175.857,176.69,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1996.96-6298,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,191.55,199.972,"Mr. Liebman, you spoke in answering the Chief Justice's question a moment ago about there being no alternative forum here, so that the jurisdictional analysis was inapposite."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,208.059,210.494,"--There are three answers to that, Your Honor."
1996.96-6298,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,293.98,306.621,"Well, that may go to his judgment, and it may have been a perfectly sensible judgment to make at the time, but it doesn't go to the question whether there is an alternative to the particular kind of review sought, which I assume is a question about the system rather than about his particular judgment."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,306.621,310.073,"Well, let me give the third reason, Your Honor, because I think it speaks directly to that."
1996.96-6298,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,352.733,376.598,"Well, assuming that to be true, you're also assuming an analogy which may well be sound, but I guess it's not self-evidently sound, and that is that the cause of action that you would be speaking of in your example is the same... is a cause of action in the same sense that there is a cause of action in habeas, and habeas is kind of a mongrelized cause of action."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,421.043,434.768,"--Well, Your Honor, first of all, I'm not sure it makes a difference whether you see this as a new element of the cause of action, or the establishment of a new defense, or as the dramatic changing of the standard of review, if you want to think of it that way."
1996.96-6298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,470.124,472.243,"Well, this isn't a new standard of review."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,502.244,503.178,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
1996.96-6298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,519.004,519.789,"Well, now... now, wait."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,530.31,530.662,--No.
1996.96-6298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.662,532.412,--unless you're making a constitutional argument.
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,532.412,532.862,--No.
1996.96-6298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.886,555.361,"But it's quite different, it seems to me, for Congress to require the courts to reexamine something that they've decided on the one hand, and that was Plaut."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,555.361,555.594,Well--
1996.96-6298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,555.594,561.748,"And Congress to say on the other hand, what's been decided we're going to leave alone, and we don't want any more appeals."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,562.814,562.814,--Yes.
1996.96-6298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,562.814,566.099,I don't think the latter is an interference with the judicial function.
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,566.099,569.134,"Your Honor, I didn't mean to appeal to Plaut as a precedent."
1996.96-6298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.256,643.766,"Mr. Liebman, those Erie cases are consistent within that context, but surely not everything that would be labeled substantive for Erie is substantive for other purposes."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,643.766,646.551,"Your Honor, I don't mean to suggest there's a one-to-one relationship."
1996.96-6298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,735.22,736.62,What is your test--
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,750.913,759.352,"--The Supreme Court, this Court itself has said the same thing in those cases that I referred to, the jurisdiction cases."
1996.96-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,781.663,789.951,"The reference to an alternative forum in McCardle is pretty much of an afterthought in the last paragraph of the opinion, isn't it?"
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,789.951,792.987,"--Well, it has been vindicated, of course."
1996.96-6298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,805.278,811.599,I thought you... I thought we just had a discussion in which you say you're not relying on any constitutional problems here.
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,811.599,812.067,--All I--
1996.96-6298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.067,814.584,"I mean, I don't see this as a McCardle case at all."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,814.584,815.136,--No.
1996.96-6298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,855.394,870.403,"What... do you have a way of saying in a sentence or two what your standard for determining which procedures are determinative of the change of consequence... you know, the language from Landgraf?"
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,882.647,883.68,Your Honor--
1996.96-6298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,883.68,886.715,"And of course, that's determinative of legal consequence."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,917.767,936.878,"--The test, Your Honor, is when a Congress provides a standard and the intent of that standard is systematically to change the outcomes in a series of cases in favor of one of the litigants, sets of litigants to that action, and against--"
1996.96-6298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,936.878,954.238,"So if, in fact, there were two levels of an administrative review, including three levels within the agency and two in court later on, and maybe three, and Congress said, I'm going to take away one level of review... why are you doing it?"
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,966.445,966.945,"--No. No, Your Honor."
1996.96-6298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,977.217,979.519,"Oh, that's why they change four levels to five."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,987.691,988.225,"But Your Honor, what I--"
1996.96-6298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,988.225,989.325,"Does that, then, make the difference?"
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,989.325,994.178,"--What I don't understand in your example is, either side can benefit from another appeal."
1996.96-6298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,994.494,998.196,Do they determine systematically that they... I mean... do you see what I'm saying?
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,999.028,1011.086,"--Well, no, Your Honor, even in that situation what I would look to is the four corners of the provision itself, and to see if within the four corners of the provision itself it is designed to realign--"
1996.96-6298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1011.086,1021.825,"--All right, so the answer to my question is yes, if there's an administrative procedure, and by looking at it you see that this procedural change was designed to help one group or one side versus the other, then it's substantive."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1021.825,1030.494,"--Well, if the statute were to say, for purposes of limiting the number of social security claimants who receive relief, yes, that would be it."
1996.96-6298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1036.667,1042.988,"Well, we have a change in the parole evidence rule because we feel that defendants in contracts cases by and large are winning too often."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1046.357,1052.511,"Well, Your Honor, I teach evidence, but I don't have to teach the parole evidence rule because it's a substantive rule of contracts, and so yes, that would be--"
1996.96-6298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1052.511,1053.094,The answer is yes.
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1053.094,1053.26,--Yes.
1996.96-6298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1053.777,1064.466,"Mr. Liebman, you've explained the one side of it, what would be subject to the ordinary rule of prospectivity."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1074.322,1077.69,--There are two aspects to this under the Landgraf rule.
1996.96-6298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1166.73,1170.665,"Mr. Liebman, can I ask you about the four corners of the instrument to which you're appealing?"
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1242.963,1249.55,"--No, Your Honor, actually 2264(b) in some senses is our strongest point, and let me try and explain why."
1996.96-6298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1282.071,1283.438,"No, wait, it isn't superfluous."
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1296.229,1296.579,--But... but--
1996.96-6298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1296.579,1297.762,It's a question of when it rules.
1996.96-6298,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1297.762,1310.32,"--But, Your Honor, under Chapter 153 each of those provisions says themselves that when you come to review a habeas corpus case you... if it's a factual question you look at 2254(e)."
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,1538.54,1546.544,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-6298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.403,1587.855,"Ms. Wellman, there are microphones, and I think we could hear you even if you didn't speak quite as loudly."
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,1587.855,1589.621,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1996.96-6298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1664.934,1669.552,"Ms. Wellman, on that point I am confused."
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,1701.721,1714.831,"It is in that sense, but it is not backward-looking in the sense of tort action, in that the remedy to a person or the liability to a person, you're not... the State is not going to pay in the sense of damages."
1996.96-6298,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1725.369,1753.872,"But it is reviewing... I mean, in order to grant relief it is reviewing past actions, whereas in a classic injunctive case I suppose the question is, at the present time, now, is the defendant doing something defendant ought not to do, and yet in... as Justice Ginsburg's question suggests, in the habeas case it's the... the consequence is entirely a consequence of something that happened in the past."
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,1759.776,1760.326,--That's right.
1996.96-6298,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1788.659,1793.094,Could you at some point at your convenience go into a question that's bothering me?
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,1884.248,1896.138,"--I think that you must do that because Congress was silent, and when Congress is silent, then the Court has to do the Landgraf analysis as to the particular provision at issue."
1996.96-6298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.005,1899.674,Did Congress know about the Landgraf analysis?
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,1910.713,1916.1,"--Well, certainly Landgraf had been decided before this was... became law by about 2 years."
1996.96-6298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1916.1,1922.754,"But Landgraf is a long opinion, and suppose the Member of Congress got only up to page 242, where it--"
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,1946.216,1961.527,"Well, I think we have to assume that if Congress knew about Landgraf, they understood the entire decision, and as I understand Landgraf, and as we argue, what it clarifies is that there are two default rules."
1996.96-6298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1973.418,1981.505,"--Then you're saying that later parts of the opinion take this back, that prospectivity is not the default rule."
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,1981.505,1981.772,--I--
1996.96-6298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1981.772,1983.373,Something else is the default rule.
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,1983.373,2022.749,"--I think when you read that what you have to understand is that when the Court... starting with Landgraf, when the Court says the default rule is prospective for a retroactive statute it means statutes that have a retroactive effect as they define it in Landgraf, which is, attach new legal consequences to conduct completed before enactment, and new legal consequences means only in paravested rights that had become a right before, under the existing law, impose new liabilities on conduct that had already occurred and was completed, or impose new duties on transactions that were already completed."
1996.96-6298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2022.749,2029.421,"Ms. Wellman, you don't concede that the position you're arguing for is retrospective application, do you?"
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2037.175,2037.175,That's--
1996.96-6298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.175,2040.377,"I mean, the crucial issue is, prospective from when?"
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2040.377,2040.877,--From when and after what?
1996.96-6298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2040.877,2042.827,Or retrospective from when.
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2042.827,2043.927,That's right.
1996.96-6298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2044.643,2045.945,That's the hard question.
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2046.528,2071.06,"--Where do you begin, and where you begin as to 2254(d), which tells the Federal court under the situations in which it can grant relief, if the State court decision is contrary to or an unreasonable application of U.S. Supreme Court precedent, as long as that decision and determination has not been made yet, then applying the statute to that decision is prospective."
1996.96-6298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2071.06,2085.902,"Well, does... I mean, my real... the real thrust of my question, to be a little facetious about it, is if all the rules of construction and cases and silences and everything balance out exactly equally, should we presume Congress intends to do that which makes more sense, you see."
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2155.463,2158.248,"Yes, I think it... I understand your concern, and I think it's well-taken."
1996.96-6298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2201.972,2203.888,Suppose... suppose he had won.
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2227.92,2250.516,"--The Seventh Circuit would have to apply new 2254(d), because that's governing that court's decision whether to grant or deny habeas, and the reason for that is a little bit unlike a normal appeal, because the habeas law has always recognized that the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit is not just reviewing what the district court did and whether it did it right, but it is independently determining whether to grant a habeas writ."
1996.96-6298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2250.516,2260.288,"Then, suppose the petitioner says, well, if only I'd realized that would happen, I would have introduced three new witnesses who... and I would have made seven different new arguments."
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2262.055,2267.507,"He... for the trans... he would get the chance to make the new arguments, I believe, as the Seventh Circuit did here."
1996.96-6298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2267.507,2269.09,"Well, what about new witnesses?"
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2269.09,2279.565,"Well, what we're determining here is whether the State court's decision on the facts as known in the State court... he never offered before to offer new evidence."
1996.96-6298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2287.802,2290.402,"There was no request for a hearing, then, in the district court in the habeas proceedings?"
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2290.402,2291.27,--Absolutely not.
1996.96-6298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2330.645,2333.747,"Ms. Wellman, I'd like to be clear about what we're discussing currently here."
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2358.026,2358.51,No.
1996.96-6298,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2358.943,2359.66,--that you're addressing?
1996.96-6298,1,42303,sally_l_wellman,,2359.66,2359.826,--I'm sorry. I don't think we're discussing whether Congress said X or Y.
1996.96-6298,2,31626,james_s_liebman,,3264.241,3285.504,"Under section 107(c), if the Court reads section 107(c), the same negative implication that says if your case was pending, 153 does not apply to you, that same implication would say that if your case was not pending, then... but you file it immediately after the statute came into effect, then Chapter 153 would apply."
1996.96-6298,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3285.771,3287.789,But in your view the filing date controls?
1996.96-6298,2,31626,james_s_liebman,,3287.789,3292.177,"--Under 107(c), because the words of the statute are cases pending."
1996.96-6298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3339.606,3352.166,"Mr. Liebman, your position as I understand it is that this affects prior conduct within the meaning of Landgraf if the procedural rule, although on its surface procedural, benefits one side."
1996.96-6298,2,31626,james_s_liebman,,3353.432,3359.903,"--If it is designed to change the outcome in the series of cases such that you can say the law, what Congress wants to happen--"
1996.96-6298,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3359.903,3366.057,--What do you do about the jury trial example mentioned by Ms. Wellman?
