1988.87-1207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.293,"We'll hear argument now in No. 87-1207, Ray Will v. Michigan Department of State Police."
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,12.027,14.979,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,92.948,107.474,"Mr. Burnham, one thing that seems strange to me about this case is, if the Supreme Court of Michigan had wanted to award damages on this cause of action, it surely could have done so just under some general state law theory."
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,117.361,125.435,"Well, it would depend on whether or not the Chief Justice has in mind state constitutional law or state law of another type, in other words state tort law."
1988.87-1207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,150.425,154.97,The holding as to the state constitution was in this very case but it was not applied to him.
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,154.97,156.111,But it was not applied to him.
1988.87-1207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.417,267.225,"Mr. Burnham, don't you think the amendment, the retroactively-effective amendment, of the Dictionary Act bears on the meaning of persons in this statute?"
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,267.225,268.787,I don't believe so.
1988.87-1207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.17,298.432,"Well, there's pretty clear evidence of an intent not to have the language so broad for the very purpose of making sure it didn't include states."
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,298.432,307.85,"--Well, that intent is the intent of the commissioners of the revision commission, and it's quite well established that the revision commission's comments are not the legislative history of that statute."
1988.87-1207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,348.677,368.952,"Well, don't you also think that the history of the 1871 act, as outlined in Monell, indicates that the framers of that act thought they had no constitutional power to impose an independent federal duty on state officers or instrumentalities--"
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,368.952,370.574,I don't believe that that is--
1988.87-1207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,370.574,376.228,--And it would be rather surprising in light of that history that they intended to include the states?
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,376.228,384.881,"--I think that what Congress was speaking of is the type of liability that was, that was dealt with in the subject at hand, which of course was the Sherman Amendment."
1988.87-1207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,411.417,426.818,"But it's most unlikely in light of the history of that act and, and the purpose of the Ku Klux Klan Act that the 42nd Congress Intended to create a damage action against state governments to be heard in state court."
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,426.818,433.675,"Well, the question of state court, I think, has to be separated from the question of whether or not a cause of action is, is set out."
1988.87-1207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,520.172,524.17,Were they brought under Section 1983 in the Louisiana courts?
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,524.17,524.654,"No, no they were not."
1988.87-1207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.563,562.514,"But that's a little disingenuous, isn't it?"
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,578.46,583.365,"Well, I agree that Monell does not cover the precise question in this case."
1988.87-1207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.848,596.016,"Well, more than that, I think it, I think it, it... it's rationale refutes the statement you just made, that any, any earlier case that had to do with the city is somehow authority for suits against the government."
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,601.327,626.004,"--No, I, I don't believe that that... the rationale of Monell, as I understand Monell, is that there's no reason to exclude cities because of the fact that the Sherman Amendment was defeated or for any other reason, that cities, the entity itself is as capable as the officers of that city of engaging in the kinds of activities that were the focus of the, of Section 1 of the 1871 act."
1988.87-1207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.64,706.426,"Isn't it queer... queer disposition you're asking us to end up with, given Quern, you're... what you're necessarily suggesting is that in order to protect individuals against the states, Congress created a cause of action against the states, but allowed that cause of action to be sued upon only in state courts."
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,722.591,725.637,"Well, the crux of the matter is that Congress did not do that."
1988.87-1207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,761.357,768.26,"You don't think Congress, in Section... using Section 5, could have, could have set the 11th Amendment aside and allowed these suits?"
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,768.26,780.989,"Congress certainly could have done that, had Congress, number one, thought that the 11th Amendment was a problem, and number two, believed that or had the foresight to forecast this Court's decision in cases such as Hutto v. Finney and Atascadero."
1988.87-1207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.756,819.912,But we've decided that the other way.
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,819.912,820.631,"Well, I--"
1988.87-1207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,820.631,824.269,"I mean, you're, you're... this argument essentially is asking us to over... overrule Quern."
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,824.269,826.424,"--Well, Quern doesn't necessarily do that."
1988.87-1207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.671,917.981,"Do they do it by using the same word, in a fashion that, that has two different meanings?"
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,928.462,929.008,No.
1988.87-1207,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,971.46,978.598,"You think Congress used person to mean state but nonetheless did, did not allow suit against the state--"
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,978.598,982.986,Congress allowed suit against the state in the sense of authorizing the cause of action.
1988.87-1207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.461,1016.457,"--Mr. Burnham, can I ask you a question about your understanding of the state of the law at the time the statute was enacted?"
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1031.482,1034.762,I don't believe that it was.
1988.87-1207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.201,1086.461,"Well, under your view, if this action had been brought against the director of the state police in 1874, right after the statute was passed, and the judgment had been entered against that official, would that judgment have been payable by the state or by the individual at that time?"
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1086.461,1089.569,That would be... either option if possible.
1988.87-1207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1093.646,1094.565,At that time?
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1094.565,1095.487,At that time.
1988.87-1207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1205.303,1206.365,Let me just interrupt there.
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1213.081,1214.626,"--Well, of course, Ex parte Young was not for another 30 years."
1988.87-1207,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.626,1221.108,"I know, but I mean, why couldn't the rationale of Ex parte Young been applied in such a case and, and say that you're only remedy is not for damages but for injunctive relief?"
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1221.108,1236.196,"Well, it would be highly unlikely that that would be the case, if Congress says right in the statute that whatever this remedy is against persons is, in the words of the statute, a... an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."
1988.87-1207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1260.186,1270.697,"Mr. Burnham, was Section 1 of the 1871 Act patterned after Section 2 of the 1866 Civil Rights Act?"
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1270.697,1276.992,"I believe the term that this Court has, has used and is, gleaning from the legislative history, is that it was a model for--"
1988.87-1207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1276.992,1279.538,"The language is identical, in fact, isn't it?"
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1279.538,1282.054,"--The language... in fact, the language is identical."
1988.87-1207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1282.054,1289.097,"And would you say that Section 2 of the Civil Rights Act applies to states as persons, making them criminally liable?"
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1289.097,1297.158,"Well, at the time, of course, the... the criminal liability could only be visited on individuals."
1988.87-1207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1297.452,1299.811,"Well, your answer is no, that it would not make criminal--"
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1299.811,1300.373,"--No, it would not."
1988.87-1207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1300.373,1302.638,--penalties enforceable against the state.
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1302.638,1303.965,"No, in other words, the state could not be imprisoned under that law."
1988.87-1207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1303.965,1310.151,"Why would we read the word ""person"" in the identical language in the later act differently then, do you think?"
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1310.151,1311.338,"Well, there are a couple of reasons."
1988.87-1207,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1418.934,1427.978,"I think that the logic of the whole history is to say yes, they thought they could reach individual state actors but not the states themselves."
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1435.084,1442.691,"Well, it's, it's very hard to account for the many references about states being the object of Section 1."
1988.87-1207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1467.603,1477.959,Are there any indications in the debates showing concern over imposition of damage liability on the states?
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1477.959,1480.88,"Not that I have been able to find, Your Honor."
1988.87-1207,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1486.596,1496.545,Is that then not indicative of an understanding by Congress that such damage liability is not encompassed by the statute?
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1496.545,1514.086,"Well, to the extent that Congress was worried about a few other things, such as in the other sections military takeover of state governments, which obviously is much more intrusive of state sovereignty than a simple damage award, suspending habeas corpus in the areas where state authorities were not able to control things."
1988.87-1207,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1516.006,1520.816,"And also the black laws, the state black laws, too."
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1520.816,1522.331,Absolutely.
1988.87-1207,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1537.778,1542.183,xxx that prevented a Negro from flying a kite.
1988.87-1207,0,44084,william_burnham,,1542.183,1546.978,Uhm.
1988.87-1207,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1594.505,1596.317,"Very well, Mr. Burnham."
1988.87-1207,1,26254,george_h_weller,,1597.613,1601.565,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1207,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1649.265,1652.373,Did the Supreme Court of Michigan agree with you on that second point?
1988.87-1207,1,26254,george_h_weller,,1652.373,1654.185,"Yes, they did, You Honor."
1988.87-1207,2,44084,william_burnham,,2714.429,2720.317,Thank you.
1988.87-1207,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.408,2766.267,"For an antitrust plaintiff, anyway."
1988.87-1207,2,44084,william_burnham,,2768.079,2768.408,--No.
1988.87-1207,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2769.563,2770.11,Defendant?
1988.87-1207,2,44084,william_burnham,,2770.11,2776.857,"As a matter of fact, one of the arguments that was made was that person should mean something different if it's a plaintiff than if it's a defendant."
1988.87-1207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2801.69,2804.938,Can you tell us why we have jurisdiction under the 11th Amendment?
1988.87-1207,2,44084,william_burnham,,2804.938,2806.235,"Well, Cohens v. Virginia."
1988.87-1207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2813.733,2820.465,"But, no, no, the Judiciary Act of 1789 gave us jurisdiction over those matters, and there was no 11th Amendment bar."
1988.87-1207,2,44084,william_burnham,,2820.465,2822.369,Well--
1988.87-1207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2822.369,2823.947,"The 11th Amendment says,"
1988.87-1207,2,44084,william_burnham,,2826.258,2827.493,--That's true.
1988.87-1207,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2827.913,2829.945,And I take it we're a federal court.
1988.87-1207,2,44084,william_burnham,,2829.945,2831.272,--Yes.
1988.87-1207,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2864.196,2865.04,But nobody's perfect.
1988.87-1207,2,44084,william_burnham,,2867.727,2877.379,"--In, in, in the interest of stare decisis, I would suggest, however, that that perhaps is, is, is water over the dam and has been for, for almost, almost 150 years."
1988.87-1207,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2972.839,2973.933,"Thank you, Mr. Burnham."
