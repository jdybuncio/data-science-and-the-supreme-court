1986.85-1027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.152,"We will hear arguments next in No. 85-1027, Arizona against Hicks."
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,15.463,26.146,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,161.172,162.812,Where was the number?
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,162.812,170.247,"Your Honor, the record reflects that he couldn't recall if it was underneath the stereo or behind the stereo."
1986.85-1027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,175.166,176.135,He had to move it?
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,176.135,180.15,He had to move the stereo in order to ascertain the serial number; that's correct.
1986.85-1027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,180.15,182.165,"And if it was under it, he had to turn it upside down?"
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,182.165,184.789,"If it was under it, that is correct, Your Honor, he did."
1986.85-1027,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.123,265.366,Suppose the government sets up a monster telescope across the street from my house and looked through my window to do nothing else except get the stereo number off of a stereo in my room.
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,267.256,287.186,"Your Honor, if the only information that can be conveyed from that serial number is whether or not the stereo or whatever the appliance or item that has a serial number on it is stolen, then in that respect, there is no legitimate expectation of privacy, and the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply in that respect."
1986.85-1027,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.176,313.534,I'm assuming that they have no business being in my house.
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,328.169,333.932,"--In your hypothetical, the officer does not have a right to make the observation that he makes."
1986.85-1027,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.227,338.571,That's right.
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,338.571,341.336,"In that case, then, we would say that under the Fourth Amendment--"
1986.85-1027,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,341.336,342.133,But why?
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,360.657,365.563,"--Okay, for the purposes of whether or not a legitimate privacy interest has been invaded, that is correct."
1986.85-1027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,372.698,377.822,"You couldn't have gotten the search warrant, though, could you?"
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,392.02,402.908,"Your Honor, under these circumstances, the test is, in Texas v. Brown, of whether the facts would warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that these items are stolen."
1986.85-1027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,408.561,410.873,So you couldn't have gotten a warrant to do what he did?
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,410.873,412.232,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,412.232,413.886,"And why not, if it isn't a search?"
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,413.886,416.479,"I'm sorry, I--"
1986.85-1027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,416.479,419.665,"Well, what the magistrate should say is, you don't need one."
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,419.665,423.648,"--To inspect the serial number, that's correct."
1986.85-1027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.648,428.989,"Except you'd have to... you'd say, well, I have to reenter the house."
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,434.41,440.611,"You're saying, get a search warrant to get the serial from the... the... whatever it is that's stolen?"
1986.85-1027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,451.732,452.045,Already in there.
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,452.045,452.841,And that was the situation.
1986.85-1027,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,452.841,472.803,"Mrs. Akers, to the extent that you're arguing there's no reasonable expectation of privacy in the number, I'm not sure that that argument was made below, or that it's even encompassed in the petition... question on petition for certiorari."
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,497.417,510.569,"Your Honor, it's the position of the State that the Fourth Amendment application must be decided first of all, because the Fourth Amendment is what is involved here on a reasonable, articulable suspicion case."
1986.85-1027,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,527.295,544.742,"Well, I thought the question as it was presented to us just assumed the application of the Fourth Amendment and assumed the existence of a search and a seizure, and asked us to determine a much more limited question under the plain view exception."
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,544.742,553.364,"In reviewing the cases, and especially United States v. Jacobson, we could not reach that determination, and felt it best to brief the issue."
1986.85-1027,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,592.317,594.707,"Well, I just think that's a new question, personally."
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,624.151,626.274,"Your Honor, all we are asking this Court--"
1986.85-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,626.274,630.1,"Suppose you hide your jewels under your stereo, or something like that?"
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,630.1,642.408,"--All we are asking this Court to hold is that a police officer may, on reasonable, articulable suspicion, examine the exterior of an item if something is revealed in plain view by--"
1986.85-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,642.408,647.157,"But you need not merely examine the exterior, but he must move the item in order to make that examination."
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,651.545,663.461,"--Your Honor, that's entirely possible, and that would have to be assessed under the set of criteria that would be available to the officer, and if he may then examine that in plain view, if it's contraband or what have you."
1986.85-1027,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.381,672.692,"What do you mean, ""to determine""?"
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,710.895,727.154,"I don't believe you do, Your Honor, in the respect that you can... if this Court finds that you can examine the exterior of an item in plain view for serial number or brand name, you do not have to encompass, then... for example, you mentioned a letter."
1986.85-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,753.49,761.782,"Supposing that the exterior of the stereo had a little notice on it, serial number on warranty; warranty in desk drawer."
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,765.781,768.265,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe that he can."
1986.85-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,785.587,790.412,"Do you think unplugging would be different, if they had to unplug to get at it, to turn it over, for example; would that make it bad?"
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,790.412,796.879,"Your Honor, I would defend the unplugging of a stereo, but in this case, you do not have to reach that far."
1986.85-1027,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,802.283,809.109,"You do get into that kind of question, though, once we accept what you want us to accept here."
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,820.635,823.54,The problem--
1986.85-1027,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,823.54,824.477,"It has that great advantage, doesn't it?"
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,824.477,843.533,"--The problem is that we come into cases like this where we have reasonable, articulable suspicion, which I believe is a standard that the Courts can employ to protect the Fourth Amendment interests of an individual, where the item itself is already in plain view; it has already been subject to visibility by a police officer, and that's unquestioned here."
1986.85-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.459,879.91,"But if the serial number were on the face of the instruments, so you didn't have to move it at all, you wouldn't even need the articulable suspicion, would you?"
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,879.91,880.754,"--No, Your Honor, you would not."
1986.85-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,880.754,882.549,So you've got kind of an intermediate class.
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,895.498,898.138,"That's correct, Your Honor, and we're not advocating that position."
1986.85-1027,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,899.841,900.529,Why not?
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,904.307,910.242,"--For the reason... no, I am sure about unplugging, and I would defend that to this Court."
1986.85-1027,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,940.858,949.496,"Well, Mrs. Akers, do you think the trial court in this case found the officer acted just out of curiosity--"
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,949.496,951.683,"No, Your Honor--"
1986.85-1027,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,951.683,955.072,--The trial court's finding was certainly not clear to me.
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,955.072,956.383,--The trial--
1986.85-1027,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,956.383,958.477,And it could be interpreted that way.
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,958.477,965.254,"--The trial court's finding, I believe, was not clear; I agree with you in that respect."
1986.85-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1040.146,1040.881,Let me ask one other question.
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,1059.156,1064.186,"--No, Your Honor, I would apply the same test to a situation such as you have described."
1986.85-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1064.186,1076.447,"So in this case, if the stereo might provide for some reason I can't hypothesize right now, might provide evidence that the man who owned it at that time also committed some other crime, you could still investigate?"
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,1076.447,1089.317,"If the examination of the stereo for the serial would reveal such information, then I would not make a distinction between an instrumentality, fruit of a crime, or contraband."
1986.85-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.317,1090.067,Or evidence?
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,1090.067,1090.708,Or evidence.
1986.85-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1105.624,1108.03,"No, but of course, the guns were different."
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,1116.434,1117.996,--Another item with--
1986.85-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1117.996,1119.417,With a different serial number.
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,1119.417,1121.745,"--a different serial number could indeed reveal that information, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1027,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1121.745,1134.647,"Suppose I'm walking down the street with a stereo under my arm, could a police officer come over to me and say, turn that stereo around, I want to check the serial number on it?"
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,1134.647,1156.747,"The ironic thing is, I believe, under the status of the laws that exist, under Terry v. Ohio, that an officer could stop you, that is seize your person briefly and momentarily, to ascertain some identification and explanation from you if he has reasonable, articulable suspicion, or reason to suspect that you and that stereo are evidence of some crime or criminal activity."
1986.85-1027,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1173.241,1186.235,"And your argument is that once the police are lawfully in my apartment, that they ought to be able to do the same thing to the stereo that they would be able to do on the street, were I walking about with it?"
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,1186.235,1189.779,"Absolutely, Your Honor; once they are lawfully present."
1986.85-1027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.779,1203.79,"What if you had a search warrant to search for something that could only be found in one room, for example; you knew where it was, you wanted to search the living room."
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,1217.099,1238.448,"Your Honor, if in the course of executing a search warrant, an officer has reasonable, articulable suspicion to believe that something else he may come across, and in this situation, Justice Stevens, guns may come into play here, where I am aware of cases where officers have executed drug search warrants and found an arsenal, 70, 80 guns."
1986.85-1027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.448,1238.854,Sure.
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,1238.854,1245.321,"In that situation, I believe that given the criminality that the officer may see--"
1986.85-1027,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1245.321,1245.789,Sure.
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,1245.789,1262.753,"--he might be able to... and he could reasonably articulate it, that he should be able to inspect those guns for the serial number, and ascertain whether or not they are lawfully maintained or possessed by the person who has... wherever he's executing the warrant."
1986.85-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1321.759,1333.895,"Maybe I don't recall the opinion that well, but I thought in that case we said there was a virtual certainty there was heroin or cocaine or something like that; just by looked at it in the bag."
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,1333.895,1340.471,All the officer could tell was that they had a white powder that someone was very interested in keeping protected.
1986.85-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1340.471,1345.641,Didn't we say the plain view test was equated with virtual certainty that it was contraband?
1986.85-1027,0,34079,linda_a_akers,,1345.641,1359.618,"In that case, it might well have been, Your Honor, that the officer viewing the white powder, and the circumstances in which the white powder was encased, that is, the several boxes and the tube; but they did not know conclusively that it was cocaine."
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,1706.423,1712.449,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1027,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.814,1779.923,The police apparently think they're helpful.
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,1779.923,1782.389,"Obviously, they think they're helpful."
1986.85-1027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.302,1925.552,What if he had to go up and get real close?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,1933.08,1933.674,Obviously.
1986.85-1027,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1940.516,1944.514,What if had to use a magnifying glass to bring the number out a little bit?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,1944.514,1965.647,"I'm not sure that I have a lot of problem with that either, although one of the problems in this case, and that may be presented in that situation, is, there is no connection between the reason that the officer was in this apartment and the serial numbers."
1986.85-1027,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1967.458,1982.671,"Well, I noticed the Court of Appeals went off on... at least in part on the theory that there had to be some nexus between the exigent circumstances that gave them cause to enter and the object they were examining in plain view."
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,1986.358,1987.858,--I think I do.
1986.85-1027,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1993.123,1997.542,"I hadn't thought there was a nexus requirement at all, Mr. Rood."
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,1997.542,2000.306,"--Well, I'm not sure it's nexus, or at least some--"
1986.85-1027,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2000.306,2021.204,"I thought anything that an officer, once he was lawfully on the premises, spotted in plain view, and that it was immediately apparent was evidence of a crime or contraband, was subject to seizure, whether or not it was related to the reason for entry?"
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2021.204,2034.496,"--Well, that's true, if it's contraband, or if it's immediately apparent that the object has some incriminating nature whatever, it can be seized."
1986.85-1027,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2093.737,2098.659,"Mr. Rood, any problem with the officer seizing all of the guns?"
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2098.659,2102.734,I don't think so.
1986.85-1027,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2113.858,2117.106,Were the guns seized?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2117.106,2118.7,The guns were seized.
1986.85-1027,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2118.7,2119.778,That was my recollection.
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2119.778,2120.731,"That's my understanding, yes."
1986.85-1027,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2120.731,2126.823,"Now, a bullet was fired through the floor into the apartment below."
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2126.823,2127.323,That's correct.
1986.85-1027,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2127.323,2131.836,Which justified the search under exigent circumstances.
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2131.836,2132.648,That's correct.
1986.85-1027,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2132.648,2137.708,Suppose there had been a shotgun among the weapons there?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2138.943,2145.845,I'm not sure that it could.
1986.85-1027,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2157.014,2160.949,"Well, suppose it were a sawed off shotgun."
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2163.121,2164.074,"Well, that's true."
1986.85-1027,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2178.726,2193.674,"But in a State that permitted the ownership of handguns, provided they were registered, suppose there had been no shot fired through, but the officers were there under some other exigent circumstances."
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2198.298,2204.108,"Well, they certainly might have looked at the serial numbers."
1986.85-1027,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2229.738,2234.673,So this case turns on whether or not the stereo was turned over?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2234.673,2243.389,"I think that's a crucial point of this case, that they actually went up, picked it up, and looked at the back of it."
1986.85-1027,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2243.389,2257.445,"Would the same be true of the... I think they were called a stocking mask, but suppose they had been ski masks, and the store had reported the ski masks had been stolen, could the officers have turned the ski masks over?"
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2257.445,2263.974,"Well, it would seem to me, that would depend upon who they reported it to."
1986.85-1027,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2269.019,2269.863,Just one.
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2269.863,2274.456,"I don't think they could take it, unless there was something else."
1986.85-1027,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2274.456,2275.252,Couldn't turn it over?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2275.252,2277.189,Couldn't turn it over?
1986.85-1027,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2277.189,2279.078,To see which store had sold it?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2279.078,2287.013,"Well, if in the case, they were attempting to look for guns, they might pick up the ski mask and look under it."
1986.85-1027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2287.013,2288.56,Let me give you an easy one.
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2297.242,2308.692,"I... I have no problem with that unless... well, I do have a problem with it."
1986.85-1027,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2324.106,2325.918,And contraband?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2325.918,2329.761,"And contraband, if it's... if it's in plain sight."
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.054,2376.679,"On that basis, you couldn't do a Terry stop--"
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2376.679,2377.272,Well--
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.272,2395.25,"--of somebody who is, I don't know, wearing baggy pants, and obviously secondhand clothes, walking down the street carrying a... gee, I don't know... pick the most expensive piece of personal property you can imagine, and this person is carrying it on his shoulders, and you say--"
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2395.25,2395.735,"--Well, there--"
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2395.735,2401.247,--one should not think that somebody who dresses in shabby clothes can't own the best stereo in the world.
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2403.013,2404.169,--Sure--
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2404.169,2409.323,Isn't that a reasonable... isn't that a reasonable situation to raise a suspicion?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2409.323,2413.727,--I don't think it is a reasonable situation.
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2440.888,2448.635,xxx stopping a rich man who's carrying something that's thought stolen and normally belongs to poor people?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2448.635,2450.681,"Well, I think--"
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2450.681,2451.072,"It's the disparity, isn't it?"
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2451.072,2452.571,--both situations are bad.
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2452.571,2454.946,You think both are bad?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2454.946,2456.196,Both are bad.
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.504,2470.891,"Does your case depend on my agreeing with you that there has been, not just a search here, but a seizure?"
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2482.965,2483.762,Right.
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.762,2487.932,"And you contend that that's a seizure, right?"
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2487.932,2490.321,"Well, we never had to contend that before, but yes."
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2491.728,2492.822,Suppose I don't agree with that?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2492.822,2497.29,"--Well, I think you have to get over the threshold problem of the search."
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2497.29,2502.725,The case would be the same if there's just a search but no seizure?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2502.725,2504.02,Pardon me?
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2504.02,2508.191,The case would be the same if it was just an unlawful search with no seizure?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2508.191,2517.765,"Well, I think the case would be the same if there was a search here that was illegal, yes."
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2517.765,2521.765,"Because the fruit of the search, to wit--"
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2521.765,2522.234,Right.
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2522.234,2524.56,"--the knowledge of the serial number, would be excluded?"
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2524.56,2525.122,That's correct.
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.122,2529.746,"That's a great relief, because it doesn't look like a seizure to me."
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2529.746,2535.978,"Well, as I've said, the focus of the case has never been the search or the seizure."
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2613.294,2614.357,Why couldn't you do it on the street?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2621.885,2623.305,--Okay.
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2623.305,2625.852,Seeing somebody walking down the street and obviously--
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2625.852,2627.569,Well--
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2627.569,2628.507,--Walking briskly.
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2640.784,2651.075,"--He may, on less than probable cause, if he has some basis, stop the person, briefly, to determine who he is, where he's going."
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2653.856,2656.417,Could he... could he ask for the identification number of the stereo?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2656.417,2657.573,"--Well, he could ask."
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2659.837,2660.572,He could ask?
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2662.289,2664.835,"That would be our position, right."
1986.85-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2666.444,2671.848,"--He could ask the person to turn the stereo around, if the person said, sure."
1986.85-1027,1,32707,john_w_rood_iii,,2673.613,2675.222,"If it goes that far, yes."
1986.85-1027,2,34079,linda_a_akers,,2930.028,2930.95,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1986.85-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2987.477,3013.998,"Mrs. Akers, what do you answer to Mr. Rood's point that even if you can persuade us that this is analogous to a Terry stop, all that you'd be allowed to do on the basis of an articulable suspicion in a Terry stop is ask for the individual's name, ask him to identify himself and give an account of why he's there or whatever?"
1986.85-1027,2,34079,linda_a_akers,,3038.209,3048.517,"In a Terry stop, the individual can be stopped under suspicion for identification and information, or response to questions about the suspected criminal activity."
1986.85-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3048.517,3050.079,"Right, and what if he says, I don't want to answer?"
1986.85-1027,2,34079,linda_a_akers,,3050.079,3062.777,"And that is encompassed within the serial number of the stereo unit, as opposed to... I mean, an inanimate object doesn't respond to questions, so he wouldn't have the option, I guess, of not responding."
1986.85-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.777,3064.871,Supposing he's carrying a stereo on his shoulder.
1986.85-1027,2,34079,linda_a_akers,,3071.024,3078.475,"If he has reasonable, articulable suspicion that there's criminal afoot, then he could investigate that criminal activity, and if it involved a stereo, he could."
1986.85-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3078.475,3082.318,"And the individual says, no, I won't turn it around."
1986.85-1027,2,34079,linda_a_akers,,3084.754,3085.863,Then at that point--
1986.85-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3085.863,3087.112,What can the officer do then?
1986.85-1027,2,34079,linda_a_akers,,3087.112,3096.984,"--Either arrest him, or decide that the information that he had and the information that he got from the suspect was such that he didn't feel that it should be pursued further."
1986.85-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.984,3099.028,"But to arrest him, he would need probable cause, wouldn't he?"
1986.85-1027,2,34079,linda_a_akers,,3101.434,3102.621,"Yes, Your Honor, if he's refusing--"
1986.85-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3102.621,3105.885,So an articulable suspicion does not get him the identification number?
1986.85-1027,2,34079,linda_a_akers,,3105.885,3114.772,"--The articulable suspicion will allow him to do the further investigation, which is to stop the man and ask him the questions that you have proposed."
1986.85-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3114.772,3115.882,"And if he gets a ""no"", that's the end of it?"
1986.85-1027,2,34079,linda_a_akers,,3115.882,3133.782,"And if he gets a ""no"" or answers that do not lead him to a logical conclusion, that he can explain his presence at the suspected criminal activity, the scene, wherever he is, then in that circumstance, that could be considered by the officer in making a determination as to whether to arrest or not."
1986.85-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3133.782,3135.032,"Thank you, Mrs. Akers."
