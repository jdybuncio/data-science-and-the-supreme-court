1969.101,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.671,"Number 101, City of Chicago against United States and 102, same parties."
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,18.622,21.98,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.101,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,132.503,137.203,"I understand, what you mean is you think it's illegal?"
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,137.203,138.043,"Well, the question we have --"
1969.101,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,138.043,142.155,You have reason to save question about unfairness.
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,142.155,145.63,I just thought I mentioned the word unfairness since it's come up today.
1969.101,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,156.537,158.477,"Well, that's quite a different argument."
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,158.477,167.257,"The appellants here today are seven regulatory commissions, one state, nine communities, three labor organizations, and one railroad passenger association."
1969.101,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,311.861,317.711,And does that -- do you concede that that if no investigation is initiated by the Commission?
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,317.711,318.621,"No, I don't think that that --"
1969.101,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,318.621,322.702,"Within this period, then do you concede that that's the end of it?"
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,322.702,324.055,"No, and I don't think so."
1969.101,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,324.474,329.08,I thought we decided that in the New Jersey case in 358 U.S.
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,329.08,329.328,Right.
1969.101,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,332.448,335.428,"Yes, but nonetheless it was a decision on the merits."
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,335.428,342.032,"Well, we don't first to answer question, we don't concede it and the Government in its brief does not consider."
1969.101,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,342.475,343.618,They don't?
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,343.618,346.741,"No, I think they use the word patent abuse."
1969.101,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,363.249,364.744,And in that case?
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,364.744,365.759,"In that case, he was --"
1969.101,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,365.759,367.713,Work type.
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,367.713,369.168,That's right it was work type.
1969.101,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,380.697,382.438,Did that case come here?
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,382.438,389.551,"And that case, did come here, he reversed on other grounds."
1969.101,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,392.034,392.821,Yes.
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,392.821,394.379,And before Section 1381 --
1969.101,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,394.379,396.043,I thought that was a West Bank at the Hudson District?
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,396.043,396.267,Right.
1969.101,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,452.991,463.01,But your argument there if I'm mistaken in thinking that your argument in no way depends upon that issue?
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,463.01,464.214,That's right.
1969.101,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,477.992,492.731,That's your opponent argument but your argument in no way depend -- you could concede as I understand your argument at least that failure of the Commission to hold a hearing and then discontinuance of the service is non-reviewable and still make basically the argument you are making.
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,492.731,494.579,"Yes, because --"
1969.101,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,494.579,496.637,Which is the mutuality argument and --
1969.101,0,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,496.637,510.476,Right and I point out that Section 1336 (a) of Title 28 says that you can go to court for any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the question is whether in order to discontinue an investigation is such an order now.
1969.101,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,627.643,628.624,Mr. Shapiro.
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,628.624,632.359,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.101,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.098,682.614,"I thought you argued Congress intended to put up within the discretion of the agency hence, accepted from review?"
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,682.614,686.576,"No, Your Honor, I don't think that Congress did intend to put this --"
1969.101,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,686.576,689.683,"Well, what about the decision to investigate it all."
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,689.683,692.873,The decision to investigate it all rest on a slightly different basis.
1969.101,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,692.873,694.614,Well that is within the discretion of the agency?
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,694.614,696.143,That is within the discretion of the agency.
1969.101,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,696.143,697.452,Non-reviewable.
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,697.452,698.953,And is non-reviewable.
1969.101,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,698.953,701.308,So you agree with the New Jersey case?
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,701.308,703.436,We agree with the New Jersey case.
1969.101,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.436,706.04,But once you start on taking investigation.
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,706.04,707.709,Once an investigation is under your can't --
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,707.709,711.055,They can't even though you discontinue it?
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,717.656,723.261,Now let me turn to that order because I think that's really the heart of our problem here.
1969.101,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,723.261,725.991,"There wouldn't have been any need for an order, they can just quit over time, right?"
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,725.991,727.836,That's right.
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,750.194,751.761,What's the second page Mr. Shapiro?
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,751.761,752.643,"67, Your Honor."
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,752.643,753.296,Thank you.
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,753.296,759.956,Those orders were entered after a full hearing on the merits.
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,778.529,778.615,Oh!
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,781.103,781.369,Oh!
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,783.048,787.928,And if you did then the Railroad simply discontinue the challenge?
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,787.928,792.615,The Commission â€“ it is conceivable the Commission might find that it opened its investigation improvidently.
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,792.615,793.32,I see.
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,793.32,805.703,But in this situation and in most situations it goes all the way through with the full administrative hearing in which it applies the substantive standard of Section 13 (a) (1).
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,805.703,814.418,Do you think maybe there may be some other situations besides opening decision to open the hearing where review wouldn't be have?
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,818.132,819.084,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.101,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,831.966,837.5,What would be the judicial remedy to continue the investigation?
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,837.5,839.138,The judicial remedy for?
1969.101,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,839.138,847.462,Suppose the court thought the Commission was wrong assume that it is reviewable what would be the judicial remedy?
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,847.462,853.721,To set aside the Commission's order and to ban the case to the Commission --
1969.101,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,853.721,854.583,To continue the investigation?
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,854.583,862.434,-- and in effect to be discontinuing those --
1969.101,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,862.434,864.559,Has he ordered any discontinuance?
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,866.767,872.388,The Commission would have to reopen the matter and to make a redetermination looking toward a direction to the railroad --
1969.101,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,872.388,874.625,Start anew and renew the investigation?
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,874.625,878.54,Renew the investigation and -- cause if the court sets aside the Commission's decision.
1969.101,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,878.54,879.435,"Well, let's start."
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,894.455,902.417,"But the discontinuance if I can get back to these two orders, the discontinuance is based upon the commission's findings of fact that --"
1969.101,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,902.417,903.522,I understand that.
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,903.522,907.124,And those findings in fact apply to substantive standards of the act.
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,907.461,922.545,"I understand that but what I'm trying to get at is on judicial review, of this order, as I understand it, a few of the court disagree with the Commission's discontinuance of the investigation."
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,929.471,930.642,That is exactly what would happen.
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,930.642,931.971,That's all that will happen.
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,934.204,937.382,That would depend on the nature of the remand.
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,974.374,980.667,"Well, I think if you think then that as soon as they started an investigation, the standards of the Act take over."
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,988.009,989.057,That is correct.
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,990.186,997.341,Although the Act really puts the standard on only in the event they want to order the trains to be continued.
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,997.341,1001.956,"Well in determining whether they should be investigation of course, they have to consider the standards of the Act."
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1023.272,1036.263,"But tell me this Mr. Shapiro, I gather that Congress enacted this law as I recall it out of some impatience with the delays in getting trains to discontinue, was it?"
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1036.263,1037.26,That is correct.
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1037.26,1048.248,"Where properly railroad should be allowed to discontinue service they were all tied up with the state and other Commission hearings and everything else, and sometimes years went on before they succeeded, is that it?"
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1048.248,1049.373,That is the purpose of the statute and that's what the Congress certainly --.
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1049.373,1050.323,"Well, that's what the Congress is concerned."
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1054.543,1059.642,"It contemplated an expedited procedure not necessarily a summary one, that's why they proposed a four months limit."
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1059.642,1066.074,"Well, isn't it summary to the extent if the Commission decides not to investigate as I understand it?"
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1073.347,1074.581,"Yes, it does."
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1097.555,1101.482,And then of course the other thing is that you got only four months back when you do investigate them.
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1101.482,1107.557,The Commission can take more than four months but its suspension of the Railroad's discontinuance.
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1107.557,1108.139,Only four?
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1108.139,1112.375,Its only four months and the Commission endeavors to wind this proceedings up rapidly --
1969.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1112.375,1115.119,"None of those things that's unfair, is it?"
1969.101,1,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,1115.119,1118.897,It boils down in a sense to a fairness question.
1969.101,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1462.236,1464.137,Mr. Hoeland.
1969.101,2,30980,james_w_hoeland,,1464.137,1467.991,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.101,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1550.396,1559.858,What happens Mr. Hoeland if the hearing proceeds and the decision is not to stop.
1969.101,2,30980,james_w_hoeland,,1563.52,1584.885,It is indeed Your Honor because the Interstate Commerce Commission can prevent the discontinuance of an interstate train only on the finding by the Commission that a public need exist for the train and that it is not an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce for the train to be continued.
1969.101,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1841.296,1847.866,How do you distinguish that from let's say its non-approval or disapproval.
1969.101,2,30980,james_w_hoeland,,1847.866,1857.995,I distinguish that Your Honor on the -- with respect to perhaps a Section 13 (a) (2) proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission.
1969.101,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2343.181,2344.107,Thank you Mr. Hoeland.
1969.101,3,25780,gordon_p_macdougall,,2357.834,2360.913,I'd like to just mention one or two things.
1969.101,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2464.824,2469.427,Does the statute require findings before an order of discontinuance?
1969.101,4,30980,james_w_hoeland,,2470.06,2474.886,"The statute requires that the -- well, let's put in the other way."
1969.101,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2524.432,2526.134,Thank you gentlemen for your submissions.
