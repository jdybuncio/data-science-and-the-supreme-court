1960.561,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,138.45,147.785,"May I ask you in that connection please, Mr. Williams, under your law, was that testimony, and in the event of a new trial, re-admissible against him?"
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,147.785,154.558,"It is my understanding, Your Honor, that it is."
1960.561,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,194.107,195.327,Has that been changed since --
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,195.327,198.561,"Yes, Your Honor, a couple of years ago."
1960.561,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,212.677,215.701,"What is the felony under Texas law, is that --"
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,215.701,217.006,"Penitentiary offense, Your Honor."
1960.561,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,217.006,217.595,Penitentiary.
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,220.001,220.044,I believe --
1960.561,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,220.044,220.617,-- the date --
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,220.617,220.652,-- I believe that's correct.
1960.561,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,220.652,226.165,-- the date of entry of the felony?
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,226.165,227.294,Now --
1960.561,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,227.294,239.611,"They imposed that the sentences for (Inaudible) let's say a years, are to not (Inaudible)"
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,239.611,268.376,"I believe, and I'm no expert in criminal matters, Your Honor, not experienced, but I believe that the offenses in our penal code where the penalty is prescribed read more or less uniformly like the provision under which this man was convicted."
1960.561,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,317.354,320.869,I understand you to say that the new Texas statute --
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,320.869,320.895,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.561,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,320.895,328.818,-- (Voice Overlap) the appointment requirement to appoint a counsel to felony.That's (Voice Overlap) --
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,328.818,345.275,"To clarify the situation, if I may, on page 5 of my brief, I call your attention to the statutes which were in effect at the time of this petitioner's trial which was 1944, Article 491 and 494."
1960.561,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,451.997,463.758,"Well, this much is clear, Mr. Williams, that had he been tried within the last couple of years on the offense for which he was convicted, the revised 494 would have required the appointment of counsel, is that so?"
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,463.758,467.49,"That's my understanding, Your Honor."
1960.561,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,730.299,730.306,On your brief?
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,730.306,732.241,There were six witnesses produced by this --
1960.561,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,732.241,733.336,On your brief?
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,733.336,733.845,I beg your pardon.
1960.561,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,735.016,735.498,Of the record.
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,735.498,739.783,The record.
1960.561,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,984.859,998.818,"Mr. Williams, may I ask you whether if he had the (Inaudible) defense lawyer in Texas, could those questions be subject to objection if it's inadmissible or improper?"
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,998.818,1009.869,"In -- in my opinion, Your Honor, they would have been excludable under decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeals."
1960.561,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1037.778,1042.915,Do they care if they came and say excludable?
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,1051.966,1075.589,"I think that the Court of Criminal Appeals would have said that it was the duty of the trial court to prevent that line of questioning, and I think I have one or two cases cited in my brief, though the exact name of them escapes me, in which that type of interrogation by the Court was -- was held to have been excludable and should have been excludable on the Court's own motion."
1960.561,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1075.589,1082.782,Before you (Inaudible)
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,1082.782,1086.48,"Now, what could a lawyer have done with regard to this confession?"
1960.561,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1111.564,1120.7,"Did I understand your suggestion, Mr. Williams, the whole proceeding governing the admissibility of the confession was in the presence of the jury, there was it?"
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,1120.7,1121.86,"It was indeed, sir."
1960.561,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1121.86,1123.682,And may have -- may --
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,1123.682,1131.915,"Under the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeals, it should have been -- should heard, it should have been heard initially outside the jury's hearing."
1960.561,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1131.915,1135.142,"This requires a request of it, of the trial judge?"
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,1135.142,1136.615,"Yes, it does, Your Honor."
1960.561,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1136.615,1140.72,But -- but there must be one otherwise may be heard in the presence of the jury?
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,1140.72,1144.332,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1960.561,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1144.332,1147.183,And your point is that had he had counsel --
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,1147.183,1147.38,First --
1960.561,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1147.38,1150.092,-- it might suppose the request would've been made for a hearing on the presence of the jury.
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,1150.092,1151.418,Indeed.
1960.561,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1243.047,1252.775,What is the explanation of the long delay 15 years before this proceeding was brought (Inaudible)
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,1252.775,1256.709,"Well, Your Honor, I do not honestly know."
1960.561,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1281.188,1282.435,Lucky color.
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,1282.435,1286.975,I don't know [Laughs] I don't why it's taking him so long.
1960.561,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1609.483,1610.16,Mr. Williams --
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,1610.16,1610.554,Sir?
1960.561,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1610.554,1623.567,"-- suppose that should happen on hearing that there was evidence that the Court believed that at trial is petitioner refused counsel, would that make any difference?"
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,1623.567,1629.553,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that would -- would amount to a waiver of his federal right."
1960.561,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1629.553,1635.025,How do we know what the facts are in that respect from this record?
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,1635.025,1646.786,"Well, I believe we have concessions from the respondent that didn't -- didn't make any difference whether the man asked for counsel or not."
1960.561,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1673.202,1673.381,Mr. Timmins.
1960.561,0,38444,percy_d_williams,,1673.381,1683.943,Thank you.
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,1683.943,1687.283,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.561,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2025.286,2044.603,"First, we're -- we're not concern here with the ultimate question as to whether there was lack of due process or not, we're concern with is whether the context of this record, the situation was such that he was prejudiced by not having him a counsel."
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2044.603,2047.616,I think we are concerned with -- with that --
1960.561,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2047.616,2047.904,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2047.904,2055.246,-- question whether he was prejudiced and as a result of his prejudice whether he was denied due process.
1960.561,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2055.246,2055.635,Yes.
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2055.635,2060.793,"I -- I think it follows the -- the second question, yes, sir."
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2062.091,2069.213,"Well, would you -- you wouldn't consider that a denial that he had beat him without mercy, would you?"
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2095.664,2106.07,"It -- I would -- I would say that in the context of the question, Your Honor, it was -- it was a denial that he jerked him out of the car in Louisiana."
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2117.274,2129.307,"Well, but -- but just before that, the petitioner said, ""Well, you beat me up across in Louisiana,"" and the answer was, ""I never touched you over there."""
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2129.307,2129.525,"Yes, sir."
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2129.525,2149.681,"And -- and the next question was, ""I have scars to prove it on my back,"" and the answer is, ""I ain't touched you but once,"" and then we get to that question, ""You jerked me out of my car over Louisiana state highway, no Louisiana law, just you and two kids and beat me up without mercy."""
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2155.768,2169.578,"It is -- it is not a denial that -- I would say that -- that replaying to the question, as I asked, it was a denial that he jerked him out of the car over in Louisiana."
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2189.464,2201.977,"But the question was, ""I have scars on -- that -- to prove it on my back,"" and the answer says, ""I ain't touched you but once,"" is that -- would you consider that a denial or any?"
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2201.977,2204.212,A denial of the beating?
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2204.212,2205.878,Yes.
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2205.878,2214.446,I would consider -- I would consider -- I can't -- I can't import an absolute denial to that answer.
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2421.564,2424.99,"Well, didn't -- didn't they have a full opportunity?"
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2443.599,2446.495,"Your Honor, I was not speaking of the time of trial."
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2451.36,2453.234,I see.
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2453.234,2460.139,"At -- at a much later time that habeas corpus is -- is sought, not at the time of trial --"
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2460.139,2461.159,"Oh, I see."
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2461.159,2461.296,-- was --
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2461.296,2461.592,I see.
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2461.592,2462.458,-- was my reference there.
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2462.458,2464.29,I see.
1960.561,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2464.29,2467.227,Is Hop Williams the same as (Inaudible)
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2467.227,2468.08,Sir?
1960.561,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2468.08,2471.904,"Is the man named Hop Williams, is he same (Inaudible) witness, Clyde --"
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2471.904,2472.752,Clyde Williams.
1960.561,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2475.631,2476.405,The same man.
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2476.405,2478.409,"Apparently, it's the same man, yes, sir."
1960.561,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2478.409,2486.84,Your contention is on the later testimony when he (Inaudible) back on the stand that he claimed the -- the details of what he did (Inaudible)
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2486.84,2495.533,"Yes, sir, that -- his -- his earlier testimony and later testimony must be read together."
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2540.086,2548.826,"Did the man -- did this man try to get into the federal court, I mean into the state courts to have this matter heard before this proceeding?"
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2548.826,2550.183,Before this proceeding?
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2550.183,2550.902,Yes.
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2550.902,2554.41,"I find no record of it in the Court of Criminal Appeals, Your Honor."
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2556.128,2557.553,"Well, is that the place for him to go?"
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2557.553,2561.009,That is -- that is the place that he would go.
1960.561,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2571.397,2579.493,Of the -- in the writ -- is the writ tried in the Court of -- in your Court of Criminal Appeals or do they sent it back to a lower court?
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2579.493,2597.793,"The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals would order the trial court to send the record up, and they would then examine the record in the case to ascertain whether there had been a denial in -- in the trial court."
1960.561,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2597.793,2617.981,"And if they have to -- they wouldn't -- they would act on the record of the trial court rather than it's too substantially as I believe, whereby the appellate court is asked to leave to send the case for determination of their claims so far as their contested facts at lower court."
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2617.981,2622.863,"They would -- my understanding, Your Honor, is that they would act on the record of the lower court."
1960.561,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2632.942,2635.874,"Yes, well, I -- I misunderstood your answer to the Chief Justice."
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2652.613,2663.323,"After the conviction, the application for writ of habeas corpus may be lodged with the trial court and then an appeal may be made and then an application may be lodged with the Court of Criminal Appeals."
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2668.255,2676.733,But can you say that he made no effort to bring this to the attention of any court in Texas for this long period of time?
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2676.733,2690.297,"So far as I was able to discover from the record of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, his -- his first -- his first application was made last year."
1960.561,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2690.297,2691.731,(Inaudible)
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2691.731,2692.592,"Yes, go ahead."
1960.561,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2692.592,2695.421,"I -- I think the Chief Justice, may I ask question after that."
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2695.421,2706.224,"Well, there -- what other courts in the State would have had jurisdiction over habeas corpus or coram nobis or whatever it might -- might be?"
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2706.224,2706.963,The trial --
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2706.963,2711.923,"After he -- after he's convicted and was in the penitentiary, what other courts --"
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2711.923,2711.978,No other --
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2711.978,2713.779,--- than the Court of -- of Appeals?
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2713.779,2714.788,"No other court, Your Honor."
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2714.788,2716.121,But you just told us that --
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2716.121,2716.802,The trial court --
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2716.802,2717.145,-- the trial court.
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2717.145,2728.98,"-- after conviction, immediately after conviction before sentencing, immediately after conviction, there could have been an application for habeas corpus to the trial court."
1960.561,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2740.02,2740.461,Yes.
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2741.618,2742.073,"Yes, sir."
1960.561,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2743.018,2750.02,(Inaudible)
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2750.02,2770.065,"The trial judge would consider it in either granted or denied at that time, as I understand it, Your Honor, and then -- and then after sentencing, after sentencing and -- and the man was in the penitentiary, then the application would be lodged directly with the Court of Criminal Appeals."
1960.561,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2770.065,2771.811,And only that.
1960.561,1,18120,b_h_timmins_jr,,2771.811,2772.473,And only that.
1960.561,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2772.473,2773.1,And only that.
