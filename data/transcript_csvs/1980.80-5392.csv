1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.342,We'll hear arguments next in Robert Howe v. Attorney General.
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,64.834,68.144,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-5392,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,124.622,126.715,What was Mr. Howe convicted of?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,126.715,128.621,He was convicted of first degree murder.
1980.80-5392,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,128.621,139.631,And do you have any answer of your own as to what would be the proper and suitable correctional treatment for him?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,139.631,147.581,"Well, I think that the 2nd Circuit's view is reasonable, that his incarceration is not for treatment at all but simply for deterrence."
1980.80-5392,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,147.581,156.561,"Well, do you think... in other words, you think that it must be treatment of some sort?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,156.561,158.733,Yes.
1980.80-5392,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,164.981,185.128,"What if the Vermont penal authorities decide that no amount of treatment can ever rehabilitate this person, that he's simply got to be locked up for a good long time in order to keep him from doing it again."
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,185.128,191.141,"Well, they are certainly entitled to that and then Mr. Howe is their problem."
1980.80-5392,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,204.089,209.727,But you say the federal system has no right to receive him under these circumstances.
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,209.727,210.274,That's right.
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,212.196,220.645,Did I hear you correctly to either say or imply that there is some legal obligation to treat him?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,220.645,228.141,I think there is an obligation to treat him so long as he is in the federal system.
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,228.141,240.887,"Why do you make it any different when it's in federal custody as a surrogate for the state, than when he is in the state custody with the state doing it on its own behalf?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,240.887,252.117,"Well, a prisoner committed to state custody is simply committed to the Commissioner of Corrections or to the prison system for whatever purpose imprisonment may serve."
1980.80-5392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,260.378,261.816,"That is, after a federal criminal trial."
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,261.816,264.158,After a federal criminal trial; precisely.
1980.80-5392,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,277.918,284.666,Would it be your submission that absent this statute there would be no authority to receive a state prisoner at all?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,284.666,285.322,Yes.
1980.80-5392,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,285.322,288.102,Why would that be?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,288.102,295.022,"That would be because of Section 4001 of Title 18, which prohibits imprisonment except pursuant to an act of Congress."
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,304.204,307.173,But 5003 isn't limited to treatment.
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,316.402,317.027,That's correct.
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,317.027,319.042,"It doesn't, it isn't limited to treatment?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,319.042,319.605,"No, it's not."
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,319.605,322.089,"Well, I was waiting for you to say it."
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,322.089,323.353,Pardon?
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,323.353,325.117,I was waiting for you to say it.
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,326.82,332.13,"Well, let's look at the face of 5003."
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,385.952,387.124,Was that done in this case?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,387.124,388.139,"No, it wasn't."
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,400.103,401.993,"Well, couldn't that be facilities for treatment?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,401.993,408.74,"--Well, that's not the Government's position and it's not the state's position, and--"
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,408.74,411.271,Answer my question; it's my question.
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,411.271,417.55,"--I don't think that the Bureau... no, I don't think it could be construed as that."
1980.80-5392,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,424.937,437.869,"Looking at the same subsection (a) that you've just been reading from, the Attorney General may,"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,465.437,477.04,"Justice Rehnquist, we agree that this statute is talking about transfers of inmates to federal prisons, and clearly custody is involved."
1980.80-5392,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,552.636,568.925,"The language of Subsection (a) does outline the purposes for which the Attorney General may receive them and it's custody, care, subsistence, education, treatment, and training."
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,568.925,570.238,That's correct.
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,581.452,582.53,Not necessarily.
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,592.681,597.398,"Well, I guess I should take that back."
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,600.46,602.273,Some food.
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,603.74,608.755,Inmates here are not invited for custody.
1980.80-5392,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,610.77,627.73,"Well, but the reading of the statute, it seems to me, it's particularly phrased in the... with the ""and"" as it is, would include custody as a separate facet."
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,627.73,634.118,"All these are incidentals, necessary incidentals to--"
1980.80-5392,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,634.118,637.211,You're really sitting on that first certification?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,637.211,638.882,--We think that's crucial.
1980.80-5392,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,640.414,642.631,And we don't have to get beyond that?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,642.631,662.45,"Well, the only way the statute could work is if it had something like the broad custody, care, subsistence, education clause in it, otherwise the Federal Government would only be in charge of the treatment aspects and everything else would be up in the air."
1980.80-5392,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,717.023,720.663,"Mr. Nelson, it's entirely a different question."
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,731.394,735.532,"No, this case solely concerns the power of the Federal Government to accept custody."
1980.80-5392,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,735.532,750.322,"So, if there's any... you're suggesting, though, is if Vermont had entered into a contract, say, with New Hampshire, for New Hampshire to take over while they remodeled their prisons or something like that, that your client could attack the New Hampshire authority to accept the prisoners?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,750.322,752.446,"No, no, we're not claiming that."
1980.80-5392,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,752.446,758.772,"Well, how do you get standing to attack the Attorney General's authority to spend federal funds in housing your client?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,758.772,764.582,We assert a right not to be incarcerated by the United States Government.
1980.80-5392,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,764.582,778.609,"Well, but isn't it arguable, at least, that you're really being incarcerated by the State of Vermont and they in effect have entered into a contract to have the Federal Government perform that state function for them during a temporary period?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,778.609,780.826,"No, I don't think that's arguable."
1980.80-5392,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,783.842,789.822,"But in the first question about Vermont and New Hampshire, it seems to me you're suggesting you could not challenge New Hampshire's custody."
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,796.821,797.414,--That's correct.
1980.80-5392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,797.414,799.898,Because of that statute.
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,799.898,800.663,That statute.
1980.80-5392,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.663,806.738,"The question is whether you're being detained by the United States, within the meaning of that statute, or whether he was still being detained by Vermont."
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,811.017,814.625,Even by... by contract they could; yes.
1980.80-5392,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,814.625,816.546,So that who is the detaining authority?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,818.124,821.31,The detaining authority is the Federal Government.
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,844.191,845.986,Could the Federal Government release him?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,845.986,847.065,Pardon me?
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,847.065,850.736,Could the Federal Government release him?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,850.736,851.158,No.
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,851.158,854.266,So who is he in the custody of?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,859.623,863.965,"In a legal sense, perhaps, he's in Vermont's custody."
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,863.965,867.838,"Well, are we interested in any sense other than a legal sense?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,867.838,877.647,"Yes, I think in the sense intended, in a real sense, in a sense intended by 4001, he is imprisoned by the United States."
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,882.02,883.254,Is it legal?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,883.254,884.378,We say it's not.
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,884.378,887.705,So he's not in the legal custody of anybody.
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,895.734,897.841,"He's not demanding freedom, Your Honor."
1980.80-5392,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,901.278,907.338,"Well, isn't that almost a case of damnum absque injuria, as we learned in law school?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,918.412,921.192,"Well, no, that's not true."
1980.80-5392,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,948.759,959.177,Why is your client going to be better off being imprisoned in the state penitentiary in New Hampshire than he is in the federal penitentiary at Terre Haute?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,959.177,960.458,"--For one thing, he'd be closer to home."
1980.80-5392,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,982.573,986.072,"Well, he wouldn't be seeing much of Vermont, would he?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,993.74,996.661,"I don't think the record shows it but he does, yes."
1980.80-5392,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,996.661,1000.629,So that visitation is a possible consideration?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1000.629,1002.893,Visitation is a major consideration.
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1040.363,1053.45,Are not the records at the federal prison maintained on the conduct and behavior of the prisoner and all of the factors that go into whether a prisoner is going to be eligible for parole?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1053.45,1054.388,--Certainly.
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1056.746,1069.023,Is there anything in the Vermont Constitution or statutes that requires that Vermont prisoners convicted in Vermont courts be kept in custody within the boundaries of the state?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1069.023,1069.757,No.
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1069.757,1078.378,"Then, they, theoretically, they could send them to Devil's Island if they wanted to, couldn't they, if there were such a place now?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1078.378,1082.189,"Under constitutional restraints, yes."
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1082.189,1088.717,That's why you focus on the power of the Federal Government to receive rather than the power of the Vermont court to transfer?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1088.717,1089.623,That's correct.
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1098.01,1111.63,What can 5003 mean if it doesn't mean that the federal system will help absorb... say... prisoners on request and use its unused capacity?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1114.645,1123.829,"Well, I think the legislative history shows that it was passed for inmates with specialized needs, treatment needs."
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1129.015,1131.327,What does the language of the statute tell us?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1136.386,1137.011,"--That's true, that's true."
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1155.114,1169.39,"Well, but the core of this statute, if you want to talk about the core of it, is that the Federal Government can make available, Congress has said the Federal Government can make available unused space in its institutions for state prisoners."
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1169.39,1173.029,"--That is... well, one independent clause says--"
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1173.029,1178.572,"Well, why do you have to parse, the particular words in order to discern that meaning?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1178.572,1187.959,"--It may do that, it may make federal prison facilities available when there are adequate and proper treatment facilities and personnel available."
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1225.756,1228.959,Where are the words that lead you to that conclusion?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1228.959,1229.38,--Pardon?
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1229.38,1230.051,Where are the words?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1233.441,1241.985,"Oh, I think the words ""treatment facilities"" in common speech means, among other things, mental hospitals or hospitals."
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1241.985,1245.765,It may mean that to you but it doesn't mean that necessarily to everyone.
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1245.765,1246.687,"No, perhaps not."
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1247.796,1256.136,"Adequate treatment means, do they have the space, do they have the facilities to take on more inmates?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1256.136,1257.854,--What does treatment mean?
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1261.353,1264.649,Are you suggesting that treatment means only treatment for a mental problem?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1264.649,1266.602,"--No, I'm not, I'm not arguing that."
1980.80-5392,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1293.106,1300.368,"In common speech, treatment is not necessarily synonymous with custody, is your argument, really, in answer to the Chief Justice?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1300.368,1301.165,"--No, that's correct, that's correct."
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1303.899,1309.459,Is there any treatment in the Vermont prisons that's not available in the federal prisons?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1309.459,1316.175,"--The record seems to say, no, that the facilities are about equivalent in both places."
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1316.175,1317.331,Equivalent?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1317.331,1319.001,"Yes, that the same types--"
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1319.001,1320.719,What do you have in Vermont like Springfield?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1320.719,1321.453,--Pardon?
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1321.453,1328.809,What does the prison system in Vermont have similar to Springfield in the federal prisons?
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1328.809,1331.465,There is a... there's a state hospital--
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1331.465,1333.152,It would the whole state of Vermont.
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1333.152,1337.198,--There is a state hospital and--
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1337.198,1338.712,"Oh, sure, but is it the equivalent?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1338.712,1340.228,"--Oh, it's not as good, I'm sure."
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1340.228,1343.383,"Well, that was my question; equivalent."
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1343.383,1346.429,"Well, I misinterpreted it."
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1346.429,1349.802,"If Congress takes the word ""treatment"" out would you give up?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1349.802,1350.599,Yes.
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1498.1,1519.453,"Are you suggesting, do I take the argument to mean that this institution does not have a medical unit, for example, to deal with people who become ill, or that they have no facilities to deal with a person who has alcoholic tendencies when he arrives, although surely he couldn't become an alcoholic after he got there?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1519.453,1521.014,Perhaps.
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1521.014,1521.966,Perhaps.
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1521.966,1528.994,"No, certainly the facilities are available in the institution, but they're not available to Mr. Howe."
1980.80-5392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1531.916,1541.395,"And maybe, as... there's just no treatment for him except custody."
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1541.395,1542.661,--That's conceivable.
1980.80-5392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1543.489,1547.768,In which case it's your claim that he cannot be transferred to a federal facility.
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1547.768,1548.205,That's correct.
1980.80-5392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1548.205,1552.47,"The first question in this case is whether or not there's a private right of action, isn't there?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1552.47,1554.843,"Well, the Government raises that here the first time."
1980.80-5392,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1556.0,1558.234,"But isn't that the first, threshold question?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1558.234,1561.091,"That is a threshold question, but I don't think it's a substantial one."
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1561.091,1570.54,"In other words, you're here challenging, as you said earlier, not the authority of Vermont to send him but the authority of the Federal Government to receive."
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1570.54,1571.102,That's correct.
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1571.102,1579.817,"Where is your standing, your client's standing to challenge what the Federal Government is doing, even though it's holding him in custody?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1579.817,1584.862,"Our stand... we assert standing under 4001, Title 18."
1980.80-5392,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.985,1603.401,"How have you brought the... you've asserted jurisdiction under 1346, and you do claim that you have a right rooted in 4001, I take it."
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1612.288,1621.737,"Well, these issues have been raised by habeas corpus, but it's habeas not seeking absolute freedom but seeking a change in custody."
1980.80-5392,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1621.737,1624.846,"Well, I know, but you are claiming that your custody is illegal."
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1624.846,1625.221,That's correct.
1980.80-5392,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.221,1636.185,"By the United States and I suppose if you could claim, at least you have the right to habeas corpus whether you have the right under 4001 or not."
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1636.185,1637.904,"Yes, it could have been brought that way."
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1637.904,1642.73,"Well, is not 18 U.S.C. 5003 an act of Congress?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1642.73,1645.728,"It certainly is, but we say it doesn't cover this case."
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1652.366,1654.974,"Solely because of the word ""treatment""?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1654.974,1655.396,No.
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1659.55,1664.534,"You told me, I said, if we took the word ""treatment"" out would you be out?"
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1665.44,1665.673,"I said, yes."
1980.80-5392,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1665.673,1667.188,So you have changed.
1980.80-5392,0,45730,william_a_nelson,,1668.516,1681.355,"Well, Justice Marshall, if we take the word ""treatment"" out, then transfers would be authorized where there were adequate and proper facilities and personnel available, and then we would have no case."
1980.80-5392,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1685.462,1687.18,Very well.
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1690.725,1709.764,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-5392,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1847.069,1857.204,But why then does the statute require that the Director shall certify that proper and adequate treatment facilities and personnel be available?
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1857.204,1859.173,"Well, there are a couple of answers to that."
1980.80-5392,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1944.482,1948.278,"No, no, his implied right of action comes from a different section, I think."
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1948.278,1948.918,--4001?
1980.80-5392,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1948.918,1949.356,Yes.
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1949.887,1951.917,"Well, either of those."
1980.80-5392,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1961.086,1970.191,"Well, that's the argument on the merits, but there's a threshold question about whether or not there is a right of action to bring the lawsuit such as the one that was brought here, which was not habeas corpus."
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1970.191,1970.582,--Right.
1980.80-5392,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1990.932,1995.384,What's your normal remedy in habeas?
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1995.384,1996.4,Transfer.
1980.80-5392,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1997.196,1997.868,Transfer?
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1998.946,1999.54,--No.
1980.80-5392,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2002.679,2006.692,"But the normal remedy of habeas corpus, the normal request, is for release."
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2006.692,2013.955,"--The normal request is for release, but it has been employed in cases in which the prisoner is complaining that he's in the wrong place."
1980.80-5392,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2013.955,2015.5,That he's detained illegally?
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2015.5,2016.0,Yes.
1980.80-5392,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2033.447,2047.472,"It would seem to me that 4001(a), the purpose of that section must have been to give a citizen who is detained by the United States not pursuant to an act of Congress a remedy."
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2050.455,2055.219,"Well, the legislative history of 4001(a) is very specific."
1980.80-5392,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2085.972,2094.265,"Well, in other words, what you're saying is that a citizen who is detained by the United States not pursuant to an act of Congress ought to have a remedy in court to get out?"
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2094.265,2096.734,That's what petitioner is saying.
1980.80-5392,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2096.734,2097.341,What?
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2097.341,2098.357,That's what the petitioner--
1980.80-5392,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2098.357,2098.92,"Well, that's what you're telling me too."
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2107.448,2115.21,"--Well, but when we look to see whether a private right of action is available we look at more than the language of the statute itself."
1980.80-5392,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2115.21,2119.319,"No, but the first thing we look at, what group does it confer a benefit on?"
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2132.391,2148.65,Except that the legislative history makes clear that the persons for whom they were concerned and to whom they wanted to give a right of action were those that were being detained without conviction only upon a probable cause of engaging in some sort of illegal activity.
1980.80-5392,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2196.474,2228.507,"Let's assume that a state, a given state, not Vermont, had a provision in its criminal statutes governing its institutions, that any prisoners on coming in would be examined and classified, and if they were found to have particular problems, for example, alcoholism and emotional disorders, then the statute would provide in that state, shall receive treatment for such condition."
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2250.968,2258.73,That's a much closer question and I think in that case there might be an expectation created by state law.
1980.80-5392,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2258.73,2262.198,"Well, the Congress in passing 5003--"
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2262.198,2263.431,Did not use that.
1980.80-5392,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2263.431,2269.772,--I would think must be assumed to have taken into account that perhaps some states do require some kind of treatment.
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2283.798,2285.235,"No, no, I don't think so."
1980.80-5392,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2452.949,2459.555,"But, of course, you would agree, would you not, that prior to 1952, when this statute was passed, that was the situation?"
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2463.334,2480.735,"Well, I'm not sure that at that time the Executive Branch could have entered into those contracts with the states because 4001 was not passed until 1971, so I don't think there would have been anything to stop the Federal Government from doing it."
1980.80-5392,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2480.735,2488.964,Do you think that the Executive Department would have the power to do it if it weren't for 4001?
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2488.964,2490.09,"Yes, I believe so."
1980.80-5392,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2512.91,2516.251,"Could I interrupt you, just to go back to that question I asked before?"
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2523.359,2524.281,--I don't know.
1980.80-5392,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2524.281,2534.245,"So apparently the states did find some other way to solve these emergency problems, because I assume there were problems from time to time where state facilities got into trouble."
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2536.994,2544.069,"That may have been, but I also think that the overcrowding problems that the states have been having have been escalating; I don't know at what stage they were--"
1980.80-5392,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2544.069,2549.301,"Well, there's nothing in the legislative history of this statute that suggests it was enacted to handle the overcrowding problem, is there?"
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2549.301,2559.391,"--No, there isn't specifically, but as I mentioned before, I think the gist of it is that if the Federal Government has a surplus and a state has a need, then those should be matched."
1980.80-5392,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2560.718,2569.622,"Well, but, there is history that your opponent cites to the effect that the Federal Government was developing special programs such as for alcoholics and drug addicts and youth corrections and the like."
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2569.622,2570.293,"--Oh, we had that."
1980.80-5392,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2570.293,2572.526,Contemporaneously with the enactment of this statute.
1980.80-5392,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2572.526,2577.76,"Well, the legislative history doesn't indicate that we were developing them at that time."
1980.80-5392,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2675.454,2679.375,We'll resume there at 1 o'clock today.
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,2715.921,2719.154,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-5392,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2775.85,2792.937,"Mr. Easton, I take it nobody disputes the statement in the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit that Vermont, as contemplated in the agreement in 1975, closed its only maximum security prison?"
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,2792.937,2795.092,"That's not in dispute, Justice Rehnquist."
1980.80-5392,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2795.092,2800.185,"You do have agreements with other states, don't you?"
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,2800.185,2800.887,That is correct.
1980.80-5392,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2811.227,2816.552,Which would allow Vermont to carry on its present regimes--
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,2816.552,2817.333,That is true.
1980.80-5392,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2817.333,2819.488,--Even though the federal prison system were not available to you.
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,2819.488,2840.059,"One of the considerations, though, Justice Stewart, is that just looking at the other New England states, most of those states, they themselves have the same problems that Vermont has, overcrowding, lack of humane facilities, facilities just not equipped to deal with prisoners such as Mr. Howe."
1980.80-5392,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2840.059,2844.073,"But New Hampshire, for example, I think, has a maximum security institution."
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,2844.073,2846.821,"That it does, and we have a compact with them."
1980.80-5392,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2846.821,2850.867,"Well, doesn't that extend also to some of your educational facilities?"
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,2865.174,2869.499,"Certainly it exists in veterinary school and, I believe, medical school."
1980.80-5392,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2871.139,2872.311,Vermont has its own law school now.
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,2872.311,2872.624,It does.
1980.80-5392,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2872.624,2874.638,But it's not state-sponsored.
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,2874.638,2875.388,That's correct.
1980.80-5392,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2941.33,2955.215,"I suppose the legal question is, say we agree with you, that it'd be a very good idea for the Federal Government to take over a large portion of these state responsibilities, but the question is whether Congress has authorized it, isn't it?"
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,2955.215,2964.477,"--We're not unmindful of the fact that if there's an entitlement, that then under the federal statute that we have to meet that entitlement for Mr. Howe."
1980.80-5392,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2996.073,2997.556,"Well, that really isn't quite his argument."
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,3006.569,3009.505,"--Yes, I think the court below found--"
1980.80-5392,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3009.505,3013.348,The Federal Government isn't just going into the business of making their facilities available on a wholesale basis.
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,3013.348,3029.295,"--As the court below found, Justice Stevens, even if some of the same activities and programs were available in Vermont, they're less accessible to Mr. Howe because of his need for maximum security incarceration."
1980.80-5392,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3091.098,3104.343,I take it that your friend's position would be the same if the federal institution to which the transfer was made were 200 yards away from your closed institution in Vermont.
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,3107.341,3109.091,"I do, Your Honor, and also--"
1980.80-5392,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3109.091,3114.166,"It isn't the cut-of-state factor, it's the transfer to a federal institution."
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,3114.166,3122.693,"--Well, petitioner's counsel said he wants to be in Vermont, but the statute which he challenges--"
1980.80-5392,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3122.693,3126.005,"That's a little sweeping for the argument, perhaps."
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,3128.098,3130.502,"--I think, perhaps."
1980.80-5392,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3130.502,3140.249,"But his legal claim would be the same, as the Chief Justice suggests, if the federal facility were 200 yards away from the state facility."
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,3140.249,3145.06,"I think, regardless of where the federal facility is--"
1980.80-5392,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3145.06,3147.107,Yes; the issue is the same.
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,3147.107,3147.763,--That's correct.
1980.80-5392,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3173.189,3180.889,"Well, the claim certainly is that there's a statutory right not to be in the custody of the Federal Government."
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,3186.263,3187.074,--Perhaps I stated it wrong.
1980.80-5392,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3196.851,3201.693,"Well, you can call it what you want to, but he says that my custody by the United States is illegal."
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,3214.407,3234.805,"--First of all, he's not of course challenging Vermont's statute, he's challenging the federal statute and the federal statute has been found to say that we're talking about care and custody and subsistence and education and treatment and training, and he is challenging the treatment aspect, trying to give that a primacy that it doesn't deserve."
1980.80-5392,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3234.805,3246.035,"But Mr. Attorney General, actually, basically, as my brother White suggests, he's challenging his detention by the federal authorities as illegal in violation of the laws of the United States, isn't he?"
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,3246.035,3246.816,He has to.
1980.80-5392,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3247.285,3250.283,Does that have anything to do with whether he has an entitlement?
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,3250.283,3257.844,"--He has to have some basis on which to challenge his custody, and he's challenging the basis in the statute under 5003."
1980.80-5392,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3257.844,3265.355,"Yes, his challenge is that laws of the United States expressly say you can't do this, you cannot deliver me to a federal authority."
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,3265.355,3269.587,He's attacking 5003 and his attack on 5003--
1980.80-5392,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3269.587,3271.541,He's invoking 5003.
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,3271.744,3272.057,--I'm sorry.
1980.80-5392,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3277.477,3290.691,He's claiming it under that the Federal Government may not have custody of this prisoner unless there is some other law that authorizes it.
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,3290.691,3294.564,"--And then we get to 5003, which he invokes, as Justice Stewart suggests--"
1980.80-5392,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3294.564,3300.077,His claim isn't on 5003; his claim is on 4001.
1980.80-5392,2,30129,john_j_easton_jr,,3300.077,3300.499,--Okay.
1980.80-5392,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3481.363,3483.3,"Just a few points, Your Honor."
1980.80-5392,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3483.3,3494.155,"Do you think Vermont can't make some other entity a surrogate, including a private corporation?"
1980.80-5392,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3523.47,3525.002,Out of the state?
1980.80-5392,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3525.002,3525.938,Anywhere.
1980.80-5392,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3531.717,3541.01,I can't point to anything in Vermont law which would prohibit that but I don't feel confident in saying that it would be authorized either.
1980.80-5392,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3680.235,3684.749,"Well, couldn't special cases mean Alcatraz?"
1980.80-5392,3,45730,william_a_nelson,,3684.749,3707.928,"It could, but it was, the Deputy Attorney General said that it mostly related to juveniles, and I think he was referring to the YCA, which had been passed in the previous Congress, that the 82nd Congress made the YCA available to the states, as well as other treatment facilities."
1980.80-5392,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3708.988,3713.253,"Very well, thank you, gentlemen."
