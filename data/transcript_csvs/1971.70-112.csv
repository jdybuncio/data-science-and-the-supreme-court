1971.70-112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.907,"70-112, Groppi against Leslie."
1971.70-112,0,44206,william_m_coffey,,10.243,13.586,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,91.066,98.368,Was the petitioner taken in to custody in the house itself where the disorder was --?
1971.70-112,0,44206,william_m_coffey,,98.368,99.319,No your honor.
1971.70-112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,105.595,111.194,"What I was asking, was there any effort to take him into custody at the time he was on the floor?"
1971.70-112,0,44206,william_m_coffey,,111.194,113.938,None at all.
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1552.272,1554.859,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1670.713,1672.409,What is the problem?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1686.356,1687.216,"I am not sure, I understand --"
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1687.216,1687.782,You do not.
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1691.57,1693.456,Oh! I am sorry.
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1695.895,1701.099,"If a Judge had one Judge, but did you tell me if legislative is there?"
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1701.099,1702.004,This was --
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1702.004,1703.896,How many House members are there?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1703.896,1705.501,There are a hundred.
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1705.501,1713.032,"Well, do I assume that it is no different from other legislature, you never had a hundred on two days in a row."
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1713.032,1717.029,There is a presumption of a regularity of the legislative proceedings.
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1717.029,1719.188,That all hundred are there?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1719.188,1725.722,"That there were sufficient numbers there and that those who voted witnessed the content, the condemnations conduct."
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1725.722,1727.993,Where they have assumed.
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1727.993,1731.49,This is a presumption that has been acknowledged by this Court.
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1731.49,1734.453,"Well, how many was there the day the act occurred?"
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1734.453,1735.889,I have no idea.
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1735.889,1738.701,Why should not I know?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1738.701,1745.498,Only if the question had been raised as a factual a question in this habeas corpus proceeding.
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1761.513,1772.549,"I assumed that someone that second day only knew what happened by hearsay and that they were not present the day it happened, but they did both?"
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1772.549,1774.474,I do not think that assumption can be made.
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.02,1783.297,Considered regularity mean that there are hundred people there everyday?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1783.297,1783.929,No.
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1783.929,1785.306,You do not assume that.
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1785.306,1785.702,No.
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1785.702,1788.342,Please do not ask me to assume it.
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1788.342,1792.381,All I am saying is that there is presumption of regularity of legislative proceedings.
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1792.381,1794.456,"Well, that is not what is before me now."
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1802.894,1804.266,Yes sir.
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1804.266,1809.136,"Well that regularity, I can assume things in to that?"
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1809.136,1810.807,I think until the question is raised.
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1813.996,1815.033,Raised by whom?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1815.033,1816.208,Raised by the --
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1816.208,1819.087,Are you trying to uphold this or not?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1819.087,1820.475,"Yes, Sir."
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1820.475,1822.312,"Well, I am asking the question?"
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1832.144,1836.158,No.
1971.70-112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1836.158,1844.443,There is a presumption I suppose only that there was a quarrel on each day or something of that kind.
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1844.443,1853.244,I think there is such a presumption and I think there is a further presumption that has been acknowledged by this Court as a presumption of the regularity of proceedings.
1971.70-112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1853.244,1853.472,Well.
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1853.472,1854.291,Which would include --
1971.70-112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1854.291,1867.601,But as my brother Marshall says that the presumption of regularity certainly does not embrace the presumption that every single one of the 100 legislators within a hall on each of the 2 days that has nothing to do with the presumption of regularity.
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1869.607,1870.509,Majority.
1971.70-112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1870.509,1880.207,"So 51 could have been there on one day and 51 the next day and this means that of the two days, it would only possibly have been one person who was there both days."
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1880.207,1884.925,That is possible.
1971.70-112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1915.732,1935.259,"Well, I thought the whole point of the petitioner's second preposition was that until there was a detailed statement of what the alleged content consisted of that people voting on the contempt would have known what it was and the implication of that is that there were not there."
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1937.813,1941.697,I do not understand that to be petitioner's argument that maybe what he is driving at--
1971.70-112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1941.697,1945.328,That is by implication what his argument has to depend upon?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1945.328,1959.618,I interpreted petitioner’s argument to be that the resolution failed to State sufficient probable cause as this Court has interpreted probable cause and this appears in Judge Kiley (ph) dissent in the Court of Appeals.
1971.70-112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1959.618,1976.506,It sets forth mere conclusion and fails to set forth any underlying facts and circumstances which constitute the alleged contemptuous behavior and I assume that the implication of that whole argument is that there where people who voted on this who did not see this with their own eyes.
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1981.42,1981.714,I have never—
1971.70-112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1981.714,1984.473,I thought that point did raise the factual issue.
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,1984.473,1988.585,I have never understood that to be petitioner’s argument.
1971.70-112,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2200.853,2205.159,(Inaudible) to expressly authorize --
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2205.159,2207.773,"Yes, it had."
1971.70-112,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2207.773,2210.492,That is not the 13.72?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2210.492,2212.24,"Yes, 13 that is what I am referring to."
1971.70-112,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2212.24,2219.263,"Well, this applied only in the case of one, actually a judge guilty by the house?"
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2219.263,2221.434,"Yes, I am sorry Mr. Justice Brennan."
1971.70-112,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2236.014,2237.007,Under the general statute?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2237.007,2237.852,"Yes, under general statute."
1971.70-112,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2237.852,2241.02,But federal statute is expressed is it not?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2241.02,2241.235,Yes.
1971.70-112,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2241.235,2247.484,It authorizes reference expressly in the case that contempts found by the house.
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2252.214,2259.92,"It is, and what I should say is Wisconsin has no parallel to that statute."
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2259.92,2265.952,Was it -- the disorderly conduct at this time on same about same business?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2265.952,2266.333,No.
1971.70-112,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2266.333,2267.761,Or is that a different affair?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2267.761,2273.337,"That the arrest was made, as I remember was made at the later time."
1971.70-112,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2273.337,2275.352,For conduct occurring where?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2275.352,2278.009,On the assembly floor.
1971.70-112,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2278.009,2280.257,That it was the same conduct?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2280.257,2283.167,"Yes, the same conduct."
1971.70-112,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2283.167,2285.989,Your response I think was a little confusing.
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2285.989,2286.401,I am sorry.
1971.70-112,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2286.401,2288.286,Just to make sure we have it clear.
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2299.9,2301.198,Exactly the same.
1971.70-112,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2301.198,2306.164,And that is the case that ended in a mistrial and it was followed by dismissal?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2306.164,2308.582,That is correct.
1971.70-112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2319.565,2322.693,It was just under a charge he had been not convict?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2322.693,2324.407,That is correct.
1971.70-112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2334.971,2339.731,"There the charge still hanging over him now, would it?"
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2339.731,2344.734,Conceivably there could be a charge under section 13.27 of the statutes.
1971.70-112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2344.734,2347.431,There was a mistrial but it was charge ever dismissed?
1971.70-112,1,42166,sverre_o_tinglum,,2347.887,2350.794,It was dismissed.
1971.70-112,2,44206,william_m_coffey,,3327.886,3341.305,"Mr. Chief Justice, the inquiry, the respondent has preceded that the summary contempt power is very great power subject to abuse."
1971.70-112,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3434.304,3449.27,"Mr. Coffey do you suggest that judicial review of a legislative contempt determination would be available, for example on the weight of the evidence or just on procedural regularity?"
1971.70-112,2,44206,william_m_coffey,,3449.27,3459.548,I would suggest Mr. Chief Justice that it has to be available on both or there would be no basis on which to check the arbitrary exercised power by the legislature.
1971.70-112,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3459.548,3478.806,What you are suggesting on is that the judicial branch would have the power to re-determine the fact as distinguished from passing merely on procedural regularity of the contempt process?
1971.70-112,2,44206,william_m_coffey,,3478.806,3481.864,I think that is essential Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-112,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3494.964,3495.144,Very well.
