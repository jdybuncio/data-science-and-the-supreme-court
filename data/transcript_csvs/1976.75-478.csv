1976.75-478,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,51.682,"We will hear argument next in number 478, Parker Seal Company against Cummins."
1976.75-478,0,34110,leonard_h_becker,,54.251,58.425,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1976.75-478,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,321.73,328.289,"Mr. Becker, I take it that there is no question as to the employees’ sincerity of his belief."
1976.75-478,0,34110,leonard_h_becker,,330.175,335.465,That is correct Mr. Justice Blackmun; no issue as such is presented on this record.
1976.75-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,376.936,385.417,"When you say voluntarism Mr. Becker, there is really nothing voluntary about what the employer is doing. He is being required to do it by an Act of Congress."
1976.75-478,0,34110,leonard_h_becker,,385.417,393.95,I quite agree and I would say that Mr. Justice Rehnquist that that is a point of great force for us on both statutory and constitutional points of this case.
1976.75-478,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,425.296,431.594,"In that connection, who has the burden of proof to come up with alternative solutions?"
1976.75-478,0,34110,leonard_h_becker,,431.594,444.887,"Under the regulation and under the statute both, the Courts have held that the burden rests with the employer to show the prima facie issue of the reasonableness of the accommodation or the “undo-ness” of the hardship."
1976.75-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,588.062,605.484,Do you not think this Court would be apt to take the judgment of the Court of Appeals on of a kind of ad hoc factual basis in an individual case where the test is reasonably accommodate rather than to second guess the Court of Appeals on the facts of the case?
1976.75-478,0,34110,leonard_h_becker,,605.484,611.07,"Well, I would assume, Mr. Justice Rehnquist that this Court would not wish to be put in the position of second guessing facts."
1976.75-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,690.422,693.287,"It was submitted on a written record though to the District Court, was it not?"
1976.75-478,0,34110,leonard_h_becker,,693.287,694.206,That is correct.
1976.75-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,705.47,714.612,"But you do not have in this case than any question of the tried, the Federal District judge’s evaluation of credibility of oral testimony?"
1976.75-478,0,34110,leonard_h_becker,,714.612,715.863,I agree Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1976.75-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,907.803,910.272,"Now, is this a statutory argument you are making or constitutional?"
1976.75-478,0,34110,leonard_h_becker,,910.272,930.218,"This is part of my statutory argument Mr. Justice Rehnquist and I am stressing the difference between the basic Anti-discrimination provision of Title VII, with which this Court has previously dealt and the very different accommodation provision which the definitional section added in 1972 and the EEOC guideline required."
1976.75-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,930.218,946.073,"But just because they are different, does that not suggest that there is going to be an element of discrimination against the people who observe the Sabbath on the Sunday and that type of people who practice the religion of the majority?"
1976.75-478,0,34110,leonard_h_becker,,946.073,950.703,That is a point which I will address and develop on my constitutional argument.
1976.75-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,953.407,957.839,"Well then, it does not seem to me to help your statutory argument very much?"
1976.75-478,0,34110,leonard_h_becker,,957.839,959.961,I am merely explaining.
1976.75-478,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1109.826,1116.926,It is fully concerned with aiding the pre-exercise or privilege?
1976.75-478,0,34110,leonard_h_becker,,1116.926,1130.217,"It is an attempt by Congress to force the employer to make accommodations or to permit the employee to engage in one kind of activity, which is religious activity."
1976.75-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1175.801,1178.483,But the statutory language is certainly broader.
1976.75-478,0,34110,leonard_h_becker,,1188.38,1189.929,That is correct under the statute.
1976.75-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1434.241,1439.511,What do you do with cases like McGowan against Maryland and that group that holds Sunday closing lawns?
1976.75-478,0,34110,leonard_h_becker,,1439.511,1444.662,Well those cases present their own difficulties.
1976.75-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1503.174,1514.039,"But Senator Randolph’s comment, I do not think can be attributed to all the other 99 senators and however many members of Congress that is who voted on that day?"
1976.75-478,0,34110,leonard_h_becker,,1514.039,1517.312,"It certainly is cannot be imputed to the law, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1976.75-478,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.249,1547.747,But what the legislature said is contained in the law that it passed sometimes in the committee report.
1976.75-478,0,34110,leonard_h_becker,,1553.03,1561.199,"I agree with that completely of course, but if we look to the words of both the guideline and the statute, there again the problem is presented."
1976.75-478,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1581.14,1584.223,Very well Mr. Becker.
1976.75-478,1,42796,thomas_l_hogan,,1586.189,1589.291,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1976.75-478,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1782.585,1788.875,"That is not uniformly true everywhere, these rates of one-and-a-half and the double?"
1976.75-478,1,42796,thomas_l_hogan,,1788.875,1800.367,"No but, in this particular factual situation, I say it is uniformly that most businesses operate on Saturday versus Sunday, if they got the choice between the two."
1976.75-478,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1800.367,1808.542,"Well, this is a society in which that has been the overwhelming tradition for more than 300 years, is it not?"
1976.75-478,1,42796,thomas_l_hogan,,1808.542,1837.631,"Well, yes Mr. Chief Justice and I think that is why Congress passed this statute was to protect the minority Sabbatarians of this country because of the fact that without this amendment or without the application of Griggs to the original Title VII prescription, there really is no benefit to Sabbatarians or to people who practice a religion that is not of the majority."
1976.75-478,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1837.631,1848.676,"Must the employer accommodate every religion, every religionist, including those who have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday?"
1976.75-478,1,42796,thomas_l_hogan,,1848.676,1855.941,"Well, I think the important thing is in the amendment of course, it is not applied just to Sabbath worship."
1976.75-478,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2028.096,2033.739,Was it not in the testimony that he did not live up to his promise?
1976.75-478,1,42796,thomas_l_hogan,,2033.739,2037.98,"Well, the question was he volunteered on numerous instances."
1976.75-478,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2528.755,2532.608,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1976.75-478,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2609.969,2612.467,"Of course Griggs was dealing with employment tests, was not it?"
1976.75-478,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2612.467,2638.948,It was dealing with employment tests that had a disparate impact in that case on the basis of race and the question was whether the tests were sufficiently related to the business needs of the employer to be a fair measure of employment opportunities or whether the disparate consequences were a violation of basic prohibition.
1976.75-478,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2677.018,2682.088,"Well, your case would be more difficult, would it not Mr. Wallace, if you did not have the 1972 amendment?"
1976.75-478,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2688.685,2708.948,"Well, our point is that the 1972 amendment really represents a reasonable legislative solution to the question of how do you determine when a practice has the forbidden consequence of an employment practice that discriminates on the basis of religion."
1976.75-478,3,34110,leonard_h_becker,,3606.258,3611.419,"If it pleases the Court, unless there are questions by the Court, I have nothing to add to my prior statement."
1976.75-478,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3611.419,3619.379,What if the Civil Service Commission had adapted precisely this sort of a regulation to be applicable to the government agencies?
1976.75-478,3,34110,leonard_h_becker,,3623.701,3638.876,"There I think once again Mr. Justice Rehnquist we would be in the posture that the government in order to avoid an infringement upon free exercise, would have to make allowances, but that is because it is the government, which is the employer in that case and I believe the Civil Service has adapted…"
1976.75-478,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3638.876,3643.649,Your client has certainly has no establishment clause or free exercise clause.
1976.75-478,3,34110,leonard_h_becker,,3661.116,3663.892,"Well, there are several points to be made in response."
1976.75-478,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3738.754,3749.183,"Mr. Becker, have any of the cases in this area involve situations where the accommodation required a violation of a collective bargaining agreement?"
1976.75-478,3,34110,leonard_h_becker,,3749.183,3758.075,Yes Mr. Justice Powell there are cases which I believe are now pending in this Court on certiorari which involve questions arising in such circumstances.
1976.75-478,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3758.075,3763.101,"Or in the Circuit which raise the question, but I do not think it is involved in the case directly."
1976.75-478,3,34110,leonard_h_becker,,3771.771,3795.311,"TWA case does, the question is reserved, I hesitate for this reason Mr. Justice Powell, the question is specifically reserved by the Court of Appeals in TWA, although you have before the Court a petition from the Union, which says that the question cannot possibly be reserved because in order to carry out the mandate of the Court of Appeals it would be necessary to alter the seniority agreement which the company has with the Union."
1976.75-478,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3815.308,3819.658,That I think that in the Yacht against the North American Rockwell Company.
1976.75-478,3,34110,leonard_h_becker,,3819.658,3836.316,"Well in Yacht, I believe the case is returned to the District Court, if I recall it correctly to consider whether it is possible that an employee who declines his Union dues can nonetheless somehow or rather be accommodated."
