1998.97-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We'll hear argument next in No. 97-1985, Neder v. United States."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,42.993,47.029,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,68.394,72.429,"The first question is the one that we reserved in our Johnson opinion, is it not?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,72.429,73.529,"It is, Your Honor."
1998.97-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,81.802,82.552,And it was a plain error?
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,82.552,83.987,--it was a plain error case; that's correct.
1998.97-1985,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,83.987,87.206,"May I ask you, before you go on with number one."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,89.474,90.458,That was the plan.
1998.97-1985,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,90.458,91.058,Okay.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,102.616,106.269,"Justice Scalia, I assume you're referring to the phrasing of the question presented."
1998.97-1985,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,126.064,126.397,Not in dispute.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,134.003,134.336,--Yes.
1998.97-1985,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.305,139.622,Not the cent... it wasn't the focus at all?
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,139.622,141.674,I would... I would agree with that.
1998.97-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.292,157.767,"Indeed, if it goes back for some reason, if we agree with you and it's retried, you don't really think the government's going to have any trouble proving materiality, I assume?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,157.767,166.705,"--I don't... I don't believe that, on a retrial, that materiality would be a central focus of any defense to the tax fraud charge."
1998.97-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,190.488,191.588,Let me just... let me just be sure I understand.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,193.773,200.927,"--The judge explicitly stated on the record that the question of materiality was for the court to decide, not for the jury to decide."
1998.97-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,200.927,203.896,"So, he didn't tell the jury to make a finding of materiality--"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,203.896,204.512,What--
1998.97-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,204.512,206.013,"--I mean, he didn't direct the jury to do that?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,206.013,211.567,--What he told the... he did not tell the jury that the court had found materiality.
1998.97-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,221.173,224.809,And what was what he told them even on the tax count?
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,224.809,225.425,That's correct.
1998.97-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,225.425,228.677,Where materiality is mentioned in the statute.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,228.677,230.213,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1998.97-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,248.174,260.315,"Well, what if the district court, instead of omitting to charge the jury at all on materiality, had given it an erroneous charge on materiality would that, too, be not subject to harmless error review?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,260.315,272.273,That would depend upon whether or not the misinstruction on the element was sufficiently serious that the jury did not in fact find the actual element beyond a reasonable doubt.
1998.97-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,272.273,281.712,"So, then, we really... no... no... no court would know in advance, no court of appeals would know in advance without... it's a case-by-case analysis in your view?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,281.712,282.498,We agree with that.
1998.97-1985,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,296.471,304.827,"But under your test, in answer to the Chief Justice's question, that would... the jury would have found those facts despite the misinstruction."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,315.885,317.218,--What the jury found--
1998.97-1985,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,317.218,324.372,Why didn't the jury in fact find in this case all of the circumstances necessary to show materiality?
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,324.372,326.824,"--The jury did not, Justice Kennedy, and for this reason."
1998.97-1985,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,356.26,360.247,Was there evidence as to the amount of the tax that was avoided or the approximate amount?
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,360.247,362.03,"--The... yes, there was."
1998.97-1985,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,373.338,378.708,I'm not sure of the difference between the case we have before us and the hypothetical given by the Chief Justice.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,392.216,394.068,--The functional difference is this.
1998.97-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,433.962,444.168,"Well, so then, then, there will be very little subject to harmless error review even if it's an erroneous instruction rather than, under your view, even rather than an omission?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,444.168,447.886,We don't believe that it would have that type of broad effect for two reasons.
1998.97-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,461.88,471.318,"Well, let's talk about Johnson, because that's a case where the Court found there was plain error and there was a failure to instruct, and we applied harmless error analysis."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,471.318,477.389,"In Johnson, there was no contemporaneous objection to the instructional error."
1998.97-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,499.303,504.29,"So, had there been no objection here, we would be in a Johnson situation?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,504.29,505.456,"That's exactly correct, Justice O'Connor."
1998.97-1985,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,505.456,517.431,"Well, why... if that is so, why couldn't we say just what the court said in Sullivan, that there's really nothing for us to operate on, we can't speculate on what the jury would have found?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,518.914,536.844,"Well, in... in the... I think the key point... I want to make sure I understand your question, Justice Kennedy... we believe that what you just said in terms of Sullivan is exactly correct, and that in this case there is nothing that the harmless error scrutiny can operate on, since there was no complete verdict on every element of the crime."
1998.97-1985,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,552.104,554.973,"Mr. Rubinstein, I don't understand that there isn't this functional equivalent."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,574.684,577.636,"--I don't believe it is, Justice Ginsburg, for a couple of reasons."
1998.97-1985,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,598.55,606.405,"Well, were they instructed in such a way that in order to return a verdict of guilty they had to find that the amount charged in the indictment was in fact the understatement?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,606.405,612.809,What they had to find was that there was in fact false information in the tax return--
1998.97-1985,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,612.809,613.392,And did they have to--
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,613.392,614.025,--and that it was willfully misstated.
1998.97-1985,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,614.025,621.915,"--And did they have to find that the false information was... was the information charged... in other words, an understatement of... what was it... several million dollars?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,621.915,628.319,I believe that there would have been... the jury would have been instructed as to what it was that was... was alleged in the indictment.
1998.97-1985,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,628.319,628.785,Right.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,641.042,655.302,"Because the jury was not... in order to take that next step, to make the finding of materiality, the jury would have to find that what it was that was misstated in the tax return would have a natural tendency to influence the audience to which it is addressed."
1998.97-1985,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,658.838,662.64,But you... you don't... you don't disagree with Justice Souter... with what Justice Souter said.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,677.632,678.217,Well--
1998.97-1985,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,678.217,681.453,The jury found an amount which was material.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,687.273,691.975,--We don't believe that the jury found... what the jury found was an amount.
1998.97-1985,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,695.177,696.843,And you acknowledge... you acknowledge the amount is material?
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,696.843,699.479,"--Well, we would agree that the element--"
1998.97-1985,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,699.479,701.145,"So, the jury found an amount which was material."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,703.847,704.631,--That's correct.
1998.97-1985,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.631,705.383,That's your objection.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,705.383,706.033,That's correct.
1998.97-1985,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,706.033,707.899,Could the jury have found anything else?
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,729.581,732.283,"Well, I'd like to answer that in two ways."
1998.97-1985,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,733.15,735.318,"Well, how about yes or no first?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,735.318,741.889,"--Well, I'll answer that I believe the jury... I don't believe that a jury could not have found materiality had it been instructed to consider it."
1998.97-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,752.947,754.297,That's not what the Court held in Sullivan.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,762.885,767.623,"--Well, we actually do have here, at the end of the day, the same error that was--"
1998.97-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,767.623,769.956,"Well, but you're... you're talking about what the holding was in Sullivan."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,771.241,773.527,"--Actually, we don't believe that we did."
1998.97-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,786.168,788.768,But Sullivan didn't involve charges on the elements of the crime at all.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,788.768,790.036,--That's true.
1998.97-1985,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,798.725,799.191,But why?
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,868.453,868.905,Yes.
1998.97-1985,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,868.905,875.226,"--it will create confusion about when, indeed, you have just misinstructed and when you haven't instructed at all, et cetera."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,879.043,891.585,"The reason, Justice Breyer, is that this Court has never allowed harmless error review to occur when the jury did not itself actually find every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt."
1998.97-1985,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,891.585,893.537,I'm sure you're right in quoting the cases.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,923.372,924.756,The reason that removal--
1998.97-1985,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,924.756,927.441,"In effective assistance of counsel, I mean, you know, a lot of things."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,927.441,941.668,--The reason that removal of an element from the jury's consideration must be regarded as one of the small class of structural errors is because the error in that case is that the wrong entity has served as the finder of fact on the element that was removed.
1998.97-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,954.142,957.88,"Well, supposing you take a mis... a misinstruction rather than a failure to instruct."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,963.097,967.068,"Well, I think the analysis there would be akin to what this Court said in Pope."
1998.97-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,992.034,995.838,"Well, but that, in itself, is a very confusing standard, I think."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,995.838,996.405,Well--
1998.97-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,996.405,1008.728,"I mean, if... if we adopt your view, we're opening up to new trial not just failure to instruct at all, but all sorts of misinstruction, it seems to me."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1008.728,1012.93,"--I think... well, on that last point, Mr. Chief Justice, the--"
1998.97-1985,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1012.93,1015.566,Only where there's been objection.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1015.566,1016.116,--That's correct.
1998.97-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1028.309,1031.261,"Well, supposing there's... there's a fair... it's a fairly debatable point."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1036.813,1038.415,I'm sorry.
1998.97-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1038.415,1050.138,"There are all sorts of Federal statutes that may have debatable points in them, that a trial judge may say, I don't agree with the defendant or I don't agree with the prosecution."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1057.426,1078.056,"Well, even... even in the case where it is debatable, if the objection is made at trial, the judge believing it to be a debatable question, refuses to give the correction instruction, and, on direct review, it is determined that the correct element was not actually found by the jury, it would require a new trial."
1998.97-1985,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1078.056,1083.626,"But it's not clear to me what the reason, the underlying rationale, for your... for your argument."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1102.523,1116.498,"The reason, Justice Kennedy, is that, as this Court held in Gaudin, the most important component of the right to a jury trial is to have only the jury serve as the finder of fact, and to have only the jury serve as the judge of guilt or innocence."
1998.97-1985,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1134.292,1138.88,"Well... well, I suppose... I suppose you could say that it's... it's wrong to have a coerced confession submitted to the jury."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1140.898,1156.175,"No, in a... in a coerced confession case, you would have a jury verdict on every element of the crime, and the court would have the jury's actual findings to use as a backdrop to assess whether or not the error in fact was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."
1998.97-1985,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1156.175,1156.808,What--
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1160.21,1163.729,"Roy was a case... was a State case, a habeas case."
1998.97-1985,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1163.729,1164.097,I know.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1184.309,1190.296,I believe that in Roy there was in fact a misinstruction on the element of intent.
1998.97-1985,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1191.681,1192.431,"Oh, why isn't it?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1196.2,1196.417,--Well--
1998.97-1985,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1196.819,1199.102,But does... does it matter... does it matter to you?
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1199.102,1200.771,It does not matter to us.
1998.97-1985,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1200.771,1201.154,It doesn't matter to you?
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1201.154,1201.904,It doesn't matter.
1998.97-1985,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1201.904,1204.556,"I mean, it may be a difficult question but, as far as you're concerned, it's irrelevant."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1204.556,1210.107,"Either way, the analysis is the same, in terms of determining whether or not the error is subject to harmless error review."
1998.97-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1236.791,1240.312,"But, Mr. Rubinstein, I really don't think your argument squares with the Court's holding in Pope."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1240.312,1253.369,--Pope was a case in which this Court found that the jury's finding on the misinstructed obscenity instruction was functional equivalent to the correct element.
1998.97-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1253.369,1265.01,"No, they concluded by saying, if on remand, the Illinois court can... concludes that no rational jury, if properly instructed, could find value in the magazines, the conviction should stand."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1265.01,1265.494,Right.
1998.97-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1285.924,1287.108,"Of course, that's now what Pope itself says."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1287.108,1288.325,That's correct.
1998.97-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1288.325,1288.725,Okay.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1288.725,1296.815,"And I think the... the key was that, in Pope itself, this Court explained that the jury was not precluded from considering the element of obscenity."
1998.97-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.087,1318.995,"But you're saying... just to be sure I understand your position... you're saying that even if we conclude that no rational juror, if properly instructed, could fail to find materiality, we should nevertheless say it's not harmless?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1318.995,1329.536,"What I... I think, to complete that thought, no rational jury could have found what it did find, based on the misinstruction, without also finding the correct element, as well."
1998.97-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1335.023,1345.396,"Well, in other words, you're saying no rational juror could find that the amount of money that was withheld from... left out of the income tax return without also finding materiality?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1345.396,1346.331,Not in this case.
1998.97-1985,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1351.466,1367.559,"No, but I'm saying your view is that even if we conclude that no rational juror could have failed to find materiality, having found all the other contested issues in favor of the government, we should, nevertheless, say that... just the exact opposite of what the last sentence of the Pope opinion says?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1367.559,1369.928,--We believe that that is the lesson of Sullivan.
1998.97-1985,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1369.928,1396.678,"Are you drawing... if I understand this line... you're saying that if the jury makes a finding... call it A... finding A necessarily implies a finding B, which it did not make and was not instructed to make; that in that case, there may be harmless error, because it made a finding and the finding necessarily implies the one that should have been on the issue that should have been submitted to it."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1416.241,1416.958,That's correct.
1998.97-1985,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1418.391,1422.01,"Why, if... if there is... in each case, there is a necessary implication."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1439.454,1445.525,"--Because in the first hypothetical, the jury itself has found the element beyond a reasonable doubt."
1998.97-1985,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1462.487,1467.022,But isn't it... isn't it necessary implication that connects A and B in the first case?
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1472.093,1479.531,It's because of the need to have the jury itself make the finding of guilt of that element beyond a reasonable doubt.
1998.97-1985,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1484.935,1485.568,Mr. Rubin--
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1501.778,1503.23,That... that's precisely correct.
1998.97-1985,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1503.23,1507.682,"But isn't... isn't that an issue... is... is that perhaps an issue of characterization, though?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1531.564,1531.931,Right.
1998.97-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1543.455,1552.045,"Mr. Rubinstein, would you be here making the same argument if the judge had just not mentioned to the jury anything about materiality?"
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1554.83,1556.549,--If the judge had made--
1998.97-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1556.549,1557.465,He just failed to instruct.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1557.465,1558.815,--no instruct at all on materiality--
1998.97-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1558.815,1559.199,Right.
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1559.199,1567.404,"--and I assume the judge would not itself... would not himself have made that finding... if there had been no instruction at all, I think we would have... we would be in the situation."
1998.97-1985,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1615.385,1617.27,"Well, the common law also required reliance."
1998.97-1985,0,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,1622.074,1622.441,Right.
1998.97-1985,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1646.189,1646.639,"Very well, Mr. Rubinstein."
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1654.045,1656.295,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1985,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.853,1709.863,"How many elements does... does this convenient theory apply to, Mr. McLeese, just... just one element, or can we apply it to all elements, and just say, we've amassed all of this evidence, look at all of this evidence, no reasonable jury in the world could possibly see all of this evidence and not find this person guilty--"
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1709.863,1710.513,Not--
1998.97-1985,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1710.513,1712.063,"--and therefore, we don't need a trial?"
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1712.063,1714.248,"--Not to all elements, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-1985,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.248,1714.948,How many?
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1718.35,1725.587,"It's difficult to imagine a case in which more than one element would be omitted or misdescribed, and each of those omitted--"
1998.97-1985,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1725.587,1726.17,"So, one is your limit?"
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1726.82,1727.456,--No.
1998.97-1985,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1728.506,1729.289,Two... two might be enough?
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1729.289,1735.86,"--So long as those issues that are contested and reasonably contestable are submitted to the jury, harmless error analysis is available."
1998.97-1985,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.86,1740.096,"So, as long as the jury finds something... the jury just has to find something?"
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1740.096,1740.546,No.
1998.97-1985,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1741.096,1742.048,It doesn't have to find the whole crime?
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1742.048,1742.481,--No.
1998.97-1985,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.154,1755.622,"Mr. McLeese, it may be angels dancing on the head of a pin, but I don't see any other line that we can take."
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1790.362,1793.981,--The Bill of Rights requires that the jury find guilt on all elements.
1998.97-1985,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1830.687,1834.224,But the jury found him guilty of all of the elements of the crime.
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1846.199,1852.436,"--But the finding of guilt, Justice Scalia, is equally composed of the legal information a jury uses and the factual evidence."
1998.97-1985,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1875.885,1885.574,--The fact that the two are different in kind and not just in degree is demonstrated by the fact that we do not allow judges to direct verdicts in criminal cases.
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1904.118,1905.254,"I disagree, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-1985,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1905.254,1907.939,And save us a lot of money in... in the whole jury process.
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1907.939,1908.522,I disagree.
1998.97-1985,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1947.981,1952.735,"Mr. McLeese, I have a more practical, less fundamental, question than Justice Scalia's."
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1994.295,2006.186,"I think, typically, in situation where you had the failure to report large quantities of income, as here, and the defendant had not contested it, the error would be harmless under the rule that we propose."
1998.97-1985,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2006.186,2015.291,Then calling it a material... then calling materiality a jury issue really has nothing behind it.
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2015.291,2024.814,"I think, in the setting where the evidence of materiality is so overwhelming and so uncontested that no rational jury could reach a different conclusion."
1998.97-1985,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2027.23,2029.766,"Well, in a tax fraud... I can't imagine a tax fraud case where that wouldn't be so."
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2029.766,2035.253,"--I think there might well be tax... again, this is not a tax fraud case."
1998.97-1985,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2049.594,2062.07,"But if you adopt a... a rational juror test, I don't see why that simply doesn't take you to a sufficiency of the evidence test of... of a particularly stringent variety."
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2067.324,2073.71,I... I think we would argue for that broader view in a case which required that it be presented.
1998.97-1985,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2114.288,2121.709,Are you arguing for us to cut back somewhat on the rationale of the Sullivan case?
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2121.709,2127.862,There is reasoning in Sullivan that I think would be inconsistent with the view that we espouse.
1998.97-1985,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2153.497,2159.567,"Well, are... are you saying that there are some flawed reasonably doubt instructions that are subject to harmless error?"
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2159.567,2160.603,--No.
1998.97-1985,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2162.703,2166.839,"So, you're isolate... you're isolating harmless error from the failure to instruct on an element?"
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2174.993,2177.362,"--Well, there were two lines of reasoning in Sullivan."
1998.97-1985,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.109,2226.795,And you really think that line makes a difference?
1998.97-1985,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,2257.814,2267.038,"--Well, I think the problem in Sullivan was not so much that the elaboration of the reasonable doubt instruction was not affirmatively helpful."
1998.97-1985,2,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,3165.531,3180.624,The government incorrectly suggests that the test we are advocating for whether or not an error is subject to harmless error review is somehow a new test or that it would present new practical problems.
1998.97-1985,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3251.303,3256.457,"Mr. Rubinstein, what do you say about... about Mr. McLeese's gold mine hypothetical?"
1998.97-1985,2,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,3256.457,3261.243,The gold mine hypothetical would obviously have involved a material misrepresentation.
1998.97-1985,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3261.659,3272.865,"Never mind the materiality, I'm... I'm talking about when in fact the gold mine is... is a gold mine, and... and what he's mistaken about is... is not... not the materiality but whether he's defrauding."
1998.97-1985,2,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,3272.865,3281.371,"--Well, ultimately, if the... if the defendant makes a statement he believes to be false but that actually turns out, by sheer luck, to have been true--"
1998.97-1985,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3281.371,3281.906,True.
1998.97-1985,2,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,3283.339,3283.906,--That's correct.
1998.97-1985,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3283.906,3284.941,"So, you're consistent."
1998.97-1985,2,32560,javier_h_rubinstein,,3301.868,3303.653,"Well, in our view, certainly."
1998.97-1985,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3313.192,3314.126,"Thank you, Mr. Rubinstein."
