1972.36_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.731,"Mr. McDaniel, you may proceed whenever you’re ready."
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,5.731,8.095,Thank you Your Honor.
1972.36_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,114.034,115.061,Where did the idea come from?
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,117.686,123.445,"That was the arrangement that we were told by the clerk, Your Honor."
1972.36_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,123.445,124.817,Meaning the arguments here today?
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,124.817,128.199,Yes.
1972.36_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,128.199,138.352,"Now, there is some misunderstanding, you arrange your argument as you wish and if you wish to save five minutes for rebuttal, that’s the conventional pattern."
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,138.352,138.962,Alright.
1972.36_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,141.475,142.984,I don’t mean to limit you to five minutes.
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,142.984,144.672,"No, I understand, thank you."
1972.36_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,144.672,147.828,We expect really to make your argument in chief in your --
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,147.828,150.53,"Yes, I will do that."
1972.36_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,157.76,158.943,(Inaudible) got of your 30 minutes.
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,158.943,161.195,"Yes, I understand."
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,212.955,225.781,"(Inaudible) you have no rebuttal is that you are the equivalent of the not of the appellant of the petitioner here, but basically of the respondent, aren't you."
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,230.924,232.018,With one minor exception.
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,232.018,238.957,"And so, this case is reverse from its ordinary posture, the ordinary posture of an appellate case before our Court?"
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,238.957,242.03,That is correct.
1972.36_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,242.03,246.239,(Inaudible) What was the significance of the 32 degree point?
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,246.239,254.085,The 32nd degree of North Latitude is the point at which the Sabine River ceases to be the boundary between Texas and Louisiana.
1972.36_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,254.085,255.714,Okay.
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,255.714,262.047,I’ll discuss the specific language of the boundary in a moment and its significance to the case.
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,334.668,340.107,"The question is who had title as between the United States and the State of Louisiana, isn’t it?"
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,340.107,340.895,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,340.895,342.044,There are no other possibilities?
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,342.044,346.902,"That’s correct, at least certain on it so far is the lawsuit shows, the record in the case shows."
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,346.902,349.435,As far as either one of them will be on either of this?
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,349.435,379.318,"That's correct, we contend that Congress never granted the area in dispute to Louisiana and the Louisiana steering of the case in addition to be being wrong because the instruments just don’t grant it to Louisiana, is constitutionally wrong because Article 4 Section 3 gives the Congress the exclusive power to dispose as the territory of the United States and the first senate to the constitution defines the Congress is consisting of the senate and a house of representatives."
1972.36_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.641,978.272,How about -- you are going to talk about the islands then?
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,978.272,982.303,"I am going to talk about them little later, I will be happy to answer any specific question you had at this time --"
1972.36_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.303,986.945,"Well, I have the -- i's only claim to the islands by prescription?"
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,986.945,991.157,Texas claims that the ones in the western half by prescription.
1972.36_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,994.076,997.918,"They claim it as by grant, by the original instrument."
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,997.918,999.895,"Yes, that is their claim for the islands."
1972.36_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,999.895,1002.697,But not any of them by prescription?
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1002.697,1005.772,"That’s correct, only Texas makes that claim."
1972.36_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1005.772,1011.825,Are there any islands that straddle the mid-line anywhere?
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1011.825,1014.154,Yes.
1972.36_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1035.98,1039.597,Even if it was formed at the time of the 1812?
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1039.597,1040.186,That’s correct.
1972.36_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1070.016,1077.377,"Incidentally, I take it there has never been any question of the right of Texas or Louisiana for that matter to free access?"
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1077.377,1105.412,"No, the treaty admitting Louisiana -- I mean the statute admitting Louisiana into the union in 1812 provides for free ride of navigation to the citizens of the State of Louisiana and all other states and the treaty of 1819 with Spain, if that is of any benefit to Texas and there are some questions where it would be in this context or not and it also provides for a free navigation of the Sabine, even though the boundary is placed by that treaty on the west bank."
1972.36_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1155.396,1162.605,Do you know something about how a map like that was prepared and who actually made a decision as to where this line should go?
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1169.127,1181.058,"Well, we don't say that is conclusive, Your Honor, we just say that it's notice to them in their own instrument, but there is a claim here that in the middle of the Sabine River that has existed for many, many years and they have done nothing about it."
1972.36_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1181.058,1184.444,You don't treat it as an admission against interest on their part?
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1184.444,1195.038,"Well, I do not think that when you are talking about acquiescence and prescription, you’re talking about the same thing as an admission against interest in the normal sense."
1972.36_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1195.038,1196.743,You treat it as an evidence of advocacy --
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1196.743,1209.167,"No, no, no, what I am saying is I agree with you that whoever drew the map could not make an admission against interest, they would be binding against the state of Louisiana, it's only an evidential fact."
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1735.287,1741.969,Is this a river that shifts the way that Mississippi river has or used to?
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1741.969,1745.647,"It shifts to some extent, but not merely enact like the Mississippi Your Honor."
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1745.647,1757.521,Would there be any difficulty in -- I am thinking about contrasting the the Thgalweg with the geographical center at the river which should be the easiest advice of practical matter.
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1757.521,1761.803,As a practical matter the geographic center would be far easier to apply.
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1772.01,1776.212,You say it is at least arguable that it is almost equal depths through most of it?
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1776.212,1796.069,"Yes, on the island question, we think that the special master only was interpreting the phrase including all islands to refer to the whole river rather than the area of the river defined by the call for a line to be drawn along the middle of the said river."
1972.36_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1796.069,1800.397,(Inaudible) on this map?
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1800.397,1802.695,"On this map, Your Honor --"
1972.36_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1802.695,1803.946,Just by name --
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1803.946,1808.361,"Alright, the Sabine Island after which we recognize is in Louisiana."
1972.36_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1808.361,1809.573,Right.
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1809.573,1819.601,"The islands coming to the west there, western middle pass Sydney Island those are spoil banks and they are not islands."
1972.36_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1843.788,1847.244,"What did you about the Sydney island, I am sorry Mr. Samuel I did not even catch you."
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1850.28,1852.565,Sydney island is spoil bank Your Honor.
1972.36_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1852.565,1853.506,"Oh, I see."
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1853.506,1859.327,"You see the intercoastal canal run drive there behind, it's spoil, the inter coastal canal."
1972.36_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1876.839,1887.638,"(Inaudible) that shipping that comes into Port Aurthur and Beaumont, I take it uses the port Aurthur canal rather than coming into Sabine lake, is that right?"
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1887.638,1888.864,That's correct Your Honor.
1972.36_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1919.18,1924.606,Are there any island that's up river to the 32 degree from this map?
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1924.606,1939.944,"There is only one that I know of in a place called the Marrows and that was decided by the Department of the Interior I believe in 1910 to belong to Louisiana, that it should be measured from the Western Channel --"
1972.36_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1939.944,1947.742,"I don't understand why is Texas objecting to that provision of the masters to employ this in New Orleans, do you any idea about that?"
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1947.742,1951.317,Well I would say it is more of a quibble really than an exception about the thing.
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1979.786,1992.199,"What if any, does this controversy have to do with the boundary between Louisiana and Texas seaward of the coast up to the three leagues for Texas and three miles for Louisiana?"
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1992.199,1993.932,It has nothing whatsoever to do.
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1993.932,1997.206,"It certainly has something to do with the starting point, doesn't it?"
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,1997.206,2012.165,"Well that gets us back to whether or not the United States has an interest in it or not and my answer to that is this Your Honor, it does have an interest in the starting point, yes as to the boundary between Louisiana and Texas."
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2012.165,2012.358,Right.
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,2012.358,2015.148,Where there is the mouth of the Sabine on the west bank.
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2015.148,2016.849,Whether it's the middle of the mouth of the west bank.
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,2016.849,2017.333,That is correct.
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2017.333,2017.823,Right.
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,2017.823,2027.374,"This does not affect the United States, I do think because as to the United States the three league limit only comes as far as our historic boundary."
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2027.374,2027.597,Right.
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,2027.597,2039.615,"The Congress does consider ports to extend it here anymore than they have consented ports to extend it up here in North to the 32 degree latitude, so we have no controversy."
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2039.615,2050.915,"But as between you -- as between Texas and Louisiana, that boundary that's seaward of the shoreline is affected by this controversy?"
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,2050.915,2060.487,It is affected and most states have stipulated that that issue is to be excluded from this lawsuit.
1972.36_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2060.487,2060.878,Alright.
1972.36_orig,0,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,2060.878,2076.079,"Now it will determine it obviously but this lawsuit will not determine, what tangent that line should take, whether it should be perpendicular from the coast or whether it should follow some other line."
1972.36_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2080.049,2081.981,Mr. Stockwell.
1972.36_orig,1,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,2081.981,2086.025,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.36_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2270.363,2272.346,[Inaudible] state of the Sabine?
1972.36_orig,1,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,2272.346,2274.524,"Yes, in my brief—"
1972.36_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2274.524,2276.198,I read that story about Mr. Merrel --
1972.36_orig,1,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,2276.198,2282.846,It's liberty of putting a chapter out of this book of Maroo (ph) who was a freebooter in this particular area.
1972.36_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2823.744,2828.849,(Inaudible)
1972.36_orig,1,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,2828.849,2832.549,"The put all the people who built it on this field, Your Honor."
1972.36_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2832.549,2833.934,But the United States Government did not build.
1972.36_orig,1,37588,oliver_p_stockwell,,2833.934,2835.161,"No, no I am not trying to see it."
1972.36_orig,2,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,2890.731,2903.209,"Well, we are saying, Mr. Justice that actually as far as I can understand, as far as the records show, if I wasn't in this in the beginning so I certainly wouldn’t having a first knowledge it?"
1972.36_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2941.652,2948.101,"But this is an argument that Texas cannot make out, anything out of the fact that Pleasure Island was built on this field, (Voice overlap)"
1972.36_orig,2,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,2948.101,2957.44,That is exactly what -- that is exactly what we are Your Honor because of the fact that we had put them on notice and decided not to do anything pending this title end.
1972.36_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2975.96,2982.134,You are not trying to convince me that Texas made this contribution to Louisiana this pier?
1972.36_orig,2,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,2982.134,2983.898,"No sir, I am not trying to do that."
1972.36_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2983.898,2987.074,"I mean it is a big state, but I did not know they were that generous."
1972.36_orig,2,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,2987.074,3001.404,"Well I do not think they intend to make this but of course Mr. Justice Marshall, actually many things are built on fields in navigable streams without affecting the title to the subsoil."
1972.36_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3019.41,3025.9,Who had the title to the bridges over the Sabine River?
1972.36_orig,2,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,3025.9,3034.319,"Well we take to position, Justice Marshall that it was – in the interest of both parties, this was a navigable stream."
1972.36_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3046.455,3050.874,Is that same for the police jurisdiction half and half all the way across?
1972.36_orig,2,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,3050.874,3061.739,"No sir but we, some of our people testified they did arrest all the way across, I would say that most haven’t recognized the division line, I mean to be perfectly candid with the Court."
1972.36_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3061.739,3063.557,The division line was in the middle?
1972.36_orig,2,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,3063.557,3083.558,"Well it was along somewhere in there, they were thinking about it from their jurisdiction but I think as far as the bridges were concerned, they were built maybe on a 50-50 basis and they owned the whole bridge together and I think you would see from the testimony there were not any line picked out in any part of the river."
1972.36_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3083.558,3105.233,"Mr. Stockwell, as I understand the common law anyway if you were to occupy a property which I claim and possess it, a mere letter from me to you saying I claim it is mine which did not change your possession would not stop the prescriptive period for money."
1972.36_orig,2,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,3113.772,3126.162,"I would agree generally with that premise, Your Honor but I feel if the parties mutually understand, that they have got another matter to settle and they are not going to litigate over it, then I think that is another matter."
1972.36_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3126.162,3144.059,"No I would agree with that but so far as Governor Jones' letter is concerned, it seems to me that if Texas was exercising possession prior to that and continue to exercise it afterwards, I do not see that the letter would be terribly relevant?"
1972.36_orig,2,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,3144.059,3149.412,Well I think it would have it then because states really act a little different than the individuals.
1972.36_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.773,3181.245,The description does not run against the sovereign state?
1972.36_orig,2,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,3181.245,3185.428,"Well we do not make that as a reference to one state, one state to another state."
1972.36_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3187.351,3191.214,But you think the same -- you are saying the ordinary rule would apply between states?
1972.36_orig,2,41711,samuel_d_mcdaniel,,3191.214,3197.993,"Well I think this Court has said that it could acquire title by acquiescence and prescription, I mean settle the boundaries."
1972.36_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3213.872,3214.946,Yes.
