1973.72-1713,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.377,"We will hear arguments next in 72-1713, Secretary of the Navy against Avrech."
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,48.592,52.289,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1713,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,379.062,391.277,Well I suppose it might reasonably said that it would stimulate some debate on the subject when you have one group of soldiers one way and -- or marines on one side and another group on another side?
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,391.277,392.722,It certainly would stimulate debate.
1973.72-1713,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,414.538,416.68,We’ll resume there at 1 o’clock.
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,430.367,432.486,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.72-1713,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,649.151,653.169,What did the Court of Appeals say about that argument of yours?
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,653.169,664.436,The Court of Appeals thought that the military context did not give it sufficient definiteness Mr. Justice Douglas but I think I can demonstrate that it does.
1973.72-1713,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,767.594,773.002,"Solicitor, the average enlisted men is not familiar with the manual at all, isn’t it?"
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,773.002,775.231,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I think that’s quite true."
1973.72-1713,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,785.189,790.623,And I wonder how many Manuals of Courts-Martial they have in Vietnam altogether?
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,790.623,791.372,I do not know that.
1973.72-1713,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,798.53,800.721,I am just wondering if you need that.
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,800.721,801.279,Pardon me?
1973.72-1713,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,801.279,802.571,I am just wondering if you need that.
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,802.571,806.783,Well I don’t need it but I think I would like to use it if I may.[Laughter Attempt]
1973.72-1713,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,823.016,824.939,The Manual isn't explained to him.
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,824.939,825.603,The manual is explained and the articles are explained.
1973.72-1713,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,825.603,828.36,Although he doesn’t read the manual himself.
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,828.36,831.218,That’s correct.
1973.72-1713,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,988.099,999.877,Mr. Solicitor General you said earlier that your brother is not appointed to any case where I don’t know just how you put it.
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1001.147,1002.567,[Voice Overlap] Mr. Justice.
1973.72-1713,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1002.567,1024.588,"Or I think you said whether there wasn’t fair notice more or less, but I am looking at these examples in the appendix, the appellee’s brief, at least some of them seem to me to be arguably while they are all of course conduct falling below what we like to think of as ideal."
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1042.688,1043.601,May I speak to those --
1973.72-1713,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1043.601,1049.834,Or even mistreatment of your members of your family for instance or refusing to testify at a corners in quest?
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1049.834,1057.518,I think that list of the appendix Mr. Justice Stewart requires use for the great deal of caution.
1973.72-1713,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1076.804,1081.963,"You could argue that both ways and merely I would, as to the validity of this."
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1081.963,1093.628,"Well, I think not Mr. Justice Stewart because if one look at civilian jurisprudence and look at the number of cases in which people have been charged of murder and how many of them were acquitted, one would not say."
1973.72-1713,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1093.628,1095.551,Well but we know what murder is.
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1098.028,1109.002,"Well, one of my examples here is man slaughter which is I suppose a negligent killing under the circumstances quite vague criminal proscription."
1973.72-1713,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1133.958,1136.408,"Well, I assume to some like that, that’s why I didn’t ask you about that."
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1136.408,1148.791,"[Laughter Attempt] Jumping off a ship which sounds a little bit carefree, as a matter of fact was a man who made a large wages and he would do a back flip off an aircraft carrier in motion and cause the Navy to just send a story about the rescue."
1973.72-1713,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1167.278,1181.337,"Of course, any deviation from ideal conduct by a man in uniform tends to bring discredit upon the uniform that he wears and the military organization, to which he belongs, isn’t that correct?"
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1181.337,1190.386,"It is certainly is correct, Your Honor but any deviation from ideal conduct is not charged under this Article."
1973.72-1713,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1591.593,1602.035,Doesn’t the Court of Military Appeals apply the standards that this Court has applied to civil procedures as respect to vagueness?
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1602.035,1613.818,I think it does Mr. Justice Douglas but it recognizes that each of these standards has a slightly different application depending upon the context and the circumstances in which it must be applied.
1973.72-1713,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1613.818,1616.379,That would be true in the civilian branch along too.
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1616.379,1619.069,That is true.
1973.72-1713,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1619.069,1623.602,"And the Court of Military Appeals has explicitly upheld the validity of Article 134, has it not?"
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1623.602,1624.374,They have indeed.
1973.72-1713,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1624.374,1625.593,How recently?
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1625.593,1629.191,"The Frantz, I think it is upheld at Mr. Justice Stewart within the last year or two."
1973.72-1713,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1632.412,1633.64,In any event quite recently.
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1633.64,1634.099,Quite recently.
1973.72-1713,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1634.099,1635.51,Is that the Frantz case?
1973.72-1713,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1635.51,1637.413,I believe it was the Frantz case.
1973.72-1713,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1637.413,1640.423,Well I have it here and I will give to Justice Stewart.
1973.72-1713,1,20611,dorian_bowman,,2059.922,2062.583,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
