1991.90-8466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.778,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 80... pardon me, in No. 90-8466, David Riggins v. Nevada."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,13.308,24.318,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-8466,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,166.167,174.32,Is there any explanation for why he initiated the proceeding for an order to terminate the medication?
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,191.11,207.307,"Justice Kennedy, Dr. Quass, who was the State's psychiatrist, the prison psychiatrist, initially prescribed 100 milligrams of Mellaril for Mr. Riggins because he was having trouble sleeping and he was hearing voices."
1991.90-8466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.209,223.286,Did he increase it or did Riggins himself increase it?
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,231.406,242.105,"Mr. Riggins initially asked for Mellaril, and then the dosage was gradually increased by Dr. Quass until it reached the 800-milligram level."
1991.90-8466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,242.105,244.386,At Riggins' request or not at Riggins' request?
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,244.386,248.603,Mr. Riggins had requested that the dosage be increased.
1991.90-8466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,248.603,249.087,He had.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,249.087,256.928,"He went back to Dr. Quass, increasing... still complaining of hearing of voices and the fact he could not sleep."
1991.90-8466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.928,262.676,You can't really say that it was... that the increased was forced upon Riggins by the physicians here?
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,262.676,265.597,"No, the increase was not forced upon Mr. Riggins."
1991.90-8466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.889,282.261,"Now, do we assume on this record that the use of the Mellaril was medically appropriate?"
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,282.261,287.431,I don't believe there was ever any finding that the use was medically appropriate.
1991.90-8466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,289.961,295.179,"Well, did Riggins ever challenge that below or make an issue of that?"
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,295.179,301.254,--The only time it was challenged was at the hearing of the motion to terminate medication.
1991.90-8466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,314.295,322.151,"Well, I thought that the petitioner wanted it stopped in order that he could appear before the jury in his natural state, whatever that was."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,322.151,322.714,That's correct.
1991.90-8466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,322.714,331.366,Not on the basis that the giving of the medication was medically inappropriate for his symptoms.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,331.366,342.003,"Well, at the hearing for the termination of administration of medication, there was testimony from Dr. Quass, who initially prescribed the medication, Drs."
1991.90-8466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,367.978,372.804,"Well, we have to decide this case on the basis of the record below us... below."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,391.078,402.745,"Well, according to this Court's decision in Washington v. Harper, there must be a finding for forcible medication that, one, it was medically appropriate, and two, that there was a finding of dangerousness."
1991.90-8466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,418.863,432.358,"Mr. Yampolsky, I don't thing you've answered Justice O'Connor's question, which is did the petitioner in the Nevada District Court challenge the giving of this dosage as being medically inappropriate?"
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,433.858,435.919,The answer would be no.
1991.90-8466,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,435.919,439.465,"Mr. Yampolsky... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,439.465,440.215,"That's okay, Justice Souter."
1991.90-8466,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,440.215,444.416,"I was going to say maybe I missed the point, but I'm not sure of your answer to Justice Kennedy's question."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,453.739,455.926,I don't believe that ever happened.
1991.90-8466,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,455.926,461.955,"So prior to his going into court, there was no act of the State forcing it upon him."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,461.955,463.393,That's correct.
1991.90-8466,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,479.09,486.024,"Well, did the court order say to the doctors you are hereby directed and instructed to forcibly medicate him?"
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,486.024,491.771,"--No, the court order said the motion to terminate administration of medication is denied."
1991.90-8466,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,493.115,494.303,"Well, why do you need a motion to terminate?"
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,497.301,501.457,"--I'm unclear, Your Honor."
1991.90-8466,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,501.457,509.985,Does every prisoner in the State of Nevada have to go to the court before he can tell his doctor not to give him medicine?
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,509.985,511.251,I don't believe--
1991.90-8466,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,511.251,514.405,Is the inference here that he was not competent to tell the doctor?
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,514.405,517.889,"--No, Your Honor, as a matter of fact, he was found competent."
1991.90-8466,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,550.953,559.935,But did the court ever go further than saying I will not order the State to stop administering the medication?
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,576.975,582.207,"Yes, the court order said the motion to terminate administration of medication is denied."
1991.90-8466,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,582.207,587.112,"So if he had then said, well, I'm not going to take it, he wouldn't be in violation of the court order?"
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,589.735,592.234,Apparently not.
1991.90-8466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,592.234,602.84,"Well, certainly the State knew and the doctors knew that he wanted the... when he made the motion, they knew perfectly well that he wanted the medication stopped."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,602.84,604.198,Correct.
1991.90-8466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,604.198,609.009,And they nevertheless continued to give it to him.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,609.009,610.446,That's correct also.
1991.90-8466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.446,615.631,"And it may be that they were justified in doing it if he was a danger to himself or others, and it was medically appropriate."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,615.631,619.661,"Well, that's correct, however, that is the precise issue."
1991.90-8466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,626.018,648.009,"Mr. Yampolsky, as I understand it, just as you did not argue below, and certainly did not argue in your petition, that the administration was medically inappropriate, so also Nevada did not argue below that... or in its response to the petition that he could have simply declined to take it on his own."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,650.29,651.569,That's correct.
1991.90-8466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,651.569,652.507,I certainly don't recall.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,672.28,678.856,"Well, they were prescribed by a doctor, psychiatrist, Dr. Quass."
1991.90-8466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.663,691.726,But you never made that argument before.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,715.794,716.904,--That's not the point.
1991.90-8466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,718.076,719.7,"Well, what do you want to introduce it now for?"
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,719.7,721.168,"--Well, according--"
1991.90-8466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.168,722.198,It's not a very interesting question.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,729.79,737.927,"--Well, Your Honor, or Justice Scalia, that's the very question that needs to be addressed."
1991.90-8466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,745.455,747.205,I read your question presented again.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,770.132,771.163,That is the question--
1991.90-8466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.163,772.038,"Well, let's talk about it."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,772.038,787.235,"--Well, to talk about that, Justice Scalia, it appears that we need to decide, one, is the medication forcible because the judge ordered it and we were attempting to stop it."
1991.90-8466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,804.508,809.944,"But Mr. Yampolsky, the forcible issue is raised in your petition for certiorari."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,812.35,822.705,"Your Honor, the medically appropriate issue is consumed by the forcible medication."
1991.90-8466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.121,846.116,"You have half an hour to argue your case, and surely the main thrust of it is the point that the medication was forcibly administered against his wishes, so why don't you get on with that."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,846.116,851.411,"Your Honor, Mr. Riggins had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia."
1991.90-8466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,906.265,911.637,"Well, let me put it this way, if it were medically appropriate, would you be here at all?"
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,924.195,929.115,If it was medically appropriate--
1991.90-8466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,929.115,929.724,Yes.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,929.724,938.095,"--and Mr. Riggins had the right to deny the medically appropriate medication, and by virtue of his--"
1991.90-8466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,938.095,938.627,"Well, that's the issue."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,938.627,939.688,--Correct.
1991.90-8466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,939.688,946.608,"Would you still be here arguing that he had the right to deny, even if it were medically appropriate that he be given it?"
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,946.608,948.95,"Yes, I would be arguing that."
1991.90-8466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,970.41,978.204,Do you say that the right not to be tried while incompetent is a waivable right under the Constitution?
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,978.204,980.891,--I have two responses to that.
1991.90-8466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,986.966,991.324,"Well, I'm asking you what your position is as to the law."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,993.386,1012.972,"--I believe it is a waivable right in the following Faretta line of cases, that as long as the competent defendant is given a full and fair hearing in which the pitfalls, the problems which could occur are set forth."
1991.90-8466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1069.933,1072.917,"Where is this in your question presented, again?"
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1090.957,1097.702,"Justice Scalia, I don't believe we ever had a finding on whether or not it was medically appropriate."
1991.90-8466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1097.702,1105.747,"I'm not talking about what the finding was, I'm talking about what you came to this Court presenting us to decide, and on the basis of which we accepted this case."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1120.38,1128.94,"The petition for cert was based on the constitutional infirmity, or our position was, on the fact that--"
1991.90-8466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1128.94,1130.236,"Well, just yes or no."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1139.031,1139.467,--Yes.
1991.90-8466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1147.089,1147.931,Okay.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1147.931,1157.006,"And they were broken up in the questions presented to the trial phase and then resentencing phase, which is why we had the two questions."
1991.90-8466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1160.098,1183.746,"Well, it sounds to me like, as I read the court of appeals' opinion, or the State, the Supreme Court in Nevada opinion, the only question they decided was that you didn't have a constitutional... a special constitutional right to discontinue these drugs so that you could appear in your natural state at trial."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1185.308,1187.775,And that's why--
1991.90-8466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1187.775,1189.946,That was the only thing they decided.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1189.946,1192.306,--And that's why we filed the petition to this Court.
1991.90-8466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.306,1192.461,Right.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1207.612,1211.111,I don't believe that's exactly accurate.
1991.90-8466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.908,1213.343,It's the only issue the court of appeals decided.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1213.343,1215.374,"--Well, it's not a special constitutional right."
1991.90-8466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1215.374,1217.138,I mean the supreme court decided.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1217.138,1223.121,"We believe that it is a constitutional right, but not a special constitutional right."
1991.90-8466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1225.198,1246.862,"Well, I know, but you would argue, I suppose, that even if in normal circumstances, you might be dangerous to yourself or others, and this is medically appropriate, you nevertheless should be able to refuse the drugs because you're going to go to trial and you want to appear in your natural state at trial."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1246.862,1253.453,"--There's the fundamental right of a defendant, which is being infringed upon here."
1991.90-8466,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1300.933,1323.393,"Well, Mr. Yampolsky, are you saying now, in effect, that the answer to the questions that you have raised is something like this: yes, with appropriate findings of necessity, the State can administer these drugs forcibly, even though it will compromise what he would regard as compromising his demeanor."
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1337.216,1338.87,That is a fair statement.
1991.90-8466,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1338.87,1339.167,All right.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1352.303,1361.674,"No, we have never taken the position that forcible medication is always inappropriate and always constitutionally infirm."
1991.90-8466,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1382.696,1383.024,Excuse me.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1395.77,1397.208,That's correct.
1991.90-8466,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1397.208,1397.44,Okay.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1397.44,1406.156,"If the Court wants to narrow the issue, it could be what would be constitutional for an insanity defendant."
1991.90-8466,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1428.117,1434.583,"Well, don't you want to rest on the need to medicate for competence rather than the need to medicate for safety?"
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1434.583,1442.704,"Well, this case wasn't predicated from the petitioner's standpoint on competence."
1991.90-8466,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1446.702,1446.905,I see.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1447.436,1453.669,The issue is insanity and how is he present... prevented from--
1991.90-8466,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1453.669,1454.841,I've got the point.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1473.208,1475.348,--There was no actual finding.
1991.90-8466,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1488.67,1490.793,There was no finding below.
1991.90-8466,0,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,1529.107,1532.121,"Yes, Your Honor... and to... Justice Scalia."
1991.90-8466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1552.333,1554.316,"Very well, Mr. Yampolsky."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1555.988,1562.736,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1644.046,1655.916,"Well, was there ever a motion by the defendant in court to stop the medication for purposes of letting him go to trial without being medicated?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1655.916,1656.385,--That was--
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1656.385,1657.993,I thought there was such a motion.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1657.993,1661.585,--Mr. Yampolsky filed that motion in July or June of '88.
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1661.585,1662.069,All right.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1665.099,1665.474,That's true.
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1665.474,1668.864,And the motion made clear that he didn't want to be medicated anymore.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1669.894,1670.769,"The... well, the--"
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1670.769,1672.081,For purposes of the trial?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1672.081,1680.422,"--The motion itself did not, for instance, have an affidavit from the defendant indicating he had some sort of a liberty interest in not being medicated."
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1680.422,1688.731,"Well, I thought we had the case on the assumption that there had been a motion to terminate the medication."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1688.731,1689.559,That's correct.
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1690.996,1696.4,"And the State's position is that, or was that it could continue to medicate."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1696.4,1702.319,The State's position... the State's concern at that point was maintaining defendant's competency to stand trial.
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1715.876,1722.982,The court made no findings on that question of whether he would remain competent.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1724.029,1727.043,The court had entered a... order of competency some months earlier.
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1774.166,1781.366,"Yeah, but there was no finding, I take it, after he filed his motion to terminate the medication."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1784.583,1785.286,That's correct.
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1785.286,1786.24,--to his competency.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1788.848,1791.8,I don't believe so.
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1808.651,1818.101,"Yes, but counsel, regardless of the reason for the motion, you don't challenge the authority of the attorney to speak on behalf of his client at that point, do you?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1818.101,1818.398,No.
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1818.992,1826.051,"So isn't it true that you had the equivalent of a statement by the defendant, I don't want any more medication at this time?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1826.051,1828.659,"Well, I think you've got a more detailed statement than that, though."
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1831.579,1838.561,"Maybe the reasons are different, but is it not fair to say that he did at least request that the medication be terminated?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1838.561,1839.139,That's true.
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1839.139,1845.73,And then the question arises is who has the burden of determining what facts will justify continuation of the medication.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1853.79,1859.866,If we assume that the Washington v. Harper liberty interest applies to this defendant in this circumstance--
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1859.866,1860.959,"Whether you assume that or not, whether you assume that or not."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1860.959,1861.287,--Yeah--
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1861.287,1862.349,Whatever his reason.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1879.388,1885.558,--I frankly think it would be his burden to show that it shouldn't be continued.
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1885.558,1889.229,And just simply saying I don't want it should not weigh in the scale at all?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1889.229,1900.599,"Yeah, based on the motion, then... based on the motion, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing, and primarily the decision... the concern of the court was what should my decision be."
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.29,1937.866,And the fact that he doesn't want to take the medication anymore just doesn't carry weight in the argument?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1937.866,1939.318,"--Well, he's the moving party."
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1939.318,1939.912,I understand.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1939.912,1943.691,I think he's got the burden to convince the court to grant what he's requesting.
1991.90-8466,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1943.691,1948.939,"Why... is that reason he has the burden, simply because he's the moving party on the motion?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1948.939,1951.483,"Well, that sounds like a good reason to me."
1991.90-8466,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1951.483,1956.358,"Well, if we assume for the sake of argument it's not a good reason, do you have another reason?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1971.289,1974.71,No such theory was advanced at the time because it wasn't really raised.
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1978.678,1990.111,"Well, the way you put it awhile ago, it sounds to me like... you say the court decided that it was necessary to maintain his competence to treat him."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,1992.345,1997.858,"--The court... the court's concern, I think was that if the medication was terminated, there was at least a--"
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.858,2005.917,"So whose ever burden it was... if it was the State's burden, you suggest that the court found it was satisfied."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2005.917,2006.51,--Yes.
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.51,2007.915,Except there was no--
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2009.29,2011.68,"Well, it was a rather short form of the order."
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2011.68,2015.288,He said the most prudent course: I don't want to take the risk.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2015.288,2019.162,That was about the nature of his rationale.
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2019.162,2020.069,Don't want to take the risk of having to postpone the trial.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2028.581,2033.484,"Well, the question of the demeanor evidence, I don't think was ever really addressed by the courts."
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2033.484,2038.17,"Well, I think it was raised by counsel, wasn't it?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2038.17,2038.7,It was raised.
1991.90-8466,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2039.872,2041.371,So that's an irrelevant consideration of the court?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2041.371,2042.668,"--No, it's a constitutional claim."
1991.90-8466,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2049.634,2052.132,"Well, he didn't vocalize the opinion?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2053.82,2055.132,"Well, no, he didn't."
1991.90-8466,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2056.005,2058.272,And you've admitted that they're relevant to the consideration?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2058.272,2059.942,--Am I admitting that?
1991.90-8466,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2059.942,2063.315,Are they relevant to the consideration of the trial court?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2063.315,2064.877,No.
1991.90-8466,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2064.877,2065.487,Why?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2065.487,2074.873,The trial court's decision was simply whether or not termination of medication would render the defendant incompetent.
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2081.933,2108.658,"Well, assuming that a particular drug is being administered, and assume for a moment that the drug would create a zombie-like appearance in the person taking the drug so that the person would appear disinterested in the proceedings going on and as though they had no effect on him one way or another."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2123.87,2128.586,Not if terminating the medication is going to make him incompetent to go to trial.
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2135.193,2141.58,"But there was no finding below as to whether he would maintain his competence, was there?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2141.58,2144.174,"Well, there was no explicit finding by the court."
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2144.174,2144.393,No.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2144.393,2147.47,The court merely entered an order saying the motion to terminate is denied.
1991.90-8466,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2147.47,2152.905,"Mr. Tufteland, there was no finding, but perhaps there was no finding because his motion wasn't based on that."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2171.304,2171.74,That's correct.
1991.90-8466,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.74,2180.518,"Had he come in and said, I will... I can be perfectly competent even without it, then the judge might have felt the need to make such a finding, but that wasn't his argument, was it?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2180.518,2180.846,No.
1991.90-8466,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.846,2185.596,"It was competence or noncompetence doesn't matter, I have an absolute right--"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2185.596,2186.094,That's right.
1991.90-8466,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.094,2187.234,--not to take the medication.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2187.234,2188.281,That's correct.
1991.90-8466,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2188.281,2190.608,I understood what went on.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2225.016,2234.106,"At the evidentiary hearing, he stipulated that competency was a jurisdictional requirement and it could not be waived."
1991.90-8466,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2234.106,2242.867,"Well, was that the equivalent of saying therefore, I do not claim that even at the risk of incompetency the medication should be stopped?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2253.692,2256.082,I'm not sure what he intended by that statement.
1991.90-8466,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2266.546,2269.655,He at least... I'm sorry.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2292.099,2292.708,No.
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2314.387,2324.415,"Yeah, but the case went to the court of appeals... to the Supreme Court of Nevada on the basis that he was being involuntarily treated."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2335.066,2343.548,"--Well, there's nothing in the record that actually supports the idea that he didn't continue to voluntarily consume the medication."
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2343.548,2355.62,"Well, the court of appeals talked as though, or the supreme court of the State talked as though he... they decided it on the basis that he was being involuntarily treated."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2355.62,2362.806,I think they addressed the question pretty much as it was presented in the briefs as to whether or not there was this constitutional right to appear unmedicated.
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2369.225,2379.845,"Was he ever... why was he... after he was arrested, wasn't he sent to a mental treatment place?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2380.313,2382.875,"He was... as far as I know, he was in the Clark County jail."
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.813,2385.015,Yes.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2385.015,2385.53,And he may have been there.
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2386.061,2388.701,Was there some question about his competence at that time?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2388.701,2392.216,"Well, Mr. Yampolsky raised that issue within a couple of weeks of the arrest."
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.216,2392.747,Yes.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2395.527,2402.665,"He filed the motion to have psychiatrists appointed for interviews, and the lower court--"
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2402.665,2403.164,Granted it.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2403.164,2407.304,"--Well, they transferred the case up to the district court, the district court appointed the psychiatrists who interviewed him."
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2412.957,2417.314,When did he do... when was that entered?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2417.314,2424.889,"The psychiatric interviews occurred... two of them are in February of '88, and the other, I believe, was in early March of '88."
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2424.889,2433.949,And did it appear that the reason he... did it appear that he had been incompetent but that the drugs made him competent?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2434.73,2435.01,Well--
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.01,2436.198,--Was that it or not?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2436.198,2446.818,--The motion of Mr. Yampolsky simply asserted that in dealing with his client he felt that he... there were concerns about his competency based on conferring with him.
1991.90-8466,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2455.549,2461.983,But your position was that after the court's ruling you could forcibly medicate him if you chose?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2461.983,2471.011,"Our position would have been if the... it was necessary to maintain competency for trial, we could have forcibly medicated him."
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2471.011,2471.589,How would you know that?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2471.589,2474.713,"Well, that's why they had the evidentiary hearing."
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.713,2480.539,"Well, I know, but it's a... there didn't sound like as much of a finding."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2487.162,2498.218,"Well, I think that the court entertained the opinions of the three psychiatrists who testified plus the reports of the other two psychiatrists whose reports were before the court."
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2516.931,2520.959,"Yes, but this is testimony before the hearing in response to his motion, isn't it?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2524.756,2525.303,--To terminate?
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.521,2525.756,Yeah.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2535.688,2537.672,Dr. O'Gorman was not sure.
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2554.947,2559.678,What did they say on the question of whether they thought he would be competent if the medication were discontinued?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2559.678,2561.927,--Most likely they thought he would remain competent.
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2561.927,2566.472,So... then you're saying that we have to assume that the judge accepted their testimony.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2579.562,2590.822,"Well, I think the way to interpret it is that if you look at defense counsel's statement at the end of the hearing, he said the evidence before the court is conflicting and basically no one knows what will happen if the medication is terminated."
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2591.696,2594.57,So you assume he believed or disbelieved the experts?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2594.57,2598.928,"--Well, I think he pretty much believed them, but there were conflicting opinions."
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2598.928,2601.192,"If he believed them, then you had to come down on the side of competence, didn't he?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2601.192,2603.208,There were conflicting opinions.
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.208,2606.597,"Well, two said he would... they thought he'd be competent and one said he wasn't sure."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2606.597,2606.597,And then there--
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2606.597,2608.222,"Which is the weight of the evidence, then?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2608.222,2612.282,"--Well, there were two reports submitted in addition to those, Jurasky and Patel."
1991.90-8466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2616.109,2618.264,"That isn't quite enough psychiatrists, is it?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2625.402,2625.652,Right.
1991.90-8466,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2625.652,2628.494,They were asking the judge to take a chance and the judge said--
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2628.494,2628.806,Right.
1991.90-8466,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2628.806,2635.101,"--it's, you know, this thing has come along too far at this stage, we're close to trial, I'm not going to take this... the chance at this point."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2635.101,2636.35,I think that was the rationale basically.
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2643.707,2646.112,"Mr. Tufteland, let me ask you another question."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2664.215,2665.042,Our position would be--
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2665.042,2666.322,Is it waivable?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2666.322,2667.775,--We don't believe it is.
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2667.775,2670.383,Aren't most constitutional rights waivable?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2670.383,2670.868,Yes.
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2670.868,2672.477,And why isn't that one?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2672.477,2686.064,"I think because in this kind of a case, this situation where in Nevada where competency is jurisdictional and this Court in a number of cases has indicated that due process requires a person to be competent when they go to trial."
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2686.064,2688.906,"I don't think we've ever decided, have we, whether it's waivable?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2688.906,2690.235,"No, you have not."
1991.90-8466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2720.332,2724.315,"Well, does your case rest on the position that it's not waivable?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2729.844,2736.419,"--Well, I mean our interest is the same regardless, and if you hold that it's waivable, then that's your opinion."
1991.90-8466,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2750.991,2759.971,"Mr. Tufteland, did the defendant appear in the trial at any stage of the trial?"
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2759.971,2761.706,He testified at the guilt phase.
1991.90-8466,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2761.706,2763.705,What did he say at the guilt phase?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2763.705,2778.653,"He testified about his background, explaining when he began hearing voices at the age of 4, and about an abused childhood, about his delusional episodes over the course of his life."
1991.90-8466,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2790.35,2792.599,Insane testimony?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2793.131,2804.203,"Well, he... claiming that the victim was trying to put AIDS-infected blood on his cocaine to kill him, and that he tried to put fiberglass in his water to kill him."
1991.90-8466,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2808.187,2808.766,And he said that during the trial?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2808.766,2810.842,He testified to the jury in that fashion.
1991.90-8466,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.56,2820.51,He didn't say anything about the abused childhood story about Marilyn Monroe and--
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2820.51,2827.649,"That was brought out by defense counsel, and he acknowledged that he had told a prior therapist about that."
1991.90-8466,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2827.649,2828.928,--But he didn't repeat that at trial?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2828.928,2830.272,He did in a sense.
1991.90-8466,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2865.571,2871.396,What do you think the record shows about his zombie-like state or anything of that sort?
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2871.396,2875.019,"Well, there's nothing that I can find in the record that supports that kind of a characterization."
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2877.003,2881.11,"Well, the dissenting judged in the Nevada Supreme Court used... was the one that first used the term."
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2882.11,2882.579,--I don't know.
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2890.231,2891.341,The jury was informed that he was on medication.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2891.341,2892.325,"--Yes, they were."
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2892.325,2893.778,And how much.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2893.778,2894.403,"Oh, yes."
1991.90-8466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2894.403,2895.557,And why he was.
1991.90-8466,1,33236,james_tufteland,,2923.968,2924.515,That's correct.
1991.90-8466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2942.836,2944.898,"Thank you, Mr. Tufteland."
1991.90-8466,2,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,2947.411,2948.755,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1991.90-8466,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3000.593,3001.906,Resulted in a continuance?
1991.90-8466,2,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,3001.906,3002.468,Correct.
1991.90-8466,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3029.02,3037.578,"I don't see how that... I mean as far as the demeanor goes, I don't see how that gets you anywhere unless his demeanor would show that he's incompetent."
1991.90-8466,2,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,3054.978,3059.381,"Justice Scalia, I did want him to appear insane, not incompetent."
1991.90-8466,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3080.545,3093.65,"Would he have a right if his insanity pushes him in that direction, to come in with a clown hat on and his face painted yellow in order to demonstrate by his demeanor that he is indeed insane?"
1991.90-8466,2,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,3095.93,3097.57,I don't believe the court has to permit that.
1991.90-8466,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3101.24,3104.333,There's nothing disorderly about his coming in dressed as a clown.
1991.90-8466,2,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,3111.892,3115.78,"--I don't believe the court has to permit that, Justice Scalia."
1991.90-8466,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3115.78,3119.326,"Well, I don't see any difference between that and what you're arguing."
1991.90-8466,2,36963,mace_j_yampolsky,,3119.326,3121.044,It's qualitatively different.
1991.90-8466,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3138.147,3139.506,"Thank you, Mr. Yampolsky."
