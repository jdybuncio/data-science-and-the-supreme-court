1982.82-167,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.294,We will hear arguments next in the case of George C. Chappell and others against Vernon Wallace and others.
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,57.18,61.132,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.82-167,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,260.021,263.41,And the same would go for the Fifth Circuit case?
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,263.41,278.45,"No, Mr. Justice White, the Fifth Circuit case was a judicial review of the intra-military process and it is clear that in certain circumstances the review process within the military--"
1982.82-167,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,278.45,281.778,This case you don't think lends any support for this--
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,281.778,284.793,--It lends no support whatsoever.
1982.82-167,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,336.239,338.942,--You mean against damages or injunctions?
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,338.942,339.879,Against damages.
1982.82-167,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,339.879,341.192,But not injunctions?
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,341.192,342.144,Not against injunctions.
1982.82-167,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,344.174,344.596,Yes.
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,344.596,352.702,If the special functions of the individual could not be effectively carried out without absolute immunity.
1982.82-167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,352.702,367.118,"Well, Butz also distinguished, didn't it, immunity, absolute immunity, from suit for common law torts, as compared to constitutional violations where it indicated qualified immunity."
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,367.118,367.462,Yes.
1982.82-167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,395.263,400.651,Well we're dealing with alleged constitutional torts or violations here.
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,400.651,402.822,--Yes.
1982.82-167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,402.822,405.525,How do you distinguish the Wilkes cases?
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,405.525,423.486,"The Wilkes case, which was the 1851 decision of this Court which recognized that, at least at that time, a military superior could be sued by essentially... for essentially assault and battery, is distinguished on several grounds."
1982.82-167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,497.394,502.595,Do you think the plaintiffs here could ask for injunctive or declaratory relief?
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,502.595,504.298,Not at this point.
1982.82-167,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.17,591.263,"But if you can't get an injunction here, it wouldn't be because of immunity."
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,591.263,595.166,"--If you could not get an injunction here, it would not be because of immunity."
1982.82-167,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,599.899,602.804,That was a prayer for declaratory and injunctive relief.
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,602.804,605.288,"--The declaratory and injunctive relief would be separate, that's correct."
1982.82-167,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,618.954,625.217,Your argument is that a Bivens cause of action just shouldn't lie in this context at all.
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,625.217,627.061,It should not lie in this context at all.
1982.82-167,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,627.061,628.185,Whether for damages or for an injunction.
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,628.185,635.229,"Whether for damages or for injunctive relief, but we do not rely on absolute immunity when we're discussing the equitable question."
1982.82-167,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,635.229,655.236,"If a claim was brought by someone in the military, Marine Corps, for example, and said that the training course was excessively harsh and violent and they suffered injury, where would that kind of claim stand under the Federal Tort Claims Act?"
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,655.236,658.954,"Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, that case would not lie."
1982.82-167,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,678.507,679.898,How does that bear here?
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,679.898,683.271,I think that decision bears here in this sense.
1982.82-167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,843.785,850.939,"Mr. McGrath, I guess the plaintiffs also filed under Section 1985(3)."
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,850.939,855.063,"They did file under 1985(3), yes, Justice O'Connor."
1982.82-167,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,855.063,859.078,The briefs don't deal with that very extensively.
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,900.498,905.637,"Well, it would be our position that it does not reach actions by federal officials in any event."
1982.82-167,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,979.763,987.307,Now would all of the personnel actions involved here have been subject to review?
1982.82-167,0,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,987.307,987.948,Yes.
1982.82-167,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1135.169,1137.138,Thank you.
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1138.231,1150.413,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it may please the Court."
1982.82-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1216.903,1219.323,How high up does this go?
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1231.615,1246.376,"No, we think it only applies to the officers that were involved in the intentional acts of discrimination against the black people who were on that ship and which deprived them of their constitutional rights."
1982.82-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1246.376,1258.136,What if they had... what if they had taken their complaint to the Admiral of the Fleet and the Admiral had brushed it off and said these are military command matters.
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1261.228,1265.007,"No, I don't believe so."
1982.82-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1275.676,1278.502,What if an allegation was that the Admiral tolerated this conduct?
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1281.986,1291.731,"Well, if he condoned it and in some way participated in it, then I believe that he would definitely be responsible."
1982.82-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1291.731,1300.742,"I'm trying... mine is just after the event, the allegation is that these matters were brought to his attention and he did nothing about them."
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1300.742,1330.699,"Well, the thing is if he had the authority and the responsibility to take action against these individuals and he knew that the commander was involved in intentional racial discrimination and he failed to take any action, then I believe that he would also be a participant and would be responsible for the discriminatory acts if they were continuing and he knew that they were continuing."
1982.82-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1330.699,1345.631,"What if he responded by pointing to the provisions of the Code of Military Justice that permits the enlisted personnel to make complaints against their officers and said, here are your remedies?"
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1345.631,1348.926,"I'm sorry, I don't understand your question, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.82-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1350.035,1358.204,"Well, there are other remedies for military personnel within the structure of the military, are there not?"
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1358.204,1361.141,"Yes, that is correct."
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1466.458,1468.142,How about appeals from Captains Masts?
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1471.36,1476.484,"--No, there was one appeal in this, there was one Article--"
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1476.484,1477.764,I mean you had that right to appeal.
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1477.764,1480.544,"--Yes, you do have a right, it isn't automatic, that is correct."
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1480.544,1482.138,You have a right to appeal.
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1482.138,1483.357,"Yes, that is correct."
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1483.357,1484.933,And they could have.
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1484.933,1487.98,There was only one Article 50 in this particular case--
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1487.98,1491.603,"Well, they said several Captains Masts, I read in the appendix."
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1491.603,1507.534,"--No, there was only one Article 50 and that was regarding Lemons and the fact that he was punished for one infraction of leaving his clothes when another person was not... a white person was not punished."
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1507.534,1509.141,"But he could have appealed that, couldn't he?"
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1509.141,1509.704,"Yes, that's correct."
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1532.898,1533.976,But he wasn't denied the right to appeal.
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1539.302,1542.348,"--No, no, I said he didn't exercise it, that's correct."
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1542.348,1544.847,"I mean, we don't have to go all the way with you, do we?"
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1544.847,1546.503,"That's correct, sir."
1982.82-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1822.128,1826.69,"Would you limit this sort of relief to peacetime, or would you carry it into wartime?"
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1826.69,1830.594,"No, we just limit it to peacetime, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.82-167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1860.644,1867.813,"I thought they said they oppose it in this case, not because of immunity, but because of other considerations."
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1867.813,1869.594,--That is correct.
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1895.426,1897.863,Let me ask you just a simple question.
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1913.857,1921.042,"Well, the ship would probably have to go to Timbuktu."
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1923.745,1926.213,"You don't doubt that, do you?"
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1926.213,1927.821,Don't doubt it for one minute.
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1927.821,1930.898,What happens to the case?
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1930.898,1939.035,"They have to wait until they get back, unless they transferred some of the people off the ship, which happens in many cases when you--"
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1939.035,1940.926,Including the commander of the ship?
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1940.926,1941.895,--Pardon?
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1941.895,1943.551,Is the commander going to depart?
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1943.551,1945.003,"No, the commander would go."
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1951.141,1952.532,"You couldn't stop him from going, could you?"
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1952.532,1954.937,"--No, that's correct."
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1958.904,1960.388,But can't you see a whole lot of problems?
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1960.388,1965.978,"Well, Your Honor, we can just continue the case."
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1967.712,1973.585,"It might go back to what this Court said in Bivens, that you ought to move very cautiously."
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1977.444,1979.239,"Yes, that is correct, Justice Marshall."
1982.82-167,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1979.239,1982.519,And don't you urge us to move very cautiously here?
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,1982.519,1985.893,"Yes, I do urge you to move cautiously here, Your Honor, that is correct."
1982.82-167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.169,2168.335,"I take it, then, you wouldn't you would say Congress could say, in providing remedies before the Corrections Board of Corrections, for example, that this remedy shall be exclusive."
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2168.335,2170.771,"Yes, that is correct."
1982.82-167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.771,2183.595,"If they actually said it and it wouldn't make any if they said it, it wouldn't change the situation much if it was a lot a pretty poor remedy."
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2183.595,2189.42,"Well, the thing is, Congress could say that but then there'd be a different issue, Justice White."
1982.82-167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2204.695,2223.751,Well I think what if we happened to disagree with you and thought that the provision of these other remedies for some or all of these acts was intended by Congress to be the exclusive remedy--
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2223.751,2225.437,"--Well, the thing is--"
1982.82-167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2225.437,2231.372,--and at least it presents the sort of a situation where you should not imply Bivens remedy.
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2237.822,2263.718,"--Well, we think this Court in Carlson v. Green stated that the remedy of the Federal Tort Claims Act is not adequate for prisoners because it does not provide the type of relief that the Constitution requires and that these other relief that have been passed by Congress was not adequate in vindicating the constitutional rights."
1982.82-167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2263.718,2272.48,"But we didn't suggest that Congress couldn't have provided that there wouldn't be a Bivens remedy in the Carlson against Green situation, did we?"
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2272.48,2274.291,"No, that's correct."
1982.82-167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2281.351,2283.179,They can provide a remedy and they can also make it exclusive.
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2283.179,2284.616,--That is correct.
1982.82-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2345.92,2348.418,"If the discipline breaks down, they can use the brig, can't they?"
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2348.418,2349.075,--Excuse me.
1982.82-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2349.075,2354.399,"If the discipline really breaks down, they can use the brig or whatever the equivalent is on board ship."
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2354.399,2356.43,"Yes, that is correct."
1982.82-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2425.856,2428.356,Do you think it'll encourage suits out of the Ninth Circuit?
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2428.356,2435.196,"No, I don't think it would encourage suits any more than it would now, because of the fact that--"
1982.82-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2435.196,2449.659,"The Ninth Circuit, if we hadn't taken the case, do you suggest this would have no impact on suits by military personnel against their officers?"
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2449.659,2455.595,"--Well, I wouldn't say it would have no impact at all, but I'm saying that essentially there's an economic question here."
1982.82-167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.949,2513.151,"But if you win, what will happen?"
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2513.151,2517.273,"Well, if we win, Your Honor, Justice White--"
1982.82-167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2517.273,2518.507,You did win in the Ninth Circuit.
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2518.507,2519.101,--That's correct.
1982.82-167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2614.969,2618.452,Are they state military officers or federals in that case?
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2618.452,2622.56,"I believe that was the U.S. Navy, Your Honor."
1982.82-167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2622.56,2624.622,Didn't you say Sherrier against Rhodes?
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2624.622,2628.511,"No, I said Dinsman v. Wilkes."
1982.82-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2630.073,2635.446,"Sherrier against Rhodes was the state militia, National Guard."
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2640.101,2641.288,"Yes, that's right."
1982.82-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2696.062,2707.401,"I don't recall your brief, but did you refer to any cases in the British Navy or the British Army prior to 1776 where suits against officers of the British were sustained?"
1982.82-167,1,31995,john_murcko,,2707.401,2708.198,"Yes, that's correct."
1982.82-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2747.745,2748.79,Thank you.
1982.82-167,2,32125,j_paul_mcgrath,,2750.806,2753.477,"I have nothing further, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.82-167,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2753.477,2755.164,"Thank you, gentlemen."
