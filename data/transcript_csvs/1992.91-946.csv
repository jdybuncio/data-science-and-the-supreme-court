1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,16.693,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-946, Church of Scientology of California v. United States and Frank S. Zolin."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,52.366,52.649,Thank you.
1992.91-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,188.321,198.962,"Well, Mr. Lieberman, I take it all the issues on the merits in this litigation are finished."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,203.064,205.783,"Well, no, Your Honor, I don't believe that's true."
1992.91-946,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,256.048,262.972,And you did not take... certiorari was not granted from that order.
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,266.189,268.289,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-946,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,270.908,274.529,"So, it's the law of the case that the court is not going to consider these transcripts."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,274.529,275.012,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1992.91-946,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,319.141,320.674,"Well, but isn't that the problem?"
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,323.593,330.949,"--Well, there was no reason to, Your Honor, because we were being remanded for the opportunity to raise it in the district court."
1992.91-946,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,351.612,358.849,Are these transcripts just duplicate copies of the materials that are... the principal materials in issue?
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,358.849,362.385,"Well, they're partial transcripts, Your Honor, and--"
1992.91-946,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,362.385,371.241,"So, everything in the transcript was covered by the documents themselves, and we've said you can look at the documents themselves in order to determine the privilege."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,375.245,392.17,"--Well, one thing that we were urging below, Your Honor, was that the district court look at the entire tapes because we believe that they would show that the privilege still remained."
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,441.02,449.943,"But if the district court wouldn't consider it, and you say it has happened since the Ninth Circuit ruled in this case that we're hearing now--"
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,449.943,451.811,"--It gets a little confusing, Your Honor."
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,451.811,453.445,--It certainly does.
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,453.445,465.203,"Since the Ninth Circuit ruled and the opinion reported at 905 F. 2d, which is not the opinion from which this certiorari petition was granted, the Ninth Circuit remanded to the district court."
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,502.411,509.398,"Well, what relief could the Ninth Circuit have granted you had it heard your appeal on the merits?"
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,509.398,512.265,The Ninth Circuit could have granted us the following relief.
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,522.741,524.191,What good would that do you?
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,524.191,526.109,The IRS wouldn't get the documents.
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,526.109,527.809,"But they have the documents, don't they?"
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,527.809,538.517,"Well, but... oh, and then it could have required the IRS to return the documents and the copies, just as this Court ordered, for example, the Justice Department to do in the Sells case."
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,538.517,541.553,"Well, but the documents wouldn't go to you."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,545.255,546.857,"Under seal, Your Honor."
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,546.857,549.059,"Well, what good would that have done you?"
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,549.059,552.61,It would have protected our privacy interest in the documents.
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,552.61,554.426,After they've already copied what they want to copy?
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,554.426,555.728,No.
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,561.782,571.722,"Well, but to say to return the copies as well suggests that you want an order precluding their use in any future proceedings."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,571.722,572.924,"No, that's not right, Your Honor."
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,642.318,649.155,"I thought in Sells, the Court said we can prevent future disclosure or further disclosure."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,649.155,650.607,--Let me be quite clear about that.
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,650.607,655.761,"Well, I think you should be clearer than you were when you just described Sells."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,655.761,663.582,"In Sells, the issue was not whether there were going to be further disclosures from the grand jury to the Justice Department."
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,664.534,666.634,Further disclosures within the Justice Department.
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,666.634,667.136,--That's right.
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,682.478,686.847,"So, you're talking about something that is going to happen in the future."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,686.847,687.18,No.
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,688.632,689.215,Continuing access.
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,689.215,690.265,"--going on today, tomorrow--"
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,690.265,691.917,"Well, but not in the past."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,691.917,693.151,--Not in the past.
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,693.703,705.844,"And so, what good is an order like that to say that the IRS shall not further look at your copies, which perhaps would be the counterpart of the Sells order?"
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,707.627,711.664,"Well, precisely the same good that it was going to do the person in the Sells case, Your Honor."
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,711.664,721.87,"Well, but the complaint in Sells was that these people were disclosing things among themselves, and that it would keep right on going."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,721.87,723.555,Precisely the same thing as here too.
1992.91-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.78,745.969,"Well, how is it that so many courts of appeals haven't really caught on to this argument of yours?"
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,745.969,750.873,"Well, that's a very good question, Your Honor, and I think if you look at the cases--"
1992.91-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,750.873,752.573,"There are only 10 of them, aren't there?"
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,752.573,753.007,--That's right.
1992.91-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,770.953,773.655,"Well, you mean they haven't analyzed it like you have."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,773.655,777.357,"--I submit that if you look at them, they haven't analyzed it very much at all."
1992.91-946,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,797.353,797.903,Excuse me.
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,799.972,801.488,--That's not clear from--
1992.91-946,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.488,803.007,"Well, then it's not clear that it was moot."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,803.007,804.257,"--Well, that's true."
1992.91-946,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,804.257,805.274,That's not what you said.
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,805.274,805.959,That's true.
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,809.244,816.148,"I suggest you try to be more accurate, Counsel, in your description of the cases."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,816.148,820.969,"--Your Honor, the Fifth Circuit in Lawhon specifically stated the documents were returned to the taxpayer."
1992.91-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,840.597,849.803,"Well, if I take you literally, every single case was like the Fifth Circuit case; namely, the documents had been returned."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,849.803,851.155,"--No, but that's not true."
1992.91-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.155,853.107,"Well, that isn't what you--"
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,853.107,853.59,That's not true.
1992.91-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.659,859.177,--All right.
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,860.127,866.598,"--The other cases, the documents weren't returned, and therefore we think they were incorrectly decided."
1992.91-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,866.598,876.271,"Mr. Lieberman, there's a similar statute for subpoena power that covers the FTC."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,877.138,878.154,"That's precisely right, Justice O'Connor."
1992.91-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,878.154,882.94,Is the language of that statute the same as here?
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,882.94,894.748,"The language of that statute, as with this statute, permits... authorizes the Federal courts to enforce a subpoena order when the FTC brings a proceeding."
1992.91-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,905.806,914.662,"There are a series of cases in which the FTC has subpoenaed material in the course of its investigations, I suppose."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,914.662,915.362,That's correct.
1992.91-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,915.362,926.885,And in which the appellate courts have held that they still have jurisdiction to order a return of the documents--
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,926.885,927.404,That's correct.
1992.91-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,927.404,928.871,--subpoenaed and the copies?
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,928.871,930.856,That's precisely correct.
1992.91-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.114,1003.952,"Well, why don't you just say that the case can't possibly be moot since at least the original of the tapes is your property?"
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1003.952,1007.873,"Well, Your Honor, because the original of the tapes is still--"
1992.91-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1007.873,1008.239,"Well, whatever--"
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1008.239,1011.158,--with the Superior Court of Los Angeles County.
1992.91-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1017.712,1028.703,"--And so, you have no right to the copy unless you win the... this case on your ground."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1028.703,1030.638,That's right.
1992.91-946,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.638,1036.023,May I ask kind of a general question that... I always have trouble figuring out what the people are fighting about here.
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1042.077,1042.529,That's correct.
1992.91-946,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1042.529,1049.766,"And the other thing that's in the back of my mind is your... the individual client is deceased now, so there's no danger of criminal proceedings against him."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1055.504,1080.386,"Well, Your Honor, if we're correct that there is no ongoing investigation, then the risk is simply the risk that any citizen faces in having his or her private papers in the possession of the Government for it to rummage through or use as it wishes when there's no particular legitimate law enforcement or other purpose for it having done so."
1992.91-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1081.837,1086.472,"Well, that's just some imaginary person."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1086.472,1088.407,"--Well, I don't know whether it's an imaginary person."
1992.91-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.333,1110.937,Is it going to hurt your clients if the investigation is all over?
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1110.937,1122.978,"Well, Congress thought it would, Your Honor, because Congress provided a scheme whereby the IRS, when it seeks documents in the summons proceeding... its summons is not self-executing."
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1150.147,1152.683,"But that's just another argument on the merits, isn't it?"
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1160.603,1161.27,That's right.
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1163.072,1165.907,That's not an argument why this case isn't moot.
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1165.907,1169.026,"Well, I was addressing the specific question."
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1169.026,1171.061,You're addressing the merits of your argument--
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1171.061,1171.378,Yes.
1992.91-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1171.378,1173.128,--for reversal of the district court order.
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1185.754,1202.497,"No, not under the order that the district court granted in the original case and which the court of appeals affirmed and which this Court affirmed by an equally divided Court."
1992.91-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1206.549,1215.055,"So, the risk of further disclosure is limited to employees of the IRS?"
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1215.055,1216.071,That's right.
1992.91-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1226.678,1251.311,"So, it may be a smaller risk, in effect, than would be the case with the FTC, I suppose, where very significant client information or even information about how goods are made or produced could be obtained by the public if they weren't returned."
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1256.898,1267.855,"--Well, I'm not sure that the FTC would ordinarily be free to just make public documents it obtained through a subpoena in a situation like that."
1992.91-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.465,1346.122,Have you exhausted your remedies below to get these papers back now that the investigation is over?
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1346.122,1350.093,I think we've done everything that one could possibly imagine.
1992.91-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1357.163,1364.001,"Well, I know, but what has happened since the investigation is over?"
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1364.001,1365.286,"Well, it's very interesting, Your Honor."
1992.91-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1365.286,1375.375,"Well, have you asked for the papers back where you say, look, the investigation is over, and you've made copies of our papers, and we have an interest in getting them back?"
1992.91-946,0,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,1375.375,1377.844,"Well, not since this case went up, Your Honor."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1683.458,1687.695,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-946,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1799.702,1813.943,"I suppose our problem is that if we're going to discuss mootness, we should undertake some analysis of the remedies that might be available below, and in this case, it doesn't look like the petitioner is going to prevail in any event."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1816.126,1828.434,"It is indeed, and I thought we had satisfied our duty to the Court in pointing out these problems in our brief in opposition, perhaps not as elaborately as one might."
1992.91-946,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1834.838,1854.732,"Well, Mr. Wallace, I think my concern is really the effect of saying this case is moot, what effect that would have in the FTC context where I think people have a lot at stake there in getting back their documents."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1863.088,1875.213,"I quite agree with you that the courts have followed a different track, certainly the D.C. Circuit, in the Federal Trade Commission cases."
1992.91-946,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1887.639,1903.565,"Well, I mean, the plain fact is there's a lot at stake in leaving some of this privileged information in the hands of offices that have no further use for them."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1903.565,1915.556,"There can be protective orders, and there are various statutory restrictions on disclosure of confidential information."
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1947.427,1952.146,"Yes, Mr. Wallace, but those are statutory protections for the taxpayers."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1952.146,1952.581,That is correct.
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1952.581,1961.354,"And one of the issues before was whether in addition to the statutory protections, the district court had any authority to enter specific protective provisions."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1965.656,1969.858,"Well, that is our position in litigation in other cases."
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1974.594,1975.244,Right.
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1975.244,1978.063,"So, that issue is no longer open in this case."
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1999.544,2001.346,Isn't your... can I just kind of ask you?
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2044.758,2050.411,"--Well, there probably is authority in dealing with subpoenas under other statutes."
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2050.411,2050.812,"No, no."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2051.761,2064.67,"Under this statute, there is a statutory requirement that production, when it's ordered, be for a reasonable time and under reasonable circumstances."
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2089.204,2098.059,"But can the order... my question is really can the district court say to you I think the reasonable time is 30 days, return them after 30 days?"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2102.677,2118.056,"It's rather seldom done in these summons enforcement orders, but there would be nothing wrong with that because one could even argue that there's a condition implied in law when the summons is enforced--"
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2118.056,2119.606,"Well, then if he has that authority--"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2119.606,2123.627,--that we can only keep the originals for a reasonable time under 7605(a).
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2123.627,2129.781,"--If the judge has that authority, could he not say there's no request for it at the time of the delivery?"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2141.086,2163.168,"Well, we think that once a production has occurred, the jurisdiction of the court has ended under the narrow jurisdiction conferred to enforce an Internal Revenue summons, but that the court, as any court does, retains authority to enforce its order."
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2187.617,2202.893,"Well, why wouldn't there be an implied condition in a case like this that the copies... if the original or copies are being used by the Government, they shall not be kept any... for any period of time beyond the time they serve some useful purpose?"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2202.893,2204.995,"Well, because that--"
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2204.995,2213.685,"If that was an implied condition, then under your explanation, the judge would have the power to say, well, look, you've had these things for 7 years and you haven't done anything."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2214.201,2235.8,--That would be an implied condition that would contradict the overall pattern of statute and decision law concerning judicial anticipation and direction of Internal Revenue Service investigations.
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.489,2357.079,"On that very point of voluntary compliance, supposing I turned over the minute books, I got the subpoena, I gave you the minute books, and you used them."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2367.601,2373.589,"--Without a court order in the first place, you said--"
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2373.589,2375.307,Just... they just complied with the subpoena.
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2375.307,2376.091,--turned over by voluntary compliance.
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2376.091,2379.259,"And then 3 years later, I say, gee, I want those... my records back."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2383.277,2401.941,The answer would be that he could sue for a violation of his rights to get his property back the way he would from any other agency of the Government that property has wrongfully been withheld.
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2401.941,2402.874,Is there any statutory provision--
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2402.874,2404.726,There's no particular statute.
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2404.726,2406.36,--Sort of the common law rights of--
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2406.36,2421.854,He would have to... he would have to do that and bring a Federal question case and come within the very narrow exception to the Tax Anti-Injunction Act that this Court has recognized.
1992.91-946,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2465.614,2480.474,"--Well, what does the... what does the statute requiring production for the IRS... does it say anything more than that the taxpayer shall produce certain books?"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2480.474,2482.576,Nothing more than that at all.
1992.91-946,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2482.576,2488.297,"Well, certainly that can't contemplate that the property interests in the books turns... goes over to the Government."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2488.297,2504.239,"Well, that is correct, Your Honor, and we can only examine them for a reasonable time, but we can during that time and, of course, in the modern practice, make copies of them."
1992.91-946,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2514.947,2518.583,But the originals of these records have been returned to where they got them from--
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2518.583,2519.518,That is correct.
1992.91-946,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2519.518,2520.668,--which is the clerk of the Superior Court.
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2520.668,2521.085,That is correct.
1992.91-946,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2540.849,2549.954,"Mr. Wallace, there were two previous occasions when the tapes were surrendered to the IRS and then ordered returned."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2560.595,2563.162,They were and they dealt with the originals.
1992.91-946,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2568.166,2575.07,Did the Government in those cases... in those instances argue mootness or raise this same--
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2575.07,2584.377,"We did not because, as I recall, we had not even made copies at that point, as we explained in our brief."
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2616.849,2624.419,"--Mr. Wallace, can I ask you another question about... just a general question, not the details of this very complex case."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2643.047,2650.57,--The copies are not to be... we recognize no obligation to return copies to anyone.
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2650.57,2651.103,"So, your view is--"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2651.103,2652.955,The copies are not anyone else's property.
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2652.955,2665.929,"--Just so that I understand this, if you do manage to get... successfully subpoena something and overcome an objection to production, you have an absolute statutory right to retain copies forever."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2665.929,2670.899,"Well, of course, we don't for our own purposes do that."
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2670.899,2672.166,"I know you don't do that, but that's what the law would authorize you to."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2672.166,2683.307,"But that is correct, as well as anything else that we have learned in our investigation as a result of having scrutinized the originals, whether we made copies or not."
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2683.307,2683.707,No.
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2692.397,2694.515,Copies like notes or like further--
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2694.515,2695.132,"I mean, the answer is yes."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2695.815,2696.884,--The answer is yes.
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2752.637,2761.243,"Mr. Wallace, leaving aside the question of whether that argument should succeed or not, are they barred from raising it below?"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2761.243,2778.253,"Well, we think that it was all res judicata, but as I said, we argued that to the court of appeals, but they didn't reach that argument because they accepted our other argument, that the contention was moot."
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2778.253,2785.191,"But it's not moot if, in fact, they may raise this issue."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2789.81,2798.249,"Well, that... they do... there is a controversy asserted between the parties."
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2807.372,2807.772,"Okay, no."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2819.18,2821.215,"Well, that is the mootness issue."
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2821.682,2823.917,"So, that's properly... so, that's properly before us."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2823.917,2825.134,--Exactly.
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2826.117,2830.085,"And if we think that issue ought to be explored, we could remand for that purpose."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2830.085,2832.604,"--Well, but the--"
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2832.604,2834.604,Couldn't we?
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2834.604,2835.556,--Well--
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2835.556,2842.81,Couldn't we say that they were entitled to explore that on the merits before the Ninth Circuit and they were not allowed to do so?
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2842.81,2844.245,"--Well, that is the mootness question."
1992.91-946,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2864.44,2864.808,"Well, your--"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2864.808,2866.525,--the merits if they're correct on mootness.
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2866.525,2869.11,"--Well, did they... excuse me, Chief."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2882.287,2892.325,"Well, there were restrictions on use in this order that this Court upheld by an equally divided Court last time around, United States against Zolin."
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2892.325,2896.194,Were they the same rescrictions that they're talking about now?
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2896.194,2896.594,No.
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2900.081,2908.771,"And so, you're saying they should have raised any request for restriction the first time around, and that goes back to your argument they can't raise these things seriatim."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2908.771,2909.387,That is correct.
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2909.387,2910.021,"Yes, okay."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2910.021,2914.841,"That's our res judicata point, but that's not our argument to this Court."
1992.91-946,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2914.841,2915.675,I recognize that.
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2934.986,2949.162,"That is not a form of relief open to the district court sitting in a summons enforcement proceeding, and therefore the summons enforcement proceeding, which is all that the court of appeals had before it, is moot."
1992.91-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2952.864,2963.589,"Mr. Wallace, why isn't... you acknowledge that any implicit terms of the order can be enforced by subsequent action of the court."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2989.556,3004.316,"--Well, because there's no statutory requirement that the Government return copies or other fruits of the disclosure after the disclosure has occurred."
1992.91-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3004.316,3006.435,"I know that, but that's why it's implicit."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3017.622,3050.88,"The question before you is whether that contention can be made in a summons enforcement proceeding after the records have been produced, whether that proceeding can extend to monitoring of the IRS' investigation by requiring that what the IRS has learned from the production be expunged from the IRS' records in one way or another."
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3050.88,3057.449,"So, we could properly decide the case based on Justice Scalia's suggestion."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3057.449,3067.889,One could decide it except there is no statutory basis for it as there is for return of the originals after a reasonable time--
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3067.889,3069.507,I thought the return of the originals--
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3069.507,3070.157,--in 7605(a).
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3070.157,3072.459,--after a reasonable time was also implied.
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3072.459,3081.731,I said it's implied because of the... it's implied in the order because it's express in the statute.
1992.91-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3083.681,3087.219,"The Government doesn't have the original anymore anyway, does it?"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3087.219,3087.852,It does not.
1992.91-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3090.337,3093.372,But when did you make the copies?
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3093.372,3095.088,--I can't tell you precisely.
1992.91-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3096.574,3113.184,"Well, at the second time... the second time that the Government was ordered to return the documents, on March 13 the district court ordered that any copies of the tapes and any notes or transcripts in possession of the Government be returned to the district court."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3120.504,3123.273,"Yes, we had nothing but the originals."
1992.91-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3123.273,3123.892,"So, the copies--"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3123.892,3124.742,And we returned them.
1992.91-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3129.094,3130.296,"--Oh, when did you make them?"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3130.296,3137.05,We made them later after we got the records on this last go-around from the district court.
1992.91-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.05,3142.286,"Yes, but at the time of this order, the original had already been returned, I think."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3142.286,3149.273,But then we got them back in this latest round at the district court.
1992.91-946,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3213.616,3219.52,But the statute says that the court exercises its jurisdiction by appropriate process.
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3226.34,3228.542,--I think it's really the same.
1992.91-946,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3229.442,3245.004,"So, by appropriate order, wouldn't... if we can interpolate that with your consent, would that not indicate that the court can use its discretion in protecting the interest of the owner of the documents?"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3245.004,3255.11,"--Well, as I started to explain, to some extent, to the extent that it doesn't contradict other provisions of the Code."
1992.91-946,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3255.11,3260.513,"Well, it's just as a condition to their being produced."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3260.513,3265.917,"Yes, and there were conditions imposed here which were upheld by the court."
1992.91-946,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3288.848,3298.656,"But if the court could make all of those orders in conjunction with the production order, surely it could retain jurisdiction."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3298.656,3301.84,It retains jurisdiction to enforce its order.
1992.91-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3311.696,3312.196,"Mr. Wallace, what about the originals?"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3326.706,3340.179,"Well, as I said, because of 7605, we can only inspect originals that belong to the person on whom we've served the summons for a reasonable period of time."
1992.91-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3343.548,3343.965,"Oh, no."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3364.295,3370.615,"Well, I think the case would have been moot before the court of appeals on the merits of the production order."
1992.91-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3370.615,3370.899,"You have to take my hypothetical, Mr. Wallace--"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3370.899,3371.149,Yes.
1992.91-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3371.149,3371.465,--and how I've given it there.
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3371.465,3373.234,"Well, I'm taking your hypothetical."
1992.91-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3379.821,3381.788,Cannot even get the originals back.
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3384.673,3387.474,He can take an appeal if he thinks the--
1992.91-946,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3387.474,3387.993,You have to get a stay.
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3387.993,3397.016,--district court has misconstrued his order and is erring in not enforcing it properly.
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3412.857,3413.957,"Well, I thought your position was he had to--"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3413.957,3414.792,--whether the case would become moot.
1992.91-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3414.792,3417.578,--put himself in contempt of court in order to appeal.
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3425.248,3426.95,That's the end of this proceeding.
1992.91-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3426.95,3434.789,"Well, how does one ever enforce against the Government the obligation to return the original within a reasonable time?"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3436.639,3444.811,The summons enforcement case is moot except for enforcing the order compelling the summons.
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3460.905,3463.107,"Well, that might be for return of property."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3463.107,3463.59,Right.
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3463.59,3466.975,But is that going to be broad enough to allow for restrictions on use?
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3466.975,3470.527,We don't think restrictions on use are proper to be posed.
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3470.527,3482.401,"You agree... certainly you don't think there should be any restrictions on use, but if a taxpayer wants to raise it, can he at least have a shot at raising it by the process you describe?"
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3482.401,3499.161,"Well, some of the cases we have cited in our lengthy footnote about the Tax Anti-Injunction Act were ones that said that attempts to get restrictions on use were not within the Enochs against Williams Packing Company exception."
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3499.161,3508.969,"So, therefore, if that's the law, he will never have an opportunity to raise a restriction on use unless he, in effect, refuses to turn it over, unless the Government agrees to such a restriction."
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3508.969,3516.123,"Or until proceedings are brought against him, which is the time to move--"
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3516.123,3516.739,For involuntary--
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3516.739,3517.173,--for suppression--
1992.91-946,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3517.173,3517.589,--Right.
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3517.589,3528.096,--under this Court's jurisprudence and not in an anticipatory way getting the courts in to supervise and delay the conduct of IRS investigations and collections.
1992.91-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3533.084,3540.421,You would say to wait in this case wouldn't do them any good because it's res judicata.
1992.91-946,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3540.421,3543.356,"Well, it happens to be res judicata in this case."
1992.91-946,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3549.427,3550.546,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1992.91-946,2,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,3553.664,3555.581,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.91-946,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3573.225,3575.708,When?
1992.91-946,2,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,3575.708,3587.985,"When the Government returned the copies on March 14, 1991, after having received them the second time... and this is noted on the docket--"
1992.91-946,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3587.985,3593.27,"So, they had copies at the time the... that the district court ordered them to return the copies."
1992.91-946,2,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,3593.27,3594.305,--That's right.
1992.91-946,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3597.507,3602.125,Had they had copies at the time the district court first ordered them to return?
1992.91-946,2,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,3602.125,3604.744,"--Yes, they did, and those were returned as well."
1992.91-946,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3604.744,3607.463,"And yet, the Government never claimed the case was moot at that time."
1992.91-946,2,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,3607.463,3620.456,"That's precisely correct, and by their action in seeking them for a third time, they thereby demonstrated that the case was not moot because the relief had been effectual."
1992.91-946,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3620.456,3620.973,"Well, did they have--"
1992.91-946,2,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,3620.973,3621.806,They needed them again.
1992.91-946,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3621.806,3623.741,--Did they have copies of each and every document?
1992.91-946,2,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,3623.741,3626.777,"Yes, absolutely."
1992.91-946,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3626.777,3629.979,"Well, so the Government is just wrong in saying that they didn't have copies."
1992.91-946,2,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,3629.979,3632.029,That's precisely correct.
1992.91-946,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3632.029,3633.581,How do we know that?
1992.91-946,2,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,3633.581,3649.757,"It's in the record, Your Honor; if you look at the docket sheet on items number 75 and 77 on pages 74 and 75 of the excerpts of record."
1992.91-946,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3680.895,3687.966,"But you know, there are other areas of the law where you... you're compelled to stand on your rights."
1992.91-946,2,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,3706.193,3709.645,"Well, you raise a very interesting question which we raise in this case, Your Honor."
1992.91-946,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3735.03,3735.613,"Yes, I had forgotten that."
1992.91-946,2,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,3735.613,3738.148,--where the taxpayer had no opportunity to do so.
1992.91-946,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3738.814,3739.397,"Thank you, Mr. Lieberman."
