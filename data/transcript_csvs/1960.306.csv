1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,26.926,31.209,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1960.306,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,807.937,811.53,Do you challenge the findings of the Commission?
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,811.53,812.424,"Yes, sir."
1960.306,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,812.424,812.968,You do?
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,812.968,813.505,"Yes, sir."
1960.306,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,813.505,815.158,"Yes, you have come to that --"
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,815.158,815.632,"Yes, sir."
1960.306,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,817.293,818.192,Right.
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,818.192,837.579,"Now, as in the recent through route joint rate cases, the question of whether Section 15 (4) which puts restrictions on the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to prescribe through routes is a very important feature in this litigation."
1960.306,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,884.242,887.696,Have we agreed with your position to that question?
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,889.528,893.224,"Alright sir, the next question then is --"
1960.306,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,893.224,897.083,"Well, I say, do we reach the other ones that we agree with you with 15 (4)?"
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,897.083,899.751,I'm sorry I thought you wanted me to proceed to the next question.
1960.306,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,942.22,953.216,"Am I right in taking, Mr. Merrill that the questions you're addressing yourself to now is the only question of laws before as the others as sufficiency -- sufficiency of the evidence --"
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,953.216,953.731,We contend --
1960.306,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,953.731,954.793,-- of findings?
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,954.793,971.889,"We do contend that with respect to through routes? there -- there are, as a matter of law, through routes on the basis of decisions which say that joint rates as a matter of law presuppose through routes and we argue that the existing joint rates established those through routes."
1960.306,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,984.159,990.919,"If we don't agree with you on your first issue, then are all the other -- other things in the case?"
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,990.919,992.471,"I would say this, Your Honor."
1960.306,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1790.078,1800.383,"I -- I understood you that there is no case, however, where -- where each line owns half of the stock."
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,1800.383,1803.98,"There is a case where two lines owned eight-ninths of the stock, sir."
1960.306,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1803.98,1807.941,"Yes, quite well, either -- either of them would be minority owners, there --"
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,1807.941,1813.362,Either would be minority and so with two lines so each owned 50% being minority owner.
1960.306,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1813.362,1815.257,Okay.
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,1815.257,1827.698,Webster defines a minority owner is having the both so less than the amount necessary to control and that requires something over at 50% as I interpret the language.
1960.306,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1827.698,1840.869,"Do you think there would be no difference at all between the case where two owned 50% and the case where, let's say, two of them together owned 51%."
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,1840.869,1851.011,"As long as the two owning the 51% can and do elect the majority of the Board of Directors, I would say they have the power jointly to control the corporation."
1960.306,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1851.011,1854.174,So you would say there would be no difference at all between the two cases.
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,1854.174,1869.085,"I would go further sir, I would say that if in this case there were two carriers, so each owned 49% of the corporation of the subsidiary and one carrier who owned only 2%, the carrier with 2% would have just as much power as those two with 49."
1960.306,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1888.41,1889.343,Mr. Merrill --
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,1889.343,1889.65,"Yes, sir."
1960.306,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1889.65,1912.839,"-- suppose we dispense with the corporate form and two competing independent railroads as partners build a line or buy one that extends as a connecting line, their lines onto the State of West Coast."
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,1922.764,1927.712,"There would not be a separate railroad, as I understand your question, sir."
1960.306,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2446.602,2447.693,What is that case?
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,2447.693,2450.464,Helix Milling Company case You Honor.
1960.306,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2524.988,2527.933,Is this before Great Northern had an interest in S. P. & S.
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,2527.933,2533.873,This is the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific have always joined owned the S. P. & S.
1960.306,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2533.873,2535.604,They did own part of it at that time?
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,2535.604,2540.355,"Oh yes, sir, since 1910, and this was 42 years later."
1960.306,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2827.483,2838.958,"Does that what you mean, Mr. Merrill, to argue that through routes exist in all (Inaudible)"
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,2838.958,2860.155,"I am arguing up to this point, sir, that where there are joint rates on all commodities over a certain route, that is our line in this case from the Twin Cities to Spokane that through routes exist for those commodities because joint rates, this Court has held, of a necessity presuppose through routes."
1960.306,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2871.453,2879.074,"The joint rates, as I understand you, apply through forest products and to export-import goods."
1960.306,0,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,2879.074,2879.438,Yes.
1960.306,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3290.789,3295.009,"You may, Mr. Merrill."
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,3298.153,3301.69,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.306,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3342.921,3345.676,"Was the 15 (4) was involved in that, isn't it?"
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,3345.676,3348.42,"Yes, short-hauling but this --"
1960.306,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3348.42,3349.858,I mean the management and control.
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,3349.858,3360.42,The joint control product we have here -- joint control of S. P. & S. by the two Northern Lines that was not present in the Denver & Rio Grande case.
1960.306,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3360.42,3372.424,"What -- what is the inter -- in terms of the precedent, what is the closest Commission decision on the construction of joint -- of control and management?"
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,3372.424,3395.883,"Two cases were referred to by Mr. Merrill, in which the Commission some years ago held at the St. Louis Terminal Railroad Association, which is owned jointly by 14 or 15 trunk line railroads, that that joint ownership was not joint ownership and control for the purposes of Section 15 (4)."
1960.306,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3395.883,3396.768,That's the closest one?
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,3396.768,3397.48,That's the closest on.
1960.306,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3397.48,3399.337,And you -- you will distinguish that?
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,3399.337,3403.981,"Yes, sir."
1960.306,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3771.866,3779.129,"Handled -- handled by the representatives as a -- as a duality, the two of them together or --"
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,3779.129,3781.407,"Yes, sir."
1960.306,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3788.228,3791.402,What happens then?
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,3791.402,3792.325,(Inaudible)
1960.306,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3792.325,3792.651,What?
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,3792.651,3793.898,(Inaudible)
1960.306,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3794.414,3797.272,(Inaudible) can do it on its own.
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,3797.272,3801.818,"In one category of rate matters, I forgot how to describe it."
1960.306,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4183.037,4202.555,"Mr. Ginnane, you take time valid but before you leave this discussion on 15 (4), would you please tell us what is meant by this phrase through routes may be exist independently of joint rates."
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4202.555,4202.832,Yes.
1960.306,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4202.832,4212.52,"Just what does it mean as used in 15 (4), the phrase ?through routes?."
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4212.52,4215.418,Let me start back a little bit.
1960.306,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4261.231,4261.405,Why not?
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4261.405,4262.353,They can't.
1960.306,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4263.945,4265.742,"Well, that's because the rate so."
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4265.742,4268.57,Except -- except that they're profitably high combination rates.
1960.306,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4268.57,4272.558,And isn't because there may not be a through route but it's because there's no joint rate.
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4272.558,4273.516,That's right.
1960.306,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4308.287,4313.744,"But evidently, this phrase through routes means something more than physical connections."
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4313.744,4325.591,"As this Court so held in the Thompson case, which is one of the -- which is one the Commission's ventures toward open routing and the Commission on effect was taking the position."
1960.306,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4337.788,4349.342,Mr. Merrill says that through routes exist because derived the physical connections and because joint rates do apply as to some commodities.
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4350.303,4352.723,Oh yes on some commodities.
1960.306,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4371.765,4377.498,"Well now, do you agree with him that through rates -- through routes do exist?"
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4377.498,4380.108,Only on certain movements of certain commodities.
1960.306,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4380.108,4384.086,"Well, does -- if -- is 15 (4) limited in any way?"
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4390.453,4391.545,That's right sir.
1960.306,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4391.545,4399.774,"Well now then, what does that mean, on all commodities or on some commodities in order for a through route to exist?"
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4403.185,4416.002,"We think the law is clear under the Thompson case and the Rio Grande case that through routes exist as to particular commodities, not as the commodities as a whole necessarily."
1960.306,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4447.035,4449.183,"Then it's only commodity basis, is it?"
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4449.183,4454.746,A commodity basis and an origin on destination basis.
1960.306,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4455.837,4458.831,It's a not a physical thing at all.
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4458.831,4462.667,"No, sir, it's a commercial thing."
1960.306,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4566.599,4568.557,Did the Commission make that point?
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4568.557,4569.142,No.
1960.306,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4574.241,4579.416,"What are those two cases, the names of them again?"
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4579.696,4579.73,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.306,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4579.73,4580.802,-- are in the brief.
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4606.296,4608.801,At the top of page 47 --
1960.306,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4608.801,4610.527,What's the name of them?
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4612.296,4613.222,They're in everybody's brief.
1960.306,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4613.222,4613.712,Everybody's brief.
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4613.712,4618.448,Absorption of Switching Charges in 157 I.C.C. and Manufacturer's Railway Company.
1960.306,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4618.448,4618.907,"Oh, wait a minute."
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4622.152,4625.574,At the top of page 47 of the appellee railroad's brief.
1960.306,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4625.574,4625.86,"Yes, at page 47."
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4625.86,4627.822,That's the blue brief.
1960.306,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4627.822,4635.927,"Thank you, sir."
1960.306,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4635.927,4641.328,"Now, the appellant's attached great weight to a grammatical analysis of Section 15 (4)."
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,4860.152,4863.177,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1960.306,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4863.177,4863.807,Mr. Rockwood.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,4863.807,4873.784,I -- I appear here for the appellee railroad companies who were dependents or intervening dependents in the lower court.
1960.306,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5054.628,5057.549,Is that what makes it through route?
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,5057.549,5058.819,That is a through route.
1960.306,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5062.971,5070.529,"Otherwise, if all there was required as what you said first, namely, a physical connection, then (Voice overlap) --"
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,5070.529,5071.354,"No, I don't say it."
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5152.672,5160.164,"Well, that's the volume of thing, giving the service so that the shippers who delivers through -- the initial carrier doesn't have to bother about the rest of the (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,5160.164,5160.805,"Well, that's right."
1960.306,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5901.091,5909.582,What is the significance if it were a fact that 125 cars did move at combination rates?
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,5909.582,5925.862,"Well, the significant so far as the Milwaukee is concerned is -- they would argue that that indicated a holding out by the S. P. & S. and the Milwaukee to give through service on anything that want to move via the Spokane route."
1960.306,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5925.862,5928.447,But there would be no published tariff.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,5928.447,5931.215,There doesn't have to be a published tariff.
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5987.813,5996.947,"Well, Mr. Rockwood, wasn't there exampling on file that the I.C.C. that the combination rates may be used as a joint rate over the joint route?"
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,5996.947,5999.309,"I don't believe -- no, I don't believe so Your Honor."
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5999.309,5999.485,You mean the --
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,5999.485,6007.052,I think the mere publication of the through rates would make that the applicable rate under the tariff.
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6007.052,6008.722,If -- well --
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6008.722,6011.55,"Under the tariffs, I should say plural."
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6011.55,6019.202,There is no indication that there is a joint route or does the shipper just go to the initial carrier and find out that there is one?
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6019.202,6026.144,"The shipper just goes to the initial carrier and builds it out from A to B and sometimes he inserts the rates, sometimes he doesn't."
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6026.144,6030.793,"Well, but the carrier wouldn't capriciously when they have a joint route and that makes (Inaudible)"
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6030.793,6031.662,"Not, no."
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6033.66,6036.096,(Inaudible) against that very thing.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6039.283,6041.349,That is one of the most difficult things in the world.
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6070.142,6073.927,What you're saying is that the through route is established through cutting custom.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6073.927,6078.372,"That's right, through holding themselves out as being prepared to new through transportation service."
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6078.372,6080.424,Doesn't even loophole for (Inaudible)
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6080.424,6081.074,That's right.
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6098.055,6109.784,"Because all events, I think if you're right or since you're right that in a hearing like this before the Commission, the existence or nonexistence of a through route to be established as a matter of traffic tariff?"
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6109.784,6110.854,Absolutely.
1960.306,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6124.047,6127.785,"But it was supported both ways in that case, wasn't it?"
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6129.411,6130.694,"Oh, yes."
1960.306,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6142.147,6142.667,That was (Voice Overlap) --
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6142.667,6144.935,"(Inaudible) westbound, I remember."
1960.306,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6144.935,6146.308,That was sustained also?
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6146.308,6147.279,They -- yes sir.
1960.306,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6156.103,6171.836,"I -- I rather gather Mr. Rockwood that what constitutes a through route within the sense here of 15 (4) is pretty much a conclusion of the Commission, how far wrong is that?"
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6171.836,6173.838,"Well, I think that is true."
1960.306,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6187.887,6193.434,But neither does it seem to be any direct pinching hole into which you can categorize it either.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6193.434,6206.981,The definition necessarily of a -- of a through route is in general language which this Court has placed shaking down to the phrase holding out.
1960.306,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6216.508,6221.353,And that maybe by a publish tariff but it need not be as you say.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6221.353,6221.859,That's right.
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6227.909,6229.817,There couldn't be any other.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6235.528,6241.525,Well that's right that would have to be included in the tariff which would be published through the Commission.
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6286.089,6310.489,"Did you take a minute to expand each for me, the difference in the application of the conception of control as this Court lies it down in the (Inaudible) case as a determination of fact and in legal interpretation (Inaudible) interpretation of control of (Inaudible)"
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6310.489,6311.829,Common management or control.
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6311.829,6312.893,Yes.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6312.893,6324.704,"The common management or control, the definition as applied in 15 (4) cases comes from Blackshear Manufacturing Company which hasn't been mentioned here today."
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6363.879,6365.977,(Inaudible)
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6365.977,6368.007,Yes.
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6449.972,6454.965,I don't quite understand that because in the Rochester exception was a de facto control.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6454.965,6456.541,"Well, it was de facto, that's true."
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6456.541,6457.164,Yes.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6457.164,6458.001,And they --
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6458.001,6463.019,"(Voice Overlap) -- de facto control, doesn't it have a de facto control one or by another (Inaudible)(4)?"
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6463.019,6464.48,"No, absolutely not."
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6464.48,6465.013,That's what I wanted to know.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6465.013,6467.218,"There's -- no, I should say no."
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6467.81,6470.915,There -- there has to be a legal relationship.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6470.915,6476.433,"It has to be controlled by ownership lease or otherwise and what otherwise means, heavens only knows."
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6485.899,6490.148,That is the definition and that's what's been carried over in the 15 (4).
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6490.148,6498.034,"Is that the management and control as against -- as against the power Rochester case, like physical control?"
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6498.034,6507.356,"Exercise of -- yes, controlled by traffic officials, responsible traffic officials over the traffic policy of the controlled carrier."
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6507.356,6516.488,"In the Rochester case, we take care of the -- of the de facto financial (Inaudible) without any exercise."
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6516.488,6517.093,That's right.
1960.306,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6525.437,6541.225,"Could you tell me in -- could you tell me in a word, if it bothers you, don't do it, what you understand would be the result if the meaning they give to management and control in 15 (4) should be accepted in this case?"
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6541.225,6546.189,I don't go along with Mr. Merrill to say that that disposes of the case.
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6607.022,6619.944,"Is this -- is this the situation of through routes having this respective ownership and that brings to the initial carrier, indeed with reference to your line of situation or others like it."
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6619.944,6622.14,I --
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6622.14,6630.257,"You would -- the petitioners say such relationship takes it out of 15 (4), out of 15 -- 15 (4), doesn't it?"
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6630.257,6631.177,Yes.
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6631.177,6634.68,"Now, what I want to know is how many like situations are there, to the railroad --"
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6634.68,6635.538,Not too many.
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6635.538,6636.57,Not too many.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6636.57,6647.85,"I don't know of any that are -- as large as this, where a carrier with a thousand miles of trackage such as the S. P. & S. is under common management and control of another."
1960.306,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6691.698,6696.84,I didn't quit get your plead answer to my question that I wanted.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6714.591,6731.048,"I think I should say quite frankly that if the Commission is wrong and if the lower court were wrong in their interpretation of Section 15 (4), probably the case should go back to the Commission to reconsider further two points."
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6748.912,6762.544,Couldn't we -- couldn't this Court dig out of the record sustaining the Commission even though 15 (4) goes out the way it didn't (Inaudible) railroad?
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6762.544,6764.855,Yes [Laughs] --
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6764.855,6765.933,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6765.933,6766.353,-- because the Commission has found --
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6766.353,6767.908,I'm not soliciting your pressure.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6768.186,6775.432,"Well, the Commission has found that the routes are not necessary desirable of the public interest within the meaning of Section 15 (3)."
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6779.676,6784.906,"Well, why don't those two findings -- I asked you -- I'll ask you, it has to be likely -- it's a different question --"
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6784.906,6785.737,I --
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6785.737,6786.442,-- why wasn't that (Voice Overlap) --
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6786.442,6798.38,"-- in all frankness, Your Honor, I think that if we are wrong on 15 (4), and I don't believe we are, the Commission ought to have another chance to consider Section 3 (4)."

1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6801.767,6802.377,"No, I don't quite --"
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6802.377,6802.905,I don't think (Voice Overlap) --
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6802.905,6808.857,-- think so because there wasn't -- they were --they're -- frankly 15 (4) protection there because their --
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6808.857,6809.791,So --
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6809.791,6809.837,-- their --
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6809.837,6811.911,-- I don't mean (Inaudible)
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6811.911,6812.505,Yes.
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6812.505,6823.592,"All I have to say is when would you know whether -- all I (Inaudible) -- when would you know, I think the (Inaudible) would know what they might do if the record has been different and has been found to be different --"
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6823.592,6823.822,Well --
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6823.822,6825.611,-- and accept it?
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6825.611,6825.707,I --
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6825.707,6828.944,If that case (Inaudible) bigger as it were (Inaudible)?
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6828.944,6832.886,"They're not the same as they were in the Rio Grande case, but I have read Your Honor's dissent in the Rio Grande case."
1960.306,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6832.886,6834.508,I'm not -- I'm not urging that.
1960.306,2,24507,fletcher_rockwood,,6837.409,6837.861,Thank you.
1960.306,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6837.861,6839.821,Thank you.
1960.306,3,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,6846.562,6850.295,"Thank you, sir."
1960.306,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6900.339,6902.742,I thought he said it was a thousand miles.
1960.306,3,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,6902.742,6912.781,"Well, in comparing to the Milwaukee, sir -- I mean to the Burlington, he indicated that I thought that the Burlington was a great big railroad, the S. P. & S. is just a little one."
1960.306,3,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6912.852,6915.356,I thought the Burlington is much longer than that.
1960.306,3,39892,raymond_k_merrill,,6915.356,6920.574,"The Burlington is much longer but I'm saying the S. P. & S. is not just a branch line railroad, sir."
