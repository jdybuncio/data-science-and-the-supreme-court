1992.92-1,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.667,"We'll hear argument now in No. 92-1, Lynwood Moreau v. Johnny Klevenhagen."
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,12.389,15.211,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-1,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,190.145,194.098,"Speaking of the Secretary of Labor, Mr. Leibig, why isn't he here?"
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,196.39,198.432,--Why isn't the Secretary of Labor?
1992.92-1,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,198.432,198.823,Yes.
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,201.746,205.188,"Your Honor, I'm not sure completely."
1992.92-1,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,217.166,217.924,I see.
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,217.924,233.866,"And I think that relates directly to one of the arguments I want to make which has to do with why regulations, when there's a statute... the way the Fair Labor Standards Act works generally is that it's an administrative act which is very dependent on the regulations not only for the use of comp time but across the board."
1992.92-1,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,360.507,375.738,"Is that ambiguity solved by the Department of Labor's reg, the one that, well, it's set out on page 28 of the red brief, that the question of whether employees have a representative for purposes of 7(o) shall be determined in accordance with state or local law?"
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,380.733,391.289,"--The regulation is, but what is quoted on page... the reference to state law that is quoted in the red brief is not a reference to the regulations, it's a reference to the preamble to the regulation."
1992.92-1,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,423.139,432.736,But isn't it also to be read by saying to determine whether there is a representative the purposes of subsection 1 you look to state law?
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,441.451,446.053,"I think there are two questions there, Your Honor."
1992.92-1,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,537.804,548.162,Why don't you just as readily look to state law to determine what the significance of the designation of the representative is in states which do not allow collective bargaining agreements?
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,548.162,566.844,"Because under the preamble, under that set reference in the preamble, which is the only reference to state law in this area anyway, if you read the whole paragraph it starts off by somebody asking exactly that question, do you look to state law to find out whether a collective bargaining representative can enter in full agreements."
1992.92-1,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,581.404,583.976,"Mr. Leibig, where is the preamble set forth?"
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,583.976,595.023,"It's easier for... he, Justice Souter referred to the red brief, but I think it's easier if you have the Petition to Cert Appendix."
1992.92-1,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,609.28,609.891,Thank you.
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,609.891,612.142,The actual regulations are in the pages just before that.
1992.92-1,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,670.461,679.527,"Mr. Leibig, you argue basically that the statute is ambiguous and we ought to refer to a regulation?"
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,679.527,681.37,That's right.
1992.92-1,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,681.37,691.544,Do you think we have to take into account the case of Gregory against Ashcroft in interpreting this statute?
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,723.655,729.768,"No, Your Honor, I don't think if you look to Gregory v. Ashcroft you would come to a different conclusion, for this reason."
1992.92-1,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,846.868,872.123,"Well, if you just look at the terms of the statute in the absence of the regulation, doesn't it appear to say that if employees aren't covered by subclause (i) then an agreement between the agency and the employee will govern, in effect?"
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,872.123,874.373,--Subclause (i) in the first--
1992.92-1,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,874.373,875.375,"I mean, that's what it says."
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,875.375,882.531,"--Subclause (ii) in the first prepositional phrase says in the case of employees not covered by subclause 1, granted."
1992.92-1,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,882.531,883.25,Yes.
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,883.25,887.533,"The problem is subclause 1 has a list of types of agreements, not types of employees."
1992.92-1,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,901.481,907.156,"Well, it seems to me you can get pretty far by just looking at the terms of the statute."
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,912.799,914.461,Let's do that for a minute.
1992.92-1,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,959.709,968.017,"Well, but realistically the employer is not in a position to refuse every collective bargaining agreement that's pressed upon it."
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,977.16,985.067,"It's isn't an available option in a limited number of states in the United States, and if Congress wanted to say that they could have."
1992.92-1,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1011.724,1033.089,"But that would still not be a vain act by Congress to set it up this way because it would preserve for those states that did have collective bargaining with public employees under 2(A) little (i), it would preserve the power and the position of the union in those states."
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1036.289,1048.908,"In that case, though, 2 little (i) would just say collective bargaining agreements, it wouldn't say... first of all it wouldn't say memorandum of understanding in the normal sense, but you could argue about that, but it wouldn't say any other agreement between the public agency and representatives."
1992.92-1,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1125.518,1129.862,"Well, I mean, words can be ambiguous but there is, you know, there is a scope of ambiguity."
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1142.441,1160.311,"I think so, and I think the way you judge that is you look at the words and see if they are unclear, not... one definition of ambiguity is two meanings, but other... the word ambiguity I think is also used to mean when a, in this context, the context of using regulations, when a statute is unclear."
1992.92-1,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1161.903,1172.788,"The critical phrase is employees not covered by subclause (i), and as you point out, subclause (i) does not describe employees but it describes agreements."
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1186.569,1195.095,"--That wouldn't be logical for a number... the first reason it wouldn't be logical is because if you play that out what that would mean, Congress wouldn't have needed all these words to say that."
1992.92-1,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.763,1232.641,"Well, those are all good policy reasons, but what you urge upon us instead is that it means employees who do not have a representative?"
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1232.641,1233.212,No.
1992.92-1,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1249.622,1253.074,But I don't see how yours is one of the available options.
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1255.445,1260.109,If you... you mean because it could only--
1992.92-1,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1260.109,1263.201,Because you're not covered by little (i).
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1269.566,1275.401,--Whether you're an employee covered by little... first of all there are a couple reasons why I think you are.
1992.92-1,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1442.232,1443.993,How do you mean devalue it?
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1446.344,1446.655,Right.
1992.92-1,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1477.075,1484.549,But is there any reason to think that that practice by an employer was condemned by Congress in this statute?
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1484.549,1490.562,"First of all, that practice was condemned by Congress in the Fair Labor Standards Act xx they outlawed comp time."
1992.92-1,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1491.463,1493.055,But here they have reintroduced comp time.
1992.92-1,0,36237,michael_t_leibig,,1493.055,1493.845,--Right.
1992.92-1,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1554.074,1555.944,"Very well, Mr. Leibig."
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,1557.016,1563.741,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-1,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1638.979,1665.295,"Well, Mr. Streicher, do you take the position that if there, in a state where there is a collective bargaining agreement but the agreement does not allow, it just doesn't cover comp time, now, do you think in such a state that the county would be able to enter an agreement with employees such as you have in this case?"
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,1670.52,1686.899,"Justice O'Connor, I don't know the answer to your question, and that is one of my points, that one would need to go to that particular state's law to determine under which section one can meet."
1992.92-1,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1686.899,1690.412,"Well, doesn't that indicate the statute is ambiguous?"
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,1721.444,1739.654,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, I believe it would, there being no agreement in Justice O'Connor's scenario, then under subpart (i), then one would go, one would be authorized to go to subpart 2."
1992.92-1,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1739.654,1745.648,Then why don't you know the answer?
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,1745.648,1751.943,"I believe then, Justice Scalia--"
1992.92-1,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.943,1752.543,That is the answer.
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,1752.543,1764.952,"--that I, if I understood Mrs. O'Connor's question correctly then, if there is no agreement under subpart (i), then one would be authorized to go to subpart 2."
1992.92-1,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.952,1766.021,"Well, but that's the question."
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,1773.076,1798.635,"If one focuses on the words of this particular statute and focuses on the subject of subpart 1, that being is there an agreement reached between a representative and the employer, there be... if there is no such agreement then one would go to subpart 2."
1992.92-1,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1798.635,1805.888,"But it's not clear that there's such agreement, because it doesn't talk about agreement, it talks about agreement with reference to compensatory time."
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,1805.888,1814.544,"I perhaps don't understand your question, Justice Kennedy."
1992.92-1,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1830.745,1840.772,"Well, I certainly think some employers could argue that single (i) controls, that there is an applicable provision, it just says nothing about it."
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,1843.953,1865.899,"One would have to go to the state law to determine the result of that answer, and in Texas, as we have stated in our Reply Brief and our Appendix, in Texas we cannot recognize a representative."
1992.92-1,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1867.959,1870.26,"Well, we're talking about two different things."
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,1919.793,1920.194,No.
1992.92-1,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.194,1921.013,No?
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,1921.013,1921.393,No.
1992.92-1,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1937.176,1951.454,"I understand, but I'm talking about another state that has public employee unions and that prohibits employees from dealing with the public employer apart from their union."
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,1959.298,1964.561,Yes.
1992.92-1,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.561,1975.04,"There would be no agreement or understanding, so you would preserve, you would preserve the exclusive bargaining power of the authorized union."
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,1975.04,1980.012,"If that was the effect of that state's law, yes, that was the exclusive bargaining agent."
1992.92-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.782,2164.323,Is it your position that the employer may on his own substitute comp time for overtime even if he doesn't deal with individual employees?
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2164.323,2166.804,No.
1992.92-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.051,2185.808,"So, does Harris County forbid dealing with individual employees?"
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2185.808,2187.187,No.
1992.92-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.455,2200.096,Comp time.
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2200.096,2204.248,--comp time arrangement which exists in the personnel regs of Harris County.
1992.92-1,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2241.444,2247.758,"Mr. Streicher, you say it's hard to imagine how they could have put it better?"
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2262.268,2263.467,Yes.
1992.92-1,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2263.467,2271.003,"That would be a much clearer way to put it, don't you think, instead of in the case of employees not covered by subclause (i)?"
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2271.003,2280.687,"I believe they stated that, Justice Scalia, when they said those employees not covered by subsection 1."
1992.92-1,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.687,2290.945,"Well, it would have made sense to me to say pursuant to little (i), applicable provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, blah, blah, blah, blah, or other agreement, little 2, absent such applicable provisions--"
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2316.971,2318.243,Agreements.
1992.92-1,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2373.689,2399.605,"May I ask you, what if there were an agreement, collective bargaining agreement in existence which prohibited the use of comp time, would subparagraph 2 apply, because those employees would not be permitted to do it by a collective bargaining agreement, they were forbidden to do it?"
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2399.605,2448.248,"I don't believe, Justice Stevens, that subpart 2 could apply because in section, subsection (o), subpart (B) it talks about existing collective bargaining agreements, and if the existing collective bargaining agreement were one wherein no compensatory time was allowed, then that collective bargaining agreement would have been entered into pursuant to subpart 1, and that would be the relationship between that employer and those employees."
1992.92-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2448.248,2454.874,Haven't Labor Department regulations been against you?
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2454.874,2479.767,"Justice White, I believe there is ammunition for both sides, but several of the Justices this afternoon pointed out the recognition by the Secretary of Labor himself that whether or not an employee has a representative shall be determined by state law."
1992.92-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.009,2503.574,I would think you would argue that it wouldn't make any difference whether they had a representative or not.
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2508.867,2510.098,--That's correct.
1992.92-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2520.055,2522.357,There must be a collective bargaining agreement with their representative.
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2522.357,2523.299,--That's correct.
1992.92-1,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2523.299,2554.998,"What do you do with the language in the Statement of Basis and Purpose for the rule, which says that the Department believes that the proposed rule accurately reflects the statutory requirement, according to the agency, that a CBA memorandum of understanding or other agreement be reached between the public agency and the representative of the employees where the employees have designated a representative?"
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2565.414,2584.567,"Preemption, or I think then we have come into the Gregory, the Ashcroft area where there must be a plain statement by Congress to upset the balance, the traditional balance between Federal and state rights."
1992.92-1,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2589.3,2594.054,"Well, I mean, my goodness... it has to be in every detail of the scheme?"
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2605.912,2607.903,I agree with you.
1992.92-1,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2607.903,2621.81,"And you're saying that every detail of the Fair Labor Standards Act must moreover be particularly clear as applied to the states, otherwise in every little section of the act you're going to have one rule for the states and one rule for the private employer?"
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2624.144,2657.484,"I agree with you, Justice Scalia, certainly that it was the intent of Congress to apply, or of this Court to apply the FLSA to the state and local governments, but it is not the intent of this Court without a plain statement by Congress to upset the traditional relationship between the rights of the states and the Federal rights."
1992.92-1,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2657.484,2682.351,"Well, isn't it your argument that the requirement for plain statement in effect arises because otherwise the Secretary or Congress, depending on whether you zero in on the reg or the statute, would be foisting or mandating a collective bargaining obligation onto the states that they did not have."
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2683.712,2685.184,"Correct, Justice Souter."
1992.92-1,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2714.242,2731.814,"Is it your view in Texas that a public employer can use subclause 1 if it wants to, or that it must always use subclause 2?"
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2731.814,2751.227,"In Texas if the, pursuant to the statute, the Police and Firemen's Act, a election were held authorizing the collective bargaining arrangement, then one could get into subsection 1."
1992.92-1,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2814.658,2838.393,"Mr. Streicher, there has been some colloquy between the bench and you and your opponent about the provisions of a regulation and there has been reference made to something on page 34a of the Appendix that apparently is the reaction of the Department of Labor to requests for comment on a rule."
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2877.669,2881.803,"I believe there is, Your Honor."
1992.92-1,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2881.803,2883.173,"Where is it, do you know?"
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2906.728,2908.39,I believe... I'm sorry.
1992.92-1,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2908.39,2911.283,--as is set forth at the top of page 33a.
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2927.672,2930.426,"I believe you're right, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2979.778,2991.064,"Yes, but what if the regulation says if there's a representative, if there is a representative been designated there has to be an agreement, regardless of what state law says."
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,2991.064,2997.49,"--This statute, Your Honor, does not say that, though."
1992.92-1,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2999.69,3019.573,"But the regulation does, on page 31a, subpart (c), where employees of a public agency do not have a recognized or otherwise designated representative the agreement or understanding concerning compensatory time off must be between the public agency and the individual employee."
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,3071.328,3073.578,"--I believe, Your Honor, that is the case, Justice White."
1992.92-1,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3087.967,3110.424,"Well, if that's the law certainly the... if that's the controlling law the regulation, to the extent it says that if there's a representative been named there must be an agreement, that just doesn't hold up."
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,3110.424,3116.916,--And that is not what this particular subpart (i) speaks of.
1992.92-1,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3157.665,3162.537,"You said they can have a representative, they just can't enter into an agreement with them?"
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,3162.537,3163.536,That's right.
1992.92-1,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3163.536,3167.84,So literally they have a representative.
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,3167.84,3175.695,"But not for the purposes of subsection (o), to enter into a compensatory time agreement."
1992.92-1,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3206.676,3211.558,Of course if you read the Secretary's regulation literally that just would mean that's kind of tough luck.
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,3226.878,3235.333,"--Justice Stevens, if it were to stop there that may be true, but we have not stopped there."
1992.92-1,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3238.655,3256.059,"Yes, but if the regulations mean what they say literally, and they may or may not, you weren't entitled to do that because the subparagraph (i) prohibition kicked in and said you can't have it, as interpreted by the Secretary."
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,3302.778,3303.878,That's exactly correct.
1992.92-1,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3303.878,3309.253,"Yes, but what it says is they shall have a representative, not whether they shall have an agreement with a representative."
1992.92-1,1,28112,harold_m_streicher,,3311.955,3342.563,"If I could take a moment with the impact of the Court's decision, it could have a substantial impact not only on the respondents but on all state and local governmental entitles."
1992.92-1,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3373.325,3376.597,"Thank you, Mr. Streicher."
1992.92-1,2,36237,michael_t_leibig,,3378.647,3382.741,I would just like to make three points.
1992.92-1,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3436.556,3438.567,"Yes, but to that extent you would have a collective bargaining agreement."
1992.92-1,2,36237,michael_t_leibig,,3438.567,3439.677,"Well, it's not a collective--"
1992.92-1,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3439.677,3442.868,"I mean, you can call it anything you want to, but it's a collective bargaining agreement on that subject."
1992.92-1,2,36237,michael_t_leibig,,3442.868,3452.005,"--It's not a collective bargaining agreement in the sense that collective bargaining agreements are ordinarily agreements between, one, between exclusive representatives and their employees."
1992.92-1,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3476.602,3483.236,Do you contend as a matter of Texas law that the collective bargaining agent can enter into comp time agreements?
1992.92-1,2,36237,michael_t_leibig,,3483.236,3487.008,As a matter of Texas law employees can designate a representative--
1992.92-1,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3487.008,3487.739,Right.
1992.92-1,2,36237,michael_t_leibig,,3487.739,3493.603,--Even Texas law gives them the right to do that and recognizes the right of the representative to act for the employees as an agent would act for the employees.
1992.92-1,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3496.674,3497.886,I wish you would tell me yes or no.
1992.92-1,2,36237,michael_t_leibig,,3497.886,3498.425,--Yes.
1992.92-1,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3524.544,3528.585,"It's still a collective bargaining agreement, whether it's enforceable or not in this case."
1992.92-1,2,36237,michael_t_leibig,,3528.585,3528.955,Right.
1992.92-1,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3531.527,3540.703,And so are employees covered by little (i)?
1992.92-1,2,36237,michael_t_leibig,,3540.703,3551.201,"--I think employees are covered by, the employees in this case would be covered by, they are employees who do not have an agreement and therefore you cannot use 2(i)."
1992.92-1,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3572.665,3574.156,"I never doubted it, Mr. Streicher."
1992.92-1,2,36237,michael_t_leibig,,3574.156,3584.353,And the point of all this is the reason to require the designation of a representative is the traditional way to guarantee that agreements are voluntary.
1992.92-1,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3612.851,3616.113,Does that position take you beyond the Secretary's position in the regs?
1992.92-1,2,36237,michael_t_leibig,,3616.113,3618.695,"No, I think that is the Secretary's position."
1992.92-1,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3618.695,3623.998,"Well, the Secretary took the position that if you have got a collective bargaining agreement this is the way you must agree on this subject."
1992.92-1,2,36237,michael_t_leibig,,3632.213,3637.027,I think the Secretary's position is you either have to have one of the kinds of agreements talked about in little (i) 1--
1992.92-1,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3637.027,3639.178,Which is not necessarily a CBA.
1992.92-1,2,36237,michael_t_leibig,,3639.178,3639.559,--Right.
1992.92-1,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3655.7,3657.032,"Thank you, Mr. Leibig."
1992.92-1,2,36237,michael_t_leibig,,3658.174,3658.634,--Thank you.
1992.92-1,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3658.634,3659.756,The case is submitted.
