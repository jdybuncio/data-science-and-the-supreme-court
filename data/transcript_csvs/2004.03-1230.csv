2004.03-1230,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.269,We'll hear argument now in American Trucking Associations v. Michigan Public Service Commission and a companion case.
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,16.054,18.504,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1230,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,71.606,76.693,"Well, it... it does for trucks that want to deliver things within the State of Michigan."
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,78.295,90.685,"Yes, it... it discriminates and it... it has an exclusory effect on trucks... out-of-state carriers that want to compete in the... and bring their trucks across the... the border of Michigan and compete against local carriers for intrastate hauls."
2004.03-1230,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,90.685,92.385,It would have that... it certainly has that tendency.
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,100.508,101.66,There was not a trial below.
2004.03-1230,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,143.904,166.602,"Of course, it also... I mean, you say it... it favors the in-state... intrastate carrier because if you're doing nothing but intrastate carriage, you... you amortize the $100 over many more miles, whereas the interstate carrier, much of whose business is out-of-state, doesn't do that."
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,195.937,216.6,"Well, Your Honor, I think what... what that's saying... and I know that was the argument made in the Solicitor General's brief... is that you can discriminate against one component of interstate commerce, those carriers that want to actually compete and do intrastate business in the State, as long as you give a benefit to another component of interstate commerce, those who just wish to operate in the... in the State of Michigan in interstate commerce."
2004.03-1230,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,216.6,228.51,"Well, it's not so much that you necessarily can do it, but it... it sort of interrupts the... the kind of the a priori reasoning and you're thrown back on a... on... on a practical effects analysis under Pike."
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,228.51,229.493,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1230,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,273.222,274.172,But may I ask this question?
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,285.947,289.299,"--If they each do 100,000 miles of intrastate business in Michigan--"
2004.03-1230,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,289.299,289.581,Yes.
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,289.581,291.166,--they would pay the same flat fee.
2004.03-1230,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,291.166,295.285,"They would both pay the same tax, both the intra and the interstate."
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,298.654,304.658,"If... if this... if this tax was apportioned based on mileage, it would not be discrimination, but unfortunately, it is not and--"
2004.03-1230,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,304.658,313.014,"No, but I'm just saying if the intrastate and interstate carriers both have the same intrastate mileage, they both pay the same tax."
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,313.014,317.818,"--And we... we would... and again, if this was a mileage-apportioned fee, it would be... it would be fine."
2004.03-1230,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,324.055,332.993,"Yes, but you might have an intrastate carrier that does a smaller amount of mileage, only 50,000 miles, and an interstate carrier that pays... does 100,000 miles."
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,338.314,340.683,--That would be true but that--
2004.03-1230,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,340.683,343.116,And the tax only operates on intrastate business.
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,343.116,350.889,--The factual situation is going to be that the interstate carrier is just not going to have the opportunity to do as much business in Michigan as the intrastate carrier.
2004.03-1230,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,350.889,353.241,"Well, it seems to me you should have introduced some evidence on that point."
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,375.72,376.106,Yes.
2004.03-1230,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,376.756,377.456,--demonstration?
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,377.456,378.106,It does strike me as self-evident.
2004.03-1230,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,397.603,406.042,Wouldn't we be better able to decide this question after a trial rather than speculation on both sides?
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,406.042,419.516,"I don't think a trial is necessary because, as I say, this... this Court quoted Justice Frankfurter clearly, and I think the Solicitor General in his brief says that on average the out-of-state carrier is not going to get as much benefit from this fee."
2004.03-1230,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,437.311,440.53,"Well, Nippert was over 100 years ago, wasn't it?"
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,440.53,444.001,I think the Nippert case was from the 1940's I believe.
2004.03-1230,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,447.286,448.786,It seems like 100 years ago.
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,449.436,450.821,--It's--
2004.03-1230,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,450.821,460.677,"Mr. Digges, this... the... the... there was a question about the ramifications of the position that you're presenting."
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,509.008,510.86,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1230,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,594.263,599.267,But the Scheiner case didn't make a distinction based on in-state activity.
2004.03-1230,0,39128,robert_digges_jr,,606.821,620.331,"--That is accurate, Your Honor, but... but nominally Scheiner... for instance, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the Scheiner case did say that... did uphold the fee because they said only Pennsylvania could charge for the privilege of using Pennsylvania's highways."
2004.03-1230,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,671.464,672.549,"Very well, Mr. Digges."
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,674.149,705.787,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In contrast to the ATA case, the question before the Court today in the Mid-Con case is whether the fee on vehicles operating solely in interstate commerce is preempted by 49 U.S.C., section 14504."
2004.03-1230,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,705.787,708.722,It's the same fee we're talking about.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,708.722,709.539,It is--
2004.03-1230,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,709.539,711.841,But a different theory of invalidity.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,711.841,713.407,--It is not the same fee.
2004.03-1230,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,719.862,720.979,Intrastate.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,720.979,722.998,--carriers that engage in intrastate activities.
2004.03-1230,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,722.998,725.198,"Okay, and yours is the interstate fee."
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,725.198,728.468,The subsection (2) fee under 478.1--
2004.03-1230,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,728.468,731.837,And your fee applies to all Michigan-plated vehicles.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,733.47,734.372,--That are operating solely in interstate commerce.
2004.03-1230,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,734.372,735.106,Yes.
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,735.106,749.299,"Do... do I understand that the two distinctions in what is done with the... or the way the fee is collected and what's done with it is that the... the fee is charged against the... is it the operator as opposed to the owner, if there is a distinction?"
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,750.866,755.62,All of the fees under subsections (1) and (2) are charged against the motor carrier--
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,755.62,756.136,The carrier.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,756.136,756.502,--or--
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,756.502,757.904,That's the term I should use.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,757.904,758.621,"----motor carrier, not to the owner."
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,758.621,759.587,Which may not be the owner.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,766.957,767.724,That's correct.
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,767.724,786.404,"Now, let... that's... that's a premise for a question I want to ask you, and the question is in economic effect, is there any difference really between charging this $100 fee with those differences from the registration fee and simply jacking up the registration fee by $100?"
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,816.84,829.331,"Yes, there is and the reason why there is a difference is that the... the fees that are paid for plating are under the... under the International Reciprocity Plan, the registration plan, the IRP."
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,846.276,849.395,"No, but that... that... maybe I don't understand."
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,857.001,857.851,"Yes, it does."
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,857.851,860.619,"Except that he only has to pay in one place, and... and if they--"
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,860.619,861.036,He pays--
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,861.036,864.07,"--increase the registration fee, he'd only have to pay in one place, once."
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,864.07,867.872,--But he would only pay the fee based on his mileage in the State.
2004.03-1230,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,872.81,876.128,Who... who sets the fee for the plating?
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,876.128,878.414,--The... the State does.
2004.03-1230,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,880.616,881.216,So--
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,881.216,882.732,--but I believe all of those are statutory fees.
2004.03-1230,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,882.732,890.472,"--you could have... unlike the... the fee, the $10 fee, that--"
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,890.472,891.455,The SSRS.
2004.03-1230,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,891.455,899.594,"--the Federal cap, this would... for plating it could be anything each individual State chooses it to be?"
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,899.594,902.445,In terms of the plating fee?
2004.03-1230,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,902.445,903.245,Yes.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,903.245,907.78,Each State is free to charge its... its own amount as the plating fee.
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,907.78,923.908,"Sure, but it... so... so regardless of what Michigan does with the apportioned amounts, the amount it charges to the... to the owner, in the case of the... the plating fee, is... is simply set by the State of Michigan."
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,923.908,925.741,That is--
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,925.741,926.091,Yes.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,926.091,927.026,--that is correct.
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,927.026,938.316,"So what... and... and the... the virtue of the apportionment is that the... that the owner or the... or the owner, I guess in this case, does not have to pay fees in 49 other States."
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,938.316,940.268,That is correct.
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,940.268,943.203,But he doesn't... it doesn't matter to... that's the value to him.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,949.44,959.415,"If they apportion it, however, it is... it is not... it does not... if they put it into the IRP, it is not part of the registration process."
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,960.248,975.025,"But who... I mean, is... that's... that's fine as a matter of administration, but in terms of the... the end effect on the person who has to pay it and on the consumers to whom it is ultimately passed on, what difference does it make?"
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,975.025,989.517,"--Well, the... the difference for the person who is paying it under IRP is that if only 20 percent of their interstate miles as a solely interstate operating carrier, if only 20 percent are in the State, they would, in fact, only pay $20 per vehicle."
2004.03-1230,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,989.517,990.55,Can I ask a quick question?
2004.03-1230,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,998.456,1000.423,"No, I don't think he... I didn't--"
2004.03-1230,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1000.423,1000.825,Sorry.
2004.03-1230,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1000.825,1002.242,--I don't understand your answer.
2004.03-1230,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1003.944,1004.36,Okay.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,1004.36,1020.703,"If it's... if it is put into a plating charge as opposed to a registration... part of the registration of a carrier for the privilege or the opportunity to carry on interstate trucking activities in the State of Michigan, that is the flat fee that we're talking about."
2004.03-1230,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1064.713,1065.982,May I ask this question?
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,1084.291,1093.732,"It would be permissible because the... if the $10 is charged to the carrier as part of the registration process, in order to be qualified to engage in interstate trucking."
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1099.636,1099.986,Okay.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,1102.754,1109.325,If he said $20 was going to be put towards the... the State instead of... instead of $100?
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1109.325,1109.658,Yes.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,1109.658,1110.824,And $80 towards IRP?
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1110.824,1111.274,Yes.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,1111.274,1118.78,"In that case, that would still violate the... the SSRS, if it is done as part of the registration process, which is what Michigan does."
2004.03-1230,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1146.681,1152.668,"But that... that assumes it's an SSRS charge, and the State denies that it... it has anything to do with SSRS."
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,1156.037,1160.924,I think what you have to do is you have to look at what the... the standards do.
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1172.064,1176.1,"Okay, but what... what if the State says, you can enter... enter into interstate activities for nothing?"
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,1181.354,1183.789,--The State could do that and that would be perfectly permissible.
2004.03-1230,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1183.789,1185.706,So this is pure formalism.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,1185.706,1187.074,It is not pure form.
2004.03-1230,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.524,1213.641,Maybe they sought to but maybe they didn't succeed.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,1228.485,1230.853,"And I don't believe that's the case, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-1230,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.853,1233.889,"You're trying to make the Federal statute work sensibly, but--"
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,1233.889,1234.372,Right.
2004.03-1230,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.372,1236.924,"--I hate to tell you, but not all statutes work sensibly."
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,1236.924,1237.374,Right.
2004.03-1230,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1286.94,1287.724,"Thank you, Mr. Hanson."
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,1287.724,1290.059,--in order for a Michigan-plated vehicle to engage in interstate commerce.
2004.03-1230,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1290.059,1290.542,Your time is expired.
2004.03-1230,1,30973,james_h_hanson,,1290.542,1292.159,Thank you.
2004.03-1230,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1292.159,1295.26,"Mr. Boynton, we'll hear from you."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1295.26,1300.514,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1340.824,1342.341,"It sure does make sense to me, though."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1366.809,1375.581,"Well, the Michigan Court of Appeals said that that very well may be the case, but they pointed to the fact that there were no facts to support that finding."
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1408.553,1417.841,--It... it's the case that a company that does only intrastate Michigan business logs all of its miles on... in Michigan.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1421.11,1421.776,That's right.
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.776,1438.905,"And it seems to me it's obvious that a... a company that does interstate business does not log all of its miles in... in Michigan, and likely... likely... very likely does... does less miles in Michigan than... than a purely intrastate Michigan trucker."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1438.905,1448.277,"Well, Justice Scalia, that very well may be true, but we don't have any way of... of qualifying or quantifying the burden here because we don't have those facts."
2004.03-1230,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1448.277,1456.281,Is it difficult to apportion the intrastate fee based on the number of miles traveled intrastate?
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1456.281,1459.049,"Well, Your Honor, I... I think it is very difficult to do that."
2004.03-1230,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1505.164,1509.399,Does it make any difference how high the... the fee is set?
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1514.385,1532.597,"--Well, Your Honor, the Michigan Court of Appeals had taken the position that this was a fee, not a tax, and under a fee... if... if a fee was $10,000, if the expenses matched the... the revenue from it, well, then it... it would be a... could be sustained as a fee."
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1534.216,1540.12,"You... you defend that position, that... that it doesn't violate the Commerce Clause so long as it's a fee not a tax?"
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1540.12,1552.927,"--Your Honor, we think that the... if it's a fee and not a tax, the Michigan Court of Appeals applied the correct standard, and that was the standard of Pike v. Bruce Church."
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.498,1563.902,"Whenever it's a fee, not a tax, you immediately go to Pike Church."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1563.902,1568.787,--I think that... that that was what the Michigan Court of Appeals--
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1568.787,1569.12,I know.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1570.222,1571.372,"--Yes, and I... I think that's a--"
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1571.372,1571.922,I found it very strange.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1571.922,1574.024,--I think that's an appropriate manner in dealing with it.
2004.03-1230,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1579.245,1583.864,What makes it a fee instead of a tax other than the court saying so?
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1583.864,1590.636,"--Well, first of all, it provided a direct benefit to the intrastate truckers."
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1611.197,1612.549,You could say the same about a tax.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1624.54,1641.068,"--Well, I think in the Michigan Court of Appeals opinion, it... it was a fee, and I think... I think what we come back to, Your Honor, is the idea is there a specific class of individuals or businesses that are benefitted."
2004.03-1230,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1667.885,1669.385,I'd like to get back just for a moment--
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1669.385,1670.069,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1230,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1670.069,1673.789,--to the answer you gave about apportionment because I wasn't quite sure I understood the answer.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1686.731,1687.464,Well--
2004.03-1230,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1687.464,1695.953,"And if we're talking about mileage here, maybe this is something that's eminently susceptible of apportionment."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1706.177,1708.796,"--Well, I... I... maybe I misspoke myself."
2004.03-1230,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1716.866,1718.318,It would be difficult to do administratively.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1721.687,1725.556,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that you got to look at what's the total cost here."
2004.03-1230,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1731.726,1733.245,--That... that... I agree that that is expensive.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1739.065,1740.881,"But, Your Honor, the problem is--"
2004.03-1230,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1740.881,1742.35,"--than with, say, attorneys or accountants or whatever."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1742.35,1751.289,"--Your Honor, the problem with that is that this fee, this intrastate fee, does not go to maintain the highways as it was in Scheiner."
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1808.976,1815.982,But the American Trucking Association is... is willing to be thrown into the... into the briar bush apparently.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1834.027,1842.716,"Well, that may be, Your Honor, but the... the point is... what we're dealing with is a... a fee that has revenues of about $3 million."
2004.03-1230,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1853.155,1853.857,May I ask this question?
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1862.879,1864.546,It's paid before.
2004.03-1230,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1865.414,1870.782,"If you had to pay it before, there would be no way to calculate it ahead of time because nobody would have had any mileage."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1871.318,1873.934,--I'm sorry.
2004.03-1230,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1873.934,1884.226,"If you have to pay it before the year begins and before you're allowed to engage in the business, you would have no way of measuring the number of miles you're going to travel during the... the ensuing year."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1884.226,1885.009,That's correct.
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.16,1891.362,"Well, I suppose that's the same thing for the $10 fee for the whatever the acronym is there."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1898.135,1899.718,"--Now, you're talking about the interstate fee, Your Honor."
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1899.718,1900.068,"Right, right."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1903.955,1906.422,"Well, it... let me back up."
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.808,1937.01,It's like a 3-day fishing license.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1937.01,1939.295,I suppose that would be one way--
2004.03-1230,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1939.295,1941.478,How... how does that work in... in practice?
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1945.116,1945.449,--Well--
2004.03-1230,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1945.449,1954.888,"--wants to fill up its truck and... and it said, well, this is going to be... the only haul this season for me, so I want the 3-day permit."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,1954.888,1957.757,"--Yes, Your Honor, you can obtain the permits in advance."
2004.03-1230,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2000.481,2010.856,This... this applies only to operations that are both licensed and registered in Michigan.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2012.039,2012.456,No.
2004.03-1230,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2015.324,2016.01,"Right, right, yes."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2016.01,2019.045,"--which is a different fee, which is in the Mid-Con case."
2004.03-1230,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2020.495,2023.83,Are you going to address the Mid-Con question?
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2023.83,2024.616,--I'm sorry?
2004.03-1230,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2024.616,2026.516,Are you going to address the Mid-Con question?
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2026.516,2027.818,"I was going to do that right now, Your Honor."
2004.03-1230,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2041.541,2052.099,"Well, what's the point of the limitation in SSRS to $10 if the State can impose any additional fee it wants just by calling it a different name?"
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2052.099,2067.275,"--Well, Your Honor, I think what you have to realize is you have... when you look at the text of the statute, I think what is very clear from reading the text is that the SSRS does not preempt all State fees and charges on motor carriers."
2004.03-1230,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2089.106,2091.142,"Of course, it... it does."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2096.26,2096.894,Well--
2004.03-1230,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2096.894,2114.238,"And... and then the... the other vehicles pay $100 for the... for the in-state fees, and so this seems to me that... that on... on its face shows that it's like a registration fee."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2114.238,2117.59,"--Well, Your Honor, I think a couple things."
2004.03-1230,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2167.873,2169.325,That's... that's the problem.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2169.325,2171.01,"Well, that's the argument."
2004.03-1230,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2171.01,2179.414,"That's the problem because here we're dealing with the fee to be paid by the people who are plated in Michigan, and it looks like that $100 is the fee for them."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2210.868,2211.351,Right.
2004.03-1230,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2211.351,2211.935,All right.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2223.793,2224.978,SSRS.
2004.03-1230,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2224.978,2225.345,Yes.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2236.802,2237.302,No.
2004.03-1230,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2240.587,2240.987,Yes.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2240.987,2242.954,--but your principal place of business is in Michigan?
2004.03-1230,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2242.954,2243.289,"Yes, yes."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2243.906,2244.256,Okay.
2004.03-1230,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2246.158,2249.276,Do I get a decal after I go through all this procedure?
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2257.847,2258.365,Okay.
2004.03-1230,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2258.365,2261.25,Then do I get a little certificate to put on the truck to say I did it.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2264.702,2269.487,If that vehicle... if the vehicle you're registering is plated in Michigan--
2004.03-1230,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2269.487,2270.373,"No, it's not."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2270.373,2270.989,--Okay.
2004.03-1230,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2272.389,2273.558,I know for Michigan.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2278.712,2279.395,I'm sorry.
2004.03-1230,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2279.395,2286.949,Don't... when I... when I go under this... this 49 U.S.C. 14504 and I choose a home State--
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2286.949,2287.735,That's correct.
2004.03-1230,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2287.735,2293.037,"--and I make all the relevant payments to that State, but they distribute, don't I get a piece of paper saying I did it?"
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2293.037,2294.555,"I believe so, Your Honor."
2004.03-1230,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2294.555,2295.005,Fine.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2325.19,2331.528,"To get a decal from Michigan, you have to be Michigan-plated and you have to pay the $100."
2004.03-1230,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2331.528,2332.061,Excellent.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2350.056,2363.114,"Your Honor, we believe that under the... the section 7 of the Michigan law, there is no fee charged for your SSRS."
2004.03-1230,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2363.114,2363.68,I'm talking about a fee.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2371.302,2377.539,"Your Honor, you have to... you have to... if it's Michigan-plated, that's the triggering mechanism."
2004.03-1230,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2381.841,2383.777,"Mr. Boynton, may I just... may I just ask this question?"
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2393.316,2409.678,"Our position, with respect to that, Your Honor, is the fact that under section 7 of the Michigan Motor Carrier Act, 478.7, Michigan has no authority to charge a Michigan-plated vehicle any fee at all."
2004.03-1230,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2409.678,2410.278,Right.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2422.835,2424.954,"Well, I don't know if I'm saying that, Your Honor."
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.886,2448.32,Is that right?
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2458.575,2459.777,--Interstate commerce.
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2459.777,2463.995,"Now, suppose I... suppose I only pay the fee for eight of them."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2466.264,2471.085,And how do you want to use the truck?
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2473.001,2473.318,No.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2495.283,2499.152,"Yes, it is."
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2499.152,2501.37,I mean... I mean the opposite.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2503.087,2503.837,Oh.
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2503.837,2508.289,"I've paid for the eight, and I can't operate at all because I haven't paid for the ninth."
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2508.289,2511.007,"Well, I think administratively that... that wouldn't happen."
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2512.776,2513.626,It seems to me how it reads.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2521.132,2530.737,"--I suppose that if the... for... for nonpayment of fees, a motor carrier risks its authority to operate in the State."
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2530.737,2531.054,At all.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2533.272,2534.989,"Well, I... I think it is."
2004.03-1230,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2536.141,2542.878,"Well, the computation is vehicle-specific, but you're using all the vehicles as hostage for the payment of... of any shortfall."
2004.03-1230,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.497,2546.197,So it's carrier-based.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2546.197,2551.068,"Well, Your Honor, I would have to disagree with Your Honor respectfully."
2004.03-1230,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2573.647,2584.872,Do you place any reliance in this scheme on the fact that the only people subject to it are people who have their principal place of business in Michigan?
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2584.872,2585.589,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1230,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2590.626,2595.245,And... and anyone can choose to do that?
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2605.703,2606.153,Right.
2004.03-1230,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2613.058,2613.374,No.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2615.058,2615.358,--Yes.
2004.03-1230,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2615.708,2616.176,You really can do that?
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2616.176,2618.962,You can plate wherever you have contacts with the State.
2004.03-1230,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2627.199,2630.151,You... you can plate your whole fleet in Michigan under those circumstances.
2004.03-1230,2,26585,henry_j_boynton,,2630.151,2637.257,"You could... you can choose where to plate your feet... plate your trucks, and a number of considerations go into that."
2004.03-1230,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2674.513,2676.215,"Thank you, Mr. Boynton."
2004.03-1230,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2678.084,2687.19,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1230,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2734.337,2737.122,"Gee, that seems to me really to go back on... on Scheiner."
2004.03-1230,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2759.619,2780.049,"--Well, with... with respect, Your Honor, I think the Court has certainly abandoned the notion that there is a bright, absolute line between intrastate activities which are subject to plenary regulation by the States without any Commerce Clause inquiry and interstate commerce which is wholly immune from State regulation."
2004.03-1230,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2920.742,2921.759,"Yes, it could."
2004.03-1230,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2958.867,2969.806,"--I mean, I think you're right that it wouldn't be reasonable to regard the within-Texas segment or the within-Oklahoma segment of a transfer of goods between States as a discrete, separable event."
2004.03-1230,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3129.153,3130.689,I'd like to know the text you rely on.
2004.03-1230,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3130.689,3132.005,That was--
2004.03-1230,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3132.005,3135.724,"For... for preemption, the text of the current statute that you rely on."
2004.03-1230,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3135.724,3147.365,"--The text of the current statute is set forth at page 82 of the appendix to the certiorari petition in Mid-Con, and it's now 49 U.S.C. 14504(b)."
2004.03-1230,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3172.116,3174.718,13501 deals just with SSRS.
2004.03-1230,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3174.718,3185.407,No. 13501 is the provision that... that defines the general regulatory jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation and the Surface Transportation Board.
2004.03-1230,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3202.968,3204.153,May I ask this question?
2004.03-1230,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3220.83,3232.221,"Well, as long as the... again, to... in our view the distinctive and disqualifying feature of the current statute is that subsection (2) is imposed specifically on vehicles that operate entirely in interstate commerce."
2004.03-1230,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3235.007,3243.445,"I'm not saying... they reduced to $90 the plating fee, but then they enacted a new $10 fee specifically designed to comply with the statute."
2004.03-1230,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3243.445,3244.528,--As long as--
2004.03-1230,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3244.528,3245.095,Could they do that?
2004.03-1230,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3245.095,3247.813,--As long as they were still imposing that additional... again--
2004.03-1230,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3247.813,3249.515,The $90 is for plating.
2004.03-1230,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3256.419,3277.432,"--As long as that $90 fee was imposed not just on Michigan-plated vehicles generally, but specifically on Michigan-plated vehicles that operate entirely in interstate commerce, we would say that's preempted because our reading of the statute is that basically Congress has said there's a severe limit on what you can do to interstate carriers that you don't do to intrastate carriers."
2004.03-1230,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3277.432,3277.916,Where does it say that?
2004.03-1230,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3298.58,3300.382,"May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2004.03-1230,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3300.382,3301.232,Briefly.
2004.03-1230,3,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3301.232,3305.935,The State doesn't argue that this registration was completed in accordance with this standard.
2004.03-1230,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3315.557,3317.007,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
