2002.01-1375,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,20.228,The Court will hear argument in the case of the United States against the Navajo Nation now.
2002.01-1375,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,62.127,65.759,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,160.83,163.923,Is there some other possible cause of action?
2002.01-1375,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,185.721,186.343,"--It was unfortunate, Justice O'Connor."
2002.01-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,186.343,196.374,And is there any other remedy for the tribe potentially for this action?
2002.01-1375,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,196.374,198.436,"I think there... it... first of all, I--"
2002.01-1375,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,198.436,200.831,Is there a lawsuit now pending--
2002.01-1375,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,200.831,202.029,--Not... not on that basis.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,1666.812,1675.545,"In listening... Mr.... Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1375,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1709.72,1717.688,"Mr. Frye, the Government has stressed that this is not a control situation like Mitchell II."
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,1749.434,1750.587,That's a two-part question.
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.974,1787.988,Oversee.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,1791.249,1803.221,"Oh, the Secretary doesn't mine coal anymore than the BIA cuts timber, but BIA sells timber to private timber companies to do the timber-cutting."
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1808.051,1814.283,--I'm not sure that that's anything more specific than the general trust responsibility that the United States has.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,1824.852,1828.401,"Well, Mitchell II control is absolutely parallel."
2002.01-1375,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1828.938,1830.713,What... what about--
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,1830.713,1832.282,"--Yes, the second part of your question."
2002.01-1375,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1832.282,1838.969,--The purpose of IMLA was to help the Indians exercise their own sovereignty.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,1838.969,1841.198,IMLA has come before this Court several times.
2002.01-1375,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1853.996,1861.139,Does it waive sovereign immunity in the statute for purposes of monetary damages against the Government?
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,1862.997,1867.909,It doesn't do so expressly just as the... the timber statutes didn't do so expressly in Mitchell II.
2002.01-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1871.996,1889.95,"That's true, but... but the Government had a good response to my question, which was that if, in fact, I was agreeing with you for the purposes of interpreting Mitchell II hypothetically, they said, you know, this is a procedure, and it's a procedure that you're complaining was violated."
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,1942.418,1942.906,Okay.
2002.01-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1956.248,1958.743,That's... that's... tell me a little bit less pejoratively and--
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,1958.743,1959.386,I will tell you.
2002.01-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1959.386,1961.699,--more specifically.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,1962.087,1962.525,Yes.
2002.01-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1977.069,1990.428,"Again, that's... you know, in a particular context, that might be terrible, but when you're talking about administration, it's a very common thing for parties to submit proposed findings, et cetera."
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,1997.653,1999.223,--That wasn't my entire answer.
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2038.891,2041.409,Maybe he did think it was vulnerable on the merits.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2044.177,2047.642,--The record... the record shows absolutely no consideration by the Secretary.
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.84,2059.492,"Well, isn't... isn't that... isn't that was... isn't that the representation that Peabody made to the Secretary, that that was just an enormous increase in the... in the fee?"
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2059.492,2069.645,--Peabody actually... the letter that Peabody wrote to Secretary Hodel that was mentioned by my brother Kneedler actually didn't get to Hodel's office.
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2080.047,2080.668,No. I understand that.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2086.324,2088.06,--We have no idea what was made.
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2088.06,2089.871,"--Well, what do you guess they made?"
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2100.692,2102.671,That's... that's not the context of this discussion.
2002.01-1375,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2117.039,2118.647,What is the number today?
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2118.647,2119.64,The number today--
2002.01-1375,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2119.64,2120.216,Today.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2120.216,2123.15,--is less than the Federal minimum of 12-and-a-half percent.
2002.01-1375,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2126.782,2131.612,What... has the tribe asked to set aside this lease?
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2131.612,2132.271,--We have not.
2002.01-1375,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2135.327,2137.472,"Well, you know about it now."
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2140.611,2146.034,"We have sued Peabody, and there are aspects of that that deal with reformation of the lease."
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2155.139,2157.247,I don't... I don't understand what the breach of trust consists of.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2178.135,2184.162,"No... no trustee has the ability to be disloyal, actively disloyal to the... to the beneficiary."
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2184.162,2191.897,I'm not... I'm not talking about actively... I'm just talking about the ex parte... receiving ex parte presentations--
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2191.897,2192.54,The Secretary--
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2192.54,2195.225,--from somebody who wants... who wants a lease altered.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2197.083,2201.557,--The... the Secretary and any ordinary trustee can receive all the communications he wants.
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2201.557,2202.034,Absolutely.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2202.034,2204.635,If the question is what the Secretary did in response to that--
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.635,2209.919,"All right, and so... so then you... you're down to what the Secretary did in response."
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2213.923,2214.294,--Yes.
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2214.294,2227.092,"And as I read the statute and regulations, the Secretary's only obligation was to assure that a very low minimum was... was complied with."
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2234.606,2238.776,"The statutes and regulations did require minimum royalty rates, and as this Court held--"
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.776,2239.23,Which are very low.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2239.23,2240.428,--Very low.
2002.01-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2258.632,2262.347,"Yes, but... I'm actually having exactly the same problem."
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2262.347,2262.802,Okay.
2002.01-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2262.802,2268.459,"What precisely is it that breached the trust, without any characterization?"
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2268.459,2269.202,Yes.
2002.01-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2269.202,2273.864,Who said... what is the act that's supposed to be the breach of the fiduciary duty?
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2283.774,2284.228,Yes.
2002.01-1375,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2296.134,2296.672,"Well, would you--"
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2296.672,2297.043,--the culminating events of the breach--
2002.01-1375,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2297.043,2298.613,"--Can I interrupt you, sir?"
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2304.186,2304.723,--Yes.
2002.01-1375,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2315.043,2315.497,All right.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2332.838,2337.956,"--But for the Secretary's intervention, 20 percent would have been slipped in as the new royalty rate."
2002.01-1375,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2337.956,2338.782,What intervention?
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2339.897,2347.948,The... the memo that Peabody's lawyers wrote that Secretary Hodel signed telling the deciding official to stop action.
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2347.948,2349.806,"Well, now wait a minute."
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2378.701,2379.899,Yes.
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2381.673,2386.048,"He should raise it... he should raise it 5,000 percent if he can get away with it?"
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2386.048,2387.33,--The--
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2387.33,2387.701,Surely--
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2387.701,2389.187,--The key modifier is if he can get away with it.
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2389.187,2390.552,--I just don't read it that way.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2416.558,2421.881,What the Secretary had to take into account is provided by the language of Article VI of the lease.
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2424.443,2424.853,Okay.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2424.853,2427.082,"--And to find that out, the Secretary's--"
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2427.082,2431.252,And reasonable doesn't mean whatever will give the tribe the most money.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2445.015,2451.852,--The Secretary can't doff his trust responsibilities by donning the mantel of an administrator.
2002.01-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2460.358,2471.254,"But that may be, but there must be a statute... there must be a statute that turned over to the Secretary or his office the job of interpreting that word reasonable in the lease."
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2472.619,2475.879,That would be the Indian Mineral Leasing Act.
2002.01-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2475.879,2490.368,"And it gives the Secretary... and you're saying that that statute, when it gives the Secretary the power to decide what is or is not reasonable under the lease, means that the Secretary must really just take the Indians' point of view into account?"
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2490.368,2491.444,Absolutely not.
2002.01-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2499.284,2501.225,"Is fair, in other words, to everybody."
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2501.225,2503.249,I think fair is not a bad characterization.
2002.01-1375,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2503.992,2504.363,Okay.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2515.054,2518.276,The Secretary was not doing what he thought was fair.
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2538.998,2541.022,"--That $13,000 didn't go to the Secretary, did it?"
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2541.022,2541.765,"Oh, there's no... absolutely--"
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2541.765,2543.873,That was... that was for the lobbyist.
2002.01-1375,1,37908,paul_e_frye,,2543.873,2545.109,--It was for the lobbyist.
2002.01-1375,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2550.021,2551.219,I agree with you.
2002.01-1375,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3465.499,3468.099,"Thank you, Justice Stevens."
2002.01-1375,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3686.021,3687.257,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
