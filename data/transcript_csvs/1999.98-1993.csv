1999.98-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.696,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-1993, Florida v. J.L.--"
1999.98-1993,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,30.731,31.374,"Neimand, Your Honor."
1999.98-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,31.374,31.951,Neimand.
1999.98-1993,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,32.572,35.999,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,83.592,89.803,"What's the closest case in this Court, in your view, that you think supports your position?"
1999.98-1993,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,89.803,99.568,"Well, the closest case that we have is Alabama v. White, where on facts similar to this the Court held that it was a close call, but in fact there was a reasonable suspicion."
1999.98-1993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,117.65,136.348,"Well, I thought the court there said that standing alone the tip in the Alabama case would not warrant someone of reasonable caution in the belief that a stop was appropriate, but in this case, there is more than the tip, and it went on to articulate other factors."
1999.98-1993,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,136.348,150.837,"Yes, Your Honor, that is the closest case, but also, if you... when we read Alabama v. White, this Court said that that question of the anonymous tip, in and of itself, was left open and would be left to be decided another day."
1999.98-1993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.837,168.381,"Well, it may have said that elsewhere, but it also said what I read to you, that standing alone, it wouldn't be enough, so to accept your view we would have to move a step beyond Alabama."
1999.98-1993,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,168.381,178.578,"I believe so, Your Honor, and I believe under the facts and circumstances in this case, where we're dealing with a dangerous weapon, a firearm, the public/officer safety concerns come into effect."
1999.98-1993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.578,183.863,"Are you arguing, then, for a firearm exception on the anonymous tip doctrine?"
1999.98-1993,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,183.863,184.606,"No, not at all, Your Honor."
1999.98-1993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,203.637,210.241,"Is it even illegal in Florida to carry a concealed firearm, or can people--"
1999.98-1993,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,210.241,211.606,It is a--
1999.98-1993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.606,212.887,--legally have one?
1999.98-1993,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,212.887,219.202,"--It's a regulated privilege, not a right in the State of Florida, and that allows for a--"
1999.98-1993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,219.202,227.004,But one does not assume in Florida that in every instance possession of a firearm concealed is unlawful?
1999.98-1993,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,227.004,227.831,--No.
1999.98-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,227.831,230.886,"Well, but it's unlawful for a minor, isn't it?"
1999.98-1993,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,230.886,231.341,Correct.
1999.98-1993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,231.341,233.404,And this person was a minor?
1999.98-1993,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,233.404,236.83,"Correct, 10 days shy of his 16th birth date."
1999.98-1993,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,236.83,267.091,"The red brief says that you in effect are arguing for a gun exception to the anonymous tip rule, and it seems to me that the red brief is in essence fair when it characterizes your argument that way, because I think what you're telling us that the nature of the tip, i.e., that there is a gun, somehow makes the tip more reliable."
1999.98-1993,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,267.091,269.941,It... that would depend--
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1007.38,1021.665,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1031.779,1035.66,"Well, you don't say that was met here, do you, reasonable suspicion?"
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1035.66,1036.237,Yes.
1999.98-1993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1040.574,1047.633,"What facts were there, other than the anonymous tip, and someone who, in fact, was on a street corner in a plaid shirt?"
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1047.633,1074.094,"The totality of the circumstances consists of the following four things: the tip, the confirmation of the verifiable details of the tip, the absence of any observations that led the officer to conclude that there was... that his suspicions should not be aroused when he got to the scene, and the fact that this tip concerned a gun that was unlawful for a child to possess, and therefore the level of suspicion that you need in--"
1999.98-1993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1074.094,1076.406,Was it readily apparent that it was a juvenile?
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1076.406,1077.604,"--Well, the--"
1999.98-1993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1077.604,1082.229,Would somebody know whether the person were 18 or 17 on appearance?
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1082.229,1095.808,"--This... the law of Florida is that anyone under 21 cannot carry a gun, and this person was under 16 years of age, so any officer who came to the scene and observed that person would have had reasonable suspicion that that was a child there."
1999.98-1993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1095.808,1099.069,Can you tell me about the tips for a moment?
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1137.047,1150.71,"We don't have any empirical evidence on this, and when you're presented with a tip like this, I think what you resort to is a common sense judgment that if there's nothing on the face of the tip that is unreliable, the officer is going to go out to the scene."
1999.98-1993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1162.848,1173.212,"If the police have the name of the... the capacity to check the number from which the call originated, does that make the tip perhaps more reliable?"
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1173.212,1174.41,It does... it does--
1999.98-1993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.41,1178.208,"Because it's a crime to violate... to have a false report under 911, so--"
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1178.208,1178.951,--It would.
1999.98-1993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1189.725,1191.006,--What do we know here?
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1194.76,1207.929,"It said, I believe... the testimony is at A-41, and this is the only thing on it, and the officer says, I believe they stated they were young, referring to the tipster."
1999.98-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.929,1211.19,Can I go back to your earlier answer?
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1218.703,1219.735,It's because--
1999.98-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1219.735,1222.957,Even though the caller doesn't know that you have caller ID?
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1222.957,1226.134,"--Well, it would have to be combined with general knowledge that--"
1999.98-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1226.134,1226.794,Oh.
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1226.794,1230.137,"--Of... Justice Scalia, of the public, that they could potentially--"
1999.98-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.137,1235.505,And combined with a very stupid caller who tries to be anonymous when he knows that he can't be anonymous--
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1235.505,1236.415,--Well--
1999.98-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.415,1238.848,--because he's calling from his own phone and you have caller ID.
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1251.397,1265.765,"--Justice Scalia, there are varying degrees of anonymity, but I would accept your basic point that unless the person... it's generally known that caller ID is out there, that it doesn't weigh into the calculus that much."
1999.98-1993,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1265.765,1279.55,"Keep everything else the same, and only vary the gun and change it to a book that's copyrighted unlawfully, or drugs, marijuana, or some other thing."
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1282.772,1283.969,"That's correct, because Alabama--"
1999.98-1993,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1283.969,1284.712,All right.
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1300.483,1305.563,--I would say that it would be the degree of suspicion that we call reasonable under the circumstances.
1999.98-1993,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1305.563,1315.51,"I thought maybe you could say that, then... but the way the term has been used in the cases, it hasn't been said suspicion that is sufficiently reasonable to justify the search."
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1320.711,1328.309,"Well, I would agree with you that the cases haven't specifically addressed this particular factor, but that's because the issue hasn't been put to the Court."
1999.98-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1337.718,1338.833,What about probable cause?
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1344.201,1359.888,"Justice Scalia, no, and the reason is that probable cause is constitutional text that has a meaning that must be drawn from its history and from its early application, and that kind of sliding scale approach does not apply in a probable cause, but what we are--"
1999.98-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1359.888,1362.571,And since we made up reasonable suspicion it's totally--
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1362.571,1364.223,--Justice Scalia--
1999.98-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.223,1366.536,"--unconnected to the Constitution, right?"
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1366.536,1367.195,--No.
1999.98-1993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1404.392,1409.261,"How about not an automatic weapon, just a weapon at school, anonymous tip?"
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1409.261,1418.715,"Well, it depends on whether the carrying of the weapon is... you would have reasonable suspicion that it was illegal to carry the weapon, and in Florida, if somebody is--"
1999.98-1993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1418.715,1419.375,"Well, sure."
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1420.035,1420.944,--Yes.
1999.98-1993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1420.944,1422.347,No weapons in school.
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1422.347,1422.885,That's correct.
1999.98-1993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1422.885,1424.743,"Anonymous tip, weapon."
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1424.743,1425.569,Then if you--
1999.98-1993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1425.569,1425.979,Is that enough?
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1425.979,1449.635,"--If you identify the person with sufficient specificity so that when the officer comes to the scene and confirms the observable details of the tip, and there's nothing else in his observations that decreases his level of suspicion, then the reasonable and prudent course is to stop and frisk, because the alternatives to the stop and frisk are... create real danger to the police and the public."
1999.98-1993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1460.78,1463.874,But is it therefore critical to your position that they realize this was a young person?
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1463.874,1479.932,"--It is... well, I would say that it is critical in this case that there be reasonable suspicion that the person does not have a license, and that's furnished in this case by the fact that there's reasonable suspicion that he's under 21 years of age."
1999.98-1993,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1479.932,1480.925,Not in the--
1999.98-1993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1480.925,1484.391,"--If he had not been under 21, you would agree that the stop would have been impermissible?"
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1484.391,1485.506,You would need reasonable suspicion--
1999.98-1993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.506,1492.73,"Well, no, on the facts of this... say precisely the same facts, except he called him and said, my cousin who is 22 is over there."
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1492.73,1493.286,--The--
1999.98-1993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.286,1494.794,Could he have made the stop?
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1494.794,1501.004,"--My only hesitation in saying no, he couldn't Justice Stevens, is there are places like New York City and the District of--"
1999.98-1993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1501.004,1508.168,"No, we've got... we've got a place in this particular case, a bus stop, three young... three men, 22 years old, one of them wearing a plaid shirt."
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1508.168,1535.084,"--I would say no, except... and if I could just finish the answer, the difference is that there are some places where there are many guns and very few licenses, and if Florida was such a place, or this particular area were such a place, like the District of Columbia or New York City, where there are an extraordinary number of guns and an extremely limited number of licenses... only, say, private detectives really have them... then there would still be reasonable suspicion."
1999.98-1993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1535.084,1535.827,Right.
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1535.827,1536.57,"Otherwise, no."
1999.98-1993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.57,1539.049,"But I'm still asking about Florida, and you would agree, in Florida he could not have--"
1999.98-1993,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1539.049,1540.907,I don't have... I don't know enough about the facts in Florida.
1999.98-1993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1540.907,1546.413,"--Mr. Gornstein, isn't the reasonable implication of the tip that he is carrying a gun illegally?"
1999.98-1993,2,28077,harvey_j_sepler,,1628.341,1633.542,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1993,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1729.022,1745.535,"If the petitioner's position is correct, that would follow, would it not, that with a gun in the guy's pocket, as they believed, to ask a bunch of questions is not going to obviate any public safety concern."
1999.98-1993,2,28077,harvey_j_sepler,,1745.535,1765.226,"It is correct, Your... Mr. Chief Justice, that if the State's proposal were adopted, yes, at that point the officers would be entitled to move directly to the frisk, and they wouldn't have to do anything else, but of course, that proposal depends, number 1, on the tip being a reliable tip, which, of course, there is no showing here, that also--"
1999.98-1993,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1765.226,1778.601,"Does it matter if the tipster said, these are young people, and under Florida law someone under 21 may not have a weapon?"

1999.98-1993,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,3416.146,3280.664,Thank you.
