1990.89-1283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.827,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-1283, Arcadia, Ohio v. the Ohio Power Company."
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,11.119,18.455,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1283,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.807,144.879,"Mr. Phillips, what is the effect of the SEC order?"
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,150.912,155.858,"To the extent it applies at all, it would... it would clearly be just a ceiling."
1990.89-1283,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,183.55,189.915,So you don't concede that at least the SEC orders effectively set a ceiling?
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,189.915,198.409,"No, I don't believe that they necessarily... I mean, at some point they set a ceiling in the sense that you cannot exceed either cost or the market price."
1990.89-1283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,221.186,224.228,How did the court of appeals construe the order?
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,224.228,238.576,"The court of appeals was able to avoid having to construe the order, because it held that it made no difference whether there was a conflict between the... its... the SEC regulation and FERC regulation."
1990.89-1283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,251.866,264.315,"You don't really care whether the... I mean, you wouldn't lose this case if the... if it were perfectly clear that the SEC purported to set a ceiling, would you?"
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,264.315,266.097,"No, Justice White, absolutely not."
1990.89-1283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,266.097,268.099,"You don't really care, then?"
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,268.099,269.39,I think that--
1990.89-1283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,269.39,271.611,Like the court of appeals.
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,271.611,287.309,"--Yes, but except for precisely the opposite reason, which is that I don't care because it is clear to me that there is no conflict between what the FERC has done here and what the SEC has done here, and therefore it should make no difference how the SEC's orders are characterized."
1990.89-1283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,287.309,289.252,What would be the SEC's angle here?
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,292.253,307.805,"Well, they want to... they would be reviewing to assess the relationships between the Southern Ohio Coal Company and the Ohio Power Company in order to ensure that there are no dealings going on beyond whatever representations are being made in connection with these orders."
1990.89-1283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,317.441,320.814,"Who are they protecting, or who are they looking out for?"
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,320.814,331.871,"Well, they could be... in this setting they could be looking out for debt holders or preferred shareholders of Ohio Power Company, or debt... anybody who might have debt with the Southern Ohio Coal Company."
1990.89-1283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,331.871,339.568,"But I would think that they would... aren't they supposed to look out for either the coal company here or a subsidiary, rather than the principal?"
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,339.568,342.59,I think in general they are supposed to look out for them.
1990.89-1283,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.803,390.492,"Well, don't you think someone would be... would be injured if an acquisition of a company that has coal reserves that is entered into for the purpose of using those reserves in the... in the operation of a utility run by another one of the affiliated companies, if it turns out that that can't be done?"
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,401.829,406.803,"Yes, of the American Electric Power System, no question about that."
1990.89-1283,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,414.48,416.861,"I am just trying to figure out what the SEC approved, though."
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,427.259,437.177,"No, the SEC approved four separate securities transactions that don't say anything about the sale of coal between Ohio Power and the Southern Ohio Coal Company."
1990.89-1283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,471.429,477.132,"Well, Mr. Phillips, the SEC's brief here purports to quote an order."
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,484.587,485.088,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,485.088,490.532,--sold coal to Ohio Power could not exceed cost to SOCCO.
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,491.914,496.527,"Well, the specific language of the order doesn't refer to Ohio Power."
1990.89-1283,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,498.941,504.694,"Well, I know, but at least it said... it set the price at which SOCCO could sell the coal."
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,506.477,508.297,"Yes, it does say that, Justice White."
1990.89-1283,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,547.273,550.355,Even... even where the market price is above cost?
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,550.355,555.107,In terms of what the charges are?
1990.89-1283,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,555.107,555.428,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,567.605,571.388,"I would have guessed that it might have been a risky venture, frankly, to try that."
1990.89-1283,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,590.001,593.044,"If cost means market, I don't... I don't even know how we can communicate anymore."
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,593.044,596.206,"Well, I'm not the one who says cost means market."
1990.89-1283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,608.403,610.965,But that makes no sense at all in terms of ordinary English usage.
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,610.965,616.341,"Well what does... but see, the reason for that is that section 13(b) doesn't say things have to follow at cost."
1990.89-1283,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,723.192,750.78,"Mr. Phillips, I take it that the court below thought that the term ""subject matter"" could be interpreted broadly, and do you think that the court below made at least a reasonable construction of the statute, a possible construction of the statute, so that we get into a deference question?"
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,754.474,770.513,"I think if you take the combination of the statutory language, the structure of the act, and the regulatory history under the act it is not a reasonable construction of the statute, because... and also it represents an incredibly malleable interpretation of the term ""subject matter""."
1990.89-1283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,840.815,845.687,How... how do you define the phrase 318?
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,845.687,856.475,I would say that it would not restrict the scope of the possible conflicts to the identified subject matters that are placed within that provision regarding securities issuances.
1990.89-1283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,856.475,858.275,You have given me a possible application.
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,859.186,864.322,"Well, I don't think you can define subject matter in the abstract, and the SEC and FERC agree with that."
1990.89-1283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,886.398,888.578,That's an extremely narrow definition.
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,888.578,896.673,--But that's... the reason it's a narrow definition is that that is the approach that best effectuates Congress' purpose.
1990.89-1283,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,921.96,931.297,What was the purpose of the SEC's approving... approving these contracts?
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,931.297,935.529,"I want to make it clear, Justice Scalia, they did not approve any contracts."
1990.89-1283,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.872,956.435,"Well, don't you... let's turn to section 13(b)."
1990.89-1283,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,970.988,976.25,"No, they never... they were never required to bring the contracts to the SEC."
1990.89-1283,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,998.778,999.737,"Very well, Mr. Phillips."
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1000.328,1013.988,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1283,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1103.777,1117.918,"Mr. Wallace, the thrust of the power company's argument was that the SEC orders were either not enforceable, or that they didn't really set a cost requirement."
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1122.85,1130.627,--I don't... I... I can't say that I agree with the entire argument.
1990.89-1283,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1143.386,1151.303,You did take the position that the power company can ignore the three orders of the SEC on sales above... sales at cost?
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1151.303,1157.426,--The orders don't speak to sales as such.
1990.89-1283,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1195.79,1204.476,So they are describing the contracts as part of the representations on which the approval of the financing transaction is based.
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1204.476,1209.421,"Well, the anticipated future contracts are being described in this recitation."
1990.89-1283,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.421,1210.381,"Oh, you don't consider that--"
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1210.381,1210.601,But they--
1990.89-1283,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1210.601,1211.332,--a commitment.
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1213.222,1216.805,"--Well, that's one possible reading of them."
1990.89-1283,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1229.534,1236.809,So would you have any objection if we wrote an opinion saying that this is just advisory language and that the power company is not bound by them in any respect?
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1236.809,1246.146,Well as we have said in our brief we do not think that question should be addressed initially by this court.
1990.89-1283,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1261.627,1266.101,"Well, can't we discuss the case as if this is a binding requirement?"
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1271.133,1278.429,Our position would be that we would still prevail.
1990.89-1283,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1352.619,1357.893,"Well, has FERC taken a position as to the meaning of ""subject matter"" in the statute?"
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1357.893,1380.857,"Well, FERC based much of its decision on the notion that rate regulation is not the same subject matter as what the SEC deals with in prescribing the internal accounting measures to be taken within a group of affiliates."
1990.89-1283,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1380.857,1385.903,"Was this a position taken by FERC in a brief in an adjudicatory matter, I take it?"
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1385.903,1388.223,In the court of appeals.
1990.89-1283,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1388.223,1394.477,"Does Chevron deference apply to such matters, or does Chevron deference just apply to rule making?"
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1394.477,1402.042,"No, Chevron deference applies to interpretation of statutory provisions that an agency administers."
1990.89-1283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1402.042,1409.928,"This was a position taken in a rate proceeding, wasn't it, that they would not allow the pass-through of costs?"
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1409.928,1419.854,That they would allow the pass-through of costs only to the extent that they would be passed through by the market criteria.
1990.89-1283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1421.984,1423.276,xxx by the SEC's orders.
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1423.276,1424.428,--That is correct.
1990.89-1283,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1455.136,1463.593,"And that we held that Chevron deference is to be given to agency positions taken in the course of litigation in an adjudicated matter, not rule making."
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1463.593,1476.931,"Well, yes, this is the kind of thing that's... that's has been--"
1990.89-1283,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1476.931,1479.542,Is that Cardoza Fonseca... what is our holding?
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1481.064,1491.901,"--Well, I am trying to remember the precise circumstances in which the Chevron cases came up, but I--"
1990.89-1283,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1491.901,1493.383,They were rule making.
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1493.383,1500.897,"--I don't believe there was rule making involved in CFTC against Schor, if I remember correctly."
1990.89-1283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1510.374,1516.818,"We constantly defer to the NLRB, and it hardly in its whole history has issued a rule."
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1516.818,1530.198,"Well, as a matter of fact, there is a case before the Court this term which is the first... that's quite correct, Mr. Justice, which is the first rule making proceeding that the NLRB has issued."
1990.89-1283,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1534.84,1535.922,I think it's the first one to get here.
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1537.594,1549.353,"--In any event, none of the Court's previous cases in which they deferred to interpretations, such as NLRB against Transportation Management, involved rule making."
1990.89-1283,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.884,1562.879,"Mr. Wallace, whether you call it Chevron deference, or whatever you call it, is it correct that both of the Federal agencies feel there is no conflict between their two positions?"
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1562.879,1564.442,That--
1990.89-1283,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1564.442,1572.86,"As they read the statute, the two orders can stand... the FERC order can stand with the SEC order."
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1572.86,1592.132,"--The most I can say is that the SEC agrees that the no-conflict criterion is the proper criterion, but has not yet taken a position on whether there is in fact a conflict between the FERC order and the orders that the SEC issued in this case."
1990.89-1283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.132,1593.073,Do you think we should remand?
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1593.073,1595.414,That is our position.
1990.89-1283,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1595.414,1597.524,So that is the position of both of the agencies?
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1597.524,1600.175,"It's the position of both of the agencies, Mr. Justice."
1990.89-1283,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1600.175,1601.718,To which agency should we remand?
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1601.718,1603.991,Remand to the court of appeals--
1990.89-1283,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1603.991,1604.232,I see.
1990.89-1283,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1604.232,1608.764,--for a determination of the meaning of the SEC orders.
1990.89-1283,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1608.764,1612.898,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1613.378,1617.933,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1706.5,1708.701,That wasn't speaking to the facts of this case.
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1708.701,1710.423,It was speaking to the fact that--
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1710.423,1711.143,The general problem.
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1711.143,1727.684,"--just a few months before, Justice Stevens, the FERC, which itself from 1935 until November 1981 applied a cost standard to affiliate transactions, in November 1981 it decided to apply a market standard."
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1727.684,1732.587,"Yes, but when it applied a cost standard it was saying the price may not be above cost, wasn't it?"
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1732.587,1734.049,The price should be at cost.
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1737.261,1740.193,It should be at cost even if cost was higher than market.
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1740.193,1742.294,--The FERC--
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1742.294,1742.785,The FERC set the standard--
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1742.785,1747.647,--The FERC had never introduced the concept of market until November of 19--
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1747.647,1750.88,"--But one of the ironies of this case, as I understand it, is the cost is higher than market."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1751.711,1753.15,--That is correct.
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.681,1758.184,And has the SEC addressed the question what should be done in that kind of situation?
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1758.184,1761.826,--It has... it has not.
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.609,1769.375,So it hasn't addressed the precise situation in this case.
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1769.375,1769.959,That is correct.
1990.89-1283,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1771.494,1777.465,"Excuse me, that's still on the books that seems to address it?"
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1777.465,1778.331,--I'm sorry.
1990.89-1283,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1778.331,1783.302,Does it not have a rule on the books that seems to address the question?
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1783.302,1786.853,The SEC most certainly does have a rule on the books.
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1805.818,1807.527,Can I just go back to your description?
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1807.527,1807.817,--Certainly.
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1807.817,1814.061,"As you describe it, that position would not be violated by the rate order in this case, would it?"
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1814.061,1815.433,It most certainly would.
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1815.433,1816.282,How?
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1816.282,1820.176,The SEC applies a cost standard--
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1820.176,1821.327,"Unless, you said."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1821.327,1823.258,--unless it grants an exemption.
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1828.06,1830.571,It shall not be above cost unless it grants an exemption.
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1830.571,1834.816,--It shall not be other than cost unless it grants an exemption.
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1842.901,1849.764,So that boils down to the question whether when they specify cost they mean it as a direction it must be at cost or that that is a ceiling.
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,1849.764,1851.856,"No, I don't... I don't think so, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1283,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1998.729,2004.015,"That's a conflict rationale you are describing, and that was not the rationale that was used by the court below."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2009.511,2014.823,"I believe it was the rationale, Justice Scalia, used as a supplement by the court below."
1990.89-1283,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2054.621,2064.424,"Mr. Berlin, the orders that have... we have been referred to entered by the SEC in this case are somewhat ambiguous, it seems to me, as to just what they are doing."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2072.871,2085.201,"First, let me suggest that while they could have been written a bit more clearly, unquestionably the first order that initiated this whole enterprise said it should be based on amount equal to actual cost."
1990.89-1283,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2088.65,2093.585,"Well, I think it's a question to me whether the final paragraph of those orders incorporates all the recitals."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2096.888,2097.528,"--I'm sorry, Chief Justice."
1990.89-1283,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2145.941,2158.31,"But if I am sitting as a commissioner of the SEC, this transaction comes in, Ohio Power is talking about getting some securities, they recite that they are going to pay so much for coal from a captive coal company."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2168.338,2179.257,"Under the holding company act, you cannot go forward with an affiliate transaction, wholly apart from 13(b), without getting a whole host of authorizations from the SEC."
1990.89-1283,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.257,2183.47,"Okay, but why is the SEC interested in this particular price?"
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2183.47,2210.418,"The reason it is interested in this particular price is because when the holding company act was being considered by Congress, one of the evils that was basic to congressional concern was the fact that it was perceived that, as a consequence of interaffiliate transactions, inflated prices were being passed along to the utility purchaser within the holding company system."
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2266.797,2271.552,"Yes, but Mr. Berlin, your description suggests to me that they were concerned about the danger the rates might be too high."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2279.366,2281.519,"--I think not, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2289.436,2293.179,"The first one, insofar as you have described it, fits exactly into what I just said, I believe."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2293.179,2296.302,--It also had an investment protection objective.
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.11,2328.304,"In other words, the purpose of this order was to protect the stockholders of the parent company?"
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2328.304,2337.49,"The purpose of this order was to balance, was to balance the dual concern that Congress had for both consumers and investors."
1990.89-1283,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2337.49,2341.494,Investors in the sense of investors in the company that owns all the affiliates?
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2341.494,2345.625,"In the final... in the final analysis, Mr. Chief Justice--"
1990.89-1283,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2345.625,2348.176,Can you answer that question yes or no?
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2348.176,2349.318,"--Yes, it was."
1990.89-1283,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2349.318,2353.99,"It was to protect the investors in Ohio Power Company, which is the holding company."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2353.99,2362.795,"It was to protect both the investors in Ohio Power Company, namely American Electric Power, and the consumers of the operating utility, Ohio Power."
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2416.732,2430.301,"Yes, but you're using the term cost, you know, and this, as defined in this order the cost is including all sorts of things, based ultimately on the rate of return which is fixed by the rate-making body, isn't it?"
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2430.301,2431.38,"--That is correct, Justice."
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.38,2433.272,The two are inevitably intertwined.
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2433.272,2454.647,"That is correct, Justice Stevens, and that particular instance the SEC has certainly used its province, said that while we are going to specify and police most of the costs, we are going to delegate to the FERC, as it is permitted to do under 318, the responsibility for setting the return."
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2466.097,2469.746,"It says will be no greater than the return, which is language of ceiling."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2469.746,2472.52,--No greater than the return allowed by the FERC.
1990.89-1283,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2512.347,2517.75,"13(b) does refer, in fact, to both investors or consumers."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2517.75,2518.211,That is correct.
1990.89-1283,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.211,2520.444,It does say protect both investors and consumers--
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2520.444,2520.564,That is correct.
1990.89-1283,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.564,2525.259,--which would seem to indicate that you can neither be above course nor below cost.
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2525.259,2526.391,"I believe that is right, Justice."
1990.89-1283,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2526.391,2537.07,"And it does say such contracts shall be performed economically and efficiently at cost, not at no... more than cost, but it says at cost."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2537.07,2538.358,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1283,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.685,2607.045,"It seems to me, Mr. Berlin, you come in talking field preemption, as you... as you are now, but you ultimately end up defining the field by finding a conflict."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2635.544,2642.277,"Justice Scalia, if I have given the impression that I believe field preemption is appropriate, then I have misspoken."
1990.89-1283,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2653.206,2654.238,"Okay, you think it's a conflict case."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2654.238,2654.265,--No.
1990.89-1283,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2670.839,2672.77,That is what I mean by field preemption.
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2672.77,2687.039,"What I mean is what I think flows out of 318, that if with respect to a subject matter the SEC has imposed a requirement, then FERC may not impose a requirement with respect to that subject matter."
1990.89-1283,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2688.021,2690.251,Whether or not... whether or not it conflicts?
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2690.251,2697.825,"--Whether or not it conflicts, although I believe in this case, as the court of appeals went on to discuss, the conflict is inevitable."
1990.89-1283,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2697.825,2700.099,"Well, but that's field preemption."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2702.039,2721.863,"I can, I believe, visualize a situation where the FERC would believe that it could supplement the requirement imposed with respect to a particular regulated activity that would not, in its judgment, result in conflict."
1990.89-1283,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.863,2723.724,--And you'd say that's no good?
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2723.724,2725.616,And I would say that that is no good under 318.
1990.89-1283,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.236,2731.989,How do you determine the field?
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2737.885,2751.413,"If you look at the legislative history, what the legislative history tells me is Congress recognized that it was setting up two regulatory regimes, each of which were going to speak to the same companies."
1990.89-1283,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2759.267,2759.648,Yes.
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2787.558,2797.043,"But for the fact that your example is covered elsewhere in the statute, and the issue of accounting is one where the FERC is given--"
1990.89-1283,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2797.043,2797.824,Make believe it's not.
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2799.835,2815.556,"--If you can construct a situation where the SE... where the FERC can supplement, without being in conflict, then I would suggest to you that yes, there would be supremacy in favor of the SEC."
1990.89-1283,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2851.99,2857.654,"But the SEC comes in and says look it, you have this all wrong... or FERC comes in and says you have this all wrong."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,2898.963,2917.956,"It probably is the case, and perhaps I am biting off more than I need chew, that anytime the SEC, the FERC imposes a requirement that is different than the requirement imposed by the SEC, there will be a conflict."
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3004.83,3013.466,"Yes, but I don't understand how that advances the argument, because if you treat it as a ceiling that would mean a market that is lower than cost would be permissible."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,3015.166,3018.108,"I think not for two reasons, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3040.384,3044.626,"Well, there might be a conflict which would be present when market exceeded cost."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,3044.626,3051.271,--As in fact it did on at least two occasions before the FERC issued its final order in this case.
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3055.845,3057.946,Are those two occasions described in the findings?
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,3058.276,3058.727,--No.
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3103.329,3105.76,--Has the SEC ever objected to that?
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,3105.76,3120.991,"The SEC in fact has stated on two occasions... the staff of the SEC, in filing comments in another affiliate transaction case before the FERC, where the staff recommended--"
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3120.991,3134.157,"It would seem to me, just to jump ahead a little bit, that if that situation developed and the SEC thought it violated the basic order, they could easily go in and say to, say there is a conflict here, in the case of conflict our order prevails."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,3137.95,3144.806,"--Well, the question, Justice Stevens, is whether the FERC has a veto simply because it has the opportunity to speak last."
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3144.806,3145.988,You mean the SEC has the opportunity?
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,3145.988,3152.014,Whether the FERC in effect can put the SEC to the burden of justifying its decision.
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3152.014,3152.373,Of enforcing its orders.
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,3159.28,3163.692,"I suggest one that has to also get back to 13(b), and to--"
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3163.692,3175.6,"Well, but if it means just we're concerned about conflicts, it seems to me you are adequately protected by your resort to go to the SEC and say hey look, they are making us pay market and that is in excess of cost."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,3175.6,3176.992,"--I think not, Justice Stevens--"
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3176.992,3182.154,And then the SEC could come back and say in order to protect the stockholders of the parent company we are going to insist on our order being obeyed.
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,3182.154,3183.456,"--I think not, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1283,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3192.962,3199.708,"Excuse me, isn't a more direct answer to that question simply that the SEC does not have the option of enforcing its orders or not?"
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,3208.962,3210.234,"--That's absolutely correct, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1283,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3234.67,3239.775,What is the enforcement consequence of a violation?
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,3239.775,3257.927,Presumably the SEC can bring enforcement action against Ohio Power and Southern Ohio for violating the only condition upon which the SEC determined that it was appropriate to allow this affiliate transaction to go forward.
1990.89-1283,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3257.927,3262.068,"The mandatory injunction to reconform your pricing scheme, or divestiture of shares?"
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,3262.488,3265.041,"I think it would be the former, Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1283,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3344.272,3345.935,"--Mr. Berlin, your time has expired."
1990.89-1283,2,21885,edward_berlin,,3346.435,3347.205,"--Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1283,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3347.205,3349.455,"Mr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes remaining."
1990.89-1283,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3349.455,3352.918,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1283,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3450.487,3464.605,"Well, it wasn't irreconcilable conflict in Nantahala either, but one doesn't... just as one doesn't interpret a Federal-State relationship to allow the trapping of costs, one should not interpret two Federal agency relationships to trap costs."
1990.89-1283,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3481.368,3486.601,But that says nothing about what the FERC was going to ultimately do with respect to those.
1990.89-1283,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3493.597,3494.328,I understand.
1990.89-1283,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3494.328,3496.619,"But that is not the appropriate conflict analysis, Justice--"
1990.89-1283,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3496.619,3503.853,You do not think that it was envisioned by the Congress that enacted that provision that you be able to get that money back when you sold it?
1990.89-1283,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3503.853,3511.257,"--Not if it turns out that it would require the rates to be set at unjust and unreasonable levels, no, Your Honor, I don't believe Congress would have intended that."
