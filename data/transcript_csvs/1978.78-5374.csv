1978.78-5374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,26.172,We'll hear arguments next in Smith against Maryland.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,29.175,29.545,Thank you.
1978.78-5374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,57.055,66.721,"Well, actually, your client will be a lot better off if we still had the system where the operator answered when you picked up the phone and said “number please,” wouldn't it-- wouldn't he?"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,66.721,75.599,"If we had that system, then I believe that the government, they staged comparison to voluntarily giving over information might well be founded."
1978.78-5374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,78.184,83.363,"So, modern technology is actually improving the position of your client in this case?"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,83.363,85.715,"No, sir, I don't believe so."
1978.78-5374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,105.506,130.941,"But isn't one of your arguments that under mo-- under the modern technology, whereby local calls simply are not monitored by the telephone company, there is an expectation of privacy because nobody except the caller knows and under the old technology, whereby the telephone company operator asked you for your number, you knew that you were telling the third party what the number was."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,130.941,131.272,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,138.876,161.135,"Mr. Cardin, in agreeing with Mr. Justice Rehnquist, are you saying in effect that you would agree there would've been no search in the olden days, let's call it, my kids like to refer to it, when-- if it sat-- if a police officer had sat to the operator and broke down all the numbers that from a-- when a particular-- it said, “every time number so-and-so calls, I'd like to know who they're calling,” and he just sat there and wrote down the numbers they would call."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,162.333,164.192,"No, I'm not agreeing that there would be no search."
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,171.156,176.015,"Then, if there's no expectation of privacy, there's no-- well, at least there's no-- at least, no Fourth Amendment question."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,176.015,176.436,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,176.436,176.791,Alright.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,176.791,177.4,That is correct.
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,177.4,178.348,Okay.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,178.348,179.366,I think there's the search.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,193.061,193.405,I'm sorry.
1978.78-5374,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,194.902,197.542,And a good-- and the answer to this question would depend upon--
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,197.542,197.794,Certainly.
1978.78-5374,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,197.794,198.734,What she did.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,198.734,203.016,Yes.
1978.78-5374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,254.567,259.731,You're not-- are you suggesting this couldn't be done without a warrant?
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,259.731,261.427,I'm suggesting--
1978.78-5374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,261.427,263.459,It couldn't be done under any circumstances?
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,263.459,267.406,"No, I believe that with a warrant it can properly be done."
1978.78-5374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,316.53,321.395,"Well, wouldn't the average subscribers due to know that?"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,321.395,322.229,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-5374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,328.938,331.332,"Even if it's not asked, it's not private."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,331.332,333.846,He knows it's not private when he makes the long distance phone call.
1978.78-5374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,333.846,340.59,"No, he knows it's not private locally that, at the time, the phone company will cut in."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,340.59,346.025,"In those instances where he has made a complaint about a bill and they were checking his bill, that is correct."
1978.78-5374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,346.025,348.271,But there are occasions?
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,348.271,349.867,"Very, very few in number."
1978.78-5374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,351.226,351.863,Right.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,351.863,353.878,There are other occasions.
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,374.862,378.829,"Mr. Cardin, do you think the police need a warrant to use a tracing device?"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,378.829,382.021,"No, sir, because if I am the person whose--"
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,382.021,388.459,"Yes, but you're going to find out where-- you're going to find out where the call came from and invade that person's privacy, aren't you?"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,388.459,398.219,"I disagree because in the function of the tracing device, the device is placed on the subscriber's phone who has made the complaint."
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,413.564,420.137,But it obtains information about the other end of the line without the knowledge of the person at the other end of the line.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,420.137,421.747,I think we're in a matter of semantics.
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,425.219,427.569,"Certainly and it defines, say, A calls B."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,429.16,429.422,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,429.422,434.352,You find out that A made the call and A didn't expect you to find that out.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,438.809,443.093,The tracing device is not in actuality find that A made the call.
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,450.29,461.363,"But not until after they found out that a call originated from Michael Smith's phone, which they found out by putting a tracing device on B's phone and finding out that A called and originated from A's phone."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,461.564,464.714,"Well, in the Smith case, the tracing device does not go to Smith's home."
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,468.314,473.762,"Well, but for purposes of my question, couldn't a-- if it had gone directly to A's home and you, thereafter, put it."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,478.113,480.712,There are many persons that would argue that it is.
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,485.363,490.027,"And in terms of expectation of privacy, is there a difference?"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,490.027,491.667,"Yes, I believe so."
1978.78-5374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,520.087,523.289,Is there anything in the record about all these different things?
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,523.289,524.075,"I'm sorry, I did not hear it."
1978.78-5374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,524.075,527.617,Is there anything in the record about tracing and all of these different things?
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,527.617,529.186,Tracing backwards?
1978.78-5374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,529.186,529.625,Yes.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,529.625,531.633,"No, there is nothing in the record about that."
1978.78-5374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,531.633,535.359,"Yes, because you're wrong on your facts about the eye spring."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,535.359,542.028,"I'm sorry, I'm wrong in my facts about tracing?"
1978.78-5374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,542.349,555.808,"You pause up to the form and you get back the exact number of the phone that was called, where it's located, who it's register to, etcetera."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,555.808,559.408,I would only submit to Your Honor that the information--
1978.78-5374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,559.408,560.774,Would you stick with the record on it?
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,560.774,569.186,"The information that I have come from the investigation department, that's the CMP Telephone Company in Baltimore."
1978.78-5374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,650.164,654.826,"That depends on what state you're in, doesn't it?"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,664.351,666.78,"Well, the point is you dial-- let me change that."
1978.78-5374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,807.814,812.218,Unless this callee happens to be a police informant.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,812.218,815.899,"Even at that stage, you wouldn't know who-- where the number came from or emanated from."
1978.78-5374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,815.899,821.689,"I know, but the person who answers the phone though is-- knows the that the other person called him."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,821.689,824.171,"If I dial, Your Honor--"
1978.78-5374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,824.171,826.062,I certainly know that you called me.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,826.062,830.378,"Yes, the fact that the call was made, but you don't know the number that it emanated from."
1978.78-5374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.378,830.578,No.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,830.578,834.645,Unless you know me or assume where I came from or where I'm going from.
1978.78-5374,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,834.645,836.619,"Well, I-- if you say who you are, I know you called me."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,836.619,851.878,"Yes, I agree with that, but I'm saying, unless there is that type of situation, there's no reason to believe that anyone is recording the number that you dial or I dial, a local situation."
1978.78-5374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,882.427,885.281,"That's not true in the case of an arrest, is it?"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,885.281,886.896,"No, we're talking here about--"
1978.78-5374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,886.896,889.062,I thought it's search or seizure.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,889.062,897.362,"I'm sorry, per a search and seizure not following a valid arrest, yes."
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,960.91,962.907,"Mr. Cardin, how can there be particularity?"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,966.35,973.488,"Well, the-- we talk about average situations."
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,995.291,1002.829,"That's what grants the probable-- on basis of probable cause, find that hundreds of numbers are probable engaged in violation of the law and, therefore, they're all subject to penalty?"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1002.829,1022.872,"No, I think it will require the officer, at least at that point, or whoever the law enforcement officer is, to proceed with an investigation to limit to at least a specific phone for a particular phone that which he believes and has probable cause to believe is the phone number involved."
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.872,1026.997,"Your particularity then means limited to one phone, not to what can be done to that phone."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1026.997,1027.227,Yes.
1978.78-5374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1027.227,1027.233,I see.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1027.233,1028.931,I agree that every number will be recorded.
1978.78-5374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1033.324,1035.875,You're not talking about hundreds of phones.
1978.78-5374,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1035.875,1036.8,One phone.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1036.8,1037.673,I'm talking about one phone.
1978.78-5374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1037.673,1040.854,"Yes, we thought a tall building with hundreds of phones."
1978.78-5374,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1040.854,1041.02,One phone.
1978.78-5374,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1041.02,1045.347,"If you know the cost to that, you--"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1045.347,1054.989,The warrant would provide a duration as to how long the pen register device would be permitted on the phone.
1978.78-5374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1105.061,1116.988,"Well, Mr. Cardin, did your Court of Appeals hold that this was a search and seizure but didn't require a warrant or that it was not a search and seizure?"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1116.988,1122.035,I believe they held that it was not a search and seizure.
1978.78-5374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1122.035,1134.72,"You're not talking about-- if you're comparing the necessity of a warrant to doing it simply on probable cause without a warrant, I take it, that has no applicability here."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1134.72,1136.786,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-5374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1162.905,1165.376,"Well, they were designated by statute."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1165.376,1176.588,"I understand that and I believe that the statute contained that specific point, as this Court stated, in order to assure that we knew who was responsible for the application, who was--"
1978.78-5374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1176.588,1185.129,"Well, the State of Maryland could provide by similar statute that warrants could only issue under terms of that statute."
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1187.597,1191.619,"There is no litigation-- I'm sorry, there is no statutory authority for--"
1978.78-5374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1191.619,1196.801,"So, what's Giordano got to do with its statutory requirements about the-- with this case?"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1196.801,1219.69,"The fact that the Court held that that particular provision, the Wire Tap statute, had to be complied with strictly would indicate that this was a very important part of that statute and one which could not be accomplished by substantial compliance."
1978.78-5374,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1354.207,1365.818,"Mr. Cardin, was-- what was introduced into evidence against your client as a result of the attachment of the pen register?"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1365.818,1367.172,Photograph.
1978.78-5374,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1367.172,1367.537,What?
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1367.537,1369.523,"A photograph, as a matter of fact."
1978.78-5374,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1406.376,1409.839,"But-- and then, was the photograph admitted into evidence--"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1410.638,1412.401,"Yes, it was."
1978.78-5374,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1428.803,1429.797,He would never have been arrested--
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1429.797,1430.071,Yes.
1978.78-5374,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1430.071,1454.967,"Without the pen register, but that's even assuming a gross violation in his arrest, can he-- even assuming you're right and that his arrest was a result of a gross violation or a vio-- a very conceded violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment, does it follow that his conviction gets set aside?"
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1476.152,1477.079,"Mr. Justice Stewart, my--"
1978.78-5374,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1477.079,1479.706,Fourteenth Amendment rights prior to trial.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1479.706,1493.22,"At the trial of the case it was stipulated, as I say, that he, that is the accused, Michael Lee Smith, would never have been identified unless this device was used."
1978.78-5374,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1497.666,1499.853,It resulted in his arrest.
1978.78-5374,0,26801,howard_l_cardin,,1499.853,1502.014,And then it resulted his being identified.
1978.78-5374,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1571.308,1573.441,Very well.
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1577.084,1581.137,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-5374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1658.284,1673.789,"Well, don't you-- are you suggesting there is no right of privacy or no expectation of privacy as to what calls are being made, it is to whom they are being made, if they're calling from your home or your office?"
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1673.789,1675.876,"That is precisely what we're contending, Your Honor."
1978.78-5374,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1724.64,1732.193,Do you mean the phone company wouldn't be subject to suit if they were-- gave that information to a third party?
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1732.193,1737.49,"In the Hodge case in the Ninth Circuit, Your Honor, I think it was held not to be subject to suit."
1978.78-5374,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1759.162,1764.508,"The phone company-- the police officer is going to also get unlisted phones, too."
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1764.508,1766.519,"That raises perhaps a different question, Your Honor."
1978.78-5374,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1767.378,1770.779,I don't see why that makes it legal just because the police officer can do it.
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1770.779,1773.997,"But the question I'm addressing myself to, Mr. Justice Marshall, is whether--"
1978.78-5374,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1773.997,1775.923,I don't think you need all of this for your argument.
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1776.802,1779.032,"I was trying to respond to the Chief Justice, but--"
1978.78-5374,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.032,1779.722,I'm sorry.
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1780.391,1792.035,"My point, sir, is that the user of a telephone has no reasonable expectation that the information he imparts to the company as to the number he wishes to achieve will not be imparted to other persons."
1978.78-5374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1859.999,1862.125,"Well, let me see that a minute, Mr. Attorney General."
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1894.473,1913.466,"Your Honor, in almost every case in which evidence that has been obtained surreptitiously, whether within the warrant requirement or without the warrant requirement, there has been a subjective expectation by the defendant who arrives in the case having had his confidence betrayed."
1978.78-5374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1919.13,1927.185,"It's true of a distinguished physician who commits statutory rape, too, I suppose with the implicit assumption that his victim would not inform on it."
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1927.185,1928.696,It was true of Mr. Hoffa.
1978.78-5374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1955.872,1956.784,Those are unlawful.
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1962.818,1969.106,"Well, I think, Your Honor, that the answer to that question is it is, the last time I looked, unlawful."
1978.78-5374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1969.106,1979.736,"Let's assume, the state-- I thought Maryland-- gambling was legal in Maryland because you have horse racing and I didn't think horse racing survived except by gambling, but let's suppose you've got a state--"
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,1979.736,1990.552,"There's a difference, if I may say so, Mr. Chief Justice, perhaps between the bookie who is not regulated by the state and, thus, unlawful and the lottery location which is regulated by the state and is lawful."
1978.78-5374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1992.866,2005.518,"Well, the governor of the state probably in a-- let's take Utah now and he's placing telephone calls to a bookie."
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,2013.613,2015.085,"I'm sure that's true, Your Honor, but one--"
1978.78-5374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2015.085,2019.607,But you say there's no reasonable or legitimate expectation of privacy.
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,2021.036,2027.203,"I'm saying, Your Honor, that it's a risk that he takes and it's the kind of risk that this Court has sanctioned in a great many cases."
1978.78-5374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2173.078,2174.433,Mr.-- General Sachs.
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,2174.433,2174.499,Yes?
1978.78-5374,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2174.499,2178.439,What do you do with your opponent's example of a maid in a hotel room?
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,2183.316,2185.702,"That's true, Your Honor."
1978.78-5374,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2254.019,2256.313,And used to convict me and put me in jail?
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,2256.313,2256.903,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-5374,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2256.903,2259.907,That's a lot different from a pork chop.
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,2259.907,2259.907,Your Honor--
1978.78-5374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2260.911,2261.639,Going back--
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,2261.639,2262.785,"The answer to that is, yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-5374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2263.457,2290.09,"Going back, Mr. Attorney General, to the hotel room, I would assume everyone takes the risk that if he leaves a 45-automatic on the top of the dresser in a hotel room or a package of marijuana, that the hotel maid is under instructions and is very likely to report that to the housekeeper who'll report it to the manager who will report it to the police."
1978.78-5374,1,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,2290.09,2292.119,"Yes, Your Honor, I certainly agree with that."
1978.78-5374,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2380.401,2381.723,"Very well, Mr. Attorney General."
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2385.337,2416.532,"I would only point out, going back to where example of the hotel room, that in the instance where the housekeeper turns over information, and we accept that as being proper, we don't have that situation here where the pen register is attached not by the telephone company for its housekeeping purposes but by the police department for its investigative purposes."
1978.78-5374,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2416.532,2422.177,"But it's attached to telephone company property, isn't it?"
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2428.295,2429.69,That is correct.
1978.78-5374,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2445.758,2448.401,"In Katz, the surveillance was on telephone company property."
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2448.401,2449.129,Yes.
1978.78-5374,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2449.129,2450.905,A payphone booth.
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2450.905,2471.974,"I would close by stating, briefly from Burger, this is no formality that we require today but a fundamental role that has long been recognized as basic to the privacy of every home in America while the requirements of the Fourth Amendment are not inflexible or obtusely unyielding to the legitimate needs of law enforcement."
1978.78-5374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2482.796,2500.313,"What would you say if the telephone company sent a letter to all its subscribers and says “from here on, we are publishing the list of-- or available in our office on demand or on request is the list of all the calls from any telephone in the city."
1978.78-5374,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2500.779,2502.5,Under the Freedom of Information Act.
1978.78-5374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.5,2506.793,“We just-- they are ju-- we're just-- anybody who wants them can have them.”
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2506.793,2509.372,If the telephone-- let me respond by saying this.
1978.78-5374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.62,2516.445,"So, you have no complaints about that then."
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2516.445,2524.817,"Then there is no expectation of the privacy but, now, the way that it is done, I believe that one expects when he dials that local number--"
1978.78-5374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2524.817,2529.924,"So, you're just-- you're relying on somebody else for confidentiality."
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2529.924,2533.569,I'm suggesting that there's really nobody listening to that local line.
1978.78-5374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2537.832,2545.566,You're relying on the telephone company though not to-- not itself to keep track of the calls that you're making and publishing them.
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2545.566,2547.625,"It certainly doesn't do it now, at least to my knowledge."
1978.78-5374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2547.625,2548.215,So you are.
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2548.215,2548.404,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-5374,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.404,2549.093,Your answer is yes.
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2549.093,2549.479,Yes.
1978.78-5374,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2549.479,2558.68,"Under Mr. Justice White's question, when the telephone company announced it, you'd be in the same situation on local calls as you would on long distance calls, wouldn't you?"
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2558.68,2561.475,I would agree with that.
1978.78-5374,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2561.475,2565.458,And there's no intrusion.
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2565.458,2568.597,"No intrusion, physical intrusion."
1978.78-5374,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2568.597,2572.419,"Or any kind, because it's what comes out of the house not what goes in the house."
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2572.419,2574.268,"Well, there's no intrusion as such, right."
1978.78-5374,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2576.682,2586.464,"No, what-- when the telephone company puts the pen register on, all that monitor is what comes out."
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2586.464,2587.708,That is absolutely correct.
1978.78-5374,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2587.708,2590.662,And the only thing it monitor is the dig-dig-dig-dig.
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2592.404,2593.807,"And the time, I believe it punches out the time."
1978.78-5374,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2593.807,2595.556,"That's the number called, the dig-dig-dig-dig."
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2595.556,2598.345,The number called and the time that the call was made.
1978.78-5374,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2598.345,2601.243,"And, now, is there anything in the record who pays for this?"
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2603.51,2606.545,I believe that in--
1978.78-5374,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2606.545,2607.286,Or if the for--
1978.78-5374,2,26801,howard_l_cardin,,2607.286,2615.926,"The New York Telephone Company case, it was indicated that the government pays for the attachment of the device, yes."
1978.78-5374,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2637.512,2638.167,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
