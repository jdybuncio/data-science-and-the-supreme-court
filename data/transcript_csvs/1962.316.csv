1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,68.112,74.374,"The AFL-CIO is asking you to reconsider Street, and I think you might well do so."

1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,128.011,128.542,Pardon?
1962.316,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,128.542,130.019,The case -- only inconsistent?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,130.019,132.891,"Well, it is at least inconsistent."
1962.316,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,134.784,138.502,"The proviso does say, it's directly to the contrary."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,138.502,142.978,It is directly contrary.
1962.316,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,210.378,211.777,This is not a class action?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,211.777,216.236,And this was brought as a class action but the trial court did not sustain that it's a class action.
1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,216.236,219.344,[Inaudible]
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,219.344,222.46,That is correct Mr. Justice.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,270.896,277.896,Was there any showing that the union had publicized the political causes and candidates of -- which it had supported?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,277.896,279.136,There was not.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,279.136,281.605,So how did they know?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,282.572,287.313,These plaintiffs aren't even members of the union.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,323.128,326.746,"Well, and a couple of others or more referred to the state right to work (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,326.746,329.195,But they didn't know whether the union supported or opposed it.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,329.195,330.869,"Oh, was there any way they could have found out?"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,330.869,332.042,They could have asked.
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,348.041,349.364,[Inaudible]
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,349.364,350.432,Pardon?
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,350.432,354.31,They will lose their position if they didn't know [Inaudible].
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,354.31,355.448,Well that's right.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,404.274,408.454,Will they have to wait -- they'd -- they have to wait until the money has been spent before they can check?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,408.454,411.36,Well I have to wait until they paid it.
1962.316,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,415.639,418.262,"No, not to which they opposed."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,418.262,423.153,They may seek to prevent this expenditure for purposes which they opposed.
1962.316,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,424.32,432.783,Suppose the evidence [Inaudible]
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,432.783,433.714,If they had an agreement?
1962.316,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,433.714,440.575,"No, if when a -- the union must -- they have an agreement [Inaudible]"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,440.575,444.789,"Well that, of course, would be illegal that the union gave money to cope."
1962.316,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,444.789,451.395,But they gave any [Inaudible]
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,451.395,453.2,Yes.
1962.316,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,453.2,458.747,They have to wait before they take the money although the union had that understanding (Inaudible)?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,458.747,489.194,"They could say under the Street case -- I'm just arguing this under the Street case, not the way I argued the Street case, but assuming the Street case to pronounce the law as it is today, they could either insist -- they could insist either on the union not spending a portion of their money force up to contribution, or, I think the alternative was that they could be relieved of a portion of the dues -- the Court indicated those two alternatives."
1962.316,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,489.194,491.659,You're in effect could object those [Inaudible]
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,491.659,493.57,None of these unions have.

1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,494.295,494.877,Pardon?
1962.316,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,494.877,496.517,Some of the unions have?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,496.517,498.798,"In this industry, I think only one union does."
1962.316,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,503.103,504.485,How about [Inaudible]
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,504.485,507.937,"Oh, very common outside the railroad industry."

1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,551.203,552.201,No.
1962.316,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,556.469,560.354,"If it was a stipulation, they [Inaudible] --"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,560.354,561.013,"Yes, that's right."
1962.316,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,561.013,561.582,Is that it?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,561.582,563.488,That's right.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,574.454,581.139,"Well, they testified as I understand it that that was contrary to their views to have the Brotherhood spend any money for political purposes."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,581.139,581.753,That's right.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,582.331,586.055,"They -- if they wanted their money spent for political purposes, they wanted to spend it themselves for the --"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,586.055,586.434,That's right.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,586.434,588.398,-- for the causes in candidates in which they believe.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,588.475,589.385,That's right and under --
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,589.385,603.906,-- somebody taking their money away from them which is -- it was necessary for them to pay out of the statute in order to keep their jobs and then spending that money for causes and candidates of a political nature at all.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,605.51,606.05,That's right.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,615.129,621.932,"No, no, in the Hanson case, as you told us this morning, it was -- the record there was that the money might or might not be spent for political --"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,621.932,627.36,"Oh no, it would be spent for political purposes which might or might now coincide with their views."
1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,627.36,632.124,[Inaudible]
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,632.124,632.597,That's right.

1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,637.427,638.375,That's right.
1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.375,653.899,"Because they are saying, “You're not opposed to any [Inaudible]?”"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,653.899,655.167,"At all, exactly."

1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,657.213,657.801,That's right.
1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.801,669.107,"Even if they come in and say, use that 35% of your income [Inaudible]?"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,669.107,671.49,Under both the Street case and the Hanson case.
1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,692.578,703.595,"So, your position is that the [Inaudible]?"

1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,798.99,803.922,"Mr. Justice, I don't have information that remains in effect in the Street case too, today."
1962.316,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,803.922,805.355,Why do you say that?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,805.355,807.418,"I know, I had to locate, it's in effect today."
1962.316,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,807.418,809.157,[Inaudible]
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,809.157,809.671,I know.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,879.262,883.532,"Well, I'll ask you first as to your first point that the jury found otherwise."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,883.532,883.892,No.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,883.892,887.623,"Looking as page 22, the first -- the first [Inaudible] for example."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,887.623,891.733,The jury found -- the jury found that the unions contribute --
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,891.733,894.95,Dues and fees which they collect from railroad employees --
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,894.95,895.358,Yes.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,895.358,900.726,-- in support of or opposition to legislation and that's a -- you see -- say that there's --
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,900.726,903.819,But they're not talking about RLPL and COPE.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,903.819,904.912,"No, they're talking about the Union."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,904.912,905.471,That's right.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,907.202,910.88,"Well, did you file a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict?"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,910.88,911.859,No.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,911.859,914.479,Well you do have jury findings contrary to what you're telling us.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,914.479,918.94,"That's right, there's not a word in the record to support that because -- and there wasn't any point --"

1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,923.274,925.636,[Inaudible]
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,925.636,936.587,"Oh, -- certainly, because none of the money that is paid to the AFL -- AFL-CIO by the unions goes to COPE for political expenditures, none of it."
1962.316,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,959.319,971.35,[Inaudible]
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,971.35,977.823,It would not and perhaps the jury had contributions to State candidates in mind.
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,987.773,992.154,"They did say they were opposed to having their money used for political purposes, didn't they?"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,992.154,997.18,For political purposes at all regardless of what they were.
1962.316,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,997.18,1012.871,But your point is that in any event there was no evidence that anything [Inaudible] where in fact [Inaudible]
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1012.871,1023.533,"No, there is not one word of evidence and indeed with respect to COPE and RLPL there is a stipulation that none of the -- none of those contributions came from either of these unions."
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1023.533,1028.847,Was there such a stipulation in reference to the finding number two of the jury?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1028.847,1029.394,I don't recall what's number two --
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1029.394,1040.15,"Does an independent union used dues and funds which they collect from railroad employees influenced vote in elections to public officers, the answer, “Yes.”"

1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1065.361,1067.924,[Inaudible]
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1067.924,1070.386,"Of course, that's the -- dues money is used for that."

1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1071.548,1074.294,"Well, I -- Mr. Justice White, many people do."

1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1086.851,1088.248,"Well, I call it legislative activity."
1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1091.684,1093.89,[Inaudible]
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1093.89,1097.193,"No, its legislative when you're before a legislative body."
1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1097.193,1101.722,[Inaudible] submitted this for [Inaudible] candidate?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1101.722,1102.817,Yes.
1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.817,1104.035,Then that's it.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1104.035,1104.559,"Oh, yes."
1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.559,1106.805,"So, that is a [Inaudible]"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1106.805,1110.879,"Oh, for political, I haven't questioned that there was evidence that they used money for political purposes."
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1114.403,1116.981,Well what about number four?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1127.412,1129.554,There is not a word of evidence to support that.
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1130.89,1133.4,But it was that challenge that (Inaudible) --
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1133.4,1135.737,We asked the judge not to submit such a question.
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1135.737,1138.943,"Well after he did submit it, did you move to set it aside?"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1138.943,1140.269,"Oh, yes."

1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1154.669,1158.255,"Well, then you had a finding by the jury that there was -- that these facts did occur?"

1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1183.638,1184.032,Yes.
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1184.032,1193.641,And you did not present as one of the questions presented that you -- the question of whether the findings were supported by evidence?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1193.641,1205.715,"Not -- not in this Court because it isn't necessary because for two reasons, none of these dues or -- no dues or fees came from any of these plaintiffs."
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1215.175,1217.296,"Well, have they paid any dues and fees?"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1217.296,1219.493,They have not paid one cent.

1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1222.619,1223.422,"That's right, we haven't --"
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1223.422,1224.256,That's the reason.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1224.256,1224.861,Pardon?

1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1236.439,1236.839,Yes.
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1236.839,1239.709,You say they do not have standing to raise that that way?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1239.709,1240.12,That's right.
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1246.4,1252.216,But they -- they come in and say we don't want to pay it because it's illegal and we don't want to pay it and the Court enjoins.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1252.216,1254.399,"But in Street, this Court specifically --"
1962.316,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1254.399,1263.255,"Your point -- your point is that Street, we held could not have enjoined the payment of the dues under the union establishment?"

1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1266.466,1269.197,Is that the part that you are asking us to overrule?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1269.197,1270.666,"Oh, no."
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1288.07,1293.521,Well this -- according to this as far as specific cause they don't want their money used for political purposes.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1293.521,1295.924,"Well, you spoke about specific candidates --"
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1295.924,1297.238,I didn't say that they had to.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1299.719,1300.083,No.
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1300.083,1313.154,If I indicated there's a difference between making a man -- freeing a man from having his money extracted from him to support one candidate and extracted from him to support a group of candidates in political causes.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1313.154,1319.234,"Well, you certainly, repeatedly said a particular candidate or a particular cause and in addition you repeatedly said --"
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1319.234,1323.607,That wouldn't be one of the reasons that for a particular candidate or particular cause.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1323.607,1324.206,But I -- it --
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1324.206,1336.489,My thought -- my (Inaudible) -- my objection was on the ground that the union didn't have a right have the -- half of the law to force people to pay dues to it and it's going to be used for political purposes --
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1336.489,1336.764,To which --
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1336.764,1337.566,-- one way or the other.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1337.566,1338.019,"Oh, no."
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1341.016,1342.507,That's what they object.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1342.507,1344.475,And -- but a particular cause you said and of which --
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1344.475,1350.292,"Well, I didn't mean by that, that they had to go and look at each particular candidate to see whether that was the particular one."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1350.292,1351.091,And you also --
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1351.091,1353.271,"That would put a burden, I never would have thought of putting on you."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1353.271,1357.411,You also said they have to notify the union of the cause to which they object.
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1357.411,1359.162,"Well they did by enjoining them, didn't they?"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1359.162,1362.726,"Well, they haven't notified them of any particular cause of any particular candidate."
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1362.726,1365.482,"You said the objective, their money being used for political purposes."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1365.482,1368.454,"Yes, and they didn't say that, Your Honor."
1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1368.454,1371.657,"And that's by all political causes, all political causes?"

1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1373.111,1375.461,They have in every single political cause --
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1375.461,1375.934,That's right.

1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.015,1385.982,"No, it is -- there's no implication they took their money."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1385.982,1387.998,But they haven't given them any money.
1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1387.998,1393.569,[Inaudible] you still have to pay [Inaudible]
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1393.569,1395.774,That's right.
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1404.92,1407.65,"I meant as I gather this, they say they have notified them."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1407.65,1408.179,They did not notify --
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1408.179,1412.66,They notified them by an injunction and got an injunction to keep them from still using their money for that purpose.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1412.66,1415.457,"Well, this is an -- this is a theory of all law I find difficult to understand."
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1415.457,1420.024,"Well, I find it difficult to understand why you don't argue it on the merits."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1420.024,1420.502,And you argued to speak --
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1420.502,1435.245,"There's a difference -- there's a difference, a vital difference between those who think they have a right to spend their money for political purposes by forcing it from them and those who think if they have all the right in the world if they've take up contribution, that's your issue."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1435.245,1435.596,Well --
1962.316,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1435.596,1436.888,Well this is the difference.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1436.888,1437.572,Pardon?

1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1464.385,1464.772,That's right.
1962.316,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1464.772,1465.177,Is that right?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1465.177,1473.778,"That's right and Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Blakeney is going to make an argument similar to what you're suggesting and that is that they notified them by suing them."
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1474.434,1478.191,"I mean, -- maybe the Court did hold that, I didn't so read his opinion."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1478.191,1478.76,"No, I thought that they --"
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1478.76,1483.633,"You just said that you couldn't notify him by -- and then file a lawsuit, enjoin it and if that would --"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1483.633,1484.482,But -- I find it --
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1484.482,1485.795,-- keep it from doing anything.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1485.795,1491.783,I find it difficult to understand how somebody -- let's say he needs -- he has to notify him to have a cause of action.
1962.316,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1502.696,1507.965,But I suggest -- you assume what you're arguing on the merits [Inaudible]

1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1675.473,1677.768,And maybe -- maybe I'll better put in the Democrat.

1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1740.294,1740.825,It does in this case.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1740.825,1741.197,And does in this case.

1962.316,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1871.777,1887.333,[Inaudible] Do you think that an injunction restraining [Inaudible]?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1887.333,1891.763,"I could stop with that, Mr. Justice Goldberg, so far as the remedy is concerned."
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1909.252,1915.556,"Well you, you speak as though the only remedy was that paragraph which appears at the top of page 23 in the record."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1926.672,1928.384,That proviso you're talking about?
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1928.384,1928.931,Yes.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1928.931,1937.721,"Provided however as of today, the unions are completely enjoined from collecting anything from these plaintiffs."
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1979.326,1984.342,It's not a matter of modifying the injunction at the -- this is a very term of the decree?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1984.342,1992.369,"Yes, it was not applied to such portion as they proved to the Court is used only for collective bargaining."
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1994.737,1997.623,"Well, it will be reasonably necessary and related to collective bargaining --"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1997.623,1998.263,Yes.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1998.263,1999.135,-- between the defendant unions --
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1999.135,1999.295,Yes.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1999.295,1999.93,-- and the plaintiff's part.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,1999.93,2006.276,They couldn't go to Congress under that and as to an increase and the benefits of the -- under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act or under the Railroad Retirement Act.
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2006.276,2021.753,"Suppose you're -- suppose you're going to the Court and say we've decided that we're not going to try to force people to pay dues in the long run which will be used for collect -- for supporting candidates or political causes, would this injunction still work against him?"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2021.753,2023.148,It would.
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2023.148,2026.313,Have you asked him to change it on that basis?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2026.313,2028.626,"I have not asked him to change it, I appealed it."
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2028.626,2030.104,But you didn't want that?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2038.563,2040.904,Because we never could agree on whatever their political purpose is.
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2042.264,2047.925,"Well, I think both of us could agree that when you spend money to support candidates, political purposes --"
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2047.925,2048.254,Yes.
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2048.254,2049.138,-- or parties?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2049.138,2053.995,I'm not sure we would agree whether seeking an amendment of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is a political purpose.
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2053.995,2058.33,"Well, that's not -- that -- I doubt if you've had any trouble with the Court on that."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2058.33,2060.501,"Well, we certainly have because the Court has said we could claim --"
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2060.501,2073.744,"But your main trouble is, isn't it -- why not face it, that your main trouble is that you think if we were wrong in holding that the union which has a close shop is not free to force its people to pay dues to use for political purposes."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2073.744,2074.3,I -- I didn't --
1962.316,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2074.3,2078.397,Ordinary everyday political purposes like supporting parties or candidates.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2078.397,2081.018,"I think you were wrong in that respect, yes."
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2113.83,2115.94,"Just before you sit down, Mr. Kramer, I have a question."
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2133.234,2139.499,"No, the contracting out there -- you see in Great Britain, one of the political party is this --"
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2139.499,2140.181,Is the Labor Party.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2140.181,2141.679,Is the Labor Party itself.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2141.679,2142.545,I understand that.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2142.545,2158.45,"Now, they use the money to support their own candidates and they have different rates of dues for those who do not want to have their money used for political purposes, but that's by statute."
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2158.45,2162.195,I'm just asking you that -- how -- whether it's difficult or has been -- has proven difficult to do --
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2162.195,2163.447,"Oh, but that's --"
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2163.447,2164.412,-- doing it?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2166.756,2168.498,I know of no trouble about lobbying activities.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2171.517,2171.831,In Great Britain --
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2171.831,2172.183,What --
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2172.183,2173.071,I'm talking about Great Britain.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2173.071,2177.534,"Yes, in Great Britain, because they are not restricted because they don't need lobbyist."
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2186.658,2187.966,It's not a comparable situation (Voice Overlap) --
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2187.966,2188.211,Not a comparable situation.
1962.316,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2188.211,2189.307,-- your point?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2189.307,2197.72,"And incidentally, the amount that's contracted out is about -- is usually one shilling per year, sometimes two shillings per year."
1962.316,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2197.72,2202.078,Are you going to say anything about the welfare funds and the insurance funds?
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2202.078,2204.913,I'd like to but I see two lights here.
1962.316,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2206.197,2208.027,You have a moment to do it.
1962.316,0,36129,milton_kramer,,2208.027,2209.872,Yes.
1962.316,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2351.867,2356.831,Very well.

1962.316,1,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,2495.445,2503.704,"I must admit, Mr. Justice Goldberg, that there is of course often difficult question as to what is political in nature."
1962.316,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2522.68,2526.334,What was your answer be directly to the question that I have put?
1962.316,1,44064,whiteford_s_blakeney,,2526.334,2528.624,If one candidate is [Inaudible]
