1991.90-1059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.119,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-1059, Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. the Members of the New York State Crime Victims Board."
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,12.95,15.882,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1059,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,51.226,70.169,"Mr. Rauchberg, are there other laws in New York that apply to other assets of someone who has committed a crime; not this statute, but other statutes that would make other assets subject to reach under a scheme like this?"
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,70.169,75.411,--There are two sets of statutes that might be responsive to your question.
1991.90-1059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,115.582,123.496,"Of course, the forfeiture statute does not turn over the forfeited proceeds to any particular victim."
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,123.496,124.708,That's correct.
1991.90-1059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.622,153.639,"Mr. Rauchberg, does the forfeiture statute, is its reach limited to items that were used in the commission of the crime?"
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,153.639,157.973,It applies to both instrumentalities of the crime and the proceeds of the crime.
1991.90-1059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,157.973,159.045,And proceeds too?
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,159.045,160.274,"Yes, absolutely."
1991.90-1059,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,160.274,170.111,"So that in the example given in one of the briefs, under the forfeiture statute New York could have proceeded against any profits derived by Mr. Milken from his illegal trading?"
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,170.111,173.584,"No, I don't think it could because... oh, I am sorry, I misunderstood the question."
1991.90-1059,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,228.66,245.743,"Is it your understanding that under this particular statute that an author who admitted in the course of a book that 20 years before he had stolen a pack of cigarettes, that that would bring him under this statute?"
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,245.743,246.264,--Absolutely.
1991.90-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,304.566,316.113,"If there had been an earlier judgment in favor of the victim that had been satisfied, a judgment for damages caused by the crime, I take it, no new cause of action would arise by reason of the publication?"
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,316.113,320.557,"The State courts haven't treated that question, and so I suppose there is possibly some room for argument."
1991.90-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,338.001,352.801,"In your view, could a State court, through the exercise of their common law jurisdiction, make it an independent tort for a perpetrator of a crime to recount the crime for profit?"
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,352.801,353.702,I think not.
1991.90-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,364.231,373.167,"Well, suppose in a rape case where the victim is suing for damages there has been a book recounting the lurid details of the crime."
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,383.843,384.594,--I think not.
1991.90-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,397.643,400.775,But in the Hustler case there was no antecedent criminal act.
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,400.775,406.411,I don't think the antecedent criminal act is relevant to the question of whether the speech ought to be protected or not.
1991.90-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,406.411,414.686,"So in your view, a rapist could break into the victim's apartment, rape the victim, and then write a lurid account of it."
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,422.24,424.283,I say that is right.
1991.90-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,425.605,429.678,"Because that is a far cry from Falwell, because here there is an antecedent crime."
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,429.678,436.132,"There is an antecedent crime, but the crime is a separate act from the authorship of a book."
1991.90-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,440.745,444.068,Your position is that we should encourage books of the kind I just described?
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,444.068,453.775,"My position is that the First Amendment encourages the writing of all books, and it is not for this Court to distinguish between which books should be encouraged and which books should not."
1991.90-1059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.375,471.299,"Well, the First Amendment doesn't encourage the writing of libelous books, certainly, does it?"
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,471.299,471.83,It does not.
1991.90-1059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.83,477.845,"Well, why isn't this maybe another category of books that the First Amendment doesn't encourage?"
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,477.845,481.277,There isn't any issue of false statements raised here.
1991.90-1059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.554,543.954,By these authors.
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,543.954,553.06,"It can't commission these authors to tell their stories, which can be an important part of the public debate on those four issues, and that is four examples."
1991.90-1059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,562.227,571.984,"It can commission books from the victims, Simon & Schuster just has to put the money in escrow, doesn't it, and pay it ultimately not to the criminal defendant, but to the victim."
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,571.984,576.569,--What we have in this case is a garden-variety publishing contract.
1991.90-1059,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,611.451,626.852,"Well, Mr. Rauchberg, could a State pass a law making all income of a convicted criminal subject to escrow to pay victims of his crimes?"
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,626.852,636.618,"I think the answer to that is yes, because then we wouldn't have a content-based selection of speech for special treatment that results in a distortion of the flow of ideas."
1991.90-1059,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,636.618,651.338,"This is kind of a curious case because all the payment restriction cases that we have had, I think, stand for the proposition that the State can't limit payments by the speaker to a messenger."
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,661.486,666.008,I think it is correct to think of Henry Hill as a speaker.
1991.90-1059,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,704.747,717.356,"Suppose in Justice O'Connor's situation where there is a statute that affects oral income, it is shown that 90 percent of the recovery is from people who author books after committing crimes, or produce movies?"
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,717.356,727.922,"I suppose it is possible that at some point an apparently general statute could be shown to be, in fact, aimed at speech."
1991.90-1059,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,793.859,800.083,"But would not such a law also discourage the writing of books, although it would do lots of other things, too?"
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,800.083,808.779,"Well, it wouldn't specifically discourage the authorship of books, just as tax laws generally applied don't discourage the authorship of books."
1991.90-1059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,870.431,875.804,"Counsel, can I ask you a question that maybe is covered in the briefs, but I forget it if it is."
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,891.686,893.736,It was applied in this case.
1991.90-1059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,905.573,916.011,Do you understand that provision to require that the author admit that what he did was in fact against the law or merely must admit facts which this commission may determine violated the law?
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,916.011,917.621,--I would understand it to be the latter.
1991.90-1059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.621,930.02,"So if a businessman described a lot of business activities that were arguably violations of the antitrust laws, the commission would decide whether in fact that was a violation of law or not, even though he thought he was innocent?"
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,930.02,930.21,That is right.
1991.90-1059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.575,938.017,Which the Board determines to be criminal.
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,938.017,938.527,--That is right.
1991.90-1059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.654,1077.408,"What if the State... I mean, maybe their problem is making the law too narrow."
1991.90-1059,0,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,1101.609,1104.741,"It wouldn't have the problem I just described, but it would have different problems."
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1562.917,1573.093,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.839,1644.765,"What... this book told about crimes other than crimes committed by Hill, I suppose?"
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1644.765,1646.354,"Yes, it did, Your Honor."
1991.90-1059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1646.354,1659.584,"And what is the justification for, what if he had not written about any crimes by himself, just about crimes of his colleagues?"
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1665.267,1667.848,The purpose of this statute is--
1991.90-1059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.848,1670.15,This statute would not have covered it?
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1670.15,1670.541,"--No, it would not."
1991.90-1059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.298,1684.098,You mean a crime that he committed?
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1684.098,1689.873,"--That he committed, that's correct, that the criminal is then profiting directly from his victimization."
1991.90-1059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1704.527,1708.047,The underlying premise is that this speech ought to be discouraged.
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1708.047,1714.562,"--The underlying premise of this statute, Your Honor, no, is that... in fact, if that were the case--"
1991.90-1059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1714.562,1716.565,"Well, isn't the underlying premise that the speech is wrong?"
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1716.565,1717.173,"--No, it is not."
1991.90-1059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1719.326,1720.346,The underlying premise is that this speech is right?
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1720.346,1724.459,--The statute... The statute is neutral with respect to the speech.
1991.90-1059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1738.17,1750.047,I thought the whole justification for this statute is that the public is outraged by the spectacle of someone profiting by recounting a crime.
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1755.535,1757.037,"--Part of what you said is true, I think."
1991.90-1059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1757.037,1760.069,"But if that's true, then you are discouraging the speech, are you not?"
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1760.069,1762.373,"No, you are not, because there certainly may be outrage."
1991.90-1059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1785.473,1793.9,"Well, Mr. Zwickel, the State has certainly singled out speech for a financial burden in this statute."
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1794.489,1796.612,It has singled out the story of the speech.
1991.90-1059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1796.612,1802.459,And it has imposed the burden only on speech of a particular content.
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1802.459,1803.366,"That is true, Your Honor."
1991.90-1059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1803.366,1815.074,"And so how do you distinguish this case, then, from taxes, such as in Minneapolis Star or Arkansas Writers Project?"
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1815.074,1825.683,"In those cases, Your Honor, first of all, there was a tax directed against the press' means of publication, which because of the history of taxation in this country is presumptively a burden."
1991.90-1059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1827.743,1829.554,You're saying this isn't a financial burden?
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1829.554,1831.286,"--Well, it is an incidental burden."
1991.90-1059,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1854.505,1862.54,"Why does it not... why should it not have to extend to other ways of profiting from criminal behavior, then?"
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1864.541,1876.259,--I think the reason it extends there is because the legislature felt that the story of a crime with victims is a direct victimization.
1991.90-1059,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1908.612,1918.96,"Mr. Zwickel, you speak as though the law very nicely cuts out the profits that he is making because of his recount of the crime."
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1941.858,1943.661,"Your Honor, that's absolutely correct."
1991.90-1059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1944.242,1945.591,But that's ridiculous.
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1945.591,1961.664,"--What this statute does, of course, is it doesn't ask the Board to sit down and look at the work and evaluate how much speech is in the work attributable to the crime or what the reasons were."
1991.90-1059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1961.664,1963.944,The whole thing is presumed to be the product of the crime.
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,1963.944,1967.367,"For purposes of attachment, that is correct."
1991.90-1059,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2077.148,2081.179,"The purpose is, again, Mr. Zwickel?"
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2081.179,2090.516,"The purpose, Your Honor, is to ensure that people who commit wrongful acts do not profit directly from their victimization."
1991.90-1059,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2090.516,2095.17,"And I take it, in New York, supposing Billy the Kid had lived in New York when this statute was in effect."
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2115.606,2117.179,"Your Honor, you are absolutely right."
1991.90-1059,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2127.056,2132.329,Why does New York distinguish between those two kinds of books written by a criminal?
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2132.329,2143.478,"--I believe that the essential reason is because New York saw the story, the asset from the story as a direct relationship to the victimization."
1991.90-1059,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2143.478,2147.089,"Kind of inflicting injury on the victims all over again, so to speak?"
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2147.089,2160.94,"Well, we talk about injury on the victims, but the injury this statute addresses... and there is obviously a temptation to say, the statute is based upon the offensiveness of what the criminal is saying."
1991.90-1059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.762,2185.176,"If Billy the Kid wasn't writing about his crimes, but about travels in the West, and he made a lot of money out of it, I suppose if he had hurt some victims, the victims could sue him, but they very likely would have to prove their case before they could attach the money."
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2185.176,2186.315,--That's correct.
1991.90-1059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.315,2190.238,"Well, the State of New York here takes it in advance."
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2190.238,2199.474,"Well, it certainly does, but the key factor here, you also have to recognize, is the plight of victims, Your Honor."
1991.90-1059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2263.872,2276.538,"Do you agree that it is fair to say that the object is not to preclude the criminal from directly profiting, the object is simply to preclude him from profiting before the victims get paid?"
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2281.203,2281.824,That is absolutely right.
1991.90-1059,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2281.824,2288.659,So everything you said really about directly profiting is essentially beside your point?
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2288.659,2289.811,"Well, it is a combined interest."
1991.90-1059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2303.662,2306.985,May I interrupt you with a slightly different question.
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2326.836,2328.418,"--That is correct, Your Honor, and it does not."
1991.90-1059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.418,2329.21,Do you think it could?
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2331.901,2332.971,"Yes, I do."
1991.90-1059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.882,2335.922,"Why didn't the State do it, do you suppose?"
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2335.922,2346.07,--Because I think the interest that the State focused upon which is the critical interest here is the unfairness of the criminal profiting before his victims.
1991.90-1059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2352.404,2364.662,"If you think the interest in preventing the criminal from profiting from his wrong would be sufficient, which would mean, as I understand it, that no matter how trivial the wrong, no matter how great the reward from writing the book, you could still appropriate the entire reward?"
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2364.662,2365.534,--I do.
1991.90-1059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2389.199,2393.203,"It just isn't victims, though, that have access to the escrow."
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2397.366,2400.46,"--That's true, but there is a critical reason for that."
1991.90-1059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2401.772,2407.236,But also the State can get unpaid taxes out of the escrow.
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2407.236,2410.398,"--Your Honor, that's true."
1991.90-1059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.067,2446.123,"Well, it certainly reduces the chance that the writer is going to have anything left over."
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2446.123,2450.245,"That is possible, but there are two aspects of that--"
1991.90-1059,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.245,2452.558,"It is possible, if there is a judgment creditor, he is going to get paid."
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2452.558,2457.279,"--He might not, but we are talking in some of these cases about substantial sums of money."
1991.90-1059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2499.387,2505.101,"Excuse me, you keep saying an accent... an asset that flows directly from their victimization."
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2505.101,2505.291,--That's correct.
1991.90-1059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.291,2511.625,But you acknowledged before that the entire amount of that asset doesn't flow directly from their victimization.
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2518.401,2519.44,"Your Honor, that's right."
1991.90-1059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2519.44,2530.199,"Indeed, even if some of the advance covers expenditures for paper, pencils, for expenditures for production of the book, that would still be swept up into the escrow, right?"
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2530.199,2530.729,"Well, yes--"
1991.90-1059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2530.729,2534.393,So it is not just the direct product of the crime that is covered at all.
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2534.393,2539.214,"--Well, Your Honor, it is because the crime is in the story."
1991.90-1059,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2568.727,2578.204,"But it seems to me that a better way to describe it, instead of constantly referring to it as the product of the crime, is to say that it is an asset tainted by the crime."
1991.90-1059,1,28448,howard_l_zwickel,,2580.704,2589.74,"Well, I don't think New York looks at this asset in terms of what taint might suggest."
1991.90-1059,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2671.723,2673.142,"Very well, Mr. Zwickel."
1991.90-1059,2,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,2676.875,2679.506,Thank you.
1991.90-1059,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2708.618,2723.127,I take it that your argument would be... would be the same or almost the same even if in this book only crimes that Hill committed were described?
1991.90-1059,2,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,2723.127,2735.406,"Yes, it would be about the same, and if Hill... if Hill had in fact been convicted of crimes and that were the basis for the law being applied here, then one of the interests that the Court of Appeals of New York has identified, namely punishment, might be triggered."
1991.90-1059,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2752.82,2773.653,"You... I take... earlier I think you said that if... if a person has committed a very brutal crime, perfectly sane, and he just makes some money out of... out of writing about it while he's in prison, you say the First Amendment forbids the application of this law to him?"
1991.90-1059,2,40340,ronald_s_rauchberg,,2773.653,2774.084,--Yes.
1991.90-1059,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2794.046,2795.769,"Thank you, Mr. Rauchberg."
