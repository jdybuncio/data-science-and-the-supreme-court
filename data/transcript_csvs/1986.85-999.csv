1986.85-999,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We will hear argument first this morning in Number 85-999, United States against Phillip Paradise."
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,16.51,32.971,"The first decree, the first litigated decree in this case in 1972 focused on discrimination in hiring and found that the Alabama state troopers had indeed been engaging in discrimination."
1986.85-999,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,245.093,246.643,"When was that, General Fried?"
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,246.643,248.295,That was in 1983.
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,299.511,309.333,"General Fried, before you get into the main thrust of your argument, could I just ask you if you accept the constitutional validity of the one for one hiring quota."
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,309.333,318.439,"--That is not before us, and it certainly is a matter which would require considerable inquiry and we would want--"
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,318.439,319.308,Do you have a position on that?
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,319.308,319.774,--We would want to look at it.
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,320.324,321.76,You mean you haven't looked at that question yet?
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,321.76,322.826,--Of course we have.
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,349.327,352.195,"Well, the government does not challenge that at this point."
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,352.195,353.079,--It does not challenge it.
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,353.079,353.429,All right.
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,353.429,354.897,It is not an issue in the case.
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,354.897,357.183,"Well, it was an issue in the case at one time."
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,357.183,363.753,But it is not an issue in this proceeding because there was no... certiorari was not sought nor was it granted on that issue.
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,363.753,364.237,I see.
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,364.237,366.622,All we have before us is the one order of a one for--
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,366.622,371.757,Do you think there is a constitutional difference between a one for one promotion quota and a one for one hiring quota?
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,371.757,372.643,--Certainly.
1986.85-999,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,543.738,562.866,"Mr. Fried, may I inquire whether you think that the fact that the order was made conditional on the adoption of a neutral promotion policy and plan is a factor to be considered in whether it was narrowly tailored or not?"
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,562.866,567.27,It is absolutely crucial that it was conditional.
1986.85-999,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,569.52,575.876,"Well, was this order conditional on the adoption of a neutral promotion?"
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,575.876,600.574,"It was said to be, Justice O'Connor, but the one time on which it was imposed, which was in 1983, the police department was offering to go forward with promotions on a four black, eleven white schedule, so there was no adverse impact by definition on that case."
1986.85-999,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,606.025,610.211,Has there been a neutral plan adopted?
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,613.413,632.526,--The procedures currently used by the department cannot in any significant way be distinguished today from those which were in place at the time the department acted and offered to do its four for eleven promotion.
1986.85-999,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,632.526,636.578,How do we know whether a neutral plan has been adopted?
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,640.682,677.705,"There has as yet, and this is cited in our brief, there has as yet been no, no system which has been validated under the Uniform Guidelines, and this is why the idea that the decree was conditional and so it doesn't really matter seems to us not to work because what happened before the decree in 1979 immediately after the consent decree was signed, the department promoted four black troopers, six white troopers."
1986.85-999,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,709.242,712.944,May I ask whose fault it is that there hasn't been a validated plan?
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,721.467,730.573,"--Well, the department has adopted a number of plans, but a validated plan, Justice O'Connor, is a difficult and complicated thing to do."
1986.85-999,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,781.273,785.409,"General Fried, what is the meaning of the term ""adverse impact"" as you have just used it?"
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,785.409,808.775,"The meaning of the term Mr. Chief Justice, is that the numbers that the procedure produces do not depart by more than four-fifths from the pool of persons applying for the job, roughly speaking."
1986.85-999,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,820.398,823.952,I need a little more help.
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,828.336,829.438,Yes.
1986.85-999,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,863.493,864.493,One out at four.
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,864.493,865.279,One out of four.
1986.85-999,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,893.696,896.998,"But it is confusing to me, still."
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,902.385,908.456,"Well, it has in fact evaporated because it has never been imposed again."
1986.85-999,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1070.045,1077.448,"But, General Fried, you can certainly say the one for one is in strict compliance with the requirement that there be no adverse impact."
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1088.506,1107.135,"Well, the question that you are inviting me to speculate on was whether the police department and the Justice Department should in fact have signed onto the consent decree they did consent to."
1986.85-999,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1124.679,1133.785,"You say that the four for eleven bears a relationship to the percentage of blacks in the private force who are trying to be corporal, 25 percent."
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1133.785,1134.82,That is correct.
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1180.433,1183.985,"General Fried, can I just ask this kind of basic question?"
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1212.737,1221.26,"Well, before I answer that question completely I must say that in respect to promotions this was to enforce a consent decree."
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1223.712,1226.33,"But we do have a history of violations of the statute, as I understand it."
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1226.33,1231.032,We have the 1972 and 1975 litigated decrees.
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1243.773,1251.795,"Is that the message, for example, of the Swann case, that they should do no more than absolutely necessary to correct it, the school desegregation?"
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1254.231,1265.639,--I don't see the Swann case as authorizing a District Court to roam at large creating racial balances or using racial clarification--
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1265.639,1266.439,"Well, no, of course, it shouldn't roam at large."
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1267.657,1268.391,--That's correct.
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1268.391,1278.28,But has this narrowly tailored language ever been found in cases describing the duty of a District Judge to correct a violation of law?
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1283.916,1296.158,"He can do a little bit more except where the little bit more trammels upon innocent parties who are not themselves violators of law, so I have always assumed that the narrow tailoring requirement--"
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1296.158,1299.276,There were a lot of white school children who weren't violating any laws who had--
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1299.276,1311.251,"--But neither were either white or black school children being deprived of an education, while here white troopers are being deprived of a promotion that they might otherwise have, so there is a very large difference."
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1315.555,1321.808,"--But just to be clear, you don't have any cases where a judicial decree has been compelled to follow this kind of formula you are suggesting?"
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1321.808,1325.41,I rather understood the Sheetmetal Workers case to make that point.
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1344.991,1354.347,"But your point, point, as I understand it, is not that a one for one quota is always impermissible, but rather that the particular facts of this particular case it was excessive relief."
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1354.347,1356.132,"--Yes, as compared to the alternatives."
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1356.132,1357.349,Sort of an abuse of discretion.
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1357.349,1359.417,As compared to the... it had no sufficient rationale.
1986.85-999,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1359.417,1365.737,"So we are really not deciding any general principle, but rather whether this particular relief was appropriate in this particular case."
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1365.737,1371.308,"When you come up with the numbers one for one, you have to have a reason for the numbers one for one."
1986.85-999,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1385.116,1394.94,"Do you think, Mr. Fried, that possibly the judge was just tired of waiting for a neutral promotion plan and it was an in terrorem sort of an order?"
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1394.94,1395.89,"--Oh, I am sure he--"
1986.85-999,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1395.89,1396.89,What did we have here?
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1396.89,1436.001,"--I am sure he viewed it that way but it is very odd if that is what it was because it is a little bit like spanking a child who is being good to show him you really mean it and you are ready to spank him when he is bad, because on this occasion the department was offering to promote in a way that had no adverse impact, and subsequently when they still didn't have a validated plan the one for one quota was no longer imposed, so it was a sword of Damocles, but I suppose the point of the sword of Damocles is that it hangs, not that it falls."
1986.85-999,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1436.001,1444.42,Was it within the power of the Court to demand and insist on the adoption of a neutral promotion plan that was validated?
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1444.42,1464.484,"Well, it is within its power, I suppose, but it has as yet shown... it has yet to show that it considers that to be such an important thing, given the fact that the department seems to be promoting without an adverse impact."
1986.85-999,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1464.484,1475.626,"There are other in terrorem remedies available if the Court simply... assuming that some in terrorem action was justified, the Court could have done something other than this."
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1475.626,1476.526,Indeed.
1986.85-999,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1476.526,1480.28,"It is not even narrowly tailored for that purpose, you would say, I guess."
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1480.28,1490.468,"It is not... you are punishing a child when he is being good to show him you are ready to punish him when he is bad, and you are not even punishing that child, you are punishing his little friend across the street."
1986.85-999,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1490.468,1492.003,"Let me ask this, General Fried."
1986.85-999,0,18942,charles_fried,,1501.776,1521.357,"Because on this occasion a promotion was ordered by a court on a basis which we consider to be profoundly illegal, and the fact that it happened to a few people only once doesn't change that fact."
1986.85-999,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1558.463,1559.48,"Thank you, General Fried."
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,1567.135,1580.478,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at the time the one for one promotion requirement was entered in this case three alternative remedies had already failed."
1986.85-999,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1654.276,1661.897,"You disagree then with the Solicitor General, Mr. Cohen, as to whether the 1972 decree dealt with promotions?"
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,1661.897,1664.382,Yes.
1986.85-999,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.469,1880.956,"Mr. Cohen, let me try to understand what it is you argue that the Court could do."
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,1916.813,1917.748,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-999,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1917.748,1918.248,Why not?
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,1918.248,1920.7,That is not what we proposed in the District Court.
1986.85-999,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.052,1951.719,What about four to one?
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,1951.719,1952.119,Excuse me?
1986.85-999,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.771,1954.421,"What about four to one, four blacks for one--"
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,1954.421,1958.742,I think that four to one would have been excessive given the District Court's experience.
1986.85-999,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.442,1964.027,--What are you measuring... what is the measure of what the ratio would be?
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,1980.755,1995.931,"--I think the District Court had to carefully balance the competing interests at stake, on the one hand the need to enforce the Department's consent decree obligations, and on the other hand the need to minimize any burden imposed on whites."
1986.85-999,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.229,2180.017,"Wouldn't we have to second guess them all the time if the tailoring standard that we adopt is the one that you have suggested, which I don't... I don't entirely understand."
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2188.223,2189.09,--No.
1986.85-999,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.09,2195.812,"Why is that the magic number then, as opposed to two to one, or three to one, four to one?"
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2195.812,2200.764,The District Court had competing interests at stake.
1986.85-999,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2216.725,2217.159,Why not?
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2218.525,2222.963,Because it had proven effective and manageable in the past.
1986.85-999,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.413,2225.548,At the hiring stage.
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2225.548,2226.265,--That's correct.
1986.85-999,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2226.265,2236.473,"But as we pointed out in our opinions, hiring is quite different from promotion in the effect that is wrought upon the individuals that are harmed."
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2236.473,2249.697,"There is a difference, and the Court in Sheetmetals, of course, pointed out once or twice, I think that it was not dealing there with a burden that was imposed on existing employees."
1986.85-999,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2259.236,2268.325,"No, but it makes you think that if one for one is good at the hiring stage it is not necessarily good, in fact, is likely not to be good at the promotional stage."
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2268.325,2273.329,There are a number of other purposes that the District Court's one for one order serve.
1986.85-999,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2282.802,2285.637,"It was in terrorem, in effect?"
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2293.143,2299.046,"--Justice O'Connor, I don't know if the term in terrorem aids the analysis."
1986.85-999,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2306.7,2312.12,Did it relate to the number of qualified blacks in a pool for promotion?
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2312.12,2314.639,--The order was carefully crafted in that regard.
1986.85-999,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2362.119,2367.856,But the order on its face did not relate to the number of qualified people available.
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2374.26,2382.116,--The order would not survive if it mandated the promotion of numerous unqualified persons.
1986.85-999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.51,2460.966,What promotions had been made just prior to the... between the time of the consent decree and the entry of this one on one order?
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2462.652,2473.793,"Yes, in February of 1980, ten corporals were promoted, six whites and four blacks, pursuant to a side agreement entered simultaneously with the decree."
1986.85-999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2491.505,2500.526,"Do you think that side agreement over... was to generous to whites, that six-four?"
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2500.526,2502.693,--I am not sure.
1986.85-999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2508.18,2525.309,From the time of the consent decree until the one on one order was entered you can't say that there were any whites who were promoted who really didn't... shouldn't have been promoted?
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2525.309,2542.27,There were no whites who were promoted from the position of corporal other than the ten persons promoted at the time right after the consent decree was entered.
1986.85-999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.27,2543.537,You said from the position of corporal.
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2544.805,2545.422,Yes.
1986.85-999,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2659.645,2678.826,"Mr. Cohen, would a flexible goal of promotions geared to the number of qualified blacks available for promotion have been a more appropriate narrowly tailored remedy, do you think?"
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2678.826,2680.678,"No, it would not, for two reasons."
1986.85-999,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2680.678,2681.711,And why not?
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2681.711,2712.613,"Just like the eleven to four proposal, the eleven to four one-time offer that the District Court rejected in 1983, a proposal that simply reiterated the department's consent decree commitments would have done nothing to compensate for the department's delay and it would not have provided some sort of mechanism to compel the department to comply with its obligations in the future."
1986.85-999,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2716.017,2725.957,"Would tying it with a fine or contempt citation for delay have solved that problem, do you think?"
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2725.957,2735.313,"--Justice O'Connor, it is impossible to say in retrospect whether or not that would have worked."
1986.85-999,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2763.715,2764.748,Or fines?
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2766.784,2776.473,"Yes, Your Honor, but it also puts the District Court in the position of perhaps licensing discrimination for a price."
1986.85-999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2791.315,2795.886,Why is the one on one order any more effective?
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2795.886,2798.369,"Your Honor, it is more effective in two ways."
1986.85-999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2805.475,2807.794,Why is that enforceable?
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2807.794,2809.394,--Excuse me?
1986.85-999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2810.396,2818.717,Based on your notion the Court could never enforce anything.
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2818.717,2822.203,"Your Honor, I regret to say that I do not understand your point."
1986.85-999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2822.203,2828.357,"Well, you say the one on one order is all right and that it is effective."
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2828.357,2830.14,It has been effective That is correct.
1986.85-999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2830.14,2834.511,"Why wouldn't... that is because the department, is obeying it."
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2834.511,2839.713,It is... it is not obeying the one for one requirement.
1986.85-999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2846.402,2849.521,"Well, nevertheless, nevertheless it is implementing the one on one requirement."
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2849.521,2855.925,--It is not promoting persons on a one to one basis Up to this point since this order was--
1986.85-999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2855.925,2860.578,"Well, in any event this court's order is being lived up to."
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2860.578,2862.078,--This court's order is being lived up to.
1986.85-999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.078,2863.547,I mean the District Court's order.
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2863.547,2864.563,That's correct.
1986.85-999,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.047,2880.057,"Well, why wouldn't a ten and five or a twelve and six, some other specific promotion scheme, why couldn't it have been employed, just like the one on one?"
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2880.057,2888.646,"--Your Honor, there is no question but that in the choice of a particular ratio a District Court has to use its best judgment."
1986.85-999,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2916.563,2926.688,Is there any reason to believe that an order simply prohibiting promotions until a validated plan was adopted would have been any less effective than this?
1986.85-999,1,29424,j_richard_cohen,,2936.227,2941.28,"Of course, that would require the District Court to decide promotions from where, for example."
1986.85-999,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3098.15,3099.55,"Thank you, Mr. Cohen."
1986.85-999,2,18942,charles_fried,,3103.852,3105.554,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3158.688,3165.192,"General, why wasn't... why weren't validated procedures adopted?"
1986.85-999,2,18942,charles_fried,,3165.192,3175.566,"--Because procedures of this sort are extraordinarily difficult to validate in terms of showing, demonstrating that they are job-related."
1986.85-999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3175.566,3177.1,Over all this time?
1986.85-999,2,18942,charles_fried,,3177.1,3178.102,Over all this time.
1986.85-999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3179.018,3181.404,How long... how long--
1986.85-999,2,18942,charles_fried,,3181.404,3182.52,They still have not done it.
1986.85-999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3182.52,3185.839,"--Well, it sounds to me like you say it is just too impossible."
1986.85-999,2,18942,charles_fried,,3186.707,3200.948,The procedures that... I think my point could be illustrated by comparing the procedures before the 1983 procedures and those that are in place now and which the plaintiffs find satisfactory.
1986.85-999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3219.179,3246.579,"I take it you would say it would be sufficient compliance with the decree to says, well, we just, we find it too hard to adopt some... get some procedures validated, so we are just going to offer... the department will just offer to do the eleven and four or twelve and six or something that will not have any adverse impact on blacks."
1986.85-999,2,18942,charles_fried,,3254.166,3266.208,"They are constantly fine tuning, if you like, monkeying with the procedures to have them produce this result more or less automatically."
1986.85-999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3266.208,3270.361,"Shouldn't your answer be yes, that would be perfectly all right?"
1986.85-999,2,18942,charles_fried,,3270.361,3277.681,"Well, it would not be... it would not have an adverse impact on blacks, and those--"
1986.85-999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3277.681,3281.419,It wouldn't live up to the decree to get some procedures.
1986.85-999,2,18942,charles_fried,,3281.419,3286.121,"--It would not live up to the decree, but that aspect of the decree is slightly mystifying."
1986.85-999,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3296.262,3310.402,And you say that the... you argue that a one on one rather than eleven and four is an exorbitant remedy for failure to adopt some validated procedures.
1986.85-999,2,18942,charles_fried,,3310.402,3315.473,when you are not having an adverse impact on your protected group.
1986.85-999,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3315.89,3317.008,May I just ask one last question?
1986.85-999,2,18942,charles_fried,,3325.496,3337.054,"The no adverse impact is the standard of the consent decree which we as well as the other parties signed, and it is not in question in this case."
1986.85-999,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3337.054,3345.343,"I understand that, but do I understand correctly what you are saying if you translate it to numbers is that a three for one hiring quota would have been permissible."
1986.85-999,2,18942,charles_fried,,3345.343,3348.295,That's exactly what was offered to the District Court.
1986.85-999,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3348.295,3351.229,"I am not asking you... your view is, that would be permissible, right?"
1986.85-999,2,18942,charles_fried,,3351.229,3358.067,It would have been permissible because we offered it and the Justice Department raised no objection.
1986.85-999,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3359.135,3360.385,"Thank you, General Fried."
