2017.16-111,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.44,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 16-111, Masterpiece Cakeshop versus Colorado Civil Rights Commission. Ms. Waggoner."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,8.44,19.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The First Amendment prohibits the government from forcing people to express messages that their violate religious convictions."
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,31.76,32.56,Can I ask you --
2017.16-111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,32.56,57.92,"What if -- what if it's a -- if it's an item off the shelf? That is, they don't commission a cake just for them but they walk into the shop, they see a lovely cake, and they say we'd like to purchase it for the celebration of our marriage tonight. The Colorado law would prohibit that. Would you claim that you are entitled to an exception?"
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,57.92,58.92,Absolutely not.
2017.16-111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,69.72,73.72,"Well, didn't -- didn't he express himself when he made it?"
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,73.72,76.2,"Yes, he did express himself when he made it."
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,81.88,83.76,"I'm sorry, he did refuse to sell --"
2017.16-111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,83.76,96.68,"Well, could I -- but could I get the answer to the question? So -- so -- so if it -- if you agree that it's speech, then why can he not refuse to sell the cake that's in the window according to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical?"
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,96.68,103.56,"Well, in the context of if it's already been placed in the stream of commerce in a public accommodation setting, his speech has been completed."
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,116.36,128.2,"I'm sorry, didn't he refuse to sell cupcakes that he sells regularly to the public to some same-sex couples who intended to marry?"
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,128.2,133.52,"That allegation was never involved in the complaint, the formal charges, the ALJ's decision."
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,133.52,166.84,"But I thought -- I'm a little bit surprised by what you're saying because your brief seemed to suggest differently -- that the couple was looking at his already pre-designed cakes that he appears to sell without any customization, and they sat down with him, and he said I don't supply cakes of any kind to gay couples. So I thought this cake was about his refusal to supply a cake for any wedding ceremony."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,166.84,170.04,"Justice Sotomayor, that's not how he responded to the couple."
2017.16-111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,201.52,224.08,"Where does it -- where does it say -- I -- I thought that the requirement was he supply a custom-made cake, as he would to any other shopper, but that he didn't have to convey somebody else's message; that is, he didn't have to write anything on the cake."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,224.08,238.28,"In Petitioners' Appendix 57(a), the order is provided, and that order requires him to provide anything that he would provide on a cake in another setting for a marriage between a man and a woman, which includes words and images that he would provide on --"
2017.16-111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,238.28,253.84,"Well, suppose we exclude that and say let's make the assumption that he -- if he makes custom-made cakes for others, he must make it for this pair, but he doesn't have to write anything for anybody."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,256.6,268.04,"Well, this Court has recognized in Hurley as well as in other decisions that artistic expression doesn't need to include words and symbols to express a message or to be protected speech."
2017.16-111,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,268.04,285.0,"Well, just -- just one more thing, and then we'll leave this part alone, so at least as far as I'm concerned. Suppose the couple goes in and sees the cake in the window and the cake has a biblical verse. Does he have to sell that cake?"
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,285.0,313.88,"Under our theory, he would need to sell that cake because he's already created that cake with the message that he intended for it, but we are drawing the line prior to the compulsion -- there can be no compulsion of speech. If the Court were to choose to draw that line in a different place and protect more speech, there certainly is precedent for that. But under the compelled speech doctrine, when someone comes in and requests speech, if that speech has already been created, then that would be -- not be compelled."
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,313.88,315.12,Could you tell me how far --
2017.16-111,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,315.12,326.48,"There's no -- there's no -- there's no compulsion of speech, but if he is required to sell a cake in the window with the message already on it, that is compelling him to associate that message with the ceremony."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,329.6,338.04,There would possibly be an expressive association claim and potentially a free exercise claim if he was delivering the cake and there was other involvement.
2017.16-111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,348.64,348.96,But your --
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,348.96,349.16,Ms. --
2017.16-111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.16,359.2,"-- the question that I started out with, I -- I wanted to clarify that what you're talking about is a custom-made cake."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,368.96,369.48,Not at all.
2017.16-111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,378.08,378.6,Going --
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,378.6,378.92,Ms. Waggoner --
2017.16-111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,378.92,388.08,"-- you mentioned -- you brought up Hurley, but in Hurley, the parade was the event."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,405.96,407.84,"The artist speaks, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.16-111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,415.08,426.76,"Who else then? Who else as an artist? Say the -- the person who does floral arranging, owns a floral shop. Would that person also be speaking at the wedding?"
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,426.76,434.44,If the -- if they are custom-designed arrangements and they are being forced to create artistic expression which this Court determines is a message --
2017.16-111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,434.44,434.96,How about --
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,434.96,435.04,So could --
2017.16-111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,435.04,438.0,-- the person who designs the invitation?
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,438.0,438.32,Yes.
2017.16-111,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,438.32,441.92,The invitation to the wedding or the menu for the wedding dinner?
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,441.92,450.44,"Certainly, words and symbols would be protected speech, and the question would be whether the objection is to the message provided or if it's to the person."
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,450.44,451.16,So the jeweler?
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,451.16,457.92,It would depend on the context as all free-speech cases depend on. What is the jeweler asked to do?
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,457.92,458.36,The hairstylist?
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,458.36,464.16,"Absolutely not. There's no expression or protected speech in that kind of context, but what it would --"
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,464.16,467.68,Why is there no speech in -- in creating a wonderful hairdo?
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,467.68,472.52,"Well, it may be artistic, it may be creative, but what the Court asks when there's --"
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,472.52,473.32,The makeup artist?
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,473.32,474.52,No.
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,476.48,480.0,It's called an artist. It's the makeup artist. (Laughter.)
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,480.0,492.92,"The makeup artist may, again, be using creativity and artistry, but when this Court is looking at whether speech is involved, it asks the question of is it communicating something, and is it analogous to other protected --"
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,492.92,493.52,But I'm --
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,493.52,493.84,-- forms of speech.
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,493.84,524.84,"-- I'm quite serious, actually, about this, because, you know, a makeup artist, I think, might feel exactly as your client does, that they're doing something that's of -- of great aesthetic importance to the -- to the wedding and to -- and that there's a lot of skill and artistic vision that goes into making a -- somebody look beautiful. And why -- why wouldn't that person or the hairstylist -- why wouldn't that also count?"
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,524.84,526.44,Because it's not speech.
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,527.92,530.36,"I mean, some people might say that about cakes, you know?"
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,530.36,530.8,Some --
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,530.8,569.32,"But you have a -- you have a view that a cake can be speech because it -- it involves great skill and artistry. And I guess I'm wondering, if that's the case, you know, how do you draw a line? How do you decide, oh, of course, the chef and the baker are on one side, and you said, I think, the florist is on that side, the chef, the baker, the florist, versus the hairstylist or the makeup artist? I mean, where would you put a tailor, a tailor who makes a wonderful suit of clothes? Where does that come in?"
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,569.32,574.8,"Your Honor, the tailor is not engaged in speech, nor is the chef engaged in speech but, again, this Court --"
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,574.8,576.68,"But why well, why -- well -- woah."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,580.72,594.88,"The -- the test that this Court has used in the past to determine whether speech is engaged in is to ask if it's communicating something, and if whatever is being communicated, the medium used is similar to other mediums that this Court has protected. Not --"
2017.16-111,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,594.88,595.8,Does it depend on --
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,595.8,623.36,"So that begs the question, when have we ever given protection to a food? The primary purpose of a food of any kind is to be eaten. Now, some people might love the aesthetic appeal of a special dessert, and look at it for a very long time, but in the end its only purpose is to be eaten. And the same with many of the things that you've mentioned."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,706.04,714.48,"Certainly not all cakes would be considered speech, but in the wedding context, Mr. Phillips is painting on a blank canvas."
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,722.6,730.48,"You know, the other night I had some people over and one of them brought a box of cupcakes and one of the cupcakes was smashed against the box."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,763.76,776.68,"No, but when we have someone that is sketching and sculpting and hand designing something, that is creating a temporary sculpture that serves as the centerpiece of what they believe to be a religious wedding celebration, that cake expresses a message."
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,776.68,777.04,All right.
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,777.04,777.36,Is this just a --
2017.16-111,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,777.36,795.04,What would you say about an architectural design? Is that entitled to -- not entitled to First Amendment protection because one might say that the primary purpose of the design of a building is to create a place where people can live or work?
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,795.04,795.76,Precisely.
2017.16-111,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,801.44,803.8,You mean an architectural design is not protected?
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,803.8,805.56,No.
2017.16-111,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,810.96,827.92,"So, in other words, Mies or Michelangelo or someone is not protected when he creates the Laurentian steps, but this cake baker is protected when he creates the cake without any message on it for a wedding? Now, that -- that really does baffle me, I have to say."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,827.92,830.2,"Well, I did say generally no in terms of architecture."
2017.16-111,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,830.2,836.16,"All right, then, what is the line? That's what everybody's trying to get at, because obviously we've all gone -- I went to a Mexican restaurant."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,892.88,894.76,"Thank you, Justice Breyer."
2017.16-111,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,905.8,909.28,And there isn't one of the people I mentioned who doesn't think he's communicating something.
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,912.76,916.0,"It's not just about what the individual thinks they're communicating, though."
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,940.64,954.68,Would you stop -- would that belief that expresses speech trump public accommodation laws against discrimination or protecting customers from race? Yes or no.
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,954.68,959.88,"This Court has never compelled speech in the context of race, but if it were ever to do so --"
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,959.88,961.68,"Oh, it didn't in Newman versus Piggie?"
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,961.68,964.36,Not in terms of compelling speech.
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,964.36,983.8,"There was a -- he claimed that he was religious, that he opposed serving blacks because it mixed the races, and we basically refused both his free expression and his free exercise clauses."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,990.12,994.4,"Respectfully, Your Honor, I don't think this Court has ever compelled speech in the context of --"
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,994.4,995.44,I'll read Newman myself.
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,995.44,996.8,"But, I'm sorry, could I just --"
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,996.8,997.84,Answer my question.
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,997.84,1000.16,-- understand your --
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1000.16,1012.6,It's your theory -- is your theory that you -- that you -- public accommodation laws cannot trump free speech or free-exercise claims in protecting against race discrimination?
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,1012.6,1017.76,That is not my theory. That would be an objection to the person and the Court may find a compelling interest in that --
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1017.76,1024.2,"But if I could just, sorry, very quickly, I know your light is on and I'm sure you'll be given a little bit of an adjustment."
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1025.6,1036.92,I guess I just didn't understand your answers to Justice Sotomayor's question.
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,1046.84,1048.48,Very different case in that context.
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1048.48,1049.28,Not the same.
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,1053.4,1055.48,"Similar case, assuming that the objection is to --"
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1055.48,1056.52,Similar to what?
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,1056.52,1057.44,Similar to Mr. Phillips.
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1064.52,1067.08,You're just saying race is different?
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,1067.08,1067.56,I'm saying yes --
2017.16-111,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1067.56,1069.32,"I mean, I don't want to put words in your mouth."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,1072.0,1088.44,"I think race is different for two reasons: one, we know that that objection would be based to who the person is, rather than what the message is. And, second, even if that were not the case, the Court could find a compelling interest in the race inquiry just as it did in the Pena-Rodriguez case."
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1089.12,1102.16,"So how about disability; I'm not going to serve cakes to two disabled people because God makes perfect creations, and there are some religions who believe that?"
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,1102.16,1102.72,"Well, I'm --"
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1102.72,1104.24,So how about there?
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,1104.24,1112.48,"-- I'm not aware of any religions that believe that, but, if they did, that would clearly be based on who the person is and not the message in the final product that's -- they're being asked to create."
2017.16-111,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1112.48,1128.8,"Well, your client was saying that providing a cake to a same-sex couple was against his free-expression rights because -- and his free-exercise rights, because he cannot celebrate that kind of marriage."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,1128.8,1134.28,"Mr. Phillips is looking at not the ""who"" but the ""what"" in these instances, what the message is."
2017.16-111,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1135.84,1139.04,"Well, actually, counsel, that seems to be a point of contention."
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,1162.64,1186.0,"I would say that in Footnote 8, the court applies an offensiveness policy, which allows the state the discretion to decide what speech is offensive and what is not, and it did not apply that in a fair way to Mr. Phillips, which creates viewpoint discrimination, as well as a violation of free exercise -- the Free Exercise Clause. But what's deeply concerning is that is not the theory that Respondents are submitting to this Court today."
2017.16-111,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1196.84,1200.0,We'll afford you the full rebuttal time.
2017.16-111,0,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,1200.0,1200.52,Thank you.
2017.16-111,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1200.52,1210.4,Sure. General Francisco.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1210.4,1235.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it -- may it please the Court: This case raises an important issue for a small group of individuals, namely, whether the state may compel business owners, including professional artists, to engage in speech in connection with an expressive event like a marriage celebration to which they're deeply opposed. In those narrow circumstances, we believe the Free Speech Clause provides breathing space --"
2017.16-111,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1235.8,1240.28,How narrow is it? Consider Justice Kagan's question.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1258.32,1263.88,"Well, Your Honor, that's, of course, a question that the course has -- Court has to answer at the threshold of every Free Speech Case."
2017.16-111,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1276.04,1282.4,But the problem for you is that so many of these examples -- and a photographer can be included -- do involve speech.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1285.72,1298.76,"Well, Your Honor, I think that what it boils down to is that in a narrow category of services that do cross the threshold into protected speech -- and I do think it's a relatively narrow category -- you do have protection."
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1306.64,1307.0,Mr. --
2017.16-111,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1307.0,1313.4,"If you prevail, could the baker put a sign in his window, we do not bake cakes for gay weddings?"
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1313.4,1320.36,"Your Honor, I think that he could say he does not make custom-made wedding cakes for gay weddings, but most cakes --"
2017.16-111,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1320.36,1320.76,And you would not --
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1320.76,1322.32,-- would not cross that threshold.
2017.16-111,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1322.32,1325.4,-- consider that an affront to the gay community?
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1325.4,1334.92,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I agree that there are dignity interests at stake here, and I would not minimize the dignity interests to Mr. Craig and Mr. Mullins one bit, but there are dignity interests on the other side here too."
2017.16-111,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1334.92,1337.68,"Counsel, sometimes it's not just dignity."
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1356.6,1357.16,Uh-huh.
2017.16-111,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1357.16,1359.28,So where there might be two cake bakers.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1368.48,1369.2,Right.
2017.16-111,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1369.2,1382.44,"And in those situations, they posit, and I don't think probably wrongly, that it may come to pass where the two cake bakers will claim the same abstention here."
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1395.56,1396.2,Right.
2017.16-111,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1396.2,1399.68,All right? How do we protect those people?
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1399.68,1408.28,"And, Your Honor, I think that is precisely a situation where the state would be able to satisfy heightened scrutiny because their interests in providing access to goods and services would be narrowly tailored."
2017.16-111,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1408.28,1428.32,"So -- but isn't that -- isn't that the same for everybody? Meaning, look, we live in a society with competing beliefs, and all of our cases have always said where LGBT people have been -- you know, they've been humiliated, disrespected, treated uncivilly."
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1431.96,1432.24,Right.
2017.16-111,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1432.24,1448.64,"-- the gay couple who was left on the side of the highway on a rainy night, people who have been denied medical treatment or whose children have been denied medical treatment because the doctor didn't believe in same-sex parenthood, et cetera."
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1448.64,1449.52,Mm-hmm.
2017.16-111,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1449.52,1471.84,"We've always said in our public accommodations law we can't change your private beliefs, we can't compel you to like these people, we can't compel you to bring them into your home, but if you want to be a part of our community, of our civic community, there's certain behavior, conduct --"
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1471.84,1472.12,Right.
2017.16-111,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1472.12,1474.44,-- you can't engage in.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1507.68,1507.92,And --
2017.16-111,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1507.92,1514.4,So why is not selling or selling to one group as opposed to another not behavior?
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1514.4,1525.16,"And, Your Honor, if I could respond, I think it's because here we have speech involved, and this case is essentially the flip side of the Hurley case. In Hurley, we couldn't force a parade to include a particular speaker."
2017.16-111,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1526.0,1527.56,That was a private parade.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1527.56,1544.64,"And here, Your Honor, we don't think you can force a speaker to join the parade, because when you force a speaker to both engage in speech and contribute that speech to an expressive event that they disagree with, you fundamentally transform the nature of their message from one that they want to say to one that they don't want to say."
2017.16-111,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1544.64,1545.2,How about if it's --
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1545.2,1546.8,"So, General, you started by --"
2017.16-111,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1546.8,1563.24,"-- if it's a -- if it's a question of race? There's a certain irony in here because one of the things that anti-discrimination in public accommodations is supposed to do is to protect religion, minority religions."
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1563.24,1563.48,Uh-huh.
2017.16-111,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1563.48,1568.04,"So you -- you have already said that you put -- might put race in a different category, right?"
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1568.04,1569.48,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-111,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1569.48,1570.56,How about gender?
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1570.56,1577.88,"Well, Your Honor, I think that race is particularly unique because when it comes to racial discrimination states have --"
2017.16-111,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1577.88,1579.28,"Well, I asked you what about --"
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1579.28,1579.6,Sure.
2017.16-111,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1580.64,1581.76,I have your answer on race.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1583.08,1583.24,Right.
2017.16-111,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1583.24,1583.96,-- and religion?
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1583.96,1613.12,"I think pretty much everything but race would fall in the same category, but as this Court made clear in the Bob Jones case, the IRS could withdraw tax-exempt status from a school that discriminated on the basis of interracial marriage, but I'm not at all sure that it would reach the same result if it were dealing with a Catholic school that limited married student housing to opposite-sex couples only. I think when you get to this case, if you agree with our test -- and I know that I have a little bit of an uphill battle in convincing some of you of that."
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1621.52,1635.36,"General, it -- it seems as though there are kind of three axes on which people are asking you what's the line? How do we draw the line? So one axis is what we started with, like what about the chef and the florist --"
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1635.36,1636.04,"Speech, non-speech."
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1636.04,1638.8,"-- and -- and, you know, everybody else that participates --"
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1638.8,1639.0,Uh-huh.
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1639.0,1653.72,"-- in a wedding? A second axis is, well, why is this only about gay people? Why isn't it about race? Why isn't it about gender? Why isn't it about people of different religions? So that's a second axis."
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1653.72,1653.96,Uh-huh.
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1653.96,1661.84,"And there's a third axis, which is why is it just about weddings? You say ceremonies, events."
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1682.96,1683.6,Thank you.
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1683.6,1685.68,"Which, you know -- so let me -- I'll just pick one of those."
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1702.32,1708.68,"So, Your Honor, if I could answer that question starting out with another example that illustrates the point in applying it to your example --"
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1708.68,1710.04,"Well, I'd like my example, please. (Laughter.)"
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1710.04,1710.24,Sure.
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1715.16,1716.08,"No, there is."
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1716.08,1716.6,-- probably no expressive event.
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1716.6,1719.76,The chef is expressing something about how he feels --
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1719.76,1719.92,Right.
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1719.92,1722.72,-- about same-sex couples and same-sex marriage.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1727.76,1728.12,And that's where --
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1728.12,1728.56,Just like --
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1728.56,1729.24,Sure.
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1729.24,1733.92,-- the baker doesn't want to celebrate a same-sex marriage.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1733.92,1744.28,"And that's where I'd go to something that I think that my friends on the other side have to deal with, is often is the case in First Amendment law you're dealing with something that some -- everybody clearly agrees is speech."
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1755.2,1760.76,"Well, I -- Mr. -- General, really, I mean, could -- could we just -- I -- I guess I'd like an answer to my hypothetical."
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1760.76,1761.04,Sure.
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1768.44,1778.44,"So the baker is speech, but the -- the great chef who's like everything is perfect on the plate and it's a work of art, it's a masterpiece?"
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1778.44,1781.52,"Well, Your Honor, you have to confront that issue in every First Amendment case, if you're --"
2017.16-111,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1781.52,1786.4,"You know, General, my -- my colleagues I think go to more elite restaurants than I do, but my -- (Laughter.)"
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1786.4,1787.64,"Same here, Your Honor."
2017.16-111,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1787.64,1790.68,I -- I -- I think that if --
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1790.68,1791.72,"Well, Ollie's Barbecue."
2017.16-111,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1791.72,1810.76,"If -- if in my -- if in my dreams I could go to a Michelin, I don't know, one-tenth star, I don't know, two-star restaurant, and there was a menu of wonderful dishes created by the chef with -- with great creativity, and I said I really don't want any of these."
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1815.44,1818.88,"Probably not, Your Honor, but I think the critical question always --"
2017.16-111,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1818.88,1833.4,"He's serving up -- he creates something when he makes -- when he devises those dishes and when somebody comes in and asks to buy one, he is just mechanically producing another example of the thing that he created earlier."
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1833.4,1835.04,Yes.
2017.16-111,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1836.12,1839.6,Why don't -- why don't you take an extra five minutes and I'll accord the same to your friends.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1839.6,1845.44,"Well, thank you. And so what happens, though, in every free-speech case you've got to make that initial cut."
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1849.64,1849.68,Okay.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1869.88,1874.6,"Well, Your Honor, if it's the exact same cake and it crosses that threshold into speech, I would say --"
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1874.6,1874.92,It's a great cake.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1874.92,1875.36,"Yeah, he can --"
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1875.36,1876.6,What do you mean is it the exact same cake?
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1876.6,1888.68,"No, what I'm saying is if it's the same type of highly-sculpted stylized cake that Mr. Phillips makes, such that in our view it crosses the line into speech, then you can't force him to create that any more than you can force the sculptor --"
2017.16-111,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1888.68,1891.4,"So, General, what -- what is the line? How -- how would you have this Court draw the line?"
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1891.4,1891.96,Sure.
2017.16-111,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1893.2,1894.24,You've been asked a lot of specifics --
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1894.24,1894.44,Yeah.
2017.16-111,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1894.44,1898.72,-- but I'd -- I'd appreciate a more abstract general rule that the government suggests.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1898.72,1904.24,"I think there are a couple of ways to draw that line, and this is something that the Court has to struggle with in a lot of cases."
2017.16-111,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1911.52,1912.64,Like the Jackson Pollock?
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1912.64,1913.32,Exactly.
2017.16-111,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1943.76,1947.44,"In fact, I have yet to have a -- a wedding cake that I would say tastes great. (Laughter.)"
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1947.44,1953.32,"And, Your Honor, my wedding cake, the top of it is still sitting in our freezer, and I'm sure it no longer tastes great."
2017.16-111,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1953.32,1953.68,Yeah.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1953.68,1963.08,"But I think the point is when you cross that threshold into free speech, the question is can you compel somebody to create and contribute speech to an expressive event --"
2017.16-111,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1963.08,1964.32,Is it a predominant purpose test --
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1964.32,1964.92,-- that they oppose.
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1964.92,1965.52,How about this --
2017.16-111,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1965.52,1971.4,-- or is it -- would you say it's a predominant purpose or a predominant effect? How would you characterize that?
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1971.4,1975.48,So if you're talking about the line between speech and non-speech --
2017.16-111,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1975.48,1975.84,Yes.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1975.84,1977.76,-- with the item that's part utilitarian and part art --
2017.16-111,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1977.76,1978.76,"Yes, yes."
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1978.76,1983.24,I'd say is it predominantly expressive or predominantly utilitarian?
2017.16-111,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1983.24,1985.4,In its purpose or its effect on others?
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1985.4,1986.96,I think -- I think both.
2017.16-111,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1997.96,1999.2,I'm not going to --
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1999.2,2012.88,"What if somebody comes in, it's a baker who's an atheist and really can't stand any religion, and somebody comes in and says I want one of your very, very special, special cakes for a First Communion --"
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2012.88,2013.0,Uh-huh.
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2013.0,2013.96,-- or for a Bar Mitzvah.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2021.0,2021.04,Right.
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2021.04,2022.96,-- in the context of a religious ceremony.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2022.96,2027.56,"Well, and, again, I think if you apply these tests, you first have to decide whether --"
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2027.56,2029.12,I just want the answer.
2017.16-111,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2029.12,2033.96,"Well, what I'm saying is that when you apply these tests you've first got to decide if the cake rises to the level of speech."
2017.16-111,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2034.2,2035.8,"It's a special, special cake."

The -- the Commission had before it the example of three complaints filed by an individual whose creed includes the traditional Judeo-Christian opposition to same-sex marriage, and he requested cakes that expressed that point of view, and those -- there were bakers who said no, we won't do that because it is offensive. And the Commission said: That's okay. It's okay for a baker who supports same-sex marriage to refuse to create a cake with a message that is opposed to same-sex marriage. But when the tables are turned and you have a baker who opposes same-sex marriage, that baker may be compelled to create a cake that expresses approval of same-sex marriage."

2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2978.92,2999.12,"Justice Sotomayor, in that latter case, if that was truly a product he wouldn't sell to any other customer, he would not have to sell it to this customer. But if it's a question of a cake he would sell to any other customer, he cannot say I have a very strong objection to interracial or interfaith marriages and I don't want to send message about those -- those events, and so I'm not going to sell it to you."
2017.16-111,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3001.68,3001.96,Counselor --

2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3002.56,3004.88,"-- law, and it would be a First Amendment objection."
2017.16-111,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3004.88,3009.96,"Counselor, tolerance is essential in a free society."
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3024.4,3025.4,"And, Your Honor, I --"
2017.16-111,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3025.4,3033.88,"And -- because accommodation is, quite possible, we assume there were other shops that -- other good bakery shops that were available."
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3033.88,3042.0,"Your Honor, I don't -- I don't agree that Colorado hasn't taken very seriously the rights of those who wish to practice their faith."
2017.16-111,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3072.04,3072.64,"Mr. Yarger, may I ask --"
2017.16-111,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3072.64,3086.08,"I'm asking can you do this? Can you -- can a baker say do this? Could the baker say, you know, there are a lot of people I don't want to serve, so I'm going to affiliate with my friend, Smith, who's down the street, and those people I don't want to serve, Smith will serve."
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3092.08,3093.32,"It would be, Your Honor. You --"
2017.16-111,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3093.32,3094.08,It would be legal?
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3094.08,3095.6,"-- can't turn -- no, no."
2017.16-111,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3095.6,3096.36,It would be illegal?
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3096.36,3099.4,If -- you cannot turn away from your storefront if you're a retail store.
2017.16-111,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3099.4,3101.12,"No, it's a -- it's a joint venture."
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3111.28,3125.16,I don't -- I -- I would say that there's -- there is a possibility that that does not violate the law if there's not some other pretext there to ensure that a disfavored class of customers receives lesser service.
2017.16-111,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3127.04,3133.08,"Does it make a difference, was -- was same-sex marriage permitted in Colorado at the time of these events?"
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3133.08,3133.96,"It was not, Your Honor."
2017.16-111,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3133.96,3135.08,Does that make a difference?
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3135.08,3136.48,"I don't think it does, Your Honor."
2017.16-111,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3136.48,3145.04,"Could he have said I'm not going to make a cake for, you know, celebrating events that aren't permitted in Colorado?"
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3145.04,3148.04,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice -- may I answer?"
2017.16-111,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3148.04,3150.88,You have five -- five more minutes.
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3150.88,3151.2,Oh.
2017.16-111,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3151.2,3152.96,If you want. (Laughter.)
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3152.96,3154.8,"I'll have to think about that, Your Honor."
2017.16-111,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3165.24,3170.24,Would Colorado be required to give full faith and credit to the Massachusetts marriage?
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3170.24,3172.2,"Well, it certainly would today, Your Honor."
2017.16-111,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3172.2,3174.4,But it wouldn't at the time.
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3174.4,3174.64,"No, it wouldn't."
2017.16-111,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3174.64,3175.6,It did not at the time.
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3222.32,3229.96,"Well, Your Honor, again, it -- it -- the decision by this bakery was it wouldn't sell any product --"
2017.16-111,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3229.96,3230.24,No --
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3230.24,3231.44,"-- of any kind, not even when the same --"
2017.16-111,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3231.44,3232.72,"-- that's not right, Mr. Yarger."
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3255.96,3257.92,"That's not incorrect, Your Honor."
2017.16-111,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3274.08,3303.6,"And we have a history of -- in the questioning by -- of Petitioners' counsel, we explored the line between speech and non-speech, but as I understand your position, it would be the same if what was involved here were words. Am I wrong? If he would put a particular form of words on a wedding cake, on a cake for one customer, he has to put the same form of words, the same exact words, on a wedding cake for any other customer, regardless of the context?"
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3303.6,3312.28,"That's -- that's right, just as he would have to sell a happy birthday cake to a member of the Jewish faith or an African-American couple."
2017.16-111,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3312.28,3325.4,"So, if someone came in and said: I want a cake for -- to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and I want it to say November 9, the best day in history, okay, sells them a cake."
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3336.64,3340.4,"Your Honor, that wouldn't be -- the -- the test is whether --"
2017.16-111,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3340.4,3342.08,It's exactly the same words.
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3342.08,3343.32,"It is, Your Honor."
2017.16-111,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3379.16,3381.6,I -- I have a quick question about the remedy.
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3409.52,3418.28,He -- a training requirement is a common remedy that's used in many civil rights cases.
2017.16-111,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3418.4,3418.52,Yeah.
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3419.48,3421.08,He doesn't have to say that his --
2017.16-111,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3421.08,3447.04,"Mr. Yarger, again, I agree with you, some sort of training by an outside group, but this order was ordering him to provide training and presumably compelling him to speak, therefore, and to speak in ways that maybe offend his religion and certainly compel him to speak. And given that, plus the discriminatory language in the -- in the Commission's discussion, I just -- that concerns me, and I just wonder what you have to say about it."
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3447.04,3458.6,"I understand, Your Honor, if -- all that's required in these training sessions is an understanding and a demonstrated understanding of the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act. It has nothing to do with a particular person's belief."
2017.16-111,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3467.24,3473.96,"Part of that speech is that state law, in this case, supersedes our religious beliefs, and he has to teach that to his family."
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3476.24,3477.8,He has to speak about the fact that --
2017.16-111,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3477.8,3478.72,His family who are the employees.
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3478.72,3485.72,"-- in running a public accommodation that's open to all people, he cannot use his faith to discriminate based on identity --"
2017.16-111,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3485.72,3486.52,He doesn't have to --
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3486.52,3488.56,-- in selling a good he would otherwise sell.
2017.16-111,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3488.56,3494.4,"The question does he -- he doesn't have to tell his family -- I mean, his belief is his belief."
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3495.24,3495.72,That's --
2017.16-111,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3495.72,3500.0,-- instruct them is this is what the law of Colorado requires.
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3500.0,3501.48,"Thank you, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.16-111,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3502.16,3504.56,You must adhere to the law.
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3504.56,3506.8,That's precisely correct.
2017.16-111,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3506.8,3513.2,Nothing about I've changed my belief in any way.
2017.16-111,2,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,3513.2,3515.12,Absolutely not.
2017.16-111,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3522.6,3529.16,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cole."
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,3529.16,3539.6,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We don't doubt the sincerity of Mr. Phillips's convictions."
2017.16-111,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3601.24,3608.96,"I'm not sure he provides equal services outside the context of wedding to -- weddings, to gay and lesbian individuals."
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,3639.56,3671.8,"So -- so, Chief Justice Roberts, the Court in -- in Obergefell did, indeed, say that individuals are free to express their disagreement through speech with the notion of same-sex marriage, but it did not say that businesses who make a choice to open themselves to the public can then turn away people because they are gay and lesbian. All the baker needed to know about my clients was that they were gay and lesbian. And, therefore -- or gay."
2017.16-111,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3677.08,3711.2,"But is there an answer to that? I was trying to get the answer to that, and I -- I think that they're proceeding roughly on the line that, well, all that you say is true, but that doesn't mean that under these laws, maybe the African American, et cetera, is separate, but it doesn't mean that the person could be hired to come to the wedding and announce to the general people there, this is the most wonderful thing I've ever been at. Now, that's where they say they have a right not to do that."
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,3711.2,3712.28,And no one --
2017.16-111,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3712.28,3718.8,And then the second step of that is to say: And what's going on here is the equivalent of that.
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,3718.8,3719.08,Right.
2017.16-111,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3719.08,3727.52,I took that as -- I may be unfair to them -- but I -- I took that as -- as -- as the outlines of the answer to what you're saying.
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,3733.04,3734.4,"Yeah, thank you."
2017.16-111,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3764.4,3784.24,"But would that be true -- would that be true if what the message -- the message -- let's say Craig and Mullins said we'd like to have on this wedding cake of ours these words: ""God bless the union of Craig and Mullins."""
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,3784.24,3789.64,"So, if he would not put that message on any other cake, then he doesn't have to put it on that cake."
2017.16-111,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3789.64,3790.16,He would put --
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,3790.16,3791.88,If he --
2017.16-111,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3791.88,3798.12,-- that message on a cake that said: God bless the union of Ruth and Marty.
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,3798.12,3798.52,Right.
2017.16-111,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3817.68,3819.88,"Do we have to answer that question, Mr. Cole?"
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,3819.88,3830.2,"No, you don't, no, Justice Kagan, you don't, because in this case, again, the only thing the baker knew about these customers was that they were gay."
2017.16-111,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3846.52,3855.36,"Suppose that either in this case or some cases you have a very complex case -- cake, and -- case and cake -- (Laughter.)"
2017.16-111,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3855.36,3870.16,"That -- that -- and -- and -- and you need a baker, a baker's assistant to be right there at the wedding so you cut it in the right place and the thing doesn't collapse. Does the baker have to attend that wedding and -- and help cut the cake?"
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,3870.16,3872.24,"So, I think, again, that --"
2017.16-111,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3872.24,3873.36,"Assume the hypo, that the --"
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,3873.36,3894.2,"Right, right, that is -- that is not necessary to decide this case, but I think in -- I think in a future case that involved physical participation in a -- in a -- in a religious ceremony that an individual deeply opposed, that a court -- this Court might draw -- might create new doctrine and draw a new line and say, no, that's not governed by Smith."
2017.16-111,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3899.72,3908.16,"How do we do that? Because, you know, we can't have 42,000 cases, each kind of vegetable -- (Laughter.)"
2017.16-111,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3908.16,3926.44,"-- that the preparer thinks is something special. So -- so here, is it an answer that satisfies you to say, well, you see, here, of course, all custom goods, all custom goods have an element of expression."
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,3984.96,3985.88,"So, Justice Breyer --"
2017.16-111,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3985.88,3987.36,"And if that's not good, what is?"
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,3987.36,4010.72,"So, Justice Breyer, I think the -- the -- the colloquy with my opponent with respect to whether a cake artist is different from a makeup -- makeup artist, or whether a highly-sculpted cake is different from an unsculpted cake illustrates that it's just not possible to develop doctrine based on how expressive, how artistic the speech is. And that's --"
2017.16-111,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4010.72,4010.92,All right.
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4012.32,4013.44,"This is what you do, Your Honor."
2017.16-111,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4046.12,4050.64,Are the words on the cake expressive conduct or are they not speech?
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4050.64,4055.92,"The -- the conduct, Your Honor, that is regulated by Colorado here is not the words on the cake."
2017.16-111,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4070.08,4070.44,But you're --
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4070.44,4071.84,-- to somebody because of who they are.
2017.16-111,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4071.84,4072.2,"Yeah, but --"
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4072.2,4075.96,It doesn't matter whether it's speech or whether it's not speech.
2017.16-111,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4075.96,4088.76,"What you just said, and -- and -- and I understand Mr. Yarger -- Yarger's position for Colorado to be the same, is that someone can be compelled to write particular words with which that person strongly disagrees."
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4088.76,4089.12,If he --
2017.16-111,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4089.12,4091.08,"That's your -- that is your position, isn't it?"
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4091.08,4109.88,"If he has written the same words for others, and the only difference is the identity of the customer, yes, so, again, a baker could sincerely believe that saying happy birthday to a black family is different from saying happy birthday to a white family, but we would not say that, therefore, it's permissible for a baker to say: birthday cakes for whites only."
2017.16-111,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4109.88,4142.36,"There's a -- there are services, I was somewhat surprised to learn this, but weddings have become so elaborate, that will write custom wedding vows for you and custom wedding speeches. So somebody comes to one of these services and says: You know, we're not good with words, but we want you to write wedding -- a vow -- vows for our wedding, and the general idea we want to express is that we don't believe in God, we think that's a bunch of nonsense, but we're going to try to live our lives to make the world a better place."
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4156.72,4167.56,"What I would say, Your Honor, is that if that case were to arise, it would certainly be open to this Court to treat it differently, but this is not a case in which anyone is being asked to --"

2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4170.6,4171.76,I think it would -- it would -- it would have --
2017.16-111,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4171.76,4174.24,On what -- what principle do we use to treat it differently?
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4174.24,4196.2,"I think the principle would have to be some amendment to Smith versus Employment Division to say that even where there's a generally applicable law, and even where it's neutrally applied, if it has the effect of compelling somebody to engage in a religious ceremony that is against their deep religious commitment, we might treat that differently, but under current law --"
2017.16-111,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4196.2,4197.76,Is that a modification of --
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4197.76,4200.56,-- that would not be the result under Smith versus Employment Division.

2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4205.44,4217.84,"Well, I think it would depend on how broadly you wrote it, certainly. But -- but I don't think in this case, where all that's asked for is a product, that you have to reach that question. And the other thing I would say, Justice Alito --"

2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4227.48,4227.64,Yeah.

2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4233.2,4233.36,No.
2017.16-111,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4233.36,4234.48,Why?
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4234.48,4236.24,And I'm not -- let me say -- let me make it clear.
2017.16-111,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4237.08,4237.96,You're not advocating this?
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4237.96,4244.96,"-- this exception at all. I am just saying that this case does not involve that kind of participation, and so you don't need to address it."
2017.16-111,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4247.12,4254.08,"Well, let's take -- let's take a case a little bit more like ours, and -- and it doesn't involve words, but just a cake."
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4272.56,4275.16,It's not identity-based discrimination.
2017.16-111,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4290.84,4301.76,"Well, why is that any different than our case? You say it's not based on identity, but the baker might well say I -- I -- I despise people who adhere to the creed --"
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4301.76,4302.04,Right.
2017.16-111,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4302.04,4305.0,-- of the KKK. That's one way of characterizing it.
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4327.36,4337.2,"So I -- I think -- I think, Your Honor, if -- if identity discrimination is involved -- and there's no question that identity discrimination is involved here because, again, the only thing the baker knew was the identity of the people who were --"

2017.16-111,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4338.2,4338.48,That -- that's --
2017.16-111,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4338.48,4342.12,-- I misunderstood your answer to Justice Gorsuch.
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4349.92,4354.08,If -- if he is not doing it on the basis of the identity -- a protected identity.
2017.16-111,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4367.4,4375.36,"Well, but this whole concept of identity is a slightly -- suppose he says: Look, I have nothing against -- against gay people."
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4380.88,4381.2,Yeah.
2017.16-111,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4381.2,4383.56,It's not their identity; it's what they're doing.
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4383.56,4384.16,Yeah.
2017.16-111,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4384.16,4385.12,I think it's --
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4385.12,4385.6,Well --
2017.16-111,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4385.6,4387.64,-- your identity thing is just too facile.
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4387.64,4392.32,"Well, Justice Kennedy, this Court faced that question in Bob Jones University."
2017.16-111,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4453.72,4465.52,"I take Justice Gorsuch's question and substitute for the KKK, a religious group, bizarre perhaps, but a religious group that unfortunately has the same beliefs as the KKK."
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4468.28,4468.44,Yeah.
2017.16-111,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4468.44,4470.4,"-- and the answer is they do have to sell it to them, right?"
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4470.4,4485.04,"I think if the discrimination is based on a -- a protected characteristic, yes, they -- they can't say because I object to the message that equal treatment sends, right? Piggie Park objected to the message that equal treatment sent."
2017.16-111,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4557.72,4565.28,Is your -- is your answer to my hypothetical about the religious legal services organization the same as Mr. Yarger's?
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4565.28,4581.72,"I think -- I -- I -- I think if -- if Christian Legal Services -- Catholic Legal Services, sorry, Your Honor, has offered a service to the public generally, let's say it was wills, and -- and a same-sex -- someone who died, the -- the survivor of a same-sex couple --"
2017.16-111,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4581.72,4585.32,"No, I just -- you're -- you're changing the hypothetical just -- just a little --"
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4585.32,4586.44,"Well, I think it's the same."

2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4591.72,4592.2,Yeah.
2017.16-111,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4592.2,4595.92,-- contracts or landlord/tenant or anything at all.
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4595.92,4596.24,Right.
2017.16-111,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4611.92,4628.36,"So they would -- if someone had a problem in connection with their marriage, again, whatever it is, contract dispute, something like that, they would have to provide representative services to someone who had a similar problem in connection with a same-sex marriage?"
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4628.36,4629.64,"So I'd say two things, Your Honor."
2017.16-111,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4649.92,4652.88,But this is not only speech; it's providing the legal services.
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4652.88,4658.16,"Well, but the -- the legal services are speech, Your Honor, I don't know what other than speech I'm engaged in, for example, right now."
2017.16-111,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4658.16,4660.36,"Well, I would say partly expressive conduct."
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4666.92,4723.04,"Well, you know, if -- if you -- if you treat -- if you treat -- Hurley, I think, illustrates that where the state is regulating only expression, no conduct at all, just a banner that's in the parade, the Court takes a different view, but where expressive conduct is involved -- and the reason the Court takes a different view makes sense because, again, the -- the analysis this Court uses with respect -- with respect to expressive conduct is, is the state regulating the conduct for some reason other than what it expresses or is it regulating what it expresses? And -- and when you only have expression, when all that's involved is expression, as was the case with the parade in Hurley, that's different because there's no -- there's no neutral conduct to be regulated. But here what we have is the sale of a good, a cake, to a -- to an individual."
2017.16-111,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4744.52,4744.68,Along the --
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4744.68,4745.96,-- and that no one has this --
2017.16-111,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4745.96,4770.4,"Along the same lines as the Chief Justice's question, would you say that Colorado can compel a religious college that -- whose creed opposes same-sex marriage to provide married student housing for a married same-sex couple or allow a same-sex wedding to be performed in the college chapel?"
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4770.4,4772.24,So I think that --
2017.16-111,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4772.24,4774.24,That's not pure -- those are not pure speech --
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4774.24,4786.36,"I think, again, there might, under -- under something like Hosanna-Tabor, there might be religious-based exceptions for core religious institutions, but a bakery that opens itself to the public is not a church, is not -- you know, it's --"
2017.16-111,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4786.36,4787.84,"Well, this is not a church."
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4795.64,4798.48,"So, I think -- I think --"
2017.16-111,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4798.48,4799.8,So your answer is they would be --
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4799.8,4799.84,I --
2017.16-111,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4799.84,4801.56,-- they would be required to do it?
2017.16-111,3,20648,david_d_cole,,4801.56,4816.2,"Well, I think under this Court's doctrine in Employment Division versus Smith, the question would be, is it a generally applicable neutral law? And if it's a generally applicable neutral law, there would not be a free exercise question at all."

And Mr. Phillips is also the speaker. So they're both speaking when they're creating --"
2017.16-111,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4985.0,4996.64,"But who makes a decision for the corporation? In -- in most situations -- it may be easier in a closely-held corporation, it may be the shareholders."
2017.16-111,4,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,5003.84,5009.56,"Well, certainly I think it -- again, if it's dealing with an employee, the employee certainly decides what -- what they're willing to express, and --"

2017.16-111,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5011.16,5012.52,-- speaking for the corporation.
2017.16-111,4,62928,kristen_kellie_waggoner,,5020.24,5021.04,Certainly.

I have three brief points in rebuttal: First of all, the bias of the Commission is also evidenced in the unequal treatment of the cake designers, the three other cake designers who were on the squarely opposite sides of this issue. If -- if the Court looks at the analysis that was provided by the Colorado Court of Appeals, line by line they take the opposite approach to Mr. Phillips that they do to those who are unwilling to criticize same-sex marriage --"

2017.16-111,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5151.68,5193.0,"Counsel, the problem is that America's reaction to mixed marriages and to race didn't change on its own. It changed because we had public accommodation laws that forced people to do things that many claimed were against their expressive rights and against their religious rights. It's not denigrating someone by saying, as I mentioned earlier, to say: If you choose to participate in our community in a public way, your choice, you can choose to sell cakes or not."
