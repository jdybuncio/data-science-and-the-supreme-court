2016.15-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.805,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 15-497, Fry v. Napoleon Community Schools. Mr. Bagenstos."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,8.805,42.03,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress adopted the Handicapped Children's Protection Act to make clear that the IDEA is not the exclusive vehicle for protecting the rights of children with disabilities, and Congress also sought to make clear that cases brought under other Federal statutes, like the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, may proceed directly to court so long as they are not actually seeking relief that is also available under the IDEA. Under that statutory text, it is irrelevant whether the plaintiff could have sought some other form of relief that would have been available under the IDEA."
2016.15-497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,42.03,51.115,Suppose -- suppose that there is a school district and two surrounding school districts within the same Federal court jurisdiction and same circuit.
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,69.02,72.88,"Well, I think the question would be: What is the relief that the plaintiff is seeking in that third lawsuit?"
2016.15-497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,72.88,74.955,So it just depends on what the complaint says?
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,74.955,79.32,"I think it depends on the relief the Plaintiff is seeking, because that's what the statutory language says."
2016.15-497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,79.92,95.665,But then you're saying that the artful form of the complaint suffices to subject the district court to damages that it might not -- the school district to damages that it might not otherwise have had to pay.
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,95.665,97.34,"Well, a couple of points about that."
2016.15-497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,132.32,139.69,"But you could -- you could have -- you could have, as Justice Kennedy suggested, gone the IDEA route."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,161.255,173.62,"Well, under Respondent's position here, I think we would have -- and under the Sixth Circuit's position certainly, we would have to follow all of the IDEA procedures through to their conclusion before filing a lawsuit under the ADA."
2016.15-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,205.55,207.92,I -- I understand you'd be making two arguments.
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,214.55,214.72,Yes.
2016.15-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,214.72,223.14,"And the second one is, you don't have to exhaust because you're not complaining about the fair and appropriate public education provision."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,228.68,228.83,No.
2016.15-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,242.47,257.77,"So if that's the case, why -- I would suspect that the denial of what is sought under the IDEA for a fair and appropriate public education is something that could well cause emotional distress in -- in most cases."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,280.595,291.23,"I don't think that that's right, Your Honor, because -- because it's not the case that every time there is a denial of a free appropriate public education under the IDEA there is also going to be a violation of the ADA."
2016.15-497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,293.15,294.13,"That's true, but --"
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,294.13,294.4,Yes.
2016.15-497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,294.4,369.735,"-- you could find -- I mean, in -- I have exactly the same question, in a very large number of suits, you know, in a very large number of suits brought -- or controversies -- where a child is seeking a special plan, there is a statute that gives him that right, and it rests -- rests heavily on his getting together or his parents getting together with the school board and trying to work something out that makes sense. Now, it seems to me, as the Chief Justice just said, that if we accept your first argument, not in all cases, but in many cases, where their lawyer wishes to avoid this exhaustion requirement, all he would have to do is wait and then sue, not for putting the child in a private school but rather for emotional suffering. Now, if that argument -- if what I have just said is right, which I think is what was just said by the Chief Justice, that would seem to gut the carefully written procedural system that the IDEA sets up."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,378.28,414.205,"Well, so -- so I think this goes not just to what the word ""relief"" actually says. I think, you know, this is a highly carefully crafted procedural regime as Your Honor says, Justice Breyer. But part of the careful crafting of the regime is the Handicapped Children's Protection Act which, remember, overruled a decision of this Court or overturned a decision of this Court that had sought to channel all disability education claims into IDEA proceedings. What Congress said in the HCPA was there are other statutes that may provide independent remedies under -- at that point it was the Rehabilitation Act Section 1983."
2016.15-497,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,425.81,434.205,"The answer to me, and I think to the Chief, so far is, so what? Because that's what Congress wanted."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,436.265,438.81,"Well, so I -- I mean, I think there are a couple of answers other than that."
2016.15-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,485.08,500.56,"I guess that's why -- but even if what you say is right, and it makes a lot of sense, a lawyer advising a client might advise that, look, this is what you want the school to do so that you can have a free and appropriate education for your child."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,518.02,518.16,I do.
2016.15-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,518.16,528.93,"As a practical matter, it would be -- could well be in the child's and parents' interest to proceed along two tracks because it makes it much more likely, even if what all they really want, they don't care about the money."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,531.61,536.915,But I think the point about that -- I think that is right about a lot of practical issues here.
2016.15-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,555.33,556.95,"Later on, once we are done with this."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,556.95,558.1,Once we are done with this. And --
2016.15-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,558.1,564.51,"I think one of the important things in this type of proceeding is timing, right? I mean, we are talking about a school year, and all this takes time."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,582.31,585.75,"Well, Your Honor, I think there are obviously a lot of variables."
2016.15-497,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,617.48,621.91,But your whole point again is it depends on what's in the complaint.
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,639.31,641.79,"So -- so I'd say a couple of things about that, Your Honor."
2016.15-497,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,661.06,662.52,"Could -- could I ask about that, Mr. Bagenstos?"
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,662.52,662.72,Yes.
2016.15-497,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,662.72,684.33,"And this takes you back to the first part of the Chief Justice's question, just so I can understand the argument, is you're really making two arguments. One argument is initially when we filed the complaint and ever since, we've really only sought emotional distress damages, and emotional distress damages are something that can't be given under the."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,684.33,684.6,Yes.
2016.15-497,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,684.6,700.915,"And that's one argument. But there is a second argument which says, you know, putting that aside, the reason why we don't need to exhaust is because we are not alleging that we've been denied a fair and appropriate public education."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,724.26,724.46,Yes.
2016.15-497,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,725.7,730.17,"Now, this -- this case is actually the combination of the two, is what you're saying."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,754.18,755.65,"I agree with that, Justice Kagan."
2016.15-497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,767.25,779.275,"And what -- Mr. Bagenstos, could you clarify what you are giving up by taking this route, by suing under the ADA and not under the IDEA?"
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,779.275,785.91,So -- so what -- what we are giving up and what parents are giving up generally by pursuing this route is anything you can get under the IDEA.
2016.15-497,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,796.31,797.275,But you might be.
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,825.74,825.98,Right.
2016.15-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,831.95,840.27,"But if we did, I mean, it seems to me that that might address many of the concerns that have been raised about the impact of the two-track proceeding."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,855.56,856.25,Right.
2016.15-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,856.25,861.17,-- but yet you want to make a more aggressive argument that you only need one.
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,861.17,861.53,Right.
2016.15-497,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,868.74,875.95,"And I suppose one understanding of this is we don't have to really deal with what happens if you only have one, because you're saying you have both."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,876.64,880.35,That is entirely right. So -- so let's be clear about the second point here.
2016.15-497,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,923.03,932.945,"And that claim could be made by someone who doesn't qualify, who is disabled but doesn't qualify for ADA because she doesn't have any learning disability."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,932.945,933.66,Absolutely.
2016.15-497,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,944.71,954.77,What would happen if the claim was that the child suffered emotional damages because of the denial of educational benefits?
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,954.77,963.91,"So -- so I think that would be a harder case because that would present only the first -- the first of our two theories, that would be we would be seeking damages that are not available under the IDEA."
2016.15-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,978.55,979.505,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.15-497,0,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,979.505,988.67,Thank you.
2016.15-497,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,988.67,992.705,Mr. Martinez.
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,992.705,1010.125,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The parties, both parties, and the government now all agree that the rule under which the Sixth Circuit decided this case is wrong, and that exhaustion is required only if the relief that the plaintiff actually seeks in the case is available under the IDEA."
2016.15-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1026.855,1039.12,"Mr. Martinez, that begs the last question that was asked, which is the Payne -- you know the Ninth Circuit Payne decision."
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1039.12,1039.52,Sure.
2016.15-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1039.52,1042.85,It doesn't do just that. It doesn't just look just at the relief.
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1070.87,1075.47,"Justice Sotomayor, I just want to be clear, I -- we understand the Ninth Circuit's approach."
2016.15-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1085.085,1085.5,No.
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1098.2,1099.75,Are you talking about the third prong in --
2016.15-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1099.75,1100.74,"Yes, exactly."
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1100.74,1102.99,"We do disagree with that third prong, Your Honor."
2016.15-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1116.2,1120.295,"So let's go to the last argument -- the last question directly, then."
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1129.93,1130.515,Yes.
2016.15-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1130.515,1134.54,The -- and it seeks injunctive relief for the future --
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1134.54,1134.63,Yes.
2016.15-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1134.63,1135.72,-- not to be hurt.
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1135.72,1136.18,Yes.
2016.15-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1136.18,1136.33,All right.
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1136.33,1137.15,You have exhausted --
2016.15-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1137.15,1142.44,"With no change of FAPE -- when -- no other thing is said? It's just, I want compensatory damages?"
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1142.44,1142.83,Yes.
2016.15-497,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1146.83,1152.71,How about no injunctive relief? Past and future damages for emotional distress?
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1152.71,1165.79,I -- I think if there's -- if the only relief sought in the complaint -- and that's what the statute says you look for is money damages -- we think that the text of the statute says that you have to figure out whether that relief sought is available under the IDEA.
2016.15-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1172.315,1187.105,"That's -- if it's that simple, if it's that simple, why are we in this argument? You apply ordinary exhaustion principles. Under ordinary exhaustion principles, you never have to exhaust and exhaustion would be futile."
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1200.955,1202.48,"I -- I agree with that, Justice Breyer."
2016.15-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1207.19,1210.095,"So could I say that? Could I say, very well."
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1220.975,1221.62,You can --
2016.15-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1221.62,1226.19,"Judge, you go back and apply that to this case, end of case."
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1231.365,1232.98,I think you could adopt the rule.
2016.15-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1236.52,1238.6,"Well, I haven't memorized that."
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1239.89,1240.12,Yes.
2016.15-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1240.12,1245.81,"-- what I am saying? If I go to Pierce on administrative law, I look up Davis, I will find some words --"
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1245.81,1246.02,What --
2016.15-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1246.02,1246.87,-- and those are the words?
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1246.87,1258.47,The words I would suggest are the words that -- that you use are as follows: That if the hearing officer lacks authority to grant the relief sought -- those are the words of the House report -- then exhaustion is not required.
2016.15-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1258.97,1261.11,I just want to make sure of the government's position.
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1275.93,1296.28,"In some circumstances, a FAPE can accommodate that, but we don't think that that's the relevant question for purposes of applying the statute, because the statute turns -- says that the exhaustion question turns on whether the relief that the plaintiff is actually seeking -- those are the terms that the statute uses -- the relief that the civil action is seeking is available under the IDEA."
2016.15-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1296.4,1298.85,"Well, but it talks about before filing the complaint."
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1298.85,1300.75,It says before filing the complaint after the loss --
2016.15-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1300.75,1307.605,Suppose it was -- suppose it was very clear that most FAPE plans cover precisely this kind of problem.
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1309.985,1326.26,I think that if -- if -- the facts of whether a FAPE would -- would allow for the school to take account of the service dog really isn't the question because the question under the statute turns on what the -- what the person is asking for; what the relief that he seeks.
2016.15-497,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1332.065,1334.975,All you're talking about -- all you're talking about is artful pleading then.
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1334.975,1352.99,"No, not at all, Your Honor. And I want to address your question and the -- and the concerns that came up, the practical concerns about the parents who actually do want -- what they really want is a change to the IEP. If the parent files the lawsuit, the ADA lawsuit, and says I want an injunction that's going to require the service dog, that is the kind of relief that would have to be exhausted."
2016.15-497,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1353.29,1362.375,So would he have to get a service dog if in fact it's going to cost him $5 million in damages? And they are talking about before filing the complaint.
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1398.515,1401.63,"No, I don't think that's right, Your Honor, because I think it's a practical matter."
2016.15-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1421.48,1421.97,No.
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1431.64,1431.98,Right.
2016.15-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1431.98,1433.4,That's a lot more leverage.
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1433.4,1445.5,"Well, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I think what I would do in that circumstance is pursue the IDEA process and say up front, you know, if I lose in this IDEA process, I'm going to bring the ADA claim with all the damages involved."
2016.15-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1457.26,1462.04,"Well, I don't -- I don't think that's what you would do, but I guess you're the better judge of that than I am. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1462.04,1475.49,"Where -- what is your position on the question I asked earlier about the two-track proceeding? Is it enough that they're seeking damages, or -- and is it enough that the --"
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1475.49,1476.35,We think --
2016.15-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1476.35,1481.145,"-- they're fine with the FAPE or the IEP, or does it have to be both?"
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1481.145,1481.62,No.
2016.15-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1524.105,1528.575,So is the parties' concession sufficient to answer that question?
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1528.575,1531.965,I think the parties' concession is sufficient to answer that question.
2016.15-497,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1531.965,1551.97,"What if you had a complaint where the parties did concede that IDEA was not violated, that a FAPE had been provided, but as you looked in the allegations in the complaint, it really seems that there is grounds to think that a FAPE was not provided and that the IDEA was violated? What do you do with a complaint that looks like that?"
2016.15-497,1,56052,roman_martinez,,1551.97,1555.68,"I think if the parties agree that the FAPE was provided, that should be enough."
2016.15-497,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1603.105,1612.73,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1612.73,1624.92,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The complaint that was actually filed in this case, in response to Justice Kagan, illustrates the point -- the type of dispute Congress chose to channel through local education experts."
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1646.43,1648.26,Can you tell us what page that's on?
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1648.26,1650.49,That's page 21 of the -- of the orange brief in opposition.
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1650.49,1651.125,"No, I know."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1652.195,1654.07,"Yeah, the orange one."
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1654.26,1657.895,What -- what allegation says they want reimbursement --
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1657.895,1658.36,So --
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1658.36,1661.04,"-- for her schooling, et cetera?"
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1661.04,1665.29,"So first they want a declaration, okay, and that's -- that's number B."
2016.15-497,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1665.81,1669.1,But the declaration was that the ADA had been violated.
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1669.1,1669.71,Correct.
2016.15-497,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1677.35,1686.29,"Well, it's not available; you don't get a declaration that the ADA has been violated or the Rehabilitation Act has been violated from IDEA officer."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1686.29,1697.6,"Absolutely, Justice Kagan. That's -- you know, we couldn't read the statute to -- the second half of Section 1415, the exhaustion requirement, to say you've got to show a -- you know, that the IDEA gives that form of relief."
2016.15-497,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1738.13,1757.59,"Mr. Katyal, any relief? I mean, that -- the -- again, your furthest argument is that if any relief is available under the IDEA, you must pursue that route first."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1770.675,1775.31,"We'd certainly caution the Court about failed legislation, trying to read too much into that."
2016.15-497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1792.09,1795.745,That's boilerplate. That may or may not be significant.
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1809.31,1820.11,"We don't concede everything, but we do think that they can -- that they get a part. And our red brief at pages 44 to 50 explains here the only thing the complaint seeks is the word ""damages."" That's at the brief in appendix at page 21."
2016.15-497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1829.76,1829.99,Right.
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1829.99,1832.79,"-- things like compensatory education, things like home schooling."
2016.15-497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1832.79,1841.87,"They're asking -- they're asking for other things; right? I know basically -- all right. So are you saying they'll get some of the damages they're seeking, but not all of them?"
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1841.87,1842.43,Correct.
2016.15-497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1842.72,1852.41,"Well, then under Jones case, isn't the rule, well, then, you know, they get to proceed with the things that they're not going to be able to get under the IDEA?"
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1852.41,1860.7,"Absolutely not, Your Honor, for a few reasons. First, the Jones case itself is -- your -- your opinion is about letting good claims go forward versus bad claims."
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1907.16,1968.585,"When I look at the claimed harms, which the only allegations besides the prayer for relief at the end is in response -- Respondent's Appellate 11, 51A through F, every one of those harms alleged is a component of emotional harm. Nowhere are they saying she was harmed by having to pay for -- to pay for a tutoring program, or harmed by her mother losing her job, which is what your brief was talking about. Here, all of the harms alleged are essentially compensatory emotional harms: A, the denial of equal access; B, the denial of the use of Wonder; C, interference to form bonds with other kids; D, denial of an opportunity to interact with other children."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1985.935,1986.55,So --
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1986.55,1995.22,So how does the IDEA provide compensatory damages for these injuries?
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1995.22,1998.01,Our brief goes into this in detail at those pages.
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1998.01,2000.47,"I know, but I was trying to look for it in the complaint, and I couldn't."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2000.47,2004.23,"Well, I do think that the only place in which emotional is isolated is F."
2016.15-497,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2017.05,2054.985,"Well, Mr. Katyal, think of it this way: Suppose this girl wanted to go into a public library a couple of times a week and the library said, you can't take your dog here; we're going to just provide you with a librarian who will help you do all the things that your dog otherwise helps you with, and the girl brings a suit. Isn't that suit exactly the suit that she brought, except that instead of a library, it's a school? But that's her -- that's her claim and those are her damages, that she was deprived of access to a public facility in a way that caused her distress and emotional harm."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2054.985,2058.05,"Justice Kagan, that may work in that case, as opposed to this one."
2016.15-497,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2067.53,2069.64,But this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's point.
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2104.49,2107.7,That's exactly right in terms of explaining the first half of 1415.
2016.15-497,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2164.4,2165.01,I see that.
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2278.53,2287.38,"So three points. First, in response to the first half about -- about whether or not this would gut the exhaustion provision, we absolutely agree."
2016.15-497,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2304.31,2312.945,"I thought he simply said that if you're going the IDEA route, you must pursue it to the end."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2331.49,2347.68,"As I understood his answer, Justice Ginsburg, to the question is that, yes, a lawyer could walk in on day one and sue for money damages, and then -- and then extort or possibly leverage that into a better situation in terms of money."
2016.15-497,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2375.7,2383.605,"But what does that say other than it's a recitation of fact? There was an IEP, and it didn't include the dog."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2383.605,2398.605,"And what that means is, if the Federal district court said, here are money damages, because you denied the dog, implicit in that -- and this is the government's brief in Payne as well as this Court's own decision in Fair v. McNary, which I'll explain in a moment."
2016.15-497,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2404.91,2409.165,But the Plaintiffs here are not suggesting that the IEP was deficient.
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2435.45,2437.91,"Justice Kagan, I think that's wrong on the facts on the law."
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2447.39,2459.175,"Mr. Katyal, you're -- you're supposed to look at a complaint as a whole, okay, at the moment it's filed. What's clear in this complaint, because the allegations say it, this is what happened."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2476.985,2477.33,Correct.
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2477.33,2479.955,They then talk about all the emotional distress.
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2521.745,2524.59,"So, Justice Sotomayor, two answers, and we agree with you, absolutely."
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2545.34,2580.85,"We are now getting -- we are now going past where I am, okay, or you're going behind what I'm saying but not getting to the point, Mr. Katyal. Maybe, before she changed schools, she might have been entitled to something related to her IDEA, but at the moment this complaint was filed, on its own face, where is it asking for any change, potentially or otherwise, to the IDEA that is no longer in effect?"
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2580.85,2639.06,"And that is my second answer to you. So the second answer is the complaint asks for a declaratory judgment, and that's what we were talking about at the beginning, to ask for declaratory judgment under this Court's decision in Golden v. Zwickler and City of Lyons, the only way they can invoke Article III jurisdiction is by saying there is a reasonable prospect that the situation would occur. There is not a word in the complaint that says she won't return to the school, and indeed, the Sixth Circuit grapples with this all the time, when children leave the school and file these lawsuits. There is a case called Woods, which is at 487 Federal Appendix 979, and what that case says is, even if you leave the school, the school has an ongoing obligation to keep an IEP current in case the person comes back to the school. If you adopted, if the Federal district court granted their declaratory judgment, the only way they can do so, and the only way they can invoke Article III processes is by saying, look, there is a chance E.F. might come back. And that happens all the time."
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2654.76,2661.2,"Would you fit into the Payne three criteria, the Ninth Circuit's three criteria?"
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2661.2,2662.97,That -- that --
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2662.97,2667.09,The Ninth Circuit uses to evaluate --
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2667.09,2667.41,Yes.
2016.15-497,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2692.36,2699.12,"How much relief -- going back to what you said before, I think you told me you're not pressing any relief."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2700.565,2725.99,"Well, I -- I do think that if the complaint seeks relief that is available under the IDEA, then at least that claim can't go forward, going back to the Jones v. Bock thing. So, if, for example, Justice Ginsburg, you had a claim like the dog one here and then you had a separate claim that said something like the child was being abused in the bathroom or something like that, something that didn't implicate a FAPE or an IDEA, certainly I think that claim could go forward."
2016.15-497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2756.95,2767.845,"The cooperative process -- the cooperative process you're talking about, given their position that they are not asking for any relief under the FAPE, would be kind of a charade."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2774.5,2782.58,"We certainly agree that if it triggers that kind of futility exception, if they literally can't get the relief for one reason or another, absolutely, they don't have to go through it --"
2016.15-497,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2782.58,2785.27,Here -- here this might also be peripheral.
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2826.81,2831.335,So this is going back to something I was trying to get to earlier about your second half of your question.
2016.15-497,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2852.85,2854.225,"I don't understand that, Mr. Katyal."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2902.79,2912.36,"Because -- because, Justice Kagan, as that page, page 37, explains, a lot of lower courts have said that when you have a discrete instance of abuse, that doesn't violate the IDEA --"
2016.15-497,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2912.36,2913.75,I don't -- discrete instance.
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2916.18,2924.8,"If it's a continuing stream of abuse, something that does implicate IDEA processes and deny FAPE, absolutely it would require exhaustion in that circumstance."
2016.15-497,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2924.8,2929.585,The IDEA doesn't care about particular instances but cares about --
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2929.585,2937.09,"There are some things, Justice Kagan, that are dealt with through the IDEA process. Typically those are things that would occur as opposed to one-offs, yes."
2016.15-497,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2947.79,2956.69,"But, Mr. Katyal, are you suggesting that there is no such thing as continuing discrimination that happens in a school setting that actually does not have anything to do with the IEP?"
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2956.69,2962.64,"To an extent -- to the extent that something like that exists, we're not -- our position does not require exhaustion there."
2016.15-497,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2972.92,2977.52,"But as I understand it from one of Amicus briefs, just to sort of put a fine point on this."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2994.115,2999.57,"Well, I'd caution the Court into saying the IEP is the only thing that's necessary. But the IEP is a good template."
2016.15-497,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3015.87,3017.835,I'm not sure I understood the answer to the question.
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3023.94,3027.85,"Well -- well, Justice Kagan, you talked about a million different possible situations --"
2016.15-497,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3027.85,3029.04,"700,000, if I can read what the --"
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3029.04,3029.1,"Or 700,000."
2016.15-497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3076.98,3077.73,"No, no, no."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3098.13,3101.69,"So certainly if it's futile, if they say, look, we lack the authority to --"
2016.15-497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3101.69,3104.38,"No, no, they say, you know, we could press ahead with this."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3110.52,3124.44,"Yeah, and the choice Congress made in 1415, and going back to an earlier question, I know it seems a little bit unusual to say -- and strange to say, why are you forcing plaintiff -- parents into a -- into a scheme that they don't want, but that's the scheme Congress laid out."
2016.15-497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3127.76,3129.88,"Well, it can't -- just not a scheme they don't want."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3146.05,3146.96,"And, Mr. Chief Justice --"
2016.15-497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3146.96,3151.8,"And when you do, you'll agree that that's an awkward position for them to go to the meeting and say, we don't want anything."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3151.8,3160.105,"It's -- it's really awkward, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think what Congress said there is it's not up to the individual parents subjectively to say, hey, I don't want any part of this process."
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3170.15,3193.945,"Mr. Katyal, my problem is, what were they -- is the only argument that you're making is that they are not entitled to their declaratory judgment because they didn't exhaust that? Are they entitled, whether they exhaust it or not, to the ADA claims for monetary compensatory damages for pain and suffering?"
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3193.945,3196.155,"Justice Sotomayor, they may be at the end."
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3198.67,3200.59,"Well, it's now -- it's now too late to exhaust, right?"
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3200.59,3201.32,"No, not at all."
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3202.94,3206.49,How about if they just waive all of that and say I want my money?
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3206.49,3215.115,"You know, so, again, I think that it can't be for the reasons that the Chief Justice and Justice Breyer said that just plaintiffs can kind of waive things around."
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3219.7,3223.205,I am -- I am so confused by your position.
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3237.445,3240.15,"Justice Sotomayor, that is their position in the reply brief."
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3262.135,3263.805,The school already admitted that.
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3276.345,3276.89,Notably --
2016.15-497,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3276.89,3278.12,They have already said that.
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3278.12,3311.225,"Notably, Petitioners never make that argument, and it's certainty not in the complaint. And the reason for that -- what is in the complaint is that they felt that the dog wouldn't be able to be welcomed back. And so the idea that they could allow money damages for this type of situation without first exhausting the state processes is an end-run around the expert agency statute that Congress set up, which they wanted to give states and localities the first crack at resolving this instead of allowing parents to abandon the IDEA system and march into Federal court, which is exactly what happened here."
2016.15-497,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3317.51,3319.03,It's not necessarily awkward.
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3383.01,3385.4,"Justice Breyer, we agree with the futility exception."
2016.15-497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3410.73,3414.63,105 days is a big part of the school year.
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3414.63,3416.17,Correct.
2016.15-497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3416.17,3421.735,"I mean, so I think saying, all they have to do is go through a 105-day process is not particularly responsive."
2016.15-497,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3421.735,3423.79,"We don't mean to minimize that, Your Honor."
2016.15-497,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3436.62,3439.855,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bagenstos, four minutes."
2016.15-497,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3439.855,3445.33,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. So let's first be clear about what the statute says."
2016.15-497,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3494.1,3496.02,How about yours is an ideal situation.
2016.15-497,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3514.585,3515.25,Right.
2016.15-497,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3515.25,3523.91,"And you didn't say, as you conceded now, that you don't want the -- the FAPE changed."
2016.15-497,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3537.04,3537.73,Sure.
2016.15-497,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3537.73,3539.03,What happens?
2016.15-497,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3539.03,3539.24,Okay.
2016.15-497,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3548.43,3549.96,I -- I just gave you a different hypothetical.
2016.15-497,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3549.96,3550.59,"Yes, I understand."
2016.15-497,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3614.96,3621.85,Does the Court have the power to stay that until the IDEA claim is exhausted?
2016.15-497,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3621.85,3622.85,"Well, so -- so I --"
2016.15-497,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3622.85,3625.12,The government appears to suggest that in their brief.
2016.15-497,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3625.12,3651.74,"So I think, you know, in some circumstances, the Court actually addressed something similar to this in the Rhines case, which is cited in Jones about habeas where a total exhaustion rule applies. And even Rhines said that staying is something that shouldn't be done as a matter of routine; it might be something done occasionally as a matter of discretion, but that the ordinary process should be even where total exhaustion applies to allow the plaintiffs to decide do we want to proceed with these unexhausted requests or not, which is what we would ask for. After all, a stay in this case would be meaningless."
2016.15-497,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3656.53,3658.81,I really -- I appreciate --
2016.15-497,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3658.81,3659.025,Yeah.
2016.15-497,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3659.025,3660.49,-- the nature of your case.
2016.15-497,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3660.49,3661.02,Got you.
2016.15-497,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3661.02,3665.43,All right? But your suggestion is likely to raise --
2016.15-497,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3665.43,3665.56,Right.
2016.15-497,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3665.56,3672.26,"-- a lot of hesitation in this Court, amongst some, maybe even me."
2016.15-497,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3672.26,3673.83,I'm getting that.
2016.15-497,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3673.83,3679.76,Because if what you're saying is we're going to be on a dual track in every case --
2016.15-497,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3679.76,3684.985,-- it's not going to be very attractive to the Court.
2016.15-497,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3684.985,3686.12,"May I briefly answer, Your Honor?"
2016.15-497,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3686.12,3686.55,Briefly.
2016.15-497,3,41035,samuel_r_bagenstos,,3686.55,3692.8,"So -- so I -- our position is you're going to be on one track, which is the things that aren't barred by the exhaustion requirement proceed."
2016.15-497,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3695.735,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
