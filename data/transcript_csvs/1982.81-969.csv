1982.81-969,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.107,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Washington against the United States.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,10.809,14.058,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,154.047,162.653,"I take it when you... the contractor adds that to his price to the owner, is that it?"
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,162.653,165.278,That is correct.
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,165.278,171.759,"Well, but then he hasn't paid his sales tax on his bricks, I take it; is that it?"
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,171.759,178.273,"If we're talking about a nonfederal contractor, Your Honor, that sales tax is added to the price that's finally presented."
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,178.273,182.662,But the contractor hasn't paid a tax when he buys his bricks?
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,182.662,190.016,The private contractor does not buy... does not pay the materials sales tax when he buys his bricks.
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,190.016,190.423,Exactly.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,196.14,198.592,"The federal contractor does, Your Honor."
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,198.592,202.09,"I know, but the private contractor does not."
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,202.09,203.34,All right.
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,217.726,221.505,But there isn't when they sell to a private contractor.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,221.505,223.067,"--That's correct, Your Honor, absolutely."
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,223.067,224.705,He is not paying that tax.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,237.669,241.996,It is the same 5.4 percent at the time--
1982.81-969,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.996,243.839,On the entire construction cost?
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,243.839,245.167,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1982.81-969,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,245.167,251.85,So if the State itself were building it is treated like a private citizen would be--
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,251.85,252.897,"That is true, Your Honor."
1982.81-969,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,252.897,253.865,--in a building project.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,265.127,270.577,"That's true, Your Honor, including overhead, profit, materials, and everything that went into it."
1982.81-969,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,270.577,274.014,"General, have you finished?"
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,274.014,274.764,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-969,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,274.764,283.354,I take it you concede that the '75 amendment was to catch federal construction?
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,283.354,295.552,"There's no question but what this statute was designed to apply the sales tax to these transactions, which were significant in our State and we believe deserve to help bear the brunt of cost of services delivered by State government."
1982.81-969,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,295.552,303.736,"In a sense, the State of Washington is a victim of its own legislative move back in 1941, isn't it?"
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,303.736,319.745,"I would resist categorizing it as a victim, Your Honor, because, like most states, these taxing schemes evolve over a period of time and as circumstances change and one type of activity increases it becomes more apparent--"
1982.81-969,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,319.745,324.26,But you're a victim only in the sense you have this litigation on your hands--
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,324.26,325.742,"--Well, yes."
1982.81-969,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,325.742,327.383,--only in the sense you have the litigation on your hands.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,332.505,333.833,"That's certainly true, Your Honor."
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.833,339.8,Because the federal contractor could pass it on to the Federal Government in terms of his price.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,339.8,341.345,"That's absolutely true, Your Honor."
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,343.766,344.063,"Yes, yes."
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,344.063,345.969,--with the Dravo Contracting case.
1982.81-969,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,345.969,346.844,"In '35, wasn't it?"
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,346.844,347.969,Yes.
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,355.981,357.231,Go ahead.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,357.792,374.051,"--In fact, that's the position being taken here by the Government, we believe, in advancing these arguments, that is, that if the same identical tax were applied then to contractors in the private sector then there would be no argument."
1982.81-969,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,665.605,673.585,"In that sense the state tax is discriminating against contractors with the Federal Government, isn't it?"
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,673.585,687.644,"In that sense, Your Honor, the incidence is on different partners in the transaction, but I believe we can show that it is not a discriminatory tax simply because that incidence is placed on different partners to the transaction."
1982.81-969,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,687.644,697.123,How do you distinguish the Moses Lake Homes and Phillips Chemical Company cases that are relied upon by the Solicitor General?
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,697.123,711.914,"Each of those discrimination cases, Your Honor, are a situation where the taxes were different from the taxes being applied against other people that might be in comparable transactions."
1982.81-969,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,749.789,765.283,"Wasn't the concern of the Court, at least in Phillips and perhaps in Moses Lake too, that the state treated contractors dealing with the state more favorably than contractors dealing with the Federal Government?"
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,765.283,779.902,There was... there was some discussion about whether people in the same identical situation as federal contractors were treated the same.
1982.81-969,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,788.165,806.19,"Do you think that analyzing the Washington... the economic burdens of the Washington transaction, it can be fairly said that Washington, that the State of Washington treats those contracting with the Federal Government less favorably than those contracting with the State of Washington?"
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,806.19,810.0,"We say we do not treat them less fairly, Your Honor, and--"
1982.81-969,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,810.0,810.578,Less favorably.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,810.578,815.934,--We say that they're being treated equally in both the federal sector and the nonfederal sector.
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.328,899.666,"Well, Mr. Attorney General, the federal contractor nevertheless has to put out the money when he buys, five or six percent more when he buys his materials."
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,914.77,919.283,The economic forces of the marketplace--
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,919.283,926.265,"Right, he's going to have to pay it and then he's going to risk whether or not he can... how much of it he can get from the Federal Government."
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,926.265,931.17,"--Your Honor is mentioning, of course, the up-front money problem that we have mentioned in our brief."
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,931.17,931.56,Yes.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,931.56,938.323,And there is at least three different aspects that need to be touched on in responding to that.
1982.81-969,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1106.677,1108.38,Refresh my recollection.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1115.126,1116.782,"That is true, Your Honor."
1982.81-969,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1116.782,1118.656,Which is different from this case.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1118.656,1151.22,"But nevertheless, the principle is the same, because the only way to explain the case and I believe the bottom line is that the tax did not discriminate against the Government and thereby breach the protective mantle of the supremacy clause in that case, because the Government, even if it assumed the burden of the tax by lowering its rents, would not be placed at a competitive disadvantage vis a vis other landlords who had to pay over a portion of their rent to the state government."
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1151.22,1169.979,"Mr. Attorney General, if you're right couldn't the State of Washington say with respect to federal contractors, we're going to put a five percent tax on you measured by the contract price to the Government, and we're not putting the legal incidence on the Government; you can do what you want to."
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1190.487,1197.437,"This would be an alternate scheme that could be used, Your Honor, a gross receipts tax of sorts applied to--"
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.437,1200.53,Applied solely to federal contractors?
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1200.53,1207.199,"--Well, I believe that we would have to have a comparable tax on contractors--"
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1207.199,1222.038,"Well, I just say... your argument is that really in effect, that your sales tax is a comparable tax the way you now arrange it, namely five percent added to the contract price that the owner must pay."
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1222.038,1223.536,"--Oh, yes."
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1236.141,1248.588,"Well, wouldn't you agree that if your argument's right Washington could put whatever your rate is, a five percent tax, on the contract price of the Government contractor?"
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1248.588,1257.445,"If I correctly understand what's being posed here and the tax were identical in its rate, yes, I believe we could, Your Honor."
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1257.445,1260.505,As long as you didn't attempt to put the legal incidence on the Government.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1260.505,1261.177,Absolutely.
1982.81-969,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1262.552,1272.827,"General Eikenberry, what is Washington law with respect to the obligation, duty of a contractor with the state to pass along the sales tax?"
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1276.452,1283.934,"It's bargaining between the parties, Your Honor, and the forces that happen to be in play in the marketplace at that time."
1982.81-969,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.934,1293.336,I thought you answered Justice O'Connor a while ago that you... that contractors contracting with the state government are treated just like private contractors.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1293.336,1293.758,"Yes, I did."
1982.81-969,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1294.617,1295.398,No.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1315.045,1321.731,"It's identical as between the private and the state government being the customer, Your Honor."
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1321.731,1324.777,But aren't they required to pass it on?
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1324.777,1326.401,"Yes, that's true, Your Honor."
1982.81-969,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1326.401,1335.428,"I think perhaps we haven't been as explicit in our questions, or perhaps you haven't been as explicit in your answers."
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1361.37,1362.729,Oh.
1982.81-969,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.087,1370.351,On which party?
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1370.351,1372.804,It would fall on the private party or the State.
1982.81-969,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1376.739,1377.364,It falls on the owner.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1377.364,1380.504,--The owner of the property for whom the construction is being done.
1982.81-969,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1400.433,1406.415,But the legal incidence of the tax is on the owner who is getting the building from the contract.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1406.415,1406.774,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-969,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1411.086,1412.663,Let me ask you one more question.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1423.236,1424.127,Yes.
1982.81-969,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1434.949,1439.62,How does the State collect that from an owner?
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1442.853,1443.197,--Yes.
1982.81-969,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1460.457,1470.06,"So that the contractor is actually the entity through which the Tax Department of the State of Washington collects the tax, even though you say the legal incidence is on the owner."
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1470.06,1470.95,That's true.
1982.81-969,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1489.147,1492.724,How can you hold the contractor liable if the incidence of the tax is on the owner?
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1492.724,1496.629,--Because we've said it's his duty to collect it from the customer.
1982.81-969,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1496.629,1498.925,"So as a practical matter, it's really the contractor that pays."
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1498.925,1503.407,"I understand the point, Your Honor."
1982.81-969,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1506.5,1513.137,"General, is the contractor's profit included in the base of the tax?"
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1513.137,1515.182,"Is... I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear."
1982.81-969,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1515.182,1523.679,I understood that the tax when you're dealing with parties other than the United States Government is based on the cost of the project--
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1523.679,1524.335,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-969,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1524.335,1524.976,--to the landowner.
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1524.976,1525.523,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-969,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1525.523,1530.067,Does that cost of the project include the contractor's profit?
1982.81-969,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1530.067,1531.052,"Absolutely, yes, sir."
1982.81-969,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1536.019,1540.939,Mr. Smith.
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1540.939,1545.03,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-969,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1695.267,1696.313,"Well, you use the term"
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1721.88,1727.535,"--It would be an attempt to do it, but our view is that they haven't done it correctly here under the precedents of the United States."
1982.81-969,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1727.535,1728.957,There are some ways they can circumvent it and other ways--
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1728.957,1730.361,Exactly.
1982.81-969,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1730.361,1732.907,--The difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance?
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1734.47,1738.313,I think--
1982.81-969,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1738.313,1767.081,"Mr. Smith, if the tax here, instead of requiring the owner of the property to pay a tax based on the full contract price, had a separate sales tax, one on the owner for the labor involved and one on the contractor for the cost of materials incorporated in the project, and the tax on the federal contractors remained the same as it is now, I assume you would say that's constitutional."
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1767.659,1777.717,"--Well, the important thing, Justice O'Connor, is that the federal contractors be treated the same as all other contractors."
1982.81-969,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1777.717,1779.467,And under that assumption it would be--
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1779.467,1780.545,Under that assumption that would be right.
1982.81-969,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1780.545,1780.826,--and it would be fine.
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1780.826,1792.32,"In other words, so that the Federal Government's immunity would prevent the state from imposing a tax on the... you know, on the contractor's profit, you know, which would be the cost borne by the Federal Government."
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1976.95,1978.543,Regardless of the economic effect?
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1978.543,1981.073,--Regardless of the economic effect.
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.073,1994.255,"Even if it's perfectly clear that the Federal Government contractor, the whole transaction of contracting with the Federal Government, will suffer a lesser economic burden than the state contractors?"
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1994.255,1999.223,"Well, that's true, regardless of that effect."
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1999.223,2000.002,And that's your position?
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2000.486,2026.554,"That is our position, and we think it's a position which is supported by the decisions of this Court, because rather than engaging in... the supremacy clause, as this Court has interpreted it countless times, presuppose... indicates the Founding Fathers' attempt to avoid this clash of sovereigns, clash of sovereigns between the Federal Government and the state government."
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2041.782,2043.531,Why do you call it discriminatory?
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2043.531,2044.734,"--Well, it is--"
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2044.734,2045.515,It's just different.
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2045.515,2046.78,"--It's different, but--"
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2046.78,2048.03,It's not discriminatory.
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2051.529,2053.152,--Indeed.
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.152,2057.402,It puts a lesser burden on the Federal Government than it does on the State.
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2057.402,2078.16,"Yes, but I think as the Court indicated in County of Fresno in describing the McCulloch rationale, the Court said if the state's power to tax the bank were recognized in principle, the Court doubted the ability of federal courts to review each exercise of such power to determine whether the tax would or would not destroy a federal function."
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.009,2102.259,Whether discriminatory or not.
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2102.259,2103.336,Whether discriminatory or not.
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.063,2140.243,"Although if they treated all contractors alike and just put a sales tax on the purchases of a contractor from all of his suppliers and left it up to the contractor to pass it on to his owner if he could, the fact that the United States would end up paying the tax would not invalidate it."
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2140.243,2146.272,"Indeed, that was the situation in 1935, and that really flows from the Court's statement in King & Boozer."
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.272,2157.815,"Even though the... even though now the burden on the Federal Government, if you accept, if you accepted the Washington tax, is no greater."
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2157.815,2159.063,Indeed.
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2160.188,2160.626,It's just different.
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2160.626,2161.36,--It's just different.
1982.81-969,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2173.541,2185.364,"Well, but I think one might fairly say your argument is reminiscent of a good deal of the decisional law of this Court before James versus Dravo and King & Boozer, where it was simply an exultation of form over substance."
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2185.364,2194.846,"I don't think so, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and the reason I don't think so is that we are examining here where the legal incidence of this tax falls."
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.397,2224.115,That's a burden... that's an economic burden argument you're making now.
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2224.115,2224.849,"--No, it isn't."
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.267,2239.218,It's just a description of how they're treated differently?

1982.81-969,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2256.789,2261.897,"Mr. Smith, in the County of Fresno we have exactly the same situation we have here."
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2287.276,2293.712,"--I think that kind of assumption... well, first of all, let me answer that in two parts."
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.354,2448.758,"Of course, the Government got into this case only because it reimbursed and then sued for a refund, didn't it?"
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2448.758,2451.086,"--I assume so, I assume so."
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2451.086,2451.382,You assume?
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2451.382,2457.161,I assume that the Government... although I suppose that the Government... the Government is a party in this case.
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2460.862,2462.861,I thought you did reimburse them.
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2462.861,2464.298,I think that's probably right.
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2467.188,2472.139,But we're talking about a case where the contractor suffered no economic burden whatsoever.
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2472.139,2492.239,"--But again, Justice White, I don't think that we can... I don't think that we can assume that the Federal... to assume that the Federal Government will make that kind of reimbursement is in effect to really, you know, make a farce of the Federal Government's immunity."
1982.81-969,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.656,2511.811,It sounds a lot like your brief in Fresno.
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2511.811,2516.387,"No, I don't think it sounds like my brief in Fresno, for one simple reason."
1982.81-969,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2588.982,2607.788,"Mr. Smith, before you leave Fresno, I should have reread the case before today, but is it not true that in the California possessory interest tax, not only did the tax apply to tenants of all publicly owned property, but to any property the owner of which was tax exempt, such as charities?"
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2609.6,2610.085,I think that's right.
1982.81-969,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2610.085,2612.551,Doesn't that make it quite different from this case?
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2612.551,2614.05,I think it does.
1982.81-969,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2614.05,2630.31,"But if you admit that, then what if Washington were to amend its tax to take the approach it now applies just to the Federal Government and create a class of contracts including state agencies and the like and treat them the way they now treat the Federal Government?"
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2631.043,2645.273,"Well, I'm not sure it would save it, only because you then would have... you then have to examine whether it included a sufficient number of similarly situated constituents within the tax to protect the Federal Government."
1982.81-969,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2656.627,2657.736,"Well, yes, but--"
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2657.736,2660.828,"--talking about the merits, it was talking about the merits of a case that the Court never reached."
1982.81-969,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2660.828,2663.64,"--So did the dissenting opinion in Fresno, but it wasn't very persuasive."
1982.81-969,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2663.64,2684.225,"But let me simply say that I think that when you're talking about who is a similarly situated constituent you have to, I think, start from the notion that the Federal Government is entitled to a full measure of protection and the inclusion of all similarly situated constituents."
