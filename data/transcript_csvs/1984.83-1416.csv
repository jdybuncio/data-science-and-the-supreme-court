1984.83-1416,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,71.012,"Mr. Come, I think you may proceed when you are ready."
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,71.012,74.714,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1416,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.049,304.981,Mr. Come?
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,304.981,305.881,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1416,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,305.881,327.395,"Has the Board ever explained the relationship between Section 152(3) of the Act, where Congress says that the term 159(b) to decide that close relatives shan't be members of a bargaining unit?"
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,334.318,340.655,That was the basis on which the Sixth Circuit refused to enforced the Board's order.
1984.83-1416,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,391.238,413.484,"But Mr. Come, the Board is relying on Section 9(b) authority, and 9(b) speaks in terms of selection of an employer unit, a craft unit, a plant unit, or a subdivision, and it just doesn't address itself to picking out individuals, does it?"
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,413.484,415.786,"No, it does not."
1984.83-1416,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,454.811,467.321,"Well, is it the Board's position that it could employ a standard that would exclude individuals simply based on anti-union animus alone?"
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,467.321,469.555,"No, Your Honor, that is--"
1984.83-1416,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,469.555,473.475,"Why not, under the Board's theory?"
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,473.475,502.661,"--Because, the statute certainly, since the Taft-Hartley amendments, as this Court made clear in Savair, is, mandates neutrality with respect to whether employees wish to select a union or not wish to select a union."
1984.83-1416,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,602.341,605.209,How about a close friend of someone in management?
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,605.209,662.712,"Well, I think that that might not be sufficient because the Board over the years has refined its 1 unit exclusion policy and has adopted the factors that were articulated by the Seventh Circuit in the Caravelle case, and in looking at those factors, what the Board looks at is how high a percentage of the stock a parent or spouse owns, how many of the shareholders are related to one another, whether the shareholder is actively engaged in management or holds a supervisory position, how many relatives are employed as compared with the total number of employees, and whether the relative lives in the same household or not."
1984.83-1416,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,662.712,672.334,"Well, Mr. Come, is the Board asking just for a rule for relatives and no one else, just a bright line rule for relatives?"
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,672.334,679.257,It's a bright line rule for some relatives.
1984.83-1416,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,679.257,681.707,Some relatives.
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,685.044,692.232,"Well, I think, I think, I think that that is what is involved in this case."
1984.83-1416,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,692.232,696.35,"Well, what's the Board asking for, though, and what's the Board's position?"
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,696.35,773.184,"Well, the Board, the Board's position is that it is a reasonable and permissible interpretation of its role under the statute to be empowered to find that relatives who would meet the Caravelle criteria, that what we are talking about essentially is close relatives of owners of closely held companies, because the way it is worked out is that unless you have had that situation, the Board has not found that a lack of community interest based solely on the family relationship but has required a showing of a special job state, so that in your example of just a close friend, in that situation the Board has uniformly required more in the way of a showing to warrant exclusion."
1984.83-1416,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1041.973,1057.233,"Mr. Come, does this mean if the exclusion, if they are excluded from the unit, that they obviously couldn't be members of the union, I guess they could also not participate in pension plans, collectively bargained pensions programs?"
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1057.233,1062.018,"If they are excluded from the unit, they would--"
1984.83-1416,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1062.018,1062.801,They would be excluded.
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1062.801,1089.435,"--But that is true, of course, Your Honor, of any employee who is excluded from a unit on a lack of community of interest grounds, and there would be nothing to prevent the employer from setting up equal pension rights or better for--"
1984.83-1416,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.435,1093.656,"Except sometimes you need a large group of employees to fund the program, I suppose."
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1096.441,1110.534,"--But as I say, that is a problem that occurs whenever employees are excluded from a unit on community of interest grounds."
1984.83-1416,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.534,1114.57,"Well, you just exclude them from voting, don't you?"
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1119.806,1122.591,"Well, they are treated as an employee, but they would not--"
1984.83-1416,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.591,1124.508,Not for these pension purposes?
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1124.508,1126.96,--But they would not be in the bargaining unit.
1984.83-1416,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1141.22,1145.672,"But then, are they to be denied the benefits of the union membership forever?"
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1145.672,1146.841,"No, they're not."
1984.83-1416,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1158.264,1161.066,Employee relations.
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1161.066,1175.208,"Well, they are not like managerial employees in the sense of who would be excluded from all rights of the group."
1984.83-1416,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1175.208,1178.678,"But the whole thesis is that they are tainted with the managerial taint, isn't it, really?"
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1178.678,1187.784,"Well, their interests are found to be more allied with management than they are with the rank and file employees."
1984.83-1416,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1187.784,1194.854,But do they... I don't think I've got your answer.
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1204.044,1213.149,"Well, they are excluded from the bargaining unit."
1984.83-1416,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1248.906,1267.134,"I suppose one of the factors there would be that when they are in negotiations or considering a strike matter, these would in effect be infiltrators whose loyalty would be divided between the... at least divided between the union and the management, is that right?"
1984.83-1416,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1267.134,1273.973,I think that puts it well.
1984.83-1416,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1348.104,1348.771,Very well.
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,1352.39,1357.894,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1416,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1412.296,1414.296,But didn't the Board find otherwise with respect to one of them?
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,1414.296,1415.165,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1984.83-1416,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1415.165,1416.848,Didn't the Board find otherwise--
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,1416.848,1418.534,"I'm sorry, I stand corrected."
1984.83-1416,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1748.762,1755.25,"--Well, did the union... did the Board apply a test using the factor you have just described in this particular case?"
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,1755.25,1757.0,The Board did not cite any case.
1984.83-1416,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1794.625,1805.683,I didn't understand Mr. Come to defend a test which would have incorporated as one factor how much union activity the particular person had engaged in.
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,1805.683,1813.622,"I'm... I don't... I think he indicated that... I think the question was asked by Justice O'Connor, well, could you consider antiunion animus?"
1984.83-1416,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1816.741,1817.824,Yes.
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,1817.824,1823.995,"--on Savair, and he cited Savair, that based upon its neutrality, that would not be permissible, and I don't disagree with that."
1984.83-1416,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2001.942,2019.988,"Well, certainly application of a special job-related privileges or benefits test such as that approved by the Sixth Circuit, could exclude individuals from a bargaining unit who are not excludable under Section 2."
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,2019.988,2023.09,"Yes, that's correct, that's correct."
1984.83-1416,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2023.09,2025.975,"And you are not arguing that that's improper, are you?"
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,2025.975,2026.558,"No, no."
1984.83-1416,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2195.901,2201.889,"Well, what if there were one that was getting special privileges and she was excluded from the unit?"
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,2204.507,2207.126,"--Well, at that particular point in time--"
1984.83-1416,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2207.126,2210.16,Wouldn't you... you would face your very same problems.
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,2210.16,2220.1,"--No, but there's a differentiation, just like I think in this court there was a differentiation with confidential employees in that not all confidential employees were excluded from the unit."
1984.83-1416,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.728,2239.578,"Well, but her job would still end up in jeopardy."
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,2239.578,2243.798,"Yes, it would, but now, but you see, the point I am making in response to that--"
1984.83-1416,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2243.798,2252.571,"And it would still be a mandatory bargaining matter if the employer wanted to keep her on that job, or move the job out of the unit."
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,2252.571,2263.109,"--That would be true in that regard, but what I am coming to, though, is that what we are looking for really is a... not a large grouping of employees that are under review here."
1984.83-1416,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2306.955,2311.959,Is living in the house with the employer a special status?
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,2311.959,2320.465,"--No, she... in this particular case she maintains the house, she has certain financial responsibilities relative to that house."
1984.83-1416,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2324.35,2328.052,"Well, how many other employees live in that house?"
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,2328.052,2330.068,"--Well, none."
1984.83-1416,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2330.068,2331.504,That's what I thought.
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,2331.504,2332.154,None.
1984.83-1416,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2332.154,2333.587,But that's not a special status.
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,2333.587,2335.056,As it relates to the job.
1984.83-1416,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2335.056,2335.972,That's right.
1984.83-1416,1,41589,stewart_j_katz,,2335.972,2338.008,"In that regard, yes."
1984.83-1416,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2386.005,2392.493,"Do you have something further, Mr. Come?"
1984.83-1416,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2392.493,2393.443,I just have--
1984.83-1416,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2393.443,2396.111,You have eight minutes remaining.
1984.83-1416,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2396.111,2397.962,--Two small points.
1984.83-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2573.793,2575.912,"Mr. Come, could I ask just one question?"
1984.83-1416,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2575.912,2576.545,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2576.545,2582.832,"In your brief on page 14, in footnote 7, you do quote from the Linn Gear case."
1984.83-1416,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2582.832,2583.184,Yes.
1984.83-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2583.184,2587.986,"The first of the factors quoted is the activity, if any, of the employee in the union."
1984.83-1416,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2587.986,2588.703,Yes.
1984.83-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2588.703,2592.974,And would you address the question whether you think that's an appropriate factor or not?
1984.83-1416,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2592.974,2593.274,"Yes, yes."
1984.83-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2598.694,2604.014,"Well, I think your brief says that it is added as a factor."
1984.83-1416,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2606.097,2607.597,"Well, some courts have."
1984.83-1416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2649.507,2655.51,"--How about the second factor there, the total number of employees as compared with the blood-related number?"
1984.83-1416,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2661.997,2670.753,"No, I don't think that it, that it is confined to that situation."
1984.83-1416,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2707.962,2710.747,Mr. Come--
1984.83-1416,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2710.747,2711.947,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1416,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2711.947,2718.584,--Both your brief and argument have spoken in terms of close relatives.
1984.83-1416,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2755.609,2756.626,Yes.
1984.83-1416,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2818.183,2829.824,"But I didn't understand Caravelle to apply the special status rule, and what you just said suggests that the Board would consider the special status or special relationship."
1984.83-1416,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2829.824,2835.578,I perhaps may not understand--
1984.83-1416,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2835.578,2839.18,"Well, there are two general standards."
1984.83-1416,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2849.405,2858.36,"--Well, special status means that you'd have to have, have some difference in job benefits and privileges."
1984.83-1416,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2867.699,2872.068,But did the Court of Appeals in this case find any special privilege?
1984.83-1416,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2872.068,2873.103,It did not.
1984.83-1416,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2913.411,2920.149,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Come."
