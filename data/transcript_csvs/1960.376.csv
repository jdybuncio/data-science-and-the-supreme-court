1960.376,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,5.009,"-- Petitioner, versus Jerry Lester."
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,6.511,9.755,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.376,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,60.484,61.721,1939 code?
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,61.721,63.571,Of the 1939 code.
1960.376,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,63.571,65.111,(Inaudible)
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,65.111,69.017,The 54 code Your Honor is substantially the -- the same.
1960.376,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,239.728,252.606,Even to say she may not have of any discretion as between the beneficiaries namely the children or that she may not have any -- any discretion to use the portion of that part for herself?
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,252.606,256.459,We think that the -- that the holding of the Second Circuit means both.
1960.376,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,304.026,311.265,Do you think the Second Circuit actually that the money had to be given to the children or -- or simply spend it exclusively on their behalf for their benefit.
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,311.265,312.727,"Well, of course."
1960.376,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,347.461,348.269,Mr. Tadlock.
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,348.269,348.832,"Yes, sir."
1960.376,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,348.832,361.735,Is it possible to -- and logical to treat her as a trustee of the part for the children or not?
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,361.735,365.461,We think that would depend upon state law of course.
1960.376,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,416.928,427.962,"That would be the power of a trustee with broad powers, a wide discretion to use the money as the trustee may think best for the beneficiaries."
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,427.962,428.411,"Yes, sir."
1960.376,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,428.411,433.556,But that still wouldn't permit the trustee to appropriate a part of it for her own use.
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,433.556,435.712,"That's right, Your Honor."
1960.376,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,935.788,941.591,Does the record how the wife treated these amounts in her income tax returns?
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,941.591,945.119,"She did not treat his income -- well, I -- sorry, the record does not show this."
1960.376,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,945.119,945.782,It does not show this?
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,945.782,946.92,"It does not show this, Your Honor."
1960.376,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,974.031,983.26,"Mr. Tadlock, is it material on what the parties to the contract intended as to who should pay the taxes or not?"
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,983.26,990.53,"We think the intention is important if you confine it within the four corners of the agreement, but only within the agreement."
1960.376,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,992.298,1009.873,"What do you say about subparagraph D on page 11 of the record which provides that after the first three years, the wife has to get only such sum as after she has paid the taxes leaves to $15,600 a year?"
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,1009.873,1015.122,We think that there is no significance to that at all Your Honor for this reason.
1960.376,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1054.67,1064.322,"Well then, I'd like to know with that construction how would you compute the amount the husband just to pay in that year?"
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,1064.322,1067.484,That the amount to be paid would be 20% of his income.
1960.376,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1067.484,1073.974,"But not in excess of $15,600 after taxes."
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,1073.974,1076.698,"After the wife has paid the taxes, assessable to her."
1960.376,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1076.698,1080.641,"Alright, now, if that's -- if that is the only issue -- excuse me."
1960.376,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1080.641,1086.77,Would you say that that's what she's to have left after she has paid the taxes assessable to her?
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,1086.77,1087.767,"Yes, on the alimony."
1960.376,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1087.767,1088.432,"And -- the $15,600 --"
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,1088.432,1090.674,Which will be 50 -- 50%.
1960.376,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1090.674,1093.18,"The 15000 -- well, in this case, it's 20%."
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,1093.18,1096.523,"Well, but 50% of the payment is for alimony."
1960.376,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1096.523,1097.075,Yes.
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,1097.075,1099.858,"50% is for child support, 316."
1960.376,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1102.838,1104.89,"Now then, this -- this will help me."
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,1113.637,1121.793,It is her money and the children's money to be used as she determines to support the children in a manner in which they are accustomed.
1960.376,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1144.598,1163.915,"Mr. Tadlock, I understand your argument that it would be must at most unfortunate to have a rule that -- if two divorced spouses live in different Circuits to have a rule that would be in internally inconsistent."
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,1202.375,1203.171,We have two comments on that --
1960.376,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1203.171,1204.723,(Voice Overlap)
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,1204.723,1206.44,-- Mr. Justice Stewart on that.
1960.376,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1212.636,1214.984,This area certainly is about the most important thing.
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,1214.984,1215.435,"Well, sir --"
1960.376,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1215.435,1218.477,And on lawyers interrupting their agreements will know where they stand.
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,1218.477,1225.767,And there would be a little opportunity or -- or very few instance in which they would be an amount for child support.
1960.376,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1326.519,1341.001,"So, is it your position that wherever there's a reduction clause, it's quite a part from my variations that there maybe a non-reduction clause, is that wherever there's a reduction clause, that part of it would be attributable for the -- for the children?"
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,1341.001,1342.282,Only if the reduction clause --
1960.376,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1342.282,1344.685,Is that the Commissioner's position now?
1960.376,0,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,1344.685,1352.471,The -- the Commissioner's position would be that if you examine the instrument to hold and find terms that will fix an amount and if a reduction clause will do this.
1960.376,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1454.9,1456.956,Mr. Mandel.
1960.376,1,34793,louis_mandel,,1456.956,1460.442,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it pleases the Court."
1960.376,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1513.141,1515.795,And what (Inaudible)
1960.376,1,34793,louis_mandel,,1515.795,1517.797,-- for that reason.
1960.376,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1601.911,1608.502,"Well, how do you square that argument Mr. -- how do you square that argument Mr. Mandel?"
1960.376,1,34793,louis_mandel,,1620.158,1623.792,I can square that by the simple intent of the whole agreement.
1960.376,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1857.722,1864.425,"Mr. Mandel, would you tell me how this might become a trap for -- for the husband?"
1960.376,1,34793,louis_mandel,,1864.425,1866.318,"Yes, I would."
1960.376,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2296.883,2298.754,Did Mr. Tadlock said about that?
1960.376,1,34793,louis_mandel,,2298.754,2312.308,"He -- he indicated and say -- he indicated that the $15,600 was to be broken up if that's his contention, half of it was -- was child support which should be charged, the wife had no tax to pay."
1960.376,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2399.863,2402.537,How old were the children at that time of the separation?
1960.376,1,34793,louis_mandel,,2402.537,2403.731,I believe they were 11 --
1960.376,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2403.731,2404.613,It's his children or?
1960.376,1,34793,louis_mandel,,2404.613,2408.387,"-- 11 -- 13 or around that, 11 or 13."
1960.376,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2429.922,2432.462,(Inaudible)
1960.376,1,34793,louis_mandel,,2432.462,2434.646,"That's right, that's now."
1960.376,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2495.173,2495.318,What --
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3364.293,3368.826,"Mr. Chief Justice, please the Court."
1960.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3386.204,3389.59,This is all deductible to -- for the husband and all the income to the wife.
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3390.163,3390.679,That's right.
1960.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3469.994,3482.577,"I -- I didn't hear earlier what you did with the -- let's say fact on this -- on this agreement that upon the wife remarries even -- even within a short time after this agreement, all the payment cease."
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3482.577,3484.256,This is a termination clause.
1960.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3484.256,3484.873,Yes.
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3484.873,3487.311,We're concerned with what happens while there are payments.
1960.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3502.309,3505.047,They -- they cease because of the agreement.
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3505.047,3505.446,"That's right, sir."
1960.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3505.446,3507.275,It doesn't terminate the agreement.
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3508.724,3510.345,Terminates the payments.
1960.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3512.523,3513.812,By reason of the agreement.
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3513.812,3514.344,"Yes, sir."
1960.376,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3524.537,3544.324,"What would be the Government's position that the agreement is provided that in the event if a child died, the payments to the wife or her support and the support of the children will be reduced in such amount as the two lawyers loss a third chosen by mutual selection your read upon."
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3544.324,3548.407,Will not fit the statute because the statute says you must be determined from the terms of the --
1960.376,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3548.407,3555.626,But this agreement do anything -- does this thing do anything more than to indicate a arbitrary amount by which is not to be reduced.
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3555.626,3557.44,"That's right sir and that's what -- that's the importance, that's the point."
1960.376,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3557.44,3558.69,You say that's enough.
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3558.69,3559.279,That's the point.
1960.376,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3579.509,3597.359,"Does -- does the case get down to this, the Government contends that in view of the fact that there is a reduction clause and a define the percentage of reduction from that the inferences to be drawn that during the lifetime of the children that proportion was to be allocated to them."
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3598.285,3598.913,"That's the case, Your Honor."
1960.376,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3598.913,3602.508,And you think they -- and you think that's the fairest construction of the document?
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3602.508,3604.128,We certainly do.
1960.376,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3617.904,3628.766,"Rather than -- rather than -- you don't make it just as plausible or just as fair to say but certainly, the wife has the obligation -- she has the custody, she has certain obligations."
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3644.578,3645.384,"Right, sir."
1960.376,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3645.384,3656.599,"But, isn't it a jump to say that because of the calculation of what the reduction, the amount of reduction should be, that money is set aside so that the mother can't use it in a different way."
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3656.599,3657.387,I certainly agree.
1960.376,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3657.387,3666.775,That's a crude way -- the reduction is a crude guessing of outsiders of what she is entitled to make a very specific disposition of.
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3666.775,3667.008,"That's right, sir."
1960.376,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3667.008,3668.233,Isn't that true?
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3668.233,3668.884,Absolutely.
1960.376,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3676.741,3677.656,It could easily be fixed if you wanted --
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3677.656,3678.012,Yes.
1960.376,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3678.012,3679.206,-- to make it certain.
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3699.152,3706.201,And the most difficult thing would be who would determine if an item was for child support or whether this is for the good of the group.
1960.376,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3710.237,3713.13,But fix -- the word fix.
1960.376,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3713.13,3713.929,Mr -- Mr --
1960.376,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3713.929,3722.007,"-- the word fix carried within a -- swish her tail, isn't appeared for the comment that fixed implies fixity?"
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3724.181,3724.291,It implies --
1960.376,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3724.291,3726.335,The thought fixing is --
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3726.335,3726.77,Facet.
1960.376,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3726.77,3738.691,"-- is not this crude calculation that the Government consists on or must rely on namely, we'll make a guess that if a child dies, he only had one-sixth for the respondent."
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3743.066,3745.003,"A settled amount, an amount."
1960.376,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3745.003,3746.908,The statute is fixed.
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3746.908,3752.616,"Fixed an amount which is payable for child support, not to fix the amount which is to be used."
1960.376,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3752.616,3753.983,"No, no, no."
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3759.746,3760.753,That's right sir.
1960.376,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3761.714,3765.921,"Mr. Tadlock, I'd like to asked you one more question please."
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3793.543,3796.66,I'm not sure of his -- of his position on that.
1960.376,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3796.66,3800.372,That's what he understood your argument to be.
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3802.921,3804.913,"Well, that is not our argument, Your Honor."
1960.376,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3825.153,3827.367,Let's note this language just a minute.
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3867.667,3869.163,"Yes, sir."
1960.376,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3869.163,3871.561,"Well, how much for the wife and how much for the children?"
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3871.561,3877.153,"According to the other provision in the agreement, $3600 -- $3600 or one half payment."
1960.376,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3877.153,3885.077,"Well then, that's -- that's exactly Mr. Mandel's understanding of your argument that $7800 then goes to her and $7800 for the children."
1960.376,2,20223,c_guy_tadlock,,3885.077,3887.218,For the purposes of taxation.
