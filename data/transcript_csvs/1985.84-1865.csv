1985.84-1865,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.27,We will hear arguments first this morning in Lockhart against McCree.
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,12.341,14.76,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.84-1865,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,52.732,58.169,"General Clark, where in Arkansas was McCree tried?"
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,58.169,62.907,"He was tried in Ouachita County, Justice Rehnquist, where the crime was committed, in Camden, Arkansas."
1985.84-1865,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,62.907,68.976,"And where did the venire come from, from a particular state judicial circuit in that case?"
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,68.976,77.666,"It is the state judicial district which comprises two counties, Union County and Ouachita County, population of about 75,000 together."
1985.84-1865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.182,136.419,"General Clark, I would assume that would only be if such a holding were made retroactive."
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,136.419,138.588,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,196.407,200.525,"General Clark, may I inquire about this matter?"
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,214.535,216.451,"Your Honor, I don't think that it makes a difference."
1985.84-1865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,217.451,236.663,Does that leave open for manipulation by the state in a given case an option to excuse jurors under Witherspoon and then plan all along to waive a request for the death penalty?
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,236.663,242.397,"--Your Honor, I don't think it was the intent of the state to leave open an option to procedurally come back and attempt to bar this effort."
1985.84-1865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,274.252,290.297,"But does the record disclose in this case why the state opted to proceed as it did and forego requesting the death penalty, after initially embarking on that course?"
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,290.297,310.794,"Your Honor, the answer to that question is yes, that in this instance, as with Grigsby in the case that was a companion case, that they were consolidated... and as the Court may be aware, Mr. Grigsby died while he was in prison... that in this instance what we did was we waived this issue because of the fact that, as I said, we wanted to get to the crux of the issue before the Court."
1985.84-1865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.794,313.194,I don't think that responds to my question.
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,325.118,325.653,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.653,331.624,"And it excused for cause some jurors under the Witherspoon doctrine, right?"
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,331.624,332.474,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.24,342.08,"And then at some time after or during the trial, the state decided not to seek the death penalty after all."
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,342.08,348.567,"In the trial with Mr. McCree, the verdict that was returned was life without parole."
1985.84-1865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,351.436,357.089,The state never backed off and decided not to seek the death penalty?
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,358.472,359.541,"Not in McCree, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,362.576,363.776,But not in McCree?
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,363.776,364.376,--Not in McCree.
1985.84-1865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,364.376,364.945,All right.
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,364.945,366.111,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,493.378,494.913,"Mr. Clark, doesn't your argument prove too much?"
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,504.519,519.378,"Your Honor, if in fact you were trying to exclude these and identify them as denial of a cross-section because they were a distinct group and they were recognizable and they were sizable and they were systematically excluded, perhaps you would be moving toward that argument, which I will address later in my argument to this Court."
1985.84-1865,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,532.186,533.002,"Well, I understand that."
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,538.973,545.259,If in fact in qualifying these jurors they were excused because they were going to be partial--
1985.84-1865,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,545.259,545.425,"No, no."
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,548.794,550.277,"--Well, if you start taking just--"
1985.84-1865,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,550.277,551.246,And they're all impartial Republicans.
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,551.246,552.329,--that's not permissible.
1985.84-1865,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.329,553.063,That's not permissible?
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,553.063,558.9,"That's not permissible, just to say all Democrats or all members of associations, I don't think, because you would have to demonstrate that they're not--"
1985.84-1865,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,558.9,568.005,"All I'm suggesting is it doesn't seem to me a complete answer to the case to say that the remaining jury, examined individually, each one of them there's no objection to."
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,570.207,572.326,"--Your Honor, no, that's not the thrust of my argument."
1985.84-1865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,604.714,655.313,"Well, General Clark, I thought that Respondent's argument was more along the line of an argument that by excluding these jurors at the guilt-innocence phase of the case that it was a procedure whereby the state has organized the procedure in such a way that it would be more likely to result in a guilty verdict because of the evidence produced by the studies, not that the jury panel was in fact biased or not impartial, but that it was a procedure by which the state is more likely to obtain a jury which will vote for a guilty verdict."
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,657.765,662.4,"Well, Your Honor, if that is the thrust, I would look at it from this standpoint."
1985.84-1865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,682.881,696.39,"Well, that leads to the question of whether the state's interest, which of course is substantial, is more substantial than the defendant's interest in having a fair procedure."
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,696.39,698.273,I submit to this Court that is.
1985.84-1865,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,832.346,840.952,"Did I understand you that if 80 percent of the people of this country are against the Sixth Amendment, it doesn't apply?"
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,840.952,843.452,"No, Your Honor, I would not say that and would never contend that."
1985.84-1865,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,843.452,844.754,You were getting awfully close.
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,844.754,846.654,"We do not contend that, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,856.628,868.019,"General, when you said that Arkansas perhaps excluded lawyers or doctors and chiropractors, were those just hypothetical examples or does Arkansas in fact exclude certain occupations?"
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,868.019,876.423,"--Specifically, Your Honor, we do exclude professions: doctors, lawyers, chiropractors, dentists, dental hygienists, firemen, Christian Scientists."
1985.84-1865,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,879.291,886.414,As a matter of mandate or as a matter of choice on the part of the person who's summoned for jury duty?
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,886.414,887.531,"Your Honor, it's matter of choice."
1985.84-1865,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,889.516,891.718,There's no statutory category?
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,891.718,896.587,"No statutory, except for felons, which are disqualified, which are in fact disqualified."
1985.84-1865,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,896.587,900.991,But this recital is not a statutory exclusion that you were reciting?
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,900.991,901.723,"No, sir, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,907.91,913.798,"Are you saying as a practical matter you don't find doctors, lawyers, and businessmen on juries, generally speaking?"
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,913.798,915.048,"No, Your Honor, I would not say that."
1985.84-1865,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1130.738,1139.427,"May I ask, Mr. Attorney General, there are two issues and they are independent, are they not, the cross-section issue and the impartiality issue?"
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,1139.427,1140.411,"Yes, Your Honor, there are two issues."
1985.84-1865,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1140.411,1150.384,You're going to address the... I gather we could disagree with the Court of Appeals on the cross-section issue and yet find merit on the impartiality issue?
1985.84-1865,0,29671,john_steven_clark,,1150.384,1151.551,"Yes, Your Honor, you could."
1985.84-1865,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1258.338,1261.373,Mr. Gross.
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1261.373,1264.658,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1405.934,1408.719,"Mr. Gross, you used the expression ""ordinary jury""."
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1441.44,1442.625,"No, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1469.61,1482.517,"Well then, an jury in your view is one that is simply made up of everyone of jury age, and then the state must show some justification for excluding any category?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1482.517,1485.202,There are other exclusions that are permissible.
1985.84-1865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1498.729,1516.84,"What if, instead of... what if you had conducted a similar survey just in Arkansas alone of Witherspoon excludibles and it showed that people from Little Rock were much more inclined to vote for the defense in a capital case than people from Camden."
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1524.344,1524.661,No.
1985.84-1865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1535.702,1538.437,"That was made for federal purposes, really, the Sixth Amendment."
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1538.437,1539.387,"That's correct, that's correct."
1985.84-1865,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1558.584,1565.754,"Mr. Gross, what if by chance there were no Witherspoon excludibles on the jury panel?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1565.754,1567.44,Then there would be no constitutional violation.
1985.84-1865,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1569.808,1578.248,"But by your terms it wouldn't be a fair cross-section, I suppose, as I understand your argument."
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1578.248,1588.454,"The fair cross-section argument, of course, goes to the systematic exclusion of Witherspoon excludibles from the group that is eligible for service."
1985.84-1865,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1593.691,1601.863,"And you would say that it was a fair and impartial jury, even if by chance there were no Witherspoon excludibles on the jury?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1601.863,1602.113,Yes.
1985.84-1865,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1621.091,1627.495,What you really are arguing for is a sort of prophylactic rule.
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1627.495,1634.335,"It's a prophylactic rule, but one that has actual consequences in quite a few cases, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1729.629,1735.533,"There was no finding, was there, of bias on the part of any single juror?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1735.533,1737.366,"No, Your Honor, no."
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1737.366,1742.62,So you're relying primarily on the statistical and expert testimony--
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1742.62,1744.556,"We're not... that's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1777.693,1789.851,--Does one state of Arkansas provide under certain circumstances that a person may be sentenced to life without benefit of parole?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1789.851,1790.251,Yes.
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1792.37,1796.155,"Yes, but let's forget capital cases for the moment."
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1805.962,1810.081,I'm not aware of any Arkansas provisions for that sentence except in capital cases.
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1810.081,1811.716,But assume there are states that have it.
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1811.716,1812.583,"Yes, there are, I know that."
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1812.583,1814.0,I think there are.
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1814.0,1814.835,I believe so.
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1814.835,1817.354,I think Texas may be one of them.
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1839.367,1850.741,"I jurors like that were excluded from the determination of guilt or innocence in a state that uses jury sentencing for that purpose, for determining life without parole, Your Honor?"
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1884.129,1888.95,But would such a jury be a cross-section of the community under your argument?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1888.95,1902.524,It would be a cross-section of the community unless there were a demonstration that the group that were excluded were important and distinctive enough to have a material bearing on the process of jury deliberations and on jury outcomes.
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1902.524,1912.232,"What do you have to do, have a Gallop poll to determine what percentage of the people in the community would oppose life sentences without benefit of parole?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1912.232,1915.184,You'd at least have to determine that it is a substantial number.
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1923.956,1925.156,For example?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,1925.156,1939.999,"For example, as the Witherspoon excludibles in this case as have been shown, these people have legitimate and distinctive attitudes on issues such as the meaning of proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2010.729,2028.457,"Would you approve of the Florida system, under which the jury may or may not recommend capital punishment, and the judge may make the decision with respect to, the final decision with respect to capital punishment?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2028.457,2030.726,"Personally, I have no particular position on it."
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2039.082,2048.104,"Yes, but the case you're arguing is constitutional under Gregg, and it is the law in the majority of the states."
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2061.595,2068.082,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and they sometimes override jury recommendations for mercy and impose the death penalty."
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2077.924,2091.031,"Doesn't that cut against your basic argument, that so-called death-prone jurors in fact are more willing to impose capital punishment than judges, for example?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2091.031,2092.049,"--No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2092.049,2092.633,You don't think so?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2092.633,2093.599,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2111.611,2123.086,Would you argue that in Florida the people who would not be willing to recommend capital punishment should not be excluded?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2123.086,2123.803,--Yes.
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2123.803,2124.604,You would?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2124.604,2125.87,They should not be excluded from--
1985.84-1865,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2125.87,2128.906,Even though the ultimate decision is to be made by a court?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2128.906,2132.591,--They should not be excluded from the determination of guilt or innocence.
1985.84-1865,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2183.041,2205.122,"Mr. Gross, if you're right then I suppose any state which allowed the state to make peremptory strikes of jurors would have violated the Constitution if it tried to strike from the jury people that the state thought would be more likely to render a defense verdict."
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2205.122,2205.557,"--No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2205.557,2215.728,"Why not, if the state tries to exercise all of its peremptory strikes in such a way as to get a jury that's more likely to convict?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2215.728,2219.566,"Your Honor, that is an even handed aspect of the adversary system."
1985.84-1865,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2262.476,2278.355,"Well, I suppose the defendant can also at the time of trial selection, in asking that jurors be excused for cause, have the defendant's counterbalancing excuses for cause, can't he?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2278.355,2279.788,--On the issue of capital punishment?
1985.84-1865,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2307.022,2323.067,"Would you consider a jury to be non-representative in, let's say, the District of Columbia, where overwhelmingly the people living in the District of Columbia are Government employees?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2336.976,2351.217,"If a given jury is not representative of the community, there is no problem, because, as this Court has repeatedly said, the defendant doesn't have a right to a particular jury panel, to twelve jurors who mirror the community."
1985.84-1865,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2367.996,2376.351,"Washington, D.C., has more lawyers per square city block or square mile than any city in the world."
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2376.351,2378.22,"--Perhaps more judges, too, for that matter."
1985.84-1865,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2378.87,2382.672,Did you ever hear of a lawyer on a Washington jury?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2382.672,2385.14,"I don't know if they ever serve on Washington juries, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2400.05,2403.102,But there's no occupational exclusion of lawyers.
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2403.102,2405.138,"--Oh, then it's a de facto occupational exclusion."
1985.84-1865,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2405.138,2406.104,Nor doctors.
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2406.104,2421.23,"Some states exclude or, more likely, provide exemptions for doctors and lawyers as a matter of statute, and in some places particular occupational groups for one reason or another don't happen to show up."
1985.84-1865,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2465.826,2484.221,"Mr. Gross, may I ask, if the Court should disagree with the Court of Appeals on the cross-section issue, would you have a different argument to make on the impartiality question?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2484.221,2501.432,"I believe, Your Honor, that the Eighth Circuit's position on the cross-section issue and the Eighth Circuit's findings on which it based its decision on the cross-section issue dictate a holding from this Court on the issue of impartiality as well."
1985.84-1865,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2504.551,2515.009,"Is that to say that if we disagree with the Court of Appeals on the cross-section issue, we also disagree with the Court of Appeals on the impartiality issue?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2515.009,2515.642,"--No, indeed."
1985.84-1865,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2515.642,2517.377,"Well, that's what I'm trying to get at."
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2517.377,2518.827,"I'm sorry, I misunderstood your question."
1985.84-1865,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2518.827,2528.667,"If we should disagree with the Court of Appeals on the cross-section issue, what argument have you on the impartiality issue?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2528.667,2537.438,The Court on formal grounds could disagree with the Eighth Circuit that this group is not what has been called a distinctive or cognizable group.
1985.84-1865,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2551.448,2553.134,That's on the guilt-innocence?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2553.134,2567.827,"--That's correct, but not only on guilt or innocence, also on the predisposition of the jury prior to the initiation of deliberations, which is I submit a constitutional issue in itself, and also on the conduct of deliberations."
1985.84-1865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2567.827,2574.063,"Well, Mr. Gross, now, you say it has an actual biasing effect, and we're not talking about cross-section."
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2577.915,2579.467,"That's correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2579.467,2586.271,So you're saying that a jury can be biased even though no individual juror on it is biased?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2586.271,2587.305,Exactly.
1985.84-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.305,2592.692,You're really saying the absence of these other people is what really biases the jury.
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2592.692,2593.425,That's right.
1985.84-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2601.131,2608.119,You think if it hadn't have been for this exclusion conviction would have been less likely?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2608.119,2609.821,The conviction may have been less likely.
1985.84-1865,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2723.244,2737.586,Do you think you have destroyed the impartiality of a jury if the prosecutor is permitted one way or another to exclude people whose members of the family have been convicted of felonies?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2737.586,2740.771,People whose members of family have been convicted?
1985.84-1865,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2755.048,2763.887,What use is made of the peremptory challenge if they can't challenge for cause in those cases?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2779.765,2780.998,"No, indeed."
1985.84-1865,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2782.634,2785.669,Or who have ever been prosecutors?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2785.669,2791.304,"--I actually know of cases in which defense attorneys have permitted that, but typically not."
1985.84-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2806.5,2824.627,"Did I misunderstand your brief to argue that at the voir dire a prosecutor should not inquire of the guilt-innocence, potential guilt-innocence juror, anything about his attitudes towards the death penalty?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2824.627,2827.429,That would avoid all of the problems that we've identified.
1985.84-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2827.429,2850.327,"You mean that it would be unconstitutional, do you think, if the prosecutor said, would you be willing to impose the death penalty, and he said, no, in no circumstances; well, you, despite your attitude toward the death penalty, would you believe that would effect your deliberations on guilt or innocence?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2851.445,2852.645,I see what you're saying.
1985.84-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.501,2878.676,You don't suggest that there are no people who are against the death penalty who would also not vote for guilt?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2878.676,2879.878,"--No, there certainly are."
1985.84-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2879.878,2883.28,"Well, how does a prosecutor identify them without asking them?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2883.28,2885.616,"Well, there are a couple of possible procedures."
1985.84-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2898.89,2900.892,You don't object to that?
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2900.892,2902.326,--Not at all.
1985.84-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2918.937,2929.395,Suppose that the challenge for cause were eliminated just because of the opposition to the death penalty.
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2938.751,2940.134,A state could permit that.
1985.84-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.369,2943.786,"Well, I know, but it wouldn't be barred constitutionally?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,2943.786,2947.107,"No, I don't believe it would, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3037.664,3046.553,"Do you have a... do you take any position that if you win, whether the ruling would be retroactive?"
1985.84-1865,1,41376,samuel_r_gross,,3046.553,3050.238,I have no position on that as an advocate for Mr. McCree.
1985.84-1865,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3119.618,3122.353,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Attorney General?"
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3122.353,3124.086,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.84-1865,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3151.206,3161.328,"But General Clark, is it not correct that the state agrees that there is a substantial percentage of Witherspoon excludibles who could follow state law on the issue of guilt or innocence?"
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3161.328,3169.667,"Your Honor, we would consent that if a juror says, who is a Witherspoon excludible, I can follow state law, that you can't strike them for cause on that reason."
1985.84-1865,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3180.309,3187.629,"Well, yes, but what if he says, I will follow state law except with respect to capital punishment?"
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3187.629,3189.248,--Then he must be excused for cause because--
1985.84-1865,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3189.248,3196.652,"Well, but he says, I can decide guilt or innocence very fairly and not be affected at all by my views about the death penalty."
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3196.652,3205.857,"--The policy, Your Honor, of our state is for the same jury to hear guilt and innocence as well as penalty, and that policy I submit to you is one that is founded in good constitutional principle."
1985.84-1865,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3252.988,3263.379,"But you agree, I take it, that the jurors we're talking about here, the 17 percent or whatever the figure is, would all be qualified to sit in all of those cases if they were not capital cases?"
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3263.379,3268.95,"They would be qualified in those cases if they stated to the court, Your Honor, they would consider the full range of punishments."
1985.84-1865,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3268.95,3279.656,"But they also state to the court in these cases, the death cases, that they can pass on guilt or innocence without any disability, and you agree with that as I understand it."
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3279.656,3281.44,"Some may state that, yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3284.126,3296.284,"Well, does it boil down to the balancing between the state's interest in the unitary system in capital cases as opposed to this proven, as I understand the record, conviction proneness of this particular jury?"
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3297.234,3299.052,"You are balancing state interests, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3311.41,3321.316,"Of course, under the Eighth Circuit holding you could have the best of both possible worlds, because it follows state law or guilt or innocence, and then you just have to have a few extra alternates on."
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3327.803,3347.033,"I would submit to this Court that that is not the best of all worlds, at least by the policy determination in Arkansas, that to set those alternates on the jury, which we set, too, but not in the deliberation phase, in case of illness or emergency, but to divide that responsibility, to diminish that responsibility, is not good policy, and that we have determined it not to be good policy."
1985.84-1865,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3353.404,3359.108,"Well, may I also ask, is the state interest a matter of policy or is there any constitutional right to this?"
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3370.565,3371.132,"--Yes, sir, I do."
1985.84-1865,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3371.132,3377.736,"They're saying they have a constitutional interest in an impartial jury, and that they're not getting an impartial jury."
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3382.473,3391.146,"Your Honor, I submit that when they argue that they have a constitutional claim, their constitutional claim that's described by the Constitution is to an impartial jury."
1985.84-1865,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3391.146,3391.796,--Right.
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3391.796,3398.233,"In this instance, by the process that we follow we only exclude those jurors who say they cannot follow state law."
1985.84-1865,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3406.238,3417.813,"Yes, but you're recusing them from the portion of the proceeding in which they admittedly can follow state law, because they cannot follow state law in a later proceeding in which they admit they should be excluded."
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3417.813,3423.8,"We are excusing them for that reason, Your Honor, and we do that because we think that jury deliberation is the better policy, rather than judge sentencing."
1985.84-1865,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3423.8,3428.787,"General, in this case did the Government use up all its peremptories?"
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3428.787,3430.271,"Your Honor, I'm not aware of whether we did or not."
1985.84-1865,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3434.758,3436.441,You believe they did use them up?
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3436.441,3437.127,She tells me we did not.
1985.84-1865,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3437.76,3438.41,You did not?
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3438.41,3440.929,We did not.
1985.84-1865,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3442.029,3445.63,Was the voir dire conducted individually?
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3445.63,3446.315,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3467.546,3470.448,So they excused six out of the entire panel?
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3470.448,3473.133,"Nine total, Your Honor, six immediately by the judge."
1985.84-1865,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3473.133,3473.466,Yes.
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3478.454,3480.954,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1865,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3482.656,3502.069,"I suppose if you had a rule that you cannot throw off Witherspoon excludibles, you cannot exclude them from the guilt or innocence phase, you would just... you would find out if they ware opposed to the death penalty, but then seat them."
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3515.46,3518.412,"--Your Honor, I think that procedure perhaps could be advanced."
1985.84-1865,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3518.412,3523.233,I guess we just wouldn't know how many alternates you would have had to have on that basis in this case.
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3523.233,3524.882,"We would not have known, Your Honor, that's correct."
1985.84-1865,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3524.882,3526.017,We don't know now.
1985.84-1865,2,29671,john_steven_clark,,3526.017,3527.134,"No, that's right."
1985.84-1865,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3568.611,3569.377,"Thank you, gentlemen."
