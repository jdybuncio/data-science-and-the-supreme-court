2009.08-992,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.468,"We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 08-992, Beard v. Kindler."
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,6.32,9.706,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-992,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,43.076,52.432,I didn't understand the Third Circuit rule to equate discretion with inadequacy.
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,90.641,97.878,"That was the -- the argument presented, but I think what the Third Circuit held was simply to equate discretion with inadequacy."
2009.08-992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,99.747,100.43,Where is that?
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,107.6,108.817,"--I don't think we really have to guess, Your Honor."
2009.08-992,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,133.765,140.502,But the fugitive forfeiture rule that they were talking about was the -- the mandatory rule wasn't firmly established.
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,140.502,144.22,"Well, I don't think that's a fair reading of this language, in and of itself, Your Honor."
2009.08-992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.46,191.951,"I -- I have a number of problems with the Third Circuit's opinion, but the question presented, it seems to me, is not really the dispositive point of the opinion."
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,196.589,197.789,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2009.08-992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,197.789,199.189,"And I don't see a split, either."
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,218.352,239.682,"--Your Honor, I think the problem here and the reason that we are at this point is that, whether the test is stated directly as being a per se ban on discretion or whether simply the standard is so high under an interpretation of ""firmly established"" that allows for virtually no deviation in results by the State courts, the effect is the same."
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,242.968,259.245,"But this wasn't the ruling by the court in analyzing your cases and saying -- you know, in six out of the cases -- six out of the ten cases, discretion was exercised, in four it wasn't, and so it's not firmly established because the numbers are skewed."
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,274.505,276.624,Justice Sotomayor--
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,276.624,283.211,"And so it characterized your argument that way, that you were saying the district court had no discretion."
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,283.211,288.264,"--Justice Sotomayor, the State didn't argue in Federal court that the State rule was mandatory."
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,289.481,297.12,"Well, whether you think you did or didn't, that's how the court described it, so it understood you to be taking a different position."
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,301.489,314.23,"The problem is that the Third Circuit did not engage in any inquiry about the nature of the rule that was applied to this defendant, so it was not in any position to say that a different rule was applied to this defendant than the rule that should have been applied."
2009.08-992,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,350.669,356.989,You mean that the defendant might not have escaped if he knew that the rule wasn't--
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,356.989,366.762,"--Well, I think that's the irony of applying this sort of adequacy analysis to this kind of default, but that, I think, is more of a problem for Kindler than for the Commonwealth."
2009.08-992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,375.384,380.521,"Well, I don't know why you submit -- why you seem to concede that that applies here."
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,414.092,436.006,"Well, I think, Your Honor, what we are presenting is that the nature of the State rule here was -- was such that the defendant had reasonable notice of what he was facing by escaping, whether or not it would have affected his subjective decision to escape, and therefore that the State ground can't be thrown out in Federal court on the ground of adequacy."
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,468.144,469.579,--What court has said?
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,484.422,484.872,Your Honor--
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,484.872,496.996,So what other circuit has said that any measure of discretion or even a lot of use of discretion bars deference to the State rule?
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,496.996,519.326,"--Justice Sotomayor, I think if you look at the amicus brief filed on behalf of 25 States, you will see that that there are a great many cases where that's exactly the analysis that the courts have applied, and in many of those cases they have required the parties to place before them dozens and sometimes hundreds of other examples of the operation of a State procedural rule so that the lower Federal court can decide whether that--"
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,519.326,524.83,How many of those cases resulted in the overturning or the grant of habeas--
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,524.83,527.199,"--I think in California, for example, it's been quite common."
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,541.773,548.462,--But do we -- what -- what does that tell us about us establishing the rule that you propose?
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,548.462,554.766,--I think what it tells us is that the lower courts are applying a very different adequacy rule than this Court has been applying.
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,562.353,566.49,But you are asking us to take away a part of the inquiry.
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,566.49,567.44,"Not at all, Your Honor."
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,567.44,585.636,"Your notice -- your notice and an opportunity to comply doesn't address a repeated statement by us, which is that whatever test is applied has to get to whether the State court is attempting to evade Federal review of constitutional questions."
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,585.636,586.738,"Yes, it does, Your Honor."
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,586.738,587.171,All right.
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,617.84,620.225,"The question is what those circumstances are, Your Honor."
2009.08-992,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,785.267,794.122,"--But the question that you present -- I mean, you state it forthrightly in your brief, and I'm reading from page 7, you say:"
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,866.069,884.465,"Justice Ginsburg, an occasional act of grace, that level of -- of leniency or flexibility that would be allowed by the district court's view of the law, or the Third Circuit's, is simply not appropriate in judging the adequacy of State grounds."
2009.08-992,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,895.071,897.456,"Well, do you want to modify then what you said?"
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,915.651,928.042,"Justice Ginsburg, we say that because there was no analysis here of what degree of discretion or whether discretion was actually applied by the State court in this case."
2009.08-992,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,988.283,1001.94,But what makes -- makes this particularly puzzling is you are attributing a rule to the Third Circuit that that very circuit in Campbell v. Burris said was not a tool.
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1017.802,1038.548,"And I think if the Third Circuit had applied that statement in this case, there might have been a different result and at the very least there would have been additional analysis, because that calls for additional analysis beyond the absolute lack of analysis in this opinion about the nature of the rule that was actually applied to this defendant."
2009.08-992,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1053.392,1074.139,"Well, it would be really odd, considering that one member of the panel was on both cases, Stapleton, and these cases are in the same year, for at least that judge not to think that what he said in the one case was in no conflict with what he said in the other."
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1074.139,1084.427,"--And yet we have a result, Your Honor, which is explainable only on the ground that the State court rule maintains some power of discretion by the State courts."
2009.08-992,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1113.114,1117.667,But it seems to me that that's not what the Third -- Third Circuit was saying.
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1130.308,1148.854,"Well, I don't think that there is an analysis of whether the law was -- was established at the time of the waiver, Your Honor, because what the court says, or at least what the precedents it rely on say, is that at the time of the waiver here, assuming for the moment that that's the relevant inquiry, the rule was discretionary."
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1157.126,1159.827,"Counsel, I don't know how you say that."
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1218.633,1219.183,--Your Honor--
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1219.183,1221.918,That's as simply as I thought the issue was.
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1242.665,1244.767,"--That wasn't State law in fact, Your Honor."
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1260.193,1268.633,So what you are disagreeing with is the Third Circuit's conclusion of what the status of Pennsylvania law was?
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1268.633,1279.072,"Well, that would have been clearer, I think, if we were appealing from the Doctor decision here now rather than from this decision, but I think that there is at the very least a great degree of unclarity in exactly what the--"
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1279.072,1292.348,"Well, Doctor dealt with what will the court do with respect to, not post-verdict motions, but with respect to appeals that are raised before or after flight."
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1292.348,1294.883,--That is what Doctor said was a distinction in State law.
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1294.883,1295.833,And that's what Doctor said?
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1295.833,1297.083,Doctor said that.
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1298.785,1318.579,"So now the only other -- Kindler now raises a new question: What are we going to do -- according to the courts below, what are we going to do with post-verdict motions to reinstate and to appeals that result after flight and after waiver; correct?"
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1318.579,1321.631,"In fact, not a new question at all under State law, Your Honor."
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1324.5,1330.804,That's where the disagreement lies: Did the Third Circuit get Pennsylvania law wrong on this issue.
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1330.804,1337.16,--I think that's at least where the disagreement lie -- lay between the Commonwealth and Kindler below.
2009.08-992,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1338.16,1338.593,All right.
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1343.564,1356.055,"--Then the question becomes, Your Honor, whether the alleged discrepancy, difference in the State law or -- or degree of unclarity is sufficient to meet this Court's adequacy test."
2009.08-992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1426.051,1428.284,May I ask one question before your time is gone?
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1439.442,1443.429,"--No, Your Honor, and I think that that's an excellent example of what I was just saying."
2009.08-992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.718,1459.105,But wasn't there -- wasn't there a general rule that capital defendants always get one shot at their constitutional issues?
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1459.105,1459.805,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1476.416,1486.172,But were there Pennsylvania cases in which they had prevented a capital defendant from raising a Federal constitutional issue for the first time?
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1486.172,1486.622,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.826,1492.843,How about other rules?
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1502.282,1505.484,"--At that time, I think they had not yet, but really, there are only a handful of--"
2009.08-992,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.484,1507.451,So then how can you have a firmly established rule?
2009.08-992,0,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,1507.451,1523.96,"--I don't think you have a firmly established rule, Your Honor, because you have -- the firmly established rule was the preexisting rule requiring preservation of error claims, in the same way that under the Federal plain error rule the rule is you have to preserve your claims."
2009.08-992,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1546.609,1548.342,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1554.932,1565.387,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I first want to address what is really at stake here."
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1581.665,1584.284,"Well, but that's because he escaped."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1596.009,1606.364,"Well, the question is, was there a firmly established and consistently applied State rule that would result in all of his claims being taken away."
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1606.364,1618.772,"And you think that -- and you don't think -- you think you can argue that a State rule saying, look, if you escape and flee the jurisdiction, you bar -- your claims cannot be adequate and independent?"
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1618.772,1621.057,"No, I don't think that, Your Honor."
2009.08-992,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1650.559,1652.242,What rules -- I'm--
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1652.242,1653.375,"Well, it's really--"
2009.08-992,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1653.375,1657.629,--What is -- what is your position as to what the Third Circuit was saying or holding?
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1677.542,1682.344,"--Well -- well, to begin with, what we're saying is that--"
2009.08-992,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1682.344,1685.38,It's not what you are saying.
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1687.565,1694.569,--What -- what I would suggest the Third Circuit said is that this case is very like Doctor.
2009.08-992,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1765.812,1767.247,What was the change--
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1767.247,1768.614,The change--
2009.08-992,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1768.614,1770.616,--that you think the Third Circuit was identifying?
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1770.616,1784.958,"--The change that the Third Circuit identified was from a -- a situation where there was complete discretion -- and really more often than not, even in noncapital cases, the discretion was exercised to hear the issues."
2009.08-992,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1800.302,1818.763,"Let's assume that a lower court in this case had said: You know, we have discretion, but we're not going to exercise it because you escaped twice and were away much longer than most fugitives."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1852.437,1854.887,--That the Third Circuit would have said that?
2009.08-992,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1854.887,1855.555,--Yeah.
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1855.555,1861.458,It's a very -- it's a very different case.
2009.08-992,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1862.292,1862.858,"Sure, it is."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1882.289,1882.872,--No.
2009.08-992,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1882.872,1884.306,Because that's the question presented.
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1884.306,1885.924,That's not the point that we are arguing.
2009.08-992,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1892.228,1898.899,"Well, that begs your adversary's question, which is every case has one or more differences in it."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1912.225,1918.462,--There -- there are several things that are important in this kind of situation.
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1952.682,1966.776,"Counsel, following up on that, I'd like your answer to this question: Is a State procedural rule automatically inadequate and, therefore, unenforceable when the State rule is discretionary rather than mandatory?"
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1968.042,1970.144,"No, it is not automatically inadequate."
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1970.144,1970.978,So you agree--
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1970.978,1971.68,It's not our position--
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1971.68,1974.982,--So you agree with the Petitioner's response to that question?
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1981.801,1984.32,--And we don't think that the -- that the Third Circuit said--
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1984.32,1990.474,"Well, but that was the same -- that was the position you took in your opposition to certiorari."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1990.474,1991.224,--Correct.
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1991.224,1993.843,And yet we nonetheless granted -- granted cert.--
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,1993.843,1994.693,Correct.
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1994.693,2014.273,"--Well, if some of us -- or I suppose if several of us -- think that that may have been or was what the Third Circuit said, would you have any objection to us vacating the opinion, explaining since you both agree that the rule is not automatically inadequate, make sure they understand that, and then they can proceed however they see fit?"
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2014.273,2016.375,"I would have no objection to that, Your Honor."
2009.08-992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2016.375,2036.372,"Insofar as the ongoing rule is concerned, let's assume that as of the time of Doctor, which was a Third Circuit case, 1996, the Pennsylvania rule was then clear, Pennsylvania for the first time having made its rule clear."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2074.663,2085.602,"Well, part of the problem here is that -- that Pennsylvania law and what the Pennsylvania rule is was a moving target throughout this time period."
2009.08-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.216,2119.287,"Well, that may be, but where -- where do you get that from the opinion of the court of appeals here?"
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2141.319,2157.245,"Well, I -- I would -- I would acknowledge that it's a bit cryptic, but I think because the Third Circuit in Kindler said that Doctor is what's controlling in its analysis, I think you really have to read it in light of Doctor."
2009.08-992,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2165.018,2181.73,"So they are going to say, I imagine below -- I'm not sure -- say: Look, that's right, and Doctor talked about the shift from mandatory to discretionary, and the district court -- the State, in Doctor, said that it was a mandatory -- it's mandatory."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2195.387,2207.261,"Well, actually our client didn't get the benefit of a number of things that were clearly established law in Pennsylvania at the time."
2009.08-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2218.153,2218.653,"Well, that's -- that's a different issue."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2265.384,2281.993,"--Well, it's not even clear, really, what -- what the trial court was applying, but I think that there are -- there are a number of serious problems with -- with the consistent application in this case."
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2303.573,2304.009,Right.
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2330.492,2334.544,I -- I lost your train of thought there.
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2335.21,2338.312,"Maybe I did, too."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2338.629,2339.079,No.
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2339.514,2344.816,But the point is you are arguing about the application -- the exercise of discretion.
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2351.155,2353.671,--That's -- that's part of what I'm arguing.
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2354.055,2361.861,So you are not arguing -- which would be very odd to argue -- that the discretion always makes the rule invalid because you--
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2361.861,2362.277,No.
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2363.379,2363.963,--Okay.
2009.08-992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2363.963,2372.319,"Do I -- Do I take it that -- that Justice -- Justice Breyer's question, repeated by Justice Scalia -- just take that fact, that's the only question before us."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2377.621,2378.139,Uh-huh.
2009.08-992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2378.139,2379.406,Then your client isn't hurt?
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2381.591,2393.564,"No, he is hurt if it is now mandatory, yes, because -- because it's -- it's like -- it's like Ford or any of the other cases where -- where the rules are being changed."
2009.08-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.564,2396.85,If -- if the new rule was applied to him.
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2396.85,2397.35,Yes.
2009.08-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2397.35,2400.302,But the point is the new rule wasn't applied to him.
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2404.52,2406.122,"Well, yes--"
2009.08-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.122,2408.241,"That's clear from the trial court's opinion, isn't it?"
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2408.241,2408.641,--Okay.
2009.08-992,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2445.931,2448.549,By whom?
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2448.549,2451.485,By any -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-992,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2452.268,2452.77,"No, no."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2461.107,2462.376,--It applies at all levels.
2009.08-992,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2462.376,2463.459,At all levels.
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2480.387,2490.026,The -- the State courts simply did not apply relaxed waiver to Mr. Kindler.
2009.08-992,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2490.026,2493.062,"None of them, including the trial court?"
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2493.062,2495.264,"Including -- including the trial court, yes."
2009.08-992,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2542.724,2545.076,"By the trial court and by us, is that what you're--"
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2545.076,2546.612,"--Yes, yes."
2009.08-992,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2546.612,2548.495,How would you fill in this sentence?
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2574.346,2574.98,Right.
2009.08-992,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2574.98,2589.955,"Now, next sentence, which maybe would never be written: This is not to say that discretion automatically means it's adequate, for it could be applied inconsistently."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2635.17,2646.109,"Well, I would -- I would actually direct you to Judge Harlan's opinion in Sullivan, where he says:"
2009.08-992,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2657.234,2674.045,"But, but, but, but, but, a trial Supreme Court -- a Supreme Court in a State is supervising lots of trial courts, and you will have different human beings sitting there as judges, and they will inevitably be inconsistent with each other to some degree."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2676.33,2677.513,--Certainly.
2009.08-992,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2678.347,2682.901,So is there anything we can say that will improve the situation?
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2685.869,2701.279,"Well, the -- the key is really consistent application and -- and looking to see whether the rules are being turned off and on."
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2728.43,2732.0,"Well, the problem -- Justice Stevens' question brought this up."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2736.802,2741.022,"Well, it's certainly--"
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2741.022,2742.622,Say it's the first one that comes up.
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2742.622,2751.295,"--Well, it would certainly help to give a -- a reasoned explanation of what's happening."
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2753.247,2754.513,"Well, but your reasoned explanation--"
2009.08-992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2754.513,2757.799,--But all -- all those books on our wall are the first time it's ever come up.
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2794.956,2805.312,"--Well, I would -- I certainly would argue that there -- there is every reason to see a potential for the State seeking to avoid Federal review."
2009.08-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2821.34,2824.375,"And they concluded that was ridiculous, so they stopped doing it."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2824.375,2833.648,"But -- but during the time period, during the relevant time period in Mr. Kindler's -- from his escape all the way through his PCRA proceedings, that was the rule."
2009.08-992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2839.885,2841.504,But those weren't escape cases.
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2842.987,2843.587,"Oh, no."
2009.08-992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2843.956,2844.756,"Well, that's the point."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2847.657,2859.798,"Well, but -- but if you want to look at what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court actually said here, they said Mr. Kindler's case is in the category like people who affirmatively waive."
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2871.503,2883.811,--You don't doubt that it would be an independent and adequate State rule to say whenever anybody escapes they waive their claims?
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2883.811,2889.049,"That -- certainly, going forward that's -- that's an adequate rule, yes."
2009.08-992,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2891.566,2897.237,"Well, what's the interest in not applying this in this case?"
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2933.643,2941.349,"--Yes, but the -- the issue here is not solely about notice to Mr. Kindler."
2009.08-992,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2956.093,2962.847,"But you just said that it would be okay to have a rule going forward that if you are a fugitive, you are out."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2962.847,2967.815,--But that -- but that's if it's a firmly established rule that is consistently applied.
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2996.951,2999.436,What is -- what is the Federal fugitive rule?
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,2999.436,3016.148,--The Federal fugitive rule is -- that was set in Ortega-Rodriguez -- says that a flight presentencing does not take away your appellate rights.
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3022.219,3023.219,Has discretion?
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3023.219,3024.436,--It has discretion.
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3042.263,3048.167,Does the discretion that the Pennsylvania courts have here -- is that similar?
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3055.523,3058.575,They -- they certainly could.
2009.08-992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3069.449,3072.984,Were you still answering the Chief Justice's -- I had -- had one more.
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3072.984,3073.551,--No.
2009.08-992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3073.551,3074.834,I didn't mean to interrupt.
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3099.901,3102.336,--conviction review.
2009.08-992,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3102.336,3103.37,--conviction review on all those points.
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3103.37,3108.907,"Well, those were -- those were direct appeal things that they looked at, yes."
2009.08-992,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3135.057,3149.901,"There is a certain irony that the case you're relying on on the merits is Mills, where if he hadn't escaped he would have gone through the whole process before Mills was decided."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3149.901,3152.436,"Well, but he may well have gotten relief anyway."
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3214.509,3217.878,"Well, he got the windfall of being free for eight years, right?"
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3231.619,3234.055,He is in much worse position.
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3242.344,3242.877,"No, no."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3254.568,3257.503,"--Well, there are certainly other things that the State can do."
2009.08-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.942,3267.092,Before or after his execution?
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3268.478,3295.795,"--Well, there -- this -- this Court said in Ortega-Rodriguez that -- that increasing somebody's sentence by a number of years based on escape would introduce an element of arbitrariness and irrationality, and -- and certainly changing the sentence from life to death based on disrespect to the courts seems like a fairly -- a fairly serious consequence."
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3295.795,3298.663,"Well, I'm sorry, if I could just nail down the point."
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3310.471,3317.994,"In -- in Federal court if it's held, as we argue, that the State court rulings were not adequate, that's true."
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3362.671,3363.856,Finish your sentence.
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3363.856,3364.856,There -- okay.
2009.08-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3376.68,3377.73,Can I please--
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3377.73,3378.115,Sure.
2009.08-992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3378.115,3382.317,--Why do you pick 1984 as the time of the escape?
2009.08-992,1,36212,matthew_c_lawry,,3414.706,3418.674,"Well, there -- there is a question about whether that is introducing a novel rule."
2009.08-992,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3428.548,3430.165,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-992,2,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,3433.917,3441.856,"Mr. Lawry's answer to the question about a mandatory forfeiture rule, Your Honors, I think is the crucial one here."
2009.08-992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3515.254,3517.706,What -- what about his -- his colleague who broke out with him?
2009.08-992,2,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,3518.856,3521.642,--That defendant was gone less than two weeks.
2009.08-992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3610.883,3611.568,May I ask--
2009.08-992,2,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,3611.568,3615.437,--or else leaving the defendant better off than he would otherwise have been.
2009.08-992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3615.437,3617.056,--May I ask this question?
2009.08-992,2,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,3639.802,3641.004,"No, Justice Stevens."
2009.08-992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3650.61,3654.312,The guidance you have asked us to give is whether there is this automatic rule.
2009.08-992,2,39153,ronald_eisenberg,,3661.5,3669.321,--I'm afraid it doesn't -- it doesn't help resolve the -- the path to which the Third Circuit got to that point.
2009.08-992,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3696.239,3697.591,"Thank you, counsel."
