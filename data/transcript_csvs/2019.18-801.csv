2019.18-801,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.2,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-801, Peter versus NantKwest. Mr. Stewart."
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,9.2,46.64,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An unsuccessful patent applicant may seek judicial review through either a direct appeal to the Federal Circuit under 35 U.S.C. 141 or a district court suit under Section 145. Section 145 states that an applicant who files suit under that provision must pay all the expenses of the proceeding. The question presented here is whether those expenses include money that the PTO spends to employ lawyers and paralegals who assist with the agency's defense of the suit. For three principal reasons, the answer to that question is yes."
2019.18-801,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,142.08,162.36,"Mr. -- Mr. Stewart, is there any other federal statute that provides for attorneys' fees on the basis of the word ""expenses"" alone? As you know, there are expenses and attorneys' fees, expenses including attorneys' fees."
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,171.08,175.64,"We're not aware of any, unless you include the trademark analogue to this provision."
2019.18-801,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,206.84,219.48,"How -- how about to the losing party? Are there other statutes that provide for fees, attorneys' fees, that are awarded against the prevailing party?"
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,219.48,223.84,"I mean, the -- the only one we're aware -- there are -- there are two categories of those."
2019.18-801,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,253.56,256.96,And it was called it a radical departure to do otherwise?
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,256.96,262.56,"Well, it -- it would be, in the context of ordinary fee-shifting provisions."
2019.18-801,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,362.16,367.0,"Counsel, your -- your interpretation of ""expenses"" includes attorneys' fees, you argue in this case."
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,383.16,386.64,"Well, the statute refers to expenses of the proceeding."
2019.18-801,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,389.04,392.52,"Well, you have -- you had a lawyer here, right, who works for the government anyway."
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,404.16,413.56,"Well, it certainly -- it's certainly true that, for some bookkeeping purposes, when we talk about personnel expenses, we will include what I think is referred to as a fully burdened rate --"
2019.18-801,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,413.56,414.44,Right.
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,414.44,424.04,-- where we're talking not just about the salary but to some additional increments of money that are -- that go along with hiring a --
2019.18-801,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,424.04,430.32,"So nothing, in other words, right? A fully burdened rate would include this other form of overhead that we're talking about, correct?"
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,430.32,434.12,I guess the point I would make is we -- we do that in the application process already.
2019.18-801,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,434.12,434.52,"Oh, okay."
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,435.48,444.72,"We're -- we're doing that in the application process in the sense that we are under a congressional mandate to collect fees that, in the aggregate, are sufficient to cover --"
2019.18-801,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,444.72,446.68,"Well, that's helpful to know that you're already doing this."
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,450.36,450.76,That's right.
2019.18-801,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,450.76,453.2,How did the government just figure this out?
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,453.2,457.2,"Well, I think -- we don't have a good explanation for why we weren't doing it before."
2019.18-801,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,463.12,471.44,"But you would -- you would say that in all the years that you weren't doing it, you were violating the statute because the statute is mandatory?"
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,471.44,474.76,I wouldn't -- I wouldn't say that we were violating the statute.
2019.18-801,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,522.16,530.16,You started by saying that the statutory term expenses unambiguously covers attorneys' fees.
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,552.96,562.48,"Oh, well, the Court has made clear that, even though a relatively clear indication of congressional intent is necessary, there's no magic words requirement."
2019.18-801,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,591.64,596.6,I think that would be true if there weren't some kind of clear statement backdrop to this.
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,602.2,602.44,That's correct.
2019.18-801,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,602.44,602.64,Okay.
2019.18-801,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,603.28,604.44,May I interrupt for a second?
2019.18-801,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,604.44,605.32,Go ahead.
2019.18-801,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,605.32,626.44,"Does that mean you are dropping your argument in your initial brief that the American Rule doesn't apply to this kind of case, because in your reply brief you don't make any mention of that, and here in responding to Justice Kavanaugh's questions and in your first two minutes, you also don't make that argument again, have you effectively dropped that argument so we're now within the American Rule presumption?"
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,626.44,683.08,"We -- we would certainly acknowledge that if this sentence didn't appear in Section 145 at all, we would need -- we would not be able to recoup personnel expenses. Now, the Fourth Circuit held that because the Section 145 mandate applies without regard to the ultimate outcome of the litigation, the American Rule doesn't apply. And we think the Federal Circuit -- the Fourth Circuit was right at least to the extent of saying the absence -- not only the absence of a prevailing party requirement, but the specific mandate that the expenses be paid regardless of the outcome of the proceedings is a good indication that this provision is trying to accomplish something very different from what an ordinary fee shifting provision is intended to accomplish. And so you can conclude on that basis the American Rule doesn't apply or you can conclude this is one of the contextual factors that leads you to the conclusion that personnel expenses are -- are encompassed."
2019.18-801,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,683.08,686.88,Are you -- are you going to send the Respondent a bill for your time today?
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,686.88,687.96,We -- we are not.
2019.18-801,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,785.56,786.2,Mr. Stewart --
2019.18-801,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,786.2,804.36,"I can see the argument, Mr. -- Mr. Stewart, that the word ""expenses"" could include attorneys' fees, but I don't understand the argument that expenses alone must include attorneys' fees."
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,804.36,830.84,"I think the argument -- the argument is simply, as a matter of plain language, no one would doubt that the money paid, excuse me, the money paid to PTO personnel in the course of the suit were part of the expenses that the PTO incurred. And the only question is whether the term expenses, like the term costs, has acquired a status as a legal term of art that has a legal meaning narrower than its common meaning."
2019.18-801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,874.08,875.44,All right.
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,876.92,896.04,"Whereas here, I think NantKwest has really given no guidance as to what it thinks the term ""expenses"" means, other than it doesn't include attorneys' fees, but we can't fault NantKwest for that because there really is no alternative source for determining what the term ""expenses"" means, if not its ordinary meaning."
2019.18-801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,896.04,898.0,How should I deal with this fact.
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,961.6,966.08,"Well, as I say, I think this was an argument that could have been made for an extended period of time."
2019.18-801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,968.12,974.16,I don't know if it could have been made between 1865 and 18 -- and 1990.
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,974.16,974.76,"Well, the -- the --"
2019.18-801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,974.76,979.12,Because during that time it was the Congress that paid these costs.
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,979.12,988.0,"Well -- well, there was still the objective of making the PTO a self-funded agency, an agency whose receipts were equivalent to --"
2019.18-801,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,988.0,988.96,It already is.
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,988.96,989.6,-- its expenses.
2019.18-801,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,989.6,1000.76,"It already is. You're -- you're paying from the fees, meaning the time you're attributing to the attorneys and the paralegals is already being paid."
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1009.0,1015.04,"Well, the -- the PTO is under a congressional mandate to ensure that it's aggregate receipts match up with it's aggregate --"
2019.18-801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1015.04,1015.68,Now.
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1015.68,1016.68,-- expenditures.
2019.18-801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1016.68,1019.28,But was that true between 1865 and 1990?
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1019.28,1019.76,"No, no."
2019.18-801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1020.28,1022.6,"No, it wasn't."
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1035.12,1056.96,"Well, the -- the mandate to pay the, I think it was the whole of the expenses of the proceeding under the original statute, the mandate was there all along and it was part of Congress's objective that the PTO be self-financing. Now, for a prolonged period of time, the way that Congress went about that was that, for the most part, Congress was determining the amount of the fees for particular services."
2019.18-801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1088.0,1090.76,"I look to 1930, for example."
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1100.0,1102.0,It was certainly trying as much as possible to --
2019.18-801,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1102.0,1102.12,Okay.
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1103.56,1105.24,I -- I'm -- I'm not sure whether you would look for -- to that.
2019.18-801,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1126.48,1147.08,"Mr. Stewart, do you dispute the Federal Circuit's estimate that if this cost of the PTO attorneys is spread among all patent applicants, even the ones who don't use 145, that the added cost per applicant would be $1.60?"
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1147.08,1147.32,We don't.
2019.18-801,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1283.24,1291.48,"I think you covered this, but just to confirm, however we rule in this case, will cover -- will affect only two statutory provisions?"
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1291.48,1292.44,That's correct.
2019.18-801,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1310.2,1334.0,"And then in terms of your overall purpose argument, Congress wanted it to be a self-sustaining agency, but what sense does it make to think that Congress wanted the winning party to turn around and pay the government's legal fees, given how unusual that is? Why would Congress have thought to do it that way is, I guess, what I'm asking."
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1334.0,1345.56,I guess the two reasons are Congress -- since the very beginning -- and the first iteration of the statute enacted in 1839 specifically said whether the decision is in its favor or not.
2019.18-801,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1371.28,1376.8,You're saying the costs are obviously a far -- far smaller amount than --
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1376.8,1377.16,They -- they --
2019.18-801,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1377.16,1377.52,-- attorneys' fees?
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1377.52,1378.68,"-- yeah -- that's correct, but the --"
2019.18-801,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1378.68,1380.56,It's unusual but not to the degree?
2019.18-801,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1380.56,1382.36,It doesn't have the same practical effects.
2019.18-801,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1453.64,1463.36,Certainly. Mr. Chu.
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,1463.36,1470.04,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three important considerations."
2019.18-801,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1561.08,1620.16,"Why -- why isn't this just like a filing fee? In other words, the applicant can take the normal appeal to the court of appeals, but if he or she wants to go through the much more elaborate proceeding of trying the case, bringing in new evidence, they have to pay a filing fee? I mean, in some agencies, I don't remember from long ago, the filing fee for a particular proceeding before the ICC was $100,000 because they figured most of the people who are going to be doing this, it's going to be corporations that can afford it, and we're -- you know, they're putting us out to a significant extent. Why -- I gather -- I mean, would it be -- would it be problematic in your case if they said, okay, you can go to district court, but if you're going to do this unusual proceeding, you know, if you have three claims, that's going to be 15,000; if you have six, it is going to be 30,000; or what -- in other words, a significant filing fee for the very purpose of doing what the statute seems to contemplate?"
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,1620.16,1623.0,"First, this is not a filing fee."
2019.18-801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1657.76,1677.96,"Is there any language short of saying explicitly ""attorneys' fees"" that would overcome the American Rule? We're told there are no magic words, but what short of saying ""including attorneys' fees"" or ""and attorneys' fees"" would do?"
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,1677.96,1713.56,"The answer to the question is no, that either the words attorneys' fees, counsel fees, reasonable compensation for services of a lawyer for a bankrupt estate, which was true in the Baker Botts case, there would be words that would be specific and explicit, to refer to Justice Kavanaugh's point, where Baker Botts, this Court made clear, that to have an exception because of a statute under the American Rule, it must be specific and explicit."
2019.18-801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1723.52,1740.6,"Well, I presume that if the Congress wrote a provision that said the pro rata share of all the services of its personnel, that would be enough, because you wouldn't exclude lawyers from that?"
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,1740.6,1765.48,"If Congress had a specific provision that showed it was intending to include lawyers, Congress has the authority to enact such legislation. But as in your exact example, I would say there would still be an ambiguity because of the American Rule."
2019.18-801,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1824.6,1825.72,"But, Mr. Chu --"
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,1825.72,1826.12,-- three years earlier.
2019.18-801,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1826.12,1844.32,"-- are you saying that expenses of the office is not enough to get you lawyers' fees? Suppose it was just expenses of the Patent Office, which would presumably give you the expenses, you know, the -- the -- the costs of personnel."
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,1844.32,1844.56,Yes.
2019.18-801,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1844.72,1846.72,Does that not include lawyers?
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,1846.72,1858.56,"Yes, I am saying under this backdrop of the American Rule, this Court has made clear Congress needs to enact a statute that is specific and explicit."
2019.18-801,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1858.56,1860.72,It basically has to say lawyers?
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,1860.72,1862.44,"Or words to that effect, yes."
2019.18-801,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1862.44,1864.28,"Well, what does words to that effect mean?"
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,1864.28,1870.32,"Counsel, compensation for legal counsel, for advice, whatever."
2019.18-801,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1871.12,1875.8,"Fees? The word ""fees"" alone?"
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,1875.8,1901.2,"I do not believe the word fees alone would cover it, because fees can refer to many, many other things, docket fees, marshal fees, filing fees, fees of other personnel, perhaps, but not attorneys' fees. If there is an ambiguity under the American Rule, this Court has repeatedly made clear it must be ""specific and explicit."""
2019.18-801,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1901.2,1910.32,What -- what expenses in your view does Section 145 impose on the person who invokes that proceeding?
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,1910.32,1934.72,"Travel expenses, lodging expenses, parking expenses, expenses with respect to court reporters, printing expenses, marshal fees, docket fees, court interpreters. That's not an exhaustive list but it does not include attorneys' fees."
2019.18-801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1934.72,1935.04,Is it --
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1935.04,1935.6,Are experts?
2019.18-801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1935.6,1936.92,I'm sorry.
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1936.92,1939.72,Experts?
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,1939.72,1959.4,"I do not think it should include expert witness fees, whether they are internal experts or external experts, but I want to note for the Court in this particular instance, for practical reasons, NantKwest did not challenge the government's request for expert witness fees and they were paid."
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1959.4,1970.44,"Well, that's -- see, then you put your finger on, yes, the American Rule, yes, yes, yes, but you have a special kind of case."
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2017.12,2019.04,Yes.
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2019.04,2020.48,I know what you're going to say.
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2021.84,2023.24,And I'm the one who's puzzled by it.
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2023.24,2025.68,If I -- if I look puzzled -- I would like --
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2025.68,2026.84,You don't look puzzled.
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2026.84,2028.36,-- to withdraw my puzzled look.
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2028.36,2029.92,I'm the one who is puzzled by it.
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2029.92,2045.28,"But I will say that in every case where a party wanted attorneys' fees under a statute, this Court has always applied the American Rule."
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.28,2045.6,"Yeah, I know."
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2045.6,2062.92,"Either the general rule, each party bears their own attorneys' fees, or the part of the American Rule that says if there's a specific and explicit statutory exception, that can apply. And the government points to no exception."
2019.18-801,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2072.6,2073.04,"Well, as you --"
2019.18-801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2073.04,2074.8,And which leaves -- I'm sorry.
2019.18-801,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2074.8,2098.04,"As you just said, in the typical American Rule case, the rule is each party to the case bears its own expenses, but that's not the situation here, is it? It's a question of whether you pay or other people who are not involved in this litigation at all pay. And maybe it is only going to be $1.60, but still other people are paying this expenses."
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2101.76,2105.48,I would state the rule differently than Your Honor.
2019.18-801,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2116.16,2118.52,"Well, let me -- let me ask something that's related."
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2130.88,2153.88,"If we were Congress -- and we're not -- Congress could decide what it thinks is fair or wise or good public policy. But as this Court has said in Alyeska, and Baker and Botts, no matter how good that policy might be, this Court does not have the roving authority to make those decisions."
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2155.96,2156.52,Well -
2019.18-801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2156.52,2157.0,Could you --
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2157.0,2158.2,Go ahead.
2019.18-801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2158.2,2166.48,Could you tell me what the difference is between expenses and cost? We have a whole statutory system of costs.
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2166.48,2167.24,Yes.
2019.18-801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2167.24,2175.16,I believe some of the items that you mentioned earlier as being expenses are not covered under the traditional sense.
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2178.76,2179.24,Yes.
2019.18-801,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2179.24,2180.6,As you understand it.
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2180.6,2180.96,Yes.
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2262.12,2267.8,"Is -- is -- this you might have looked up, and it -- it might help me actually and help you -- or not."
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2292.32,2293.36,We found no case --
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2293.36,2294.24,Nothing on that?
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2294.24,2302.36,"-- no case, no instance where an agency has done anything like that, even for considerably shorter periods of time."
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2302.36,2317.4,"Or did you find some in a shorter period of time and the court said we're going to follow your habit; we're not going to follow going into a deep -- deep, difficult statutory analysis with an old statute? It's good enough for you; it's good enough for us."
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2319.56,2329.88,"Not for any period of time. I can give you an example, but it's a relatively short period of time. This case -- this Court decided the Adams Fruit case."
2019.18-801,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2406.2,2439.8,"Picking up on -- on Justice Breyer's question, if you have a situation where there's a statute and it's pretty evident -- and certain parties, here it would be the PTO, for some period of time do not advance an interpretation of the statute that would benefit them, and a period of time passes, should we adopt a rule that that's strong evidence of what the statute means, that it doesn't mean the thing that -- the interpretation that would have benefited these parties that failed to take advantage of it?"
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2439.8,2452.04,"I would say yes, in the following sense: The beginning part of statutory interpretation is always plain and ordinary meaning of the language on the date of enactment."
2019.18-801,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2478.24,2486.6,"Just in ordinary English, though, ""expenses"" would encompass attorneys' fees, wouldn't it? That's Mr. Stewart's point to the contrary."
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2486.6,2535.88,"It might or might not, but it would ignore the American Rule for 200 years, ignore the consistent case law of this Court always applying the American Rule, including applying the American Rule when in the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, the unsuccessful petitioner, under that Act of Congress, could be awarded attorneys' fees. Although this Court didn't use the words ""American Rule,"" the government's reply brief, I believe at page 18, I would say takes the position in the reply brief different from earlier positions and says, in effect, this Court was applying the American Rule."
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2535.88,2542.56,"Is -- you probably, I'm just looking at your resume here, have experience in this patent area."
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2544.12,2544.72,Yes.
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2544.72,2545.64,Okay.
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2587.72,2630.96,"I can think of no instance by my personal experience or through reading or otherwise where a contract would say you bring this up and you pay for the whole thing, no matter what, including attorneys' fees. But there certainly are agreements that are silent on attorneys' fees in recognition of the American Rule, or that expressly say attorneys' fees may be shifted under certain circumstances, or expressly say not at all. I would say what's interesting here is that Congress in 1952 first enacted what we now know as Section 285 of the Patent Act."
2019.18-801,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2805.8,2817.12,I suppose a difference there is -- and maybe there is -- but I gather in those situations there weren't alternative proceedings that you could go through.
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2817.12,2821.96,I do not know before the statutes whether there were or were not alternative proceedings.
2019.18-801,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2834.24,2842.8,"Yeah, I suspect -- I don't want to preempt him, but I suspect Mr. Stewart will say don't worry about those, because those are different."
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2855.6,2857.16,"Well, that is their argument."
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2866.08,2882.64,"In 1839 -- you've gone to a lot of work here, but in 1839, say 1840 to 1865, they did have a fund where the patentees paid all the expenses, et cetera."
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2898.64,2898.8,No.
2019.18-801,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2898.8,2899.44,No.
2019.18-801,1,63168,morgan_chu,,2900.36,2908.36,I thank the Court very much.
2019.18-801,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2908.36,2912.2,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart, you have six minutes remaining."
2019.18-801,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2912.2,2934.2,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I mean, there were -- there were various questions concerning the legal significance of the PTO's, and formerly the Patent Office's, failure to take this position over an extended period of time. And there is no question this is an atmospherically unhelpful point for us, but I -- I -- (Laughter.)"
2019.18-801,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2934.2,2968.88,"I -- I don't think that it fits in any established doctrinal category, that is, there are cases in which the Court has said when you have a body of court of appeals precedent that adopts a particular interpretation of a particular term, and then Congress reenacts the provision without changing that term, then Congress can be supposed to have acquiesced in or ratified the -- the prior judicial interpretation. We don't have anything like that here. We don't have a body of lower court case law saying that the term expenses doesn't include personnel expenses."
2019.18-801,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2968.88,2976.8,You do have that interpretation through action by the agency itself over the period of 190 years or something.
2019.18-801,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2976.8,2988.08,"I mean, you could -- you could say at the most that a -- a view that these expenses were not recoverable is implicit in what the PTO has done or not done."
2019.18-801,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3000.56,3013.12,"But we do have a doctrine, the American Rule, that says that unless a clear statement of attorneys' fees is encompassed, we won't impose them."
2019.18-801,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3022.6,3022.96,Okay.
2019.18-801,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3055.76,3070.2,"What about your -- I know this is slightly frivolous, but, I mean, we say we finally figured out what Justinian meant by this particular thing, a thousand years ago. Do you see the --"
2019.18-801,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3070.2,3074.08,"I -- I -- I see the point, but, you know, the Court -- the Court --"
2019.18-801,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3074.08,3079.32,Can you share it with the rest of us? (Laughter.)
2019.18-801,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3079.32,3119.68,"The -- the -- the Court has said in cases like United States versus Fausto that the implications of existing statutory provisions may be clarified by newly-enacted provisions, and the PTO has examined this matter afresh in light of the totality of the statutory scheme. And the last thing I would want to say, and it's in -- in part a continuation of the point I was making earlier about the Section 145 suit being, in a very meaningful sense, in a legal sense, a continuation of the examination process. Up to this point, Congress has directed the PTO to ensure that its aggregate intake equals its aggregate expenses."
2019.18-801,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3225.32,3229.0,I think this goes back to a question that you got at the very beginning.
2019.18-801,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3237.96,3241.04,"I mean, sometimes we have charged for travel expenses."
2019.18-801,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3277.76,3278.92,"Thank you, counsel."
