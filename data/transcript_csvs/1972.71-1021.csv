1972.71-1021,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.092,"We’ll hear arguments next in 71-1021, Employees against to the Department of Public Health and Welfare."
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1396.483,1400.757,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.206,1583.062,"But the function really is, whether you can reasonably say the state has waived, isn’t that the basic question?"
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1583.062,1585.246,I -- we don’t regard Parden --
1972.71-1021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1585.246,1586.436,What Parden is all about?
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1586.436,1589.571,"Well, the dissent said that it was a waiver."
1972.71-1021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.579,1600.476,"And if you want to do this, you have to do that so --"
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1600.476,1625.547,"Congress has undertaken to regulate the activities in this field rather perform by a state or by a business and to undertake them evenhandedly it has notified the state that if they continue to engage in this activity, they are subject to the same federal regulation of that -- of the business enterprises also engaging in this activity are subject to."
1972.71-1021,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1633.116,1638.053,That’s what’s all about it where there is consented -- it is said to have consented to suit in a federal court?
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1638.053,1642.503,"That is correct Your Honor, by engaging in the activity."
1972.71-1021,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1713.525,1721.92,"Mr. Wallace, would you say that Parden is basically a constitutional holding?"
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1721.92,1737.389,The Court was unanimously of the view in Parden that Congress had the constitutional power to impose in effect this constructive consent under States activity that was divided five to four on whether Congress had in fact done so.
1972.71-1021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1784.679,1790.508,The remedies in suit by the Secretary or what and injunction he can enjoin --
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1790.508,1791.371,He can enjoin --
1972.71-1021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1791.371,1794.417,"And he can get a recovery of the single wages, is that it?"
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1794.417,1802.019,Of the single wages without interest and without consequential damages of any kind.
1972.71-1021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1809.381,1811.839,"Double recovery plus interest, plus attorney’s fees?"
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1811.839,1813.758,"It’s not plus interest, Your Honor."
1972.71-1021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1813.758,1814.122,Plus attorney’s fees?
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1814.122,1818.215,It is in lieu of interest and in lieu of consequential damages --
1972.71-1021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1818.215,1819.96,And plus attorney’s fees?
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1819.96,1824.864,"Plus attorney’s fees, otherwise, many of these suits I doubt would be in Court."
1972.71-1021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1824.864,1825.054,Right.
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1825.054,1826.21,Because many of them are relatively smart --
1972.71-1021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1826.21,1827.367,"Well, I understand the argument."
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1838.093,1839.716,That is correct.
1972.71-1021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1879.886,1883.565,What happens when Secretary recovers money?
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1887.338,1890.656,"That is turned over to the employee the recovery, yes."
1972.71-1021,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1890.656,1891.837,With just that much?
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1891.837,1896.973,"Just that much, just the amount of the withheld wages."
1972.71-1021,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2049.592,2061.826,Would that -- that means you’re telling us that the operation of a mental hospital or a university by the States is unfair competition against private universities and private hospitals?
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2061.826,2064.085,"Well, this was the view Congress took."
1972.71-1021,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2064.963,2066.956,If you think that was --
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2066.956,2098.873,I think there is a rational basis for concluding that in many instances they are competing with privately run instances they are competing with privately-run enterprises and Congress spell was unfair for the privately-run enterprise to have to comply with the provisions in the Fair Labor Standard Act and to have competing services made available by state institutions at lower clause to uses of those services partly because low paid non-professional personnel are being paid substandard wages.
1972.71-1021,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2267.293,2276.713,But how much exactly of vast bureaucracy would you need if you allocated this enforcement just with respect to the States?
1972.71-1021,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2276.713,2296.006,"Well, of the covered employees to 2.7 million of them are in these covered state institutions and this involves 118,000 such institutions, so it’s a substantial part."
1972.71-1021,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2398.311,2400.497,Very well.
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2403.418,2409.444,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1021,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2488.383,2493.446,You -- do I understand that you concede that an action such as this could be brought in a state court?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2493.446,2498.016,"No, Your Honor, I am saying that that question is not presented by this case."
1972.71-1021,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2517.862,2534.513,And you do concede I would or do you that so far as the Federal Constitution goals with its protection of state sovereign immunity that protection extends only to federal court actions?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2534.513,2534.749,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1021,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2534.749,2540.513,Certainly the terms of the Eleventh Amendment talked in terms of extending the power in federal courts.
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2540.513,2546.737,Whether we speak in terms of the Eleventh Amendment or the basic constitutional principle recognized in the Hans case --
1972.71-1021,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2546.737,2547.349,Hans against Louisiana.
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2547.349,2549.354,That was not the Eleventh Amendment.
1972.71-1021,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2551.328,2556.012,Federal courts.
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2556.012,2572.935,What is at issue is one narrow question that is whether the remedies provided that private employer by 16 (b) were intended by Congress to be available to such employees against the State of Missouri.
1972.71-1021,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2574.562,2578.957,Will you concede the right then that say but you challenge the remedy?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2578.957,2581.163,"That’s precisely it, Your Honor."
1972.71-1021,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2605.763,2610.25,"So you say, the only issue then is where the Congress required Missouri to waive?"
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2610.25,2611.075,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1021,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2658.144,2672.559,We’ll resume right there after lunch.[Noon Recess]
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2674.796,2683.133,"Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, we were discussing the four remedies that Congress has provided under the Fair Labor Standards Act."
1972.71-1021,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2701.72,2704.523,And he can do that only on requests?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2704.523,2708.812,This is a suit under 16 (c).
1972.71-1021,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2775.579,2777.383,We’re talking here only about 16 (c)?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2777.383,2791.836,Only 16 (c) and this is the only situation where the employer is required to pay more than has been withheld illegally.
1972.71-1021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2933.823,2936.383,How does that argument survive Parden?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2936.383,2945.226,"Well, Parden, Section 56 of the FELA specifically allowed the employee to maintain an action in the federal courts."
1972.71-1021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.406,2951.849,That is expressly an congressional intent that is not present in this case?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2951.849,2953.405,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.408,2962.531,"Now, but that the 16 (c) permit the employee to suit?"
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2962.531,2969.341,In the court of competent jurisdiction and the federal courts here are not courts of competent jurisdiction.
1972.71-1021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2969.341,2970.253,Unless --
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2970.253,2970.471,The State --
1972.71-1021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2970.471,2971.763,Unless they are otherwise competent?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2971.763,2974.763,Unless the State has consented to suit.
1972.71-1021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2985.549,2991.411,But isn’t it true that without that the employees are practically without remedy?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,2991.411,3001.681,I don’t think that this is certainly the situation in Missouri as our brief indicates the Secretary of Labor has filed an action under Section 17 against the State of Missouri.
1972.71-1021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3013.311,3017.953,But that’s not the Congress’ action as I understand it.
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3025.032,3033.681,"To have future enforcement, although the Court declined an injunction and to recover past unpaid compensation."
1972.71-1021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3033.681,3036.972,That was the purpose of 6 (c)?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3040.082,3046.988,The purpose of Section 16 (b) was to permit private actions by the employees.
1972.71-1021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3048.671,3054.392,"Well, isn’t that just as valid if the State is or as a private person?"
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3054.392,3055.086,Pardon me?
1972.71-1021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3055.086,3065.268,Isn’t that just as valid to protect the employee of a State as it is necessary to protect the employee of a private employer?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3065.268,3072.341,"Well, except that there has been a traditional principle that the states are immune from suit in the federal courts and --"
1972.71-1021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3072.341,3075.389,But why did Congress leave it there?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3081.439,3084.15,"Well, because it would have application."
1972.71-1021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3087.909,3093.831,"Well, I thought I was -- well, which ever Section involved allows the private employee."
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3094.859,3096.176,That’s 16 (b).
1972.71-1021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3096.176,3097.064,That’s what I thought.
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3115.469,3116.443,I don’t know.
1972.71-1021,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3147.842,3150.929,But then there’s no need to bring the State under the Act?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3150.929,3153.103,Competitive advantage.
1972.71-1021,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3197.792,3213.966,"The Solicitor General’s brief I think and the argument indicated that about 95% of all the employees covered with the Act are private, truly private employees, and perhaps 4-5% more or less are public."
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3215.764,3218.997,I would think that would be a reasonable estimate.
1972.71-1021,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3219.858,3240.177,"In your point of view, the only thing supporting the -- govern the Solicitor General’s view and his friend is that it’s more convenient to let the private -- the employee sue in a private suit rather than have the Secretary sue for them?"
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3240.177,3260.67,That appears to be the Solicitor General’s argument and I thought he advanced to a rather novel proposition which was because of the limited staff available in the Solicitor of Labor’s Office that Congress must not have intended that would be the sole vehicle by which the Act could be enforced against the State.
1972.71-1021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3493.826,3503.71,Would you make that argument if there was a suit brought under the Act in the State Court?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3503.71,3506.429,"I would consider making that argument, I don’t know."
1972.71-1021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3506.429,3508.339,It would be very difficult for you to do so?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3508.339,3515.631,It would be very difficult to argue that if the State Court had jurisdiction that the provisions of the Act did not apply.
1972.71-1021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3515.631,3516.785,Yes.
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3516.785,3519.898,"And as I mentioned earlier, I am not necessarily conceding that the --"
1972.71-1021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3519.898,3526.559,So really -- your argument really is should be whether the Congress intended to make the remedy available in the federal court?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3526.559,3528.588,"That’s -- well, the argument -- yes, it would be --"
1972.71-1021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3528.588,3530.089,Rather than et al.
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3530.089,3549.586,"This goes to -- the fact that there are the double damages, I think, goes to the intent of the Congress and I think that when you have an extreme remedy of that nature, that it certainly raises a question as to whether Congress intended that that type of remedy would be available against the State."
1972.71-1021,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3549.586,3552.947,"Well, what does that -- enlighten me on this."
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3557.759,3558.949,"Well, the Parden case --"
1972.71-1021,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3558.949,3559.686,Eleventh Amendment is --
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3559.686,3562.931,It’s whether the Congress intended that the State waive its immunity.
1972.71-1021,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3562.931,3573.464,"Well, but you’ve indicated or at least I thought you had that you would not have this defense that you’re arguing to a suit in the state court."
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3573.464,3575.131,Yes.
1972.71-1021,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3575.131,3581.269,How could they recover double damages in all of the statutory remedies in the state court?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3581.269,3584.713,"They will certainly be in a position to argue that they could, and we would be --"
1972.71-1021,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3584.713,3591.292,Is there anything in the Act that indicates that you wouldn’t get the same remedy in the state court as in the federal court?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3591.292,3592.96,"No, there isn’t."
1972.71-1021,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3592.96,3595.832,"So, you’re really just arguing the forum, aren’t you?"
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3595.832,3608.994,I am arguing the forum and I think in view of the remedy there is -- it certainly raises the question as to whether Congress intended that the forum be available.
1972.71-1021,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3608.994,3616.777,"Well as I understood you General Blackmar, you haven’t conceded, however, that this kind of suit could be part of the state court."
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3618.849,3623.736,"Yes, I have to try to limit it to that question."
1972.71-1021,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3666.955,3669.724,"No, but that Act, that Act permit suit in the state court?"
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3669.724,3680.812,"It permits suits in state court as well as federal court and expressly and expressly -- expressly says to either court this Act, Your Honors, only says a court of competent jurisdiction."
1972.71-1021,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3680.812,3694.712,"Well, that certainly doesn’t give any intimations of excluding state courts --, state courts being courts of general jurisdiction. I thought earlier under your argument you have virtually conceded that not in this last colloquy but --"
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3694.712,3695.45,"Well, I’ve considered --"
1972.71-1021,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3695.45,3695.734,"Well, what?"
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3695.734,3698.526,-- that the State of Missouri -- I do not believe the question is before the Court.
1972.71-1021,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3698.526,3699.652,"Well, I know. I know, of course."
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3699.652,3701.105,But I would say --
1972.71-1021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3701.105,3703.087,"Well, don’t we?"
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3703.087,3716.666,That is a difficult question and that Missouri placed on several cases would be hard-pressed to argue that the state court cannot or did not have jurisdiction to hear the action.
1972.71-1021,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3716.666,3724.896,"Mr. Blackmar, Am I right in taking that there might be two separate inquiries as to whether a suit like this might be entertained in the state courts of Missouri."
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3737.384,3738.125,"Right, it would be right."
1972.71-1021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3743.455,3754.186,May I ask you -- is there a form of Missouri for employees to stay in suit for back pay? Let’s assume there is -- has Missouri waived its own sovereign immunity with its own?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3754.186,3764.609,"Missouri historically has been very, very reluctant to yield one bit of its sovereign immunity. Now, there is a fairly recent case involving a state contract where the court --"
1972.71-1021,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3764.609,3769.366,Is this judicial -- almost an entirely judicial constructed Missouri or is it statutory?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3769.366,3771.063,"No, it is basically judicial."
1972.71-1021,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3780.68,3787.865,I suppose you could therefore make the argument that a state court would not be a court of competent jurisdiction?
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3787.865,3788.367,"Well, --"
1972.71-1021,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3788.367,3790.838,But in any event you have pointed out at the outset that [Voice Overlap].
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3790.838,3795.642,I would hate to leave myself into the position of arguing against the position. I may have to rgue sometime in the state court.
1972.71-1021,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3795.642,3796.598,All right.
1972.71-1021,2,18346,charles_a_blackmar,,3801.814,3823.292,"And finally, the Eighth Circuit didn't consider the alternative remedies that are available which I think really will indicate the Act and certainly have in Missouri. After the Secretary of Labor filed his action in Missouri Legislature for the first time took cognizance of the problem. They appropriated a sum of money which was sufficient to satisfy the judgment."
1972.71-1021,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3997.461,4002.061,Thank you Mr. Blackmar.
