1967.237,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,20.942,"Number 237, Archie Nathaniel Biggers, petitioner versus Tennessee."
1967.237,0,36318,michael_meltsner,,23.136,26.578,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,1598.862,1602.541,"Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court."
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1602.541,1604.988,Mr. Fox?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,1604.988,1615.156,I don't think that I am too much in disagreement with opposing counsel with respect to the facts as shown by record or with respect to what the law is.
1967.237,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1676.138,1679.637,I didn't understand what you said?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,1679.637,1690.421,Mr. Justice Frankfurter in that case said in determining what amounted to due process was a weighing of the good -- of the hurt against the good to be done.
1967.237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1914.884,1916.491,Do you mean like the assailant?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,1916.491,1917.865,"Like the assailant, yes sir."
1967.237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1917.865,1922.988,But what puzzles me about this is she was never able to say anything about the features of any assailant?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,1922.988,1927.887,"Yes, well I think that the record indicates that she did."
1967.237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1927.887,1928.744,That she did?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,1928.744,1939.812,"That she did say something about it and I'm not speaking -- what the printed record said as stated by my opposing counsel but I think from the inferences, we can say that she did say something about him."
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1963.925,1964.997,That's clear in the record?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,1964.997,1969.526,"Yes sir, that's I think no question about it, that's clear in the record."
1967.237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2127.26,2131.55,But how many have testified this to her identification at the trial?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2131.55,2132.638,How many?
1967.237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.638,2134.578,Policemen?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2134.578,2137.085,"If the Court please, I can't answer it."
1967.237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2142.192,2143.163,Is that all?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2143.163,2145.574,As far as I remember he --
1967.237,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2145.574,2152.276,I thought we were told that four police officers testified to what happened at the identification?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2152.276,2154.25,"If the Court please, I really don't know."
1967.237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.436,2160.981,Isn't that in the record?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2162.51,2164.969,"Yes sir, we got the full trial record and I --"
1967.237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2164.969,2165.62,"Well, that's alright."
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2165.62,2167.724,And I think I can find out.
1967.237,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2261.783,2267.963,Do you think this procedure was preferable to a lineup then?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2291.442,2296.751,"No sir, I think he had been, it would have been more protective if he had been placed in lineup at counsel parade."
1967.237,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2296.751,2298.159,But why didn't they put him in lineup?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2298.159,2299.27,Sorry.
1967.237,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2299.27,2302.258,Is there any reason in the record here why they didn't put him in line?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2302.258,2313.888,"No sir, I don't think so, but I think the inference is that she had been down to the -- Ms. Beamer had been down police headquarters so many times, she had looked at so many people."
1967.237,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2332.194,2337.813,"Does this record show that she was confronted by anybody else, any other suspect?"
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2337.813,2344.291,This record shows that she was asked to identify several different people as --
1967.237,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2344.291,2355.694,Does it show that she was confronted by several different people or show -- or does it -- or may have not been that she was shown that pictures?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2355.694,2360.512,"If the Court please, I don't -- I'm not sure I understand you but she was shown 30, 40 different pictures to identify."
1967.237,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2360.512,2364.835,"No, and I'm asking you whether she was shown other living people --"
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2364.835,2365.252,Yes sir.
1967.237,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2365.252,2365.587,-- other than this 16 year old boy?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2365.587,2373.294,"Yes, the record says several, the record says several, it doesn't say how many, or at what periods of time, or the regularity, or anything."
1967.237,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2386.357,2389.735,Isn't the lineup customarily used in Nashville?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2389.735,2398.861,"I would think so if the Court please, but I don't know the record doesn't indicate whether it is or not, I would think so."
1967.237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.144,2426.336,"Mr. Fox in this connection I see on page, maybe you can help me out, on page 24, 25 of the record this is on cross-examination --"
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2426.336,2426.898,Yes.
1967.237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.898,2429.139,-- of Mrs. Beamer.
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2445.583,2446.596,"Yes, sir."
1967.237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2451.942,2457.692,"Well, I know but this one is, this one is a, I can't find any antecedents to this at all --"
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2457.692,2458.503,"Yes, well."
1967.237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.503,2462.069,-- and that was the second time you were allowed to see him.
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2462.069,2466.202,"Yes sir, well the record show -- now this is the first time he had been to police headquarters."
1967.237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2466.202,2467.966,This is the first time she had ever --
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2467.966,2469.653,This is the first time she--
1967.237,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.653,2471.164,This is the first time she had been asked.
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2471.164,2484.418,"Yes sir, yes and I think her testimony is a little confusing, maybe she didn't understand the question or there's good bit, this was a pretty heated tried lawsuit and there's lots of controversy, and I don't think she understood."
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2668.587,2675.381,"Mr. Fox may I ask if he was arrested for another rape, was he is not?"
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2675.381,2678.238,"Yes, yes."
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2678.238,2680.107,Whatever happened to that case?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2680.107,2694.148,"Court please, the record doesn't show, and some argument made at one time about whether or not he was got propelled over from the juvenile court over to the criminal court, but that's not no longer in the case so far as I understand and--"
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2694.148,2697.432,"Is he charged, is a he charged now with that other rape?"
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2697.432,2704.872,"I think Your Honor please, I know from read or at least I read in the newspaper that there was other charges of this type pending against him."
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2710.71,2712.322,Do you know whether they were dismissed --
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2712.322,2712.99,"No sir, no sir I--"
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2712.99,2714.753,-- Or the charge is still pending --
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2714.753,2715.758,I do not know.
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2727.92,2732.116,Is there anything in this record about that case at all?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2732.116,2734.343,"Not very much, it's a little--"
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2734.343,2734.835,What is it?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2734.835,2743.468,"Alright, I don't think that -- the trial judge was trying desperately to keep out any information about the other rapes."
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2776.393,2780.784,"Well, that would probably have some effect on the jury, wouldn't it?"
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2780.784,2781.968,Yes if it got --
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2781.968,2785.924,"If he was arrested for another rape before, he was arrested here?"
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2785.924,2789.818,"Yes sir, but this was defendant's counsel bringing that out, this one mistake."
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2818.391,2827.14,But you have no information as to whether that was a provable case or whether it's still considered--
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2827.14,2827.799,"No sir, I don't."
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2827.799,2829.177,-- a wide case by the state or not?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2829.177,2831.47,No sir I can't be certain on this record.
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2831.47,2834.078,Is that a charge on his record now?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2834.078,2840.739,"No sir, it ain't dealt in this record and it is still a charge and whether it still a charge against him or not and I don't know."
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2845.85,2855.792,Was there any evidence in this case at all other than the identification of Mrs. Beamer?
1967.237,1,42662,thomas_e_fox,,2855.792,2859.903,"No sir, no, I don't think so."
1967.237,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2947.591,2950.875,Very well.
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,2954.504,2957.468,Just a few points may it please the Court.
1967.237,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.043,3016.115,What -- is your constitutional point that this is a due process question?
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3023.792,3026.888,That is one way I think it could be looked at.
1967.237,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3026.888,3029.276,Well how else do you look at it?
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3046.999,3047.425,That's correct.
1967.237,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3047.425,3050.494,Or it's so unreliable that it can't support a conviction?
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3050.494,3050.97,Correct.
1967.237,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3050.97,3052.972,Slowly built case?
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3052.972,3068.097,"I think that's one way of looking at it, but I think you can also see it through cases like -- well first of all Stovall is the primary authority, but also cases like Turner versus Louisiana and also cases like Napue."
1967.237,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3099.243,3111.16,What did all these five officers – or as many of them have testify to this identification of Mrs. --
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3111.16,3113.673,Were you present in the police station?
1967.237,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3118.395,3120.703,"It was all of them, all of them to --"
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3120.703,3124.228,Correct and objection was made that this was not evidentiary.
1967.237,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3191.395,3205.958,"To what extent was the original arrest for a rape mentioned in this case -- I don't mean his arrest, I mean the arrest for another rape?"
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3205.958,3207.757,This is all outside the record.
1967.237,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3228.34,3232.294,Was there some article in the newspaper you say about that?
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3232.294,3233.433,Yes and --
1967.237,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3233.433,3236.494,That was prior to his trial?
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3236.494,3240.918,That is how the other case was injected by the state before the jury.
1967.237,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3265.404,3268.122,They said so on the voir dire?
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3268.122,3269.0,That's correct.
1967.237,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3274.1,3277.977,"And you don't mean the jurors had, you mean the venire, the members of the --"
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3277.977,3279.374,The members of the sitting panel.
1967.237,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3288.803,3290.2,Jurors as members of the jury?
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3290.2,3294.639,"That's the inference from that statement, yes."
1967.237,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3298.208,3311.124,Or is that correct?
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3313.042,3322.088,It's -- I'm sorry Your Honor it is a point made by counsel when he is objecting to this other case being mentioned.
1967.237,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3322.088,3326.879,Have you raised any such points in your petition for certiorari?
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3326.879,3327.62,Concerning?
1967.237,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3327.62,3329.966,Presented --
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3329.966,3330.941,Not exclusively.
1967.237,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3331.361,3334.693,"If you raised it all, I've just read it and I don't find any."
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3334.693,3338.556,"Well, I believe in the petition we mentioned --"
1967.237,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3338.556,3340.023,Is that the question presented?
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3340.023,3347.587,"No, no, not the newspaper itself, it's just another factor in the case."
1967.237,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3347.587,3352.253,"Do you know what's become of that other charge, that original charge?"
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3352.253,3372.213,"My best understanding is this, he has never been indicted for the assault that took place on August 16, but he has been indicted for two other charges in Davidson County and these charges have not come to trial, but the original one he has not been indicted."
1967.237,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3372.213,3373.818,Those were rape charges?
1967.237,2,36318,michael_meltsner,,3373.818,3377.753,Yes.
1967.237,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3377.753,3378.846,Very well.
