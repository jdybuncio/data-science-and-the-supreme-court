1959.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,12.5,"Number 14, United States of America, Appellant, versus Lucille Aldine Dege."
1959.14,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,15.999,20.968,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.14,1,43467,thomas_whelan,,1339.827,1349.322,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1959.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1675.673,1688.465,"Mr. Whelan so that I could understand your position is to what the law now is, would you concede that there could be a criminal conviction of Mr. and Mrs. Dege, how do you pronounce your --?"
1959.14,1,43467,thomas_whelan,,1688.465,1690.6,Dege is the way you pronounce it Your Honor.
1959.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1690.6,1701.329,"If -- if Lucille Dege and Ernest Dege and John Smith had been indicted of a criminal conspiracy, could all three of them convicted?"
1959.14,1,43467,thomas_whelan,,1701.329,1703.307,I -- I think that's correct Your Honor.
1959.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1724.751,1729.353,"Well, and though -- you said the one person, but each separately could be convicted if --"
1959.14,1,43467,thomas_whelan,,1729.353,1731.954,"Well, if I -- I would -- I would think so your Honor."
1959.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1731.954,1734.879,And each sent to separate prisons.
1959.14,1,43467,thomas_whelan,,1734.879,1742.537,"Well, there actually are two physical persons but as a matter of the law they're one identity."
1959.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1980.24,1982.53,This reference is to a California Supreme Court and not the Legislature.
1959.14,1,43467,thomas_whelan,,1982.53,1991.962,That is correct and the California Supreme Court denied the petition for a hearing which was asked by the prosecution in that case.
1959.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2169.475,2170.675,I just -- before you sit you down.
1959.14,1,43467,thomas_whelan,,2179.011,2181.455,"Well, lets take this situation."
1959.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2252.402,2281.816,"Well now, how would any difficulties be present and that situation that would not be present if they were both indicted and being tried or substantive offences for the same -- commission of the same substantive offence or conversely have in any problems to be present in your hypothetical case it wouldn't be present if Mr. and Mrs. Dege or has a -- a codefendant John Smith."
1959.14,1,43467,thomas_whelan,,2282.981,2313.942,"Well, I think if they had a codefendant that this privilege of -- in favor the husband wouldn't -- wouldn't control the admission of the evidence there if she could testify against John Smith and she could exonerate herself and I -- I don't see how in that case that the husband could prevent her from testifying in -- on her own behalf."
1959.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2331.567,2346.459,"Well, there is certainly at least to be questioned to whether or not she could testify, if there is a third defendant it would be effective for her to testify it would be adverse to her husband under the profits decision that that there at least would be a question."
1959.14,1,43467,thomas_whelan,,2346.459,2351.964,There would be certainly a question but I don't think the question would be as great as that she and her husband were alone indicted.
1959.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2363.94,2373.636,"Well, is there any difficulty about having a severance and having separate trials for conspirators even though you know there are only two conspirators?"
1959.14,1,43467,thomas_whelan,,2373.636,2380.505,"Well, I would think that as a practical proposition you never get separate trial."
1959.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2380.505,2382.951,Why not is there any difficulty about it?
1959.14,1,43467,thomas_whelan,,2382.951,2392.013,"Well, as a practical the proposition there is I'm defendant a lot of conspiracy issues and I think in every case that made a motion for a severance and I have normally --"
1959.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2392.013,2394.803,"Normally that's the advantage of the defendants, isn't it?"
1959.14,1,43467,thomas_whelan,,2394.803,2396.321,"To have a severance, yes."
1959.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2402.887,2409.823,That wouldn't be very evidentiary testimony or problems that you suggest and I -- wouldn't they give a reason for a Court of (Voice Overlap) --
1959.14,1,43467,thomas_whelan,,2409.823,2410.565,"Well, yes."
1959.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2410.701,2411.73,-- discretion to grant separate trail.
1959.14,1,43467,thomas_whelan,,2411.73,2433.941,If -- if there would be pronouncement from the Congress or some direction or suggestion by this Court that the Trial Courts ought to grant severances in such situation it probably would mean they were able -- the severance would be easier to get and it would be beneficial to defendants --
1959.14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2433.941,2449.516,"In other words am I right in understanding that she -- you're suggestion is not the pocket which controls the disposition of the problem in this case but that in view of Hawkins their would be practical difficulties in trying husband and wife together as co-conspirators, is that it?"
1959.14,1,43467,thomas_whelan,,2449.516,2454.769,"That's it, but I don't say that Hawkins doesn't control the decision in this case."
1959.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2525.212,2527.129,Very well.
