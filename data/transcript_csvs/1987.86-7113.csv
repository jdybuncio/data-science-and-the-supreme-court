1987.86-7113,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.324,"Very well, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.86-7113,0,20959,duane_houdek,,14.324,18.628,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-7113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,146.06,153.398,"There are two types of school districts in North Dakota; the Organized and the Reorganized, is that it?"
1987.86-7113,0,20959,duane_houdek,,153.398,161.487,"They've come to be known, and it's a rather awkward set of terms, Justice O'Connor, Reorganized and Non-reorganized."
1987.86-7113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.487,163.439,Organized and Non-reorganized.
1987.86-7113,0,20959,duane_houdek,,163.439,177.199,"And the Reorganized districts have done so pursuant to statutes that were passed in the '40s to encourage an economy of scale, if you would."
1987.86-7113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.199,186.721,"And in terms of numbers of students, is it about equally divided among the two types of districts?"
1987.86-7113,0,20959,duane_houdek,,186.721,187.954,I think it is.
1987.86-7113,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,204.016,211.687,"Are the Appellants still living in the same location and their circumstances have not improved, I take it?"
1987.86-7113,0,20959,duane_houdek,,211.687,218.341,"They're living in the same location, their circumstances have greatly deteriorated."
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1324.943,1329.614,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-7113,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1425.892,1428.344,And that proves what?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1428.344,1435.95,"That proves that, although it may have been an imposition, they were able to get that child to school and clearly could have paid the fee which was--"
1987.86-7113,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1435.95,1439.235,"It doesn't prove they could afford it, does it?"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1439.235,1440.752,"--I think it does, yes."
1987.86-7113,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1440.752,1445.639,What if they went into debt and their debts were overwhelming and they continued to go in debt?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1445.639,1448.008,I think it would have been prudent to pay the fee.
1987.86-7113,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1448.008,1454.162,It might have been prudent but I don't believe it proves anything else.
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1454.162,1464.283,"Of course, with a family they are, they certainly aren't at a high level of income, but they did have resources to devote to various things, and it would appear that that's something they should have done."
1987.86-7113,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1465.719,1466.402,What do you mean by
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1470.87,1471.837,Pardon me?
1987.86-7113,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1471.837,1473.839,They didn't have very much.
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1473.839,1475.091,"No, it was certainly limited."
1987.86-7113,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1475.091,1480.828,Are you inferring irresponsible spending on their part?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1480.828,1484.03,"No, not at all."
1987.86-7113,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1493.235,1498.706,"With all the resources of the state, you could have found out how much money they had, couldn't you?"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1498.706,1499.839,"Pardon, Justice Marshall?"
1987.86-7113,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1499.839,1504.943,Couldn't you have found out exactly how much money that family had?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1504.943,1509.662,"Well, the testimony... they testified as to what their income was, and it was $15,000."
1987.86-7113,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1509.662,1515.299,Are we bound by that or are you trying to add to that?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1515.299,1515.882,"No, no."
1987.86-7113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1524.822,1531.76,"Mr. Dynes, what about... it might have been more economical, but what about the contractual requirement?"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1534.295,1535.579,"That's true, they were asked to sign a contract."
1987.86-7113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.405,1558.911,"But the contract, let me just go back to the contract that would have required them, would have prohibited them from bringing an action in this case, is that right?"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1558.911,1561.244,"--I guess it would have, yes."
1987.86-7113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1561.244,1562.963,What is the reason for that?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1562.963,1576.956,"I guess not, they could still bring the equal protection on the argument between the districts; and I think they could still... I don't know if it would prevent them from bringing the action; but of course they would have committed to pay the fee."
1987.86-7113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1583.026,1585.478,Why do you have such a contractual provision?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1588.161,1593.048,It's a matter of lining up during the summer season to know who's going to ride the bus.
1987.86-7113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1609.677,1610.327,"Well, that would explain my--"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1610.327,1611.01,--They do the best the can to schedule.
1987.86-7113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1617.081,1624.853,--What about... what is the reason for the waiver of the right to challenge the fee?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1624.853,1626.303,What is the reason for the waiver?
1987.86-7113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.303,1627.805,Yes.
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1630.59,1632.323,You're speaking about the statutory waiver?
1987.86-7113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1632.323,1639.446,"No, as I understand it... I don't have it in front of me; the contract would have foreclosed a lawsuit like this... at least some of the claims."
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1639.446,1642.398,"Well, they would have agreed that they were obligated to pay the fee."
1987.86-7113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1645.433,1647.652,And that they could not contest that fact?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1647.652,1649.202,I don' know that it said that in there.
1987.86-7113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1683.225,1704.571,"Mr. Dynes, I guess no matter how we view the case, we have to address the argument here that there's an equal protection denial by virtue of different treatment in North Dakota of reorganized school districts for bus transportation and non-reorganized districts?"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1704.571,1705.488,Yes.
1987.86-7113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1705.488,1727.754,"And the supreme court apparently found that the statute authorizing bus fees in non-reorganized school districts, but not in the reorganized ones, was rationally related to the legitimate government purpose of encouraging reorganization?"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1727.754,1731.306,"I think we have to take that in two parts, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-7113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1777.77,1789.161,"We now have this scheme on the books and if it's a reorganized district, they can't charge bus fees, and if it isn't they can, and that's being challenged?"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1789.161,1789.494,That's right.
1987.86-7113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1789.494,1796.248,"Now what is the legitimate governmental purpose now, do you suppose, in that difference?"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1796.248,1815.443,"That as the reorganization has been completed, the plans are in place; they've been voted on in the individual districts and the legislature when they passed this fee statute, simply left those districts alone because they had those plans in place, with not charging any fees."
1987.86-7113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1815.443,1824.482,So I'm asking you for what governmental purpose we should look in the discrepancy here?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1826.584,1828.702,"The first purpose was to reorganize, which they did."
1987.86-7113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1839.927,1840.727,And never will be.
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1840.727,1841.91,--And never will be.
1987.86-7113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1841.91,1842.546,Too big.
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1842.546,1846.664,"They were never required to have any bus system, you see."
1987.86-7113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1864.209,1866.244,This was a local option?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1866.244,1871.815,"Local option... and those plans, you have to remember, were different, and are different."
1987.86-7113,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1887.241,1892.729,"In the case of a non-reorganized district, which I take it Dickinson is--"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1892.729,1893.662,That's correct Your Honor.
1987.86-7113,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.662,1898.633,--Is the district simply left free to decide whether or not they will charge a fee?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1898.633,1899.449,That's true.
1987.86-7113,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.449,1909.838,"It's not as if the state says you will charge a fee to some districts and you won't to others, and with the districts that aren't reorganized, they are left a local option?"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1909.838,1915.808,They are left a local option and the statutes are completely silent on whether or not they could charge a fee.
1987.86-7113,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1915.808,1921.296,"But with the reorganized districts, the state tells them you can't charge a fee?"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1921.296,1922.664,Well it doesn't say that.
1987.86-7113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1931.604,1937.341,All of these systems that are local option on bussing?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1937.341,1946.529,"Well, in a way, except that the reorganized districts are done by vote of the people at the time the districts was organized, the unorganized districts--"
1987.86-7113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1946.529,1951.081,I thought that the supreme court said that the reorganized districts could not charge a bussing fee.
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1954.616,1956.366,--The statute is silent on that.
1987.86-7113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1958.299,1960.901,Well what does the supreme court say?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,1960.901,1965.822,"I'm not sure, Your Honor; I'm not sure about that."
1987.86-7113,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.472,2005.863,"In your view, so far as the North Dakota statute are concerned, it's optional to charge fees for the school bus in both kinds of districts?"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2005.863,2006.549,No.
1987.86-7113,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.167,2028.962,"But well, I think what several of us are trying to find out is, do the North Dakota statutes mandate one way or another as to whether a fee should be charged for a school bus trip in (a) the reorganized districts; and (b) the other districts?"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2028.962,2033.199,In the reorganized districts it says nothing about fee.
1987.86-7113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2037.851,2047.39,The reason that fees are not charged for bussing in the reorganized districts is that those reorganization plans provided for free bussing?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2047.39,2048.958,I think that's true.
1987.86-7113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.511,2056.463,A reorganized district might possibly not charge a fee at all?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2056.463,2057.232,Absolutely.
1987.86-7113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2057.232,2061.1,They could have a transportation plan that says $1.00 a mile.
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2061.1,2062.35,That's true.
1987.86-7113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.42,2073.591,"So in effect, all the reorganized districts have opted themselves to provide free transportation?"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2073.591,2075.058,--That in effect is true.
1987.86-7113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.443,2082.096,Also their transportation plans really differ one from another?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2082.096,2083.713,--That's right.
1987.86-7113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2084.213,2087.398,They don't charge but their mileages are different or things like that--
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2089.083,2092.552,--Some of them pick them up at the door and some of them don't.
1987.86-7113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2092.552,2107.962,"--The opinion of the supreme court, I thought, stated that the North Dakota statute allows only those school districts which have not been reorganized to charge a fee for school bus service?"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2107.962,2108.997,"That's true, Your Honor."
1987.86-7113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2108.997,2110.497,And that's what they said.
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2113.449,2114.066,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-7113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2126.642,2132.529,But don't we have to accept the interpretation of the statute placed on them by the supreme court of your state?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2132.529,2134.646,I think it's correct.
1987.86-7113,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2143.318,2146.789,I thought that was one of the issues raised by the Appellant?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2146.789,2153.293,"All right, I stand corrected, I guess they have raised that issue."
1987.86-7113,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2162.632,2168.119,"What's the reason, then, for the distinction between the two kinds of districts?"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2174.623,2183.545,"Justice Kennedy, as I mentioned, I think the Court recognizes the argument for the rational basis for the reorganized district, having a busing plan."
1987.86-7113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2231.276,2234.978,"Mr. Dynes, before you sit down, please follow up on Justice Kennedy's question."
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2254.558,2258.36,I don't believe you've read the entire opinion.
1987.86-7113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2258.36,2265.866,"I'm reading on page 64 of the Appendix which after explaining at some length why it's a rational basis standard, they say,"
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2280.609,2286.446,"That's the separate legislation that requires that they have a bus plan in place, which they do, the reorganized districts."
1987.86-7113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2293.35,2296.402,Where do they describe that in the opinion from the part I've read?
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2296.402,2300.706,--I could pass a note through Mr. Spaeth later if you'd like.
1987.86-7113,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2301.989,2303.158,"Well, I didn't find it."
1987.86-7113,1,25168,george_t_dynes,,2303.158,2306.443,"It's been neglected in the briefs, I think."
1987.86-7113,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2306.443,2307.493,"Thank you, Mr. Dynes."
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2312.264,2323.636,"Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court: may it please the Court, before beginning the argument I've prepared, I would like to pick up on a question Justice Stevens just asked because I can tell that the Court is interested in it."
1987.86-7113,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2372.252,2378.122,"General Spaeth, can a reorganized school district charge for school busing?"
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2378.122,2379.372,"No, I do not believe so."
1987.86-7113,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2380.658,2381.508,So we can put that at rest?
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2381.508,2383.443,"We can put that at rest, that's right."
1987.86-7113,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2387.495,2397.953,"All right, and so on the equal protection challenge, as to the difference between the reorganized and the unreorganized districts, what is the legitimate governmental justification for it?"
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2397.953,2409.141,"It was a local option to provide each school district with the choice of deciding first of all whether it wanted to reorganize; then if it decided not to reorganize, whether it wanted to charge a fee?"
1987.86-7113,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2417.331,2424.853,"You are saying, I think, if I understand it correctly, that it once had a purpose, to achieve reorganization."
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2465.412,2471.066,"No, it still has a rationale in the sense that it provides the non-reorganized school districts with an option."
1987.86-7113,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2476.403,2486.844,"General Spaeth, the option, if I understand you, at the time of the legislation, they were concerned about poor families living a long ways from the new central school, and what would happen to them if they didn't provide bus service?"
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2486.844,2487.861,Not just poor families.
1987.86-7113,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2487.861,2490.062,"Well, at least those who are a distance away."
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2523.967,2531.539,"What happened here, Justice Stevens, is there was a very rational scheme was put in place given the needs of the state as a whole, and you're focusing on the Dickinson school district, where it isn't."
1987.86-7113,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2531.539,2531.906,No.
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2548.168,2563.178,"Because when the legislature was considering this problem, the legislature emerged from a political compromise and realized that, in order to provide some districts with an incentive to reorganize, it was going to have to put in some guarantee that transportation would be provided."
1987.86-7113,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2576.568,2588.007,What you are saying is that the legislature had no intention whatever to benefit people distant from the schools; it just wanted to eliminate a possible obstacle to their voting for reorganization?
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2588.007,2588.757,That's correct.
1987.86-7113,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2588.757,2591.209,It has no beneficent desire here at all?
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2592.259,2605.117,"The primary focus was to encourage this process of consolidation, and in order to get this legislation through, that important protection had to be put in to encourage the consolidation process, and that's what we're talking about here."
1987.86-7113,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2642.892,2645.844,"I guess it's enough to raise the challenge, isn't it?"
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2645.844,2651.997,"Well, the state law would have provided for a waiver of fee; and no waiver--"
1987.86-7113,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2651.997,2653.532,"Well, let's talk about this state law."
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2659.269,2660.219,--That is correct.
1987.86-7113,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2660.219,2663.555,Would it have excused her parents from paying?
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2663.555,2664.571,"Yes, it would."
1987.86-7113,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2664.571,2666.107,You think it addresses that?
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2666.107,2687.687,"Yes, all you have to do is if you look in the joint appendix, the court's Finding of Fact No. 14, that's located on page 7 of the joint appendix... what the court decided based on the conflicting evidence was all that the Dickinson school district required was that the parents sign the written agreement to pay fees, and make a bona fide effort to pay on these obligations, a bona fide effort."
1987.86-7113,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2689.289,2689.739,Well--
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2689.739,2693.574,"In fact, she'd been bussed for three years without payment of any fees."
1987.86-7113,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2693.574,2704.548,"--But counsel, if their cattle works out, for example, and they make a lot of money, they're going to have to pay that fee."
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2704.548,2707.184,"That's correct, and there goes the equal protection argument."
1987.86-7113,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.975,2720.775,"So as long as they're poor, they don't pay?"
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2720.775,2721.094,--That's right.
1987.86-7113,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2726.229,2728.081,I don't want to pay even if I'm rich.
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2738.703,2740.069,"--If you put it in that sense, right."
1987.86-7113,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2776.578,2778.461,"General, may I interrupt?"
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2810.965,2815.703,"--I am tempted to respond, Justice Stevens, by saying that is not the case here, but two weeks ago--"
1987.86-7113,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2815.703,2816.803,"Well, we've got an obstacle."
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2817.655,2827.177,"--Justice Scalia warned the assembled Attorney-Generals in this room that we were not to answer a question that way; that we were indeed required to answer a question anyway, even if we don't believe it applies."
1987.86-7113,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2831.146,2842.02,"And the justification would be the state says each school district runs its own affairs, except that in 9 out of 10 we have regulations that ensure that the children have adequate access to the school."
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2848.174,2861.582,"--Yes, it would, and in fact, if you look at this Court's decision in McGowan v. Maryland and an earlier case, Calvert v. Maryland, where there were different... Ann Arundel County had different sets of rules than other counties, those kinds of challenges were raised and rejected."
1987.86-7113,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2875.092,2879.11,I understand that you say there's no denial of education in this case?
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2879.11,2880.995,That is correct.
1987.86-7113,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2880.995,2895.488,"Well, let's take the State of Texas, and they tell the children in Galveston you can go to school in El Paso, would that be a denial of education?"
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2895.488,2898.023,"It depends, I suppose, on the purpose, Justice Marshall."
1987.86-7113,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2919.352,2923.571,How are the poor people going to get there?
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2927.542,2931.577,"They're going to have to move there, I think, is what the answer is."
1987.86-7113,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2931.577,2933.06,It's easy.
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2933.06,2933.446,No it's not.
1987.86-7113,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2933.446,2940.266,I think if you give one people bus transportation you should give it to the others.
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2943.634,2945.651,"It's not the state making that decision, Justice Marshall."
1987.86-7113,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2948.77,2958.978,"I thought that state education was a part of the Constitution; that the state, once they offered education should offer it on an equal basis."
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2959.644,2961.66,"It does, Justice Marshall."
1987.86-7113,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2964.496,2966.964,You can't escape it by turning it over to the counties.
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2966.964,2978.153,"--No, the state, just for your information, in this case the state funds 2/3rds of the transportation costs to the local district, and it's only the other third that we're talking about right here, the school district--"
1987.86-7113,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2978.153,2982.89,The other third could be very important to some people.
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2982.89,2984.926,"There's no doubt about that, Justice Marshall, but we're talking--"
1987.86-7113,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2984.926,2986.392,It also applies to the millionaire.
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,3001.951,3002.57,--Yes.
1987.86-7113,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3005.087,3013.409,"Then it seems to me there the principal; it's not so much then the county itself deciding how to disperse the local taxpayers' money, but you have the state financing it."
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,3018.063,3019.113,I disagree.
1987.86-7113,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3059.24,3068.18,"I assume that in the reorganized districts where they don't make a charge for the bussing fee, it comes out of locally imposed taxes?"
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,3068.18,3069.413,"That's right, the taxpayers there."
1987.86-7113,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3069.413,3074.983,"So that the people who don't pay bussing fare have to pay something more in their taxes, although it probably wouldn't--"
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,3074.983,3087.874,"Right and it generally is property taxes, which are not, you know, which are tax, and you could argue, I suppose that poor people aren't likely to pay property taxes, and therefore are likely to get a free ride in those kinds of accountings."
1987.86-7113,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.376,3090.343,--Nice pun.
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,3092.561,3100.217,"--Again, I think we are dealing here with something that is an economic benefit, and we have one school district here that's charging a small amount for it."
1987.86-7113,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3112.858,3117.678,"I suppose that reorganized districts have got a better tax base, so an enhanced tax base--"
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,3117.678,3118.628,They certainly do.
1987.86-7113,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3118.628,3132.522,"--and if an unreorganized district, probably because if it can't be reorganized isn't going to achieve a better tax base."
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,3136.14,3139.859,"In many cases that's right, Justice White, and you know it--"
1987.86-7113,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3139.859,3144.08,"Well, the Supreme Court said... indicated that right?"
1987.86-7113,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,3144.08,3145.996,"--Yes, that's correct."
1987.86-7113,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3181.936,3183.305,Thank you General Spaeth.
1987.86-7113,3,20959,duane_houdek,,3187.173,3200.166,"Thank you Your Honor, I would first like to point out that the concept of reorganization did not create the right to bussing in North Dakota."
1987.86-7113,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3224.448,3226.498,But did free bussing exist before?
1987.86-7113,3,20959,duane_houdek,,3226.498,3227.317,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-7113,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3275.047,3282.034,"General, your opponent suggests that the fee equals only the local contribution."
1987.86-7113,3,20959,duane_houdek,,3285.67,3285.772,--Yes.
1987.86-7113,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3296.128,3299.913,"I suppose you could say you could offer to take 2/3rds of it away with the school, would you?"
1987.86-7113,3,20959,duane_houdek,,3299.913,3301.365,"No, I wouldn't, Your Honor."
1987.86-7113,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3341.007,3362.772,"I suppose you can say that the person who can't afford the 1/3 fee or whatever proportion of that is charged, has to forego the other 66 percent just because that person doesn't have the money, but another resident of the district who has no children forgoes the whole thing, all the time."
1987.86-7113,3,20959,duane_houdek,,3368.592,3369.126,No.
1987.86-7113,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3490.888,3491.621,"Thank you, Mr. Houdek."
