1988.87-1277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.71,"We'll go now to the argument of No. 87-1277, Lockhart against Nelson."
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,73.5,94.933,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the State of Arkansas believes the facts in this case are somewhat simple in that simply what occurred here in our trial courts in Union County was trial error rather than a failure to submit sufficient evidence."
1988.87-1277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,204.606,207.808,This is because of the multiple offender aspect?
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,207.808,209.108,"Yes, your Honor."
1988.87-1277,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,272.741,278.365,"Attorney General Clark, couldn't one argue... I don't know if it would be a correct argument... that one of your four apples really wasn't an apple?"
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,278.365,281.677,"--Yes, your Honor, one can argue that, clearly."
1988.87-1277,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,281.677,283.527,And that therefore it's really a Burks case?
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,283.527,285.637,"Yes, your Honor, one could argue that clearly."
1988.87-1277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,333.289,342.156,"Well, in fact here, I think that decision was to be made by the judge, but under a mistake he referred it to the jury."
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,342.156,343.578,"--Yes, your Honor, that is correct."
1988.87-1277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,385.775,389.005,"Well, General Clark, I know you're arguing the Burks question."
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,394.538,395.349,"Yes, your Honor."
1988.87-1277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,395.349,396.811,--outside the capital context?
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,396.811,397.871,"Yes, your Honor."
1988.87-1277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,412.731,414.972,I just wonder why you were so willing to concede that.
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,416.855,425.26,"--Your Honor, I'm only willing to concede that because I simply believe that that is the way that process occurs and would not want to misrepresent or mislead this court in any fashion."
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,425.26,429.721,"Mr. Attorney General, you did mislead the trial court, didn't you?"
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,429.721,430.853,"No, your Honor, we did not."
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,430.853,436.737,But you did give them what was a conviction that had actually been pardoned?
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,436.737,437.578,We did offer--
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,437.578,440.51,You did present that to the court deliberately?
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,440.51,442.042,"--Yes, your Honor, we did present the conviction."
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,444.313,450.197,"Well, weren't you obliged to find out whether it was a valid conviction or not?"
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,450.197,451.617,"Your Honor, at the time that we offered--"
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,451.617,454.259,Did you present it as a valid conviction?
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,454.259,455.13,"--Yes, your Honor, we did."
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,455.13,456.172,It wasn't.
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,456.172,457.42,"No, your Honor, it was not."
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,457.42,459.053,And you should have known it.
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,459.053,459.712,"No, your Honor."
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,460.152,461.594,"Well, why don't you admit that?"
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,461.594,477.162,"--Your Honor, in the interest of the time that we offered this conviction, which was a 1960 conviction which followed the 1964 pardon, the time that the notice came to the state, other than the comments of the defendant... and the comments of the defendant were weighted both by the trial court and by the jury--"
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,477.162,482.007,--and the lawyer when he presented evidence to the court supported it.
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,482.007,483.757,--Did the prosecutor support the evidence?
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,484.548,486.319,"Well, you didn't support it, did you?"
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,487.13,487.791,"We did, your Honor."
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,488.191,490.463,"Well, that was wrong, wasn't it?"
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,490.463,492.022,--It was erroneous at the time.
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,492.573,493.234,Wasn't it wrong?
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,493.234,493.635,We thought--
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,493.635,495.255,W-r-o-n-g?
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,495.255,498.627,"--Your Honor, we believed that the conviction was a valid conviction at the time that it was offered."
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,500.868,503.981,How could it be valid then?
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,503.981,510.104,"Your Honor, the conviction continues to exist today regardless of what maybe was said in respondent's brief in terms of--"
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,510.104,512.956,But your court said it was not?
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,512.956,514.168,"--Our court said it was, your Honor, after a--"
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,514.168,516.449,"Well, should I listen to your court or you?"
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,516.449,533.15,"--You should listen to our court in the sense, your Honor, when the collateral attack came and the habeas petition and the facts were discovered by the trial court of the state, which we admitted, and the defense, that in fact we had offered an erroneous conviction not known to any of the persons at that trial proceeding in 1982, then we at that point said--"
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,533.15,533.71,Didn't--
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,533.71,534.411,--said error occurred.
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,534.411,535.683,--Didn't you know about it?
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,535.683,538.044,"We did not know, your Honor, at the time offered."
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,538.044,540.726,"Well, when it was pardoned wasn't your office notified?"
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,540.726,542.136,"No, your Honor, my office was not."
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,543.237,545.968,You mean the government pardons somebody and didn't tell you?
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,545.968,547.5,"--Your Honor, that's correct."
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,550.694,551.27,"Well, where is that in this record?"
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,551.27,552.772,"It's not in that record, your Honor."
1988.87-1277,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,552.772,554.563,"Well, where... I'm sorry, I have to take your word for it."
1988.87-1277,0,29766,j_steven_clark,,554.563,555.344,"Yes, your Honor."
1988.87-1277,1,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1521.262,1539.293,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, what the state is asking for here is an opportunity to get a chance to resentence this man to fill a void in its proof six and a half... if the trial is later, seven years, seven and a half years... after the fact."
1988.87-1277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1547.619,1549.261,Why do you say it's a void in their proof?
1988.87-1277,1,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1564.12,1565.371,That's true.
1988.87-1277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1591.457,1593.439,Surely the defense was on notice too.
1988.87-1277,1,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1593.439,1595.66,"Yes, the defense was on notice."
1988.87-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1784.203,1786.096,"Mr. Hall, may I ask you a question?"
1988.87-1277,1,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1811.412,1816.975,At that time they could have resubmitted only the three prior convictions.
1988.87-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1816.975,1817.536,The three?
1988.87-1277,1,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1825.59,1832.635,In that particular case you'd have the question of he moved to set aside the conviction.
1988.87-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1841.411,1847.954,Why would that situation be any... why should the rule be any different in that situation than the one you've got today.
1988.87-1277,1,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1851.587,1854.251,"--Well, the question is double jeopardy finality."
1988.87-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1854.251,1854.609,Right.
1988.87-1277,1,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1854.609,1857.111,In this particular case here we are talking about it seven and a half years later.
1988.87-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1859.535,1870.932,"But why should your defendant get the benefit of the fact that he's seven years late in succeeding with what he should have brought to the attention of the court right away, if he knew the facts and if his lawyer checked it out?"
1988.87-1277,1,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1873.703,1876.245,"Well, everybody is responsible for the delay."
1988.87-1277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1913.2,1932.011,"--But if the double jeopardy isn't kind of an equitable doctrine... it's kind of a firm rule of law... it would seem to me that if the state is barred now, it would also have been barred if they'd raised it just a few... you know, 30 or 60 days later... brought out the fact that there in fact, there were only three apples and you need four."
1988.87-1277,1,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1932.011,1943.709,"--On that particular type of situation other consideration might come in, like whether the defendant was sandbagging the state, for instance, and letting this go to the jury for the purpose of causing that kind of error."
1988.87-1277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1950.995,1964.842,But what if exactly those same facts... where there is no evidence of sandbagging... on Justice Stevens' hypothesis... so that it's all the same except it all comes out 60 days after the... or 30 days after the judgment of conviction?
1988.87-1277,1,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1964.842,1972.676,--Then it would still be barred by double jeopardy assuming the defendant didn't participate such that he could be charged with some participation in the occurrence.
1988.87-1277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.137,1996.828,What about a murder trial in which there is some dispute as to whether the alleged decedent was even killed and they produced testimony about a certain corpse and it is later found out that it was not the right corpse?
1988.87-1277,1,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,1996.828,1999.269,Another person was killed?
1988.87-1277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.269,1999.75,Right.
1988.87-1277,1,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,2000.949,2001.7,"Well, that's not--"
1988.87-1277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2001.7,2007.055,"Therefore, that testimony at the first trial should not have been admitted, because the fellow was testifying about a different corpse."
1988.87-1277,1,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,2007.055,2010.205,"--Well, you wouldn't even have a double jeopardy problem because you're talking about another victim."
1988.87-1277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2013.758,2014.899,"No, I'm not talking about another victim."
1988.87-1277,1,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,2028.488,2034.722,"--But you're talking about a person who was convicted of killing person ""A"" when in fact he killed person ""B""?"
1988.87-1277,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.722,2035.353,No.
1988.87-1277,1,30855,john_wesley_hall_jr,,2064.421,2074.419,The question of trial error has to be looked at in terms of he and the prosecutor cure the error given an opportunity to put more proof.
1988.87-1277,2,29766,j_steven_clark,,2646.581,2649.263,"Mr. Chief Justice, just two points I'd like to make."
1988.87-1277,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2668.627,2673.679,What's the matter with the other habitual offender provision?
1988.87-1277,2,29766,j_steven_clark,,2673.679,2676.882,"--It is a separate process, Justice O'Connor, in which we must meet that burden of proof."
1988.87-1277,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2706.361,2707.921,"Thank you, General Clark."
