1982.81-1003,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,85.685,"Mr. Tribe, I think you may proceed when you are ready."
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,85.685,87.028,Thank you.
1982.81-1003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,252.476,264.659,"Mr. Tribe, under that line of reasoning, wouldn't it be possible to say that the decision of the Hilton Corporation to build a new Hilton on Copely Square might be thought to be the result of the city's ingenuity, too?"
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,266.362,273.483,"Well, in this case, Justice Rehnquist, the key point is that the city is a but-for cause under the very terms of the regulations."
1982.81-1003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,312.375,325.118,"Well, what if it were strictly private funds but the city had been very active in persuading the persons who had the disposition to private funds to use them in Boston rather than Minneapolis?"
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,325.118,330.726,I suppose that that would push our logic beyond the point where I would urge the Court to take it.
1982.81-1003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,361.667,377.692,"Well, why should the city stand any better if it applies its regulation to things that it had no part in funding but was federally funded, but it nevertheless had a great part in producing on the scene, than should the privately funded things that it had the same great part in producing?"
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,377.692,383.534,"Well, I suppose the judgments of degree here are ones that this Court might well leave to Congress."
1982.81-1003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,537.846,541.611,Does the record really tell us how much of each is involved--
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,541.611,544.031,"Justice O'Connor, the record is ambiguous."
1982.81-1003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,578.565,581.969,"--But we don't know how, we don't know if the city was signatory or what."
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,583.531,594.855,"Well, we know that the city does not in fact... the city does not in fact sign the construction contract on the hotel and other purely private-seeming parts of the project."
1982.81-1003,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,618.376,627.826,--Did the city make the argument about the federal policy that is being made now in these briefs to the court below?
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,627.826,632.84,"Well, actually, it was in the Complaint, it was in the Complaint made against the city; that is, the Complaint quoted some of these regulations."
1982.81-1003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,669.762,675.479,Do you think your UDAG argument is really fairly representative of the writ for certiorari?
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,675.479,678.337,"It... in the petition for certiorari, Justice--"
1982.81-1003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,678.337,683.538,"No, the question is presented on there on the first page."
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,683.538,683.975,"--No, that's right."
1982.81-1003,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.846,776.297,"Mr. Tribe, before you get to the traditional--"
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,776.297,776.672,--Sir.
1982.81-1003,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,776.672,801.35,"--public works, just pausing with the public federally funded projects for the moment, isn't there a possibility that there's a conflict between some of the federal secretary's regulations and the specific 50 percent requirement of the Boston executive order which might raise the preemption issue, which is one of the questions that, as I understand, the Massachusetts Supreme Court did not answer, and that--"
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,801.35,801.74,I would think--
1982.81-1003,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,801.74,802.599,--that might remain in the case?
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,802.599,808.019,"--I would think, Justice Stevens, that it would cut the other way; that is, the other--"
1982.81-1003,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,808.019,809.738,"For the most part, I can see a parallel between the two."
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,816.891,820.655,"--If there were a flat 50 percent requirement without any feasibility test, then it might."
1982.81-1003,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,926.956,942.451,"Before you leave UDAG grants again, Mr. Tribe, for a moment, what is it that the city itself actually does or performs on these UDAG grants that would make those programs proprietary rather than governmental?"
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,942.451,957.537,"--Well, what the city has to do is identify a developer and hold local hearings to make sure that the developer's precise plans will meet the needs of the unemployed and underemployed and particularly the minority residents of the area."
1982.81-1003,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,971.985,973.485,"Well, why isn't all that governmental?"
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,973.485,981.186,"Well, it seems to me it's governmental in the same sense that when the government procures something for its own police department, that's governmental."
1982.81-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1021.263,1022.248,And can slide by the boards.
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1022.248,1022.888,And it slides back and forth.
1982.81-1003,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1046.971,1050.143,"Well, why isn't there some of this federal market participation?"
1982.81-1003,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1050.143,1054.923,Federal market participation so that Congress should have a dominant voice.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1741.145,1745.941,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1766.354,1773.086,"We don't suggest that Boston would have to permit nonresidents to attend their school district, their schools?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1773.086,1774.881,"No, I don't, Justice White."
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.224,1781.317,Then how can they reserve their elementary schools to residents?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1781.317,1783.69,--They may do so.
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1783.69,1784.237,How?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1786.096,1795.546,"They may do so because they are involved with something that is integral to their very purpose; and that is, to provide education for their children."
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1795.546,1804.558,"Why can't they, why can't Boston then require that only residents build their school buildings?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1804.558,1813.882,Because at that point the city is not acting with respect to an integral government function.
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1815.396,1821.784,"Well, cities normally build school buildings, and school districts normally build school districts... school buildings."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1821.784,1822.581,--They do--
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.581,1823.83,Nobody else ever builds them--
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1823.83,1825.627,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.627,1827.126,"--except private, private schools do."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1827.126,1837.467,--The city does not build the school building in the sense that they have their own employees perform... the city is not in the contracting business.
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1837.467,1849.305,So what if a school district has a requirement that the school building we contract to have built will be built by residents of our school district?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1849.305,1853.381,"There'd be no different, Justice White."
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1881.448,1891.427,"But if it had its own employees to build school buildings, you would say they could confine their employment to residents?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1891.427,1897.284,"I think, yes, Justice White, they could under the Court's decision in McCarthy v. the Elks--"
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.284,1898.534,"The Firemen, the Firemen's case?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1898.534,1899.925,"--The Firemen's case, that's correct."
1982.81-1003,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1935.958,1944.611,"Well, as to those, the federal grant programs seem to mandate some degree of preference for local hiring."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1949.047,1949.421,--Well--
1982.81-1003,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1949.421,1952.733,"Because it seems to have had rather little attention, I think."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1952.733,1953.608,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-1003,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1974.005,1976.629,"All right, but let's talk about it insofar as--"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1976.629,1977.207,--Insofar as--
1982.81-1003,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1977.207,1978.737,--the UDAG funds are--
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1978.737,1979.159,--Involved--
1982.81-1003,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1979.159,1981.861,--marked and the federal regulations are applicable.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,1981.861,1982.205,--All right.
1982.81-1003,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2023.251,2032.434,If we had a case where the city's order matched in all respects the federal--
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2032.434,2033.34,Yes.
1982.81-1003,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2033.34,2035.511,"--mandate, what does that do?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2035.511,2044.758,"At that point, Justice O'Connor, first there are other federal projects other than those administered by HUD, the UDAGs."
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2079.15,2080.463,Mr. Kingston.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2080.463,2081.119,"Yes, Justice Brennan."
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2081.119,2085.257,Perhaps you have already answered Justice O'Connor to this respect.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2099.423,2103.671,Are there any projects which are not--
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2103.671,2105.405,Within either of those classes.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2105.405,2112.668,--Are there... the scope of the order would cover either projects entirely funded with city dollars--
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2112.668,2113.246,By Boston.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2113.683,2114.215,--By Boston.
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2114.215,2116.354,Or covered by UDAG?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2116.354,2118.119,Or covered by UDAGs.
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2118.119,2118.775,But nothing else?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2118.775,2130.77,"There may be, Justice Brennan, some projects which have not been identified but which would have been covered under the Department of Transportation I alluded to a moment ago."
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2143.843,2151.902,"So for our purposes, may we treat this case as presenting under the executive order only the two classes I have mentioned?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2151.902,2153.916,--Two classes being city-funded--
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2153.916,2156.478,"City, city-funded or UDAG."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2156.478,2157.619,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2157.619,2158.322,I see.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2158.322,2162.085,Because the terms of the order apply to all projects--
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2162.085,2162.663,I see.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2162.663,2165.866,--to which the city is the contributing--
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2165.866,2167.707,Yes.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2167.707,2171.379,--source or any project involving federal funds.
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2171.379,2172.207,Right.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2172.207,2173.659,It is not limited to--
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2173.659,2174.581,It couldn't be more than UDAG?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2174.581,2176.159,--It could clearly be more than UDAG.
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2176.159,2177.658,"While I have you interrupted, may I ask one other question?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2195.416,2197.586,"That's absolutely correct, Justice Brennan."
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2197.586,2205.084,"But you don't concede, or do you, that the federal regulations really save the UDAG coverage?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2205.084,2209.442,"No, we don't concede that the federal regulations save the UDAG."
1982.81-1003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2215.784,2216.986,Mr. Kingston.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2216.986,2217.72,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2217.72,2242.944,Do you think that an ordinance which simply carried out and matched perfectly a provision of a UDAG which said that each ordinance which gets UDAG money shall provide for 50 percent employment of residents would violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause if it represented an affirmative sanction of Congress acting under its spending power and the Commerce Clause?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2242.944,2244.459,Respondents do.
1982.81-1003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2244.459,2246.131,"Well, do you have any case for that?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2246.131,2247.599,"Your Honor, I don't--"
1982.81-1003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.599,2249.052,About that precise situation?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2249.052,2252.113,--I do not have a case for that precise situation.
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.0,2302.763,Although Congress might enforce it in a way that the courts might not otherwise; might expand it?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2302.763,2305.794,"Yes, Justice White."
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2305.794,2316.227,But your... the question is here whether Congress could limit the reach of the clause beyond that that courts might otherwise find?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2316.227,2321.365,"And my response, Justice White, is that while I do not have a case--"
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2321.365,2321.881,They could not?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2321.881,2322.521,--They could not.
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2322.521,2339.218,"And what, Mr. Kingston, is your answer to Mr. Tribe's argument: yes, but 94 percent of those involved are residents of other communities in Massachusetts, so there's no discrimination between residents of several states?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2339.218,2343.872,With respect to the Commerce Clause or the Privileges and Immunities?
1982.81-1003,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2343.872,2344.685,Privileges and Immunities.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2344.685,2344.919,All right.
1982.81-1003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2417.124,2429.057,"Well, doesn't that kind of contradict your earlier argument that some suburban residents or residents of Springfield or Northampton don't have access to the political process that enabled Boston to do this?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2437.412,2455.296,"--Well, my point, Justice Rehnquist, is that the state statute upon which the executive order was premised in itself allowed the suburbs and gave them a preference with respect to public construction works within their locality."
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2529.345,2538.872,"Well, isn't the order restricted to projects where the city is going to be writing the check?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2538.872,2541.823,"No, Justice White."
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2546.04,2550.524,"Well, no, but it is the prime mover."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2552.037,2558.036,--It applies to the Federal Government for these federal funds.
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2588.93,2595.631,"In UDAG projects, what is the premise for the use of the federal funds?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2595.631,2604.643,"The premise, Justice White, is to leverage private reinvestment in our nation's cities."
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2604.643,2609.032,"Yes, and they are given when a city applies for it, I suppose."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2609.032,2612.67,I don't understand that they are automatically given.
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.763,2619.322,"Well, I know, but nevertheless the Federal Government doesn't go around and shop for this, does it?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2622.275,2623.9,"--Oh, yes, Your Honor, it does."
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2623.9,2625.461,The city applies.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2625.461,2626.305,The city applies.
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2626.305,2628.522,"And so, please help us out as a city."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2628.522,2629.507,That's correct.
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.38,2684.687,"Well, it may merit it, but you wouldn't be satisfied to win this case on that basis, I guess, that this regulation, this order, is invalid to the extent that federal funds are used?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2684.687,2685.875,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2688.358,2697.496,"So putting aside those, then you're talking about the city itself paying for municipal improvements."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2697.496,2699.76,--With respect--
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2699.76,2706.679,And you say they are not a market participant in those because they are not using their own employees to build the buildings?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2706.679,2708.255,--That's correct.
1982.81-1003,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2789.739,2798.845,"Mr. Kingston, I guess all we have in front of us, though, is those things to which the executive order would apply, right?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2798.845,2801.281,"I don't know if I understand, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-1003,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2801.281,2805.545,"Well, we have before us the city's executive order requirements."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2805.545,2805.841,Yes.
1982.81-1003,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2805.841,2816.37,"And under the terms of the executive order, it says that it's limited to those projects to which the city is a signatory to the construction contract."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2819.509,2821.46,"Well, I think it continues, Justice O'Connor,"
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2830.909,2834.361,"Well, it still signs the contracts in those."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2834.361,2837.391,"If it signs the contracts, Justice White--"
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2837.391,2837.766,"Well, doesn't it?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2837.766,2840.141,--I don't believe it does.
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2842.186,2845.513,You mean it doesn't sign the construction contracts where the federal funds are provided?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2845.935,2851.261,--The developer would... I'm sorry.
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2855.571,2856.509,"Yes, yes."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2856.509,2867.987,"But the point is, there is no commitment, there is no entrepreneurial aspect, there is no assumption of risk, there is no financial commitment which the city has made in those UDAG projects."
1982.81-1003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2898.07,2902.256,You say it attempts to dictate conditions to people with whom it has no relationship.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2902.256,2902.833,Yes.
1982.81-1003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2902.833,2907.675,"Give me an example, if you would, of the people to whom it's dictating conditions?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2907.675,2921.623,"It is dictating... first of all, it is dictating to subcontractors the terms of the order, namely that they must hire at least 50 percent Boston residents."
1982.81-1003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2925.012,2929.853,"Well, but that's a fairly archaic concept if you apply it that way, isn't it?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2946.269,2957.03,"That may be so, Justice Rehnquist, but it seems to us that if we're dealing with constitutional matters that normal contractual matters may not always carry."
1982.81-1003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2957.03,2964.278,"I think that's true, and that's what I was wondering why you kind of resurrected the notion of privity to analyze a commerce clause problem."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,2964.278,2964.729,Yes.
1982.81-1003,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3237.837,3240.742,Let me ask just one question on the commerce clause.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,3244.96,3250.489,The economic market is the construction market.
1982.81-1003,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3250.489,3253.441,It's the market in which the contractors compete?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,3255.503,3257.783,I don't know if I understand.
1982.81-1003,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3263.546,3266.608,And 94 percent of the laborers are not out of state people?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,3266.608,3268.248,"Oh, in that respect."
1982.81-1003,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3283.615,3291.848,"Does the record tell us what is the impact in any measurable way on interstate trade of any kind, either employees or out of state people?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,3291.848,3316.023,"The agreed statement of facts, Justice Stevens, which the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court expressly relied upon in its decision contained the stipulation that out of state, without any numerical limitations, out of state residents will be denied work opportunity, contractors will be discouraged from bidding in Boston construction."
1982.81-1003,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3316.023,3317.148,Is there any quantification?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,3317.148,3318.164,No quantification.
1982.81-1003,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3332.299,3340.734,"Would it matter for your interstate commerce theory what the facts actually show, or is it just the fact that there is this potential is enough?"
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,3340.734,3351.822,"--Well, the agreed statement of facts specifically contained an acknowledgment that it would have those disadvantages and those burdens on interstate commerce."
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3387.339,3404.77,There's no bar to out of state firms or no discrimination against interstate commerce You say that this requirement may keep some out of state firms from coming in because they would have to hire locals.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,3404.77,3423.403,"The agreed statement of facts, Justice White, contained an expression, and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court acknowledged and relied on it, that both in-state and out-of-state contractors would be discouraged from bidding on Boston construction work."
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3423.403,3424.856,Because they would have to hire locals?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,3424.856,3426.433,They would have to hire locals.
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3447.815,3451.345,Why would that requirement discourage a non-Bostonian?
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,3451.345,3454.234,A contractor?
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3454.234,3454.858,Yes.
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,3454.858,3457.03,"Well, there are inefficiencies."
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3459.982,3467.838,"It may be inefficient, but they wouldn't bid except at a price that would cover those inefficiencies."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,3476.037,3478.116,"--Well, that may be their problem."
1982.81-1003,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3496.686,3509.196,"Well, a building code might require certain specifications for a building that some out-of-state contractor is not used to putting up with."
1982.81-1003,1,38054,paul_j_kingston,,3509.196,3511.383,"--Correct, Justice White."
1982.81-1003,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3528.002,3531.798,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Tribe?"
1982.81-1003,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3531.798,3534.061,"A couple of points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1003,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3719.128,3729.14,In your earlier argument you seemed to rest quite heavily on the proposition that Boston was entitled to have these jobs to take care of its unemployment.
1982.81-1003,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3739.541,3742.43,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it would be if we were throwing other bodies out of work."
1982.81-1003,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3753.301,3754.8,Where does that money come from?
1982.81-1003,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3754.8,3762.484,"It comes from the federal Treasury in part, but a fifth of it under the law has to be matched by the city, and a lot of it is directly raised from city residents."
1982.81-1003,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3762.484,3765.671,"Well then, 80 percent of it comes from the Federal Government."
1982.81-1003,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3768.217,3770.014,"I think not at all, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1003,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3801.578,3802.063,"Thank you, gentlemen."
