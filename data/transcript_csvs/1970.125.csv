1970.125,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.957,"We'll hear arguments next in United States against Randall, number 125."
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,30.957,36.582,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.125,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,334.455,339.628,Does the Government in this case really is not a matter of priorities at all?
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,339.628,341.129,"That's right Mr. Justice Stewart, it's not."
1970.125,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,341.129,345.709,"And by contrast, the way the Court looks at it, that's all it was?"
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,345.709,345.868,That's right.
1970.125,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,345.868,347.653,And priorities.
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,347.653,369.755,"That's exactly right and prior to several years ago, I believe in 1965 when the Third Circuit decided the Connecticut Motor Lines case, every court that had looked into this and all the commentators as I shall shortly view the question as not one of priorities but simply the recognition of a trust and not a matter of relative priorities."
1970.125,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,370.088,372.461,I think the question becomes to the trust to be --
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,372.461,373.644,"Yes, is it --"
1970.125,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,373.644,374.902,It is here because they raise --
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,374.902,395.094,"Exactly, exactly that is precisely what I think is important to show and what we are really alarmed about in this decision is the fact that the Court of Appeals viewed these trust assets as debts and viewed this case as a matter of priorities between conflicting administrative expenses."
1970.125,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,395.25,404.007,"Mr. Stone, on your theory the bankrupt estate is really enjoying the windfall if it prevails here is it not?"
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,404.007,430.84,That's right Mr. Justice Blackmun though it is hard to trace as I intend to discuss at length that is hard to trace precisely what happen to the funds one likely illogical assumption is that this trust fund has simply been added to the amount of assets available to the collection of the bankrupt's creditors and therefore collection from those assets would be windfall to those creditors.
1970.125,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,430.84,444.986,"But the trust fund you're talking about is in every case of this kind is a fund that arises from the bankrupt's asset themselves, from the bankrupt's own assets."
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,444.986,445.543,That's right.
1970.125,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,445.543,459.175,It's just something that he paid wages but he wrote checks to his employees for an amount left than they're -- what they were --
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,459.175,459.608,That's right.
1970.125,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,459.608,461.535,-- paid and so he just kept the rest.
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,461.535,462.175,That's right and so --
1970.125,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,462.175,465.993,And so there's never been a transfer creation of the trust fund?
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,465.993,473.214,"No, though it was ordered by the referee and it was ordered by the referee that the trustee make a transfer at the time he paid the wages."
1970.125,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,473.214,473.991,He never did.
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,473.991,475.662,"In fact, he never did."
1970.125,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,475.662,475.921,He never did.
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,475.921,495.481,And one of the points which I plan to address myself to is whether the enjoyment of the trust ought to be defeated by the fact that the trustee never did make these deposits and so that all that we're really talking about is whether a trust ought to be imposed on general assets of the bankrupt estate.
1970.125,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,514.496,536.19,"But on your theory, this statute along with the order of the court impresses a constructive trust on the total receipts of the bankrupt and regards him as having done what he had been ordered to do, is that --"
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,536.19,537.787,That's exactly right.
1970.125,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,695.787,699.077,"Mr. Stone, let me test your argument with the hypothetical case."
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,699.077,699.856,Yes.
1970.125,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,699.856,701.251,If I may.
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,742.873,745.315,"That is a very different case from the one we're facing Mr. Chief Justice, for it."
1970.125,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,745.315,745.419,Oh!
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,746.633,755.659,But -- and I think that I'm not sure what the answer to that question is perhaps not but I don't think that controls the instant case for the following reason.
1970.125,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,755.659,763.562,"No, what I'm driving at is, I was trying to setup a hypothesis where you could identify --"
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,763.562,766.255,If you can identify the raise of this trust --
1970.125,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,766.255,768.343,You can trace it all the way to -- you can trace it all the way to Argentina now.
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,768.343,783.414,"If you can identify the raise of this trust, I at the moment find no argument against the proposition that the general assets of the creditors of this company ought then to be subject of the Government's tax claim."
1970.125,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,800.721,807.636,"Incidentally Mr. Stone, I gather the employees get credit for the amount--"
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,807.636,808.024,That's right.
1970.125,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,808.024,810.287,-- on the books indicated as withheld from the --
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,810.287,821.465,"That's right Mr. Justice Brennan, their liability with respect to those withheld funds is discharge that the time wages are paid and taxes withheld from those wages which we think identifies --"
1970.125,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,821.465,823.295,Without payment over by the employer.
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,823.295,828.726,That's right there and similarly if any refund is owed.
1970.125,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,832.568,837.328,"Well, the point is that nothing in the way of the trust involved here for the employees."
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,837.328,838.693,"No, it's a trust for the Government."
1970.125,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,838.693,839.698,Only for Uncle Sam.
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,839.698,840.735,Only for the Government.
1970.125,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,972.658,977.742,"Mr. Stone, we're really in a situation here of tension between the two statutes, aren't we?"
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,977.742,996.724,My precise point Mr. Justice Blackmun is that we are not in the state of tension between these two statutes for the reason that though the Court of Appeals certainly felt we were for the reason that Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act has nothing to do with trust funds.
1970.125,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,996.724,996.885,"Well, this --"
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,996.885,1011.944,"It deals with administrative expenses of the bankrupt estate and unless you can at some point identify withheld taxes as tax debts of the employers, there is no tension because Section 64 has no bearing on those amount."
1970.125,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1011.944,1013.296,This has to be your position.
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1023.905,1026.637,"Section 64, The Bankruptcy Act is the older of the two."
1970.125,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1026.637,1032.189,So that the other one which is I recall came in about 1934 is the newer one?
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1032.189,1032.96,Right.
1970.125,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1032.96,1036.436,Does this lend you any support at all?
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1036.436,1039.557,"Well, it lends -- I think it does lend us some support."
1970.125,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1056.49,1060.177,Do you know what prompted at its birth (Inaudible)?
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1060.177,1062.498,The institution of the trust fund?
1970.125,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1062.498,1063.148,Yes.
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1063.148,1063.86,Provision?
1970.125,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1096.778,1103.033,Am I correct that this statute come in to being before withholding was established?
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1103.033,1105.575,Withholding of income tax was after.
1970.125,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1121.892,1130.624,Well then your view isn't the Trust Section imperative to the integrity of the Social Security Act structure?
1970.125,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1130.624,1135.847,It is imperative to the structure of the Social Security Act and to the withholding of income taxes.
1970.125,1,33840,kevin_j_gillogly,,1599.964,1600.422,"Yes, sir."
1970.125,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1600.422,1612.73,Suppose I would assume that a large employer like General Motors or others of that category probably have it any given day millions of dollars in the segregated account.
1970.125,1,33840,kevin_j_gillogly,,1628.774,1633.241,I would say under the existing law it would be the United States Government.
1970.125,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1633.241,1636.538,And would they be the legal owner only or the equitable?
1970.125,1,33840,kevin_j_gillogly,,1636.538,1639.568,"Well, I would say the legal owner under the trust theory."
1970.125,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1639.568,1639.867,Yes.
1970.125,1,33840,kevin_j_gillogly,,1639.867,1644.588,The legal title of course is in the holder of funds and the equitable title would be in the United States Government.
1970.125,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1644.588,1655.921,"Well, don't you think the equitable title would vest in the employees if the Act had been repealed?"
1970.125,1,33840,kevin_j_gillogly,,1657.595,1657.786,Oh!
1970.125,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1658.794,1659.284,That's right.
1970.125,1,33840,kevin_j_gillogly,,1659.651,1660.963,I'm sorry.
1970.125,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1665.537,1666.359,Employees.
1970.125,1,33840,kevin_j_gillogly,,1680.226,1680.92,"Yes, sir."
1970.125,2,40553,richard_b_stone,,3111.647,3113.547,"Yes, I'll just take a minute Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.125,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3145.35,3146.842,"He doesn't need it, has he?"
1970.125,2,40553,richard_b_stone,,3146.842,3147.464,Has a trust.
1970.125,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3149.472,3155.848,Or you can say that he doesn't need it because of his estate?
1970.125,2,40553,richard_b_stone,,3155.848,3160.895,That I suppose is an undesirable but albeit an alternative.
1970.125,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3160.895,3162.829,How about this (Inaudible)?
1970.125,2,40553,richard_b_stone,,3162.829,3163.431,Oh!
1970.125,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3265.175,3274.732,What do you say about subject liable in so far as it says that taxes withheld by the employers will be collected by the same procedures?
1970.125,2,40553,richard_b_stone,,3274.732,3277.476,We have dealt with that in length in our brief Mr. Justice White.
1970.125,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.839,3308.527,Accumulated?
1970.125,2,40553,richard_b_stone,,3308.527,3308.822,Right.
1970.125,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3350.822,3352.121,Thank you Mr. Stone.
