2009.09-6338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.591,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-6338, Dillon v. United States."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,7.651,11.086,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.09-6338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,80.669,90.009,"What if the sentencing commission just issued a new guideline and said: Anyone with a -- a crack sentence, their sentence is going to be reduced by 10 percent."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,91.634,95.585,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I think it would present precisely the same problems here."
2009.09-6338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,109.264,113.514,But there's no -- but 3553(a) doesn't even come into play under my hypothetical.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,113.514,114.809,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2009.09-6338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,114.809,119.512,"3553(a) doesn't even come into play, so there's not a resentencing by a judge."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,123.509,132.942,"I disagree, Your Honor, because Congress in this case decided to enact a statute, 3582(c), that invokes the discretionary sentencing power of the court."
2009.09-6338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,132.942,134.112,"Right, in -- in this case."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,144.108,162.93,"And, Your Honor, perhaps I misunderstood, but once the sentencing commission acts to revise a guideline under its power under 994(u) and opts to make that amendment retroactive under -- I mean 994(o) -- and opts to make it retroactive under 994(u), only the court has power to lower a sentence."
2009.09-6338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,163.491,164.349,Why is that?
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,187.575,190.012,"--And Justice -- Justice Kennedy, I think there would be."
2009.09-6338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,207.003,209.05,But the -- the hypothetical is Congress doesn't do this.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,217.325,230.713,"--Your Honor -- Your Honor, if Congress chose to draft a statute similar to 3624(b) to empower the Bureau of Prisons to act whenever the commission lowered a guideline or -- or changed a guideline under 994(o), I agree with Your Honor."
2009.09-6338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,232.195,232.709,Okay.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,236.691,240.797,"The difference, again -- and I don't mean to be dodging your questions."
2009.09-6338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,257.806,275.752,What is the constitutional difference that would ignore a Sixth Amendment right in the resentencing by the court that doesn't when it's a resentencing or a modification of a sentence by the Bureau of Prisons?
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,275.752,290.762,"--Justice Sotomayor, I think the difference would be that when it is delegated to the courts under a statute like 3582(c), the court is then dealing with a mandatory guideline range, and the Sixth Amendment problem arises when the court sentences the--"
2009.09-6338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,290.762,298.556,"But is this truly a new sentence -- meaning a person serving a sentence, this is an act of clemency."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,313.128,321.377,"--Justice Sotomayor, I disagree with the premise of your question that this is an act of clemency similar to the reductions for good time behavior."
2009.09-6338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,331.48,340.6,"Ms. Freeland, may I take you on another path, not the question of the difference between the two -- two sections."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,392.593,397.323,"--Justice Ginsburg, I have a couple of responses to your question."
2009.09-6338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,423.438,439.481,"But why should, bearing in mind that entire prison population similarly situated, the courts say the finality bar is lifted only to the extent that the crack cocaine guideline disparity has been reduced?"
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,439.481,448.57,"And, Your Honor, once the finality bar is lifted, the concerns about retroactivity should slip away."
2009.09-6338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,492.051,510.186,"If you -- if you are right that this benefit goes to -- only to the classic can you get in the door, wouldn't that be a powerful motive to the sentencing commission not to make its guidelines reductions retroactive?"
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,510.186,512.636,"Your Honor, I would certainly hope not."
2009.09-6338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,547.575,548.202,It wouldn't say that.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,549.575,552.215,"You are right, Your Honor."
2009.09-6338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.57,564.679,"Well, it is certainly a factor that if I were -- if I were on the commission, I would certainly take that factor into account."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,576.127,576.689,"Well, Your Honor--"
2009.09-6338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.689,579.516,--if I am making the retroactivity determination?
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,579.516,585.041,"--Your Honor, if I could, I am not suggesting that the commission close its eyes to anything."
2009.09-6338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,599.255,599.692,Only Booker?
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,599.692,600.456,And that means--
2009.09-6338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,600.456,601.517,Only Booker?
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,616.418,618.758,"--Your Honor, I would have to say that it is."
2009.09-6338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,619.713,620.461,"Yes, you would you have to say so--"
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,620.461,623.492,--The sentence imposed would have to comply with the Constitution.
2009.09-6338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,623.492,628.737,--So it's not only as unfair as Justice Ginsburg hypothesized.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,642.888,662.194,"That's true, Mr. Chief Justice, but that's the case in any situation where a defendant has raised an issue on appeal or has presented a claim in a 2255 petition, and just by happenstance the decision awarding them a new -- a new trial or a new sentence happens when a new constitutional rule is announced by this Court."
2009.09-6338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,662.678,663.992,"Well, that's a new constitutional rule."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,676.44,686.324,"--And again, Your Honor, I think that he would get to raise it, but I want to point out that not every constitutional issue would be ripe for the court's decision at that proceeding."
2009.09-6338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,701.128,701.565,"Oh, no, no, no."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,708.533,711.017,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I must have misspoken."
2009.09-6338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,734.098,736.177,And my point is that they shouldn't under your theory.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,747.236,752.282,"I disagree, Your Honor, that my theory does not encompass that part of the rule."
2009.09-6338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,764.355,766.96,"Well, why do you -- why do you pick on -- on Booker as -- as not carrying over?"
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,789.2,802.68,"--Well, Your Honor, if the law of the case were in place before Booker was decided, the new law would be an exception to the law of the case if Mr. Dillon were resentenced as he were after the Court's decision in Booker."
2009.09-6338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,817.751,838.259,"Under your theory there is no bar to an upward sentence by the -- by the judge, because if it's a brand new hearing subject to Booker, which mandates complete discretion under 3553, the judges define the sentence that fits the crime and the defendant."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,840.146,846.503,"Well, under 3582(c), Your Honor, the statute -- the statute provides that--"
2009.09-6338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,846.503,850.063,"--You only want part of the statute, not the whole statute?"
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,850.063,853.609,"--Your Honor, I think we want the whole statute, the statute--"
2009.09-6338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,853.609,856.451,"If you want the whole statute, then it's a new sentence."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,864.398,864.71,--Your Honor--
2009.09-6338,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,864.71,865.022,It doesn't make sense.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,865.022,866.426,--I think I understand your point.
2009.09-6338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,880.234,883.826,So what's -- what's the -- the words in the statute is that it may reduce the term.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,896.522,898.741,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.09-6338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,898.741,899.911,Do you see anything -- what's -- what's unconstitutional about that?
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,919.529,927.601,"Your Honor, post-Booker what violates the Constitution is the policy statement's use of the word ""shall""."
2009.09-6338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,929.617,929.944,I don't remember.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,960.978,965.99,"--Your Honor, in our view 3582(c) is not unconstitutional."
2009.09-6338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,965.99,966.364,All right.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,992.353,1002.66,"Justice Breyer, post-Booker if 3582(c) is interpreted as you just said, that the sentence -- the reduction in sentence must be consistent with a particular policy statement--"
2009.09-6338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1002.66,1003.018,That's what it says.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1006.173,1013.123,--And that the -- and that the policy statement then requires the court to impose a mandatory guideline sentence--
2009.09-6338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1013.123,1024.193,"No, it just says what we're doing is we are reopening the sentencing in respect to the particular way we reduce people's sentence, not in respect to something else."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1051.498,1067.115,"--The Constitution -- Your Honor, if I could, the constitutional problem with Section 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) is that it requires the district court to impose a sentence within the guideline range."
2009.09-6338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1084.608,1099.555,"Ms. Freeland, what would happen if the -- the motion is made with respect to the crack cocaine, and the judge said, I'm -- I'm not going to -- I deny the motion."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1116.203,1128.478,"Your Honor, if I could, if a judge is presented with a 3582(c) motion and denies the motion, all the court has done is enter an order denying a motion."
2009.09-6338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1144.676,1160.402,"Well, if -- suppose Congress and the sentencing commission had made it crystal clear that they are authorizing a reopening but only with respect to one piece."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1174.804,1175.241,Justice Ginsburg--
2009.09-6338,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1175.241,1175.584,--consideration?
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1175.584,1176.882,"--Justice Ginsburg, that is correct."
2009.09-6338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1210.835,1214.287,I have a better answer to Justice Breyer's question.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1215.601,1217.098,"Please, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-6338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.098,1217.395,Sure.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1255.067,1256.253,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2009.09-6338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1256.253,1265.546,And your point here is that the policy statement which says you effectively will disregard Booker is unconstitutional?
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1265.546,1266.654,I agree.
2009.09-6338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.654,1267.371,"That works, doesn't it?"
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1267.371,1267.902,I agree.
2009.09-6338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1268.686,1269.044,You agree.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1331.249,1334.077,"--And, Justice Breyer, I apologize because I may not be--"
2009.09-6338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1334.077,1335.889,"No, no, you don't have to apologize."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1335.889,1336.279,--I may not be understanding your question.
2009.09-6338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1336.279,1337.777,I understand your argument now.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1341.446,1342.713,Okay.
2009.09-6338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1343.384,1344.932,You wanted to get the idea in my mind.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1347.725,1348.414,"--Okay, thank you."
2009.09-6338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1394.409,1394.986,I'm sorry.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1400.376,1415.244,"--Under 3621 it's very clear that the -- the Bureau of Prisons, absent a reduction under 3624(b) for good time, is directed to hold the defendant in the custody of Bureau of Prisons for the term of imprisonment on the judgment."
2009.09-6338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.118,1421.756,What -- what if the President reduces the sentence using his pardoning power?
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1430.955,1434.032,"--Justice Scalia, I'm certain that that's not true."
2009.09-6338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1437.031,1437.721,So why is this any different?
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1437.721,1438.938,--with this provision.
2009.09-6338,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.938,1440.139,Why is this any different?
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1468.113,1473.706,"And again, Your Honor, I'm not familiar with the clemency and commutation procedures."
2009.09-6338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1500.148,1501.271,That is what it says.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1512.237,1513.017,I agree.
2009.09-6338,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1513.017,1531.992,"And I don't know why they couldn't take into account that to make any drug-related change, you see, and then make that retroactive, is going to reopen the sentencing for every single person who has already been convicted of a drug crime in the Federal courts, of which there are probably tens of thousands."
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1540.13,1557.577,"Your Honor, the -- the practice in the court of appeals post-Booker of remanding all of the cases that were in the pipeline shows that the Federal courts are able to handle revisiting thousands of sentences imposed under a mandatory system to revisit them under 3353(a)."
2009.09-6338,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1572.259,1576.006,I will make this brief because your -- your rebuttal light is on.
2009.09-6338,0,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,1594.638,1614.63,"(b) does apply to (c), Your Honor, and I'm glad that you raised that because 3582(b) is significant in that it does not distinguish the effect of finality of remands, modifications under 3582(c); it's the judgment of conviction -- the conviction that remains final."
2009.09-6338,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1624.672,1625.873,"Thank you, Miss Freeland."
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1632.732,1644.555,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act at issue in this case, unlike the provisions that were at issue in Booker, do not govern the imposition of sentence."
2009.09-6338,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1685.239,1698.965,"Does that extend to -- which was part of this case -- the court notices that there was a technical error; it was a calculation error the first time, and the judge says, well, I will fix that up, too."
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1702.385,1708.102,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the same rule applies to the calculation error that Petitioner is raising."
2009.09-6338,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1793.583,1810.48,"Well, that gets tied up, doesn't it, to your argument that this is not a part of the criminal prosecution, that this is -- not a Sixth Amendment proceeding, but some -- not a Sixth Amendment proceeding, so it doesn't require constitutional protection?"
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1810.48,1812.777,"That's correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.09-6338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1848.029,1854.946,Am I correct in understanding that 3582(c) was enacted prior to our decision in Booker?
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1854.946,1856.228,"Yes, it -- it was."
2009.09-6338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1856.228,1868.301,"And is it clear that it should be construed as though the system was mandatory before the decision in Booker, rather than construed in the light of the remedial decision in Booker?"
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1868.301,1876.327,"Well, I think there are two questions that are raised here about how this statutory scheme comports with Booker."
2009.09-6338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1918.469,1919.031,Right.
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1924.513,1931.618,"I'm not sure whether or not it's a more dramatic change in terms of the number of case that is would be affected, but it--"
2009.09-6338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1931.618,1944.397,"The remedial opinion basically rewrote the whole statute on -- except that it didn't have to reach 3582(c)(2), but it certainly changed the -- the nature of the mandatory provisions that were previously in the statute."
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1944.397,1954.484,"--That's true, and it did so in order to solve the constitutional difficulties that were created by a mandatory guidelines system with respect to the imposition of sentence."
2009.09-6338,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2024.722,2034.951,"Have there been other guidelines ranges that have been reduced, and if so were those also retroactive?"
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2034.951,2043.12,"There have -- there have been many guidelines, ranges that have been reduced over the course of the existence of the sentencing guidelines."
2009.09-6338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2085.461,2091.821,Can -- can I ask you a different question on the secondary argument that they make?
2009.09-6338,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2106.58,2112.828,"I think you told me -- I asked you that question, and you told me it could not be corrected, because everything was final."
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2112.828,2114.544,That's correct--
2009.09-6338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2114.544,2115.121,Why?
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2115.121,2116.747,--and the policy statement actually also--
2009.09-6338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2116.747,2118.354,What in the policy statement?
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2161.728,2165.635,--It's on page -- if you look at page 8A of the appendix--
2009.09-6338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2165.635,2166.212,I have it.
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2166.883,2168.459,"--In the final sentence, it says,"
2009.09-6338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2179.456,2193.84,"Well, all other guideline application decisions, their claim is that they just made an error, like a clerical error, a clear error, manifest injustice, in that first math."
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2197.634,2198.633,I do.
2009.09-6338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2198.633,2199.557,Yes.
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2199.557,2203.008,I think that that is the plain meaning of the sentencing commission's directive there.
2009.09-6338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2203.008,2207.895,"I guess they also made a mistake in not applying Booker, right?"
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2207.895,2212.238,"Well, the premise of that question, I think, assumes two things."
2009.09-6338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2221.656,2230.807,"I would have thought the objection to that is: No, they didn't make a mistake in applying Booker, because this Court has said that Booker isn't retroactive."
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2241.523,2248.534,"--Well, if Booker were retroactive, I think that our position would still be that this is not the proper vehicle for applying it."
2009.09-6338,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2267.65,2273.46,I know my word was: It shall leave all other guideline application decisions.
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2291.53,2294.872,"--I think you may be working a little hard, Justice Breyer."
2009.09-6338,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2323.752,2337.857,"When the judge considers the adjustment motion under the -- under the section, does he consider how the prisoner has behaved in prison; i.e., if he has behaved very badly, he doesn't give the -- the reduction?"
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2337.857,2345.789,"The district court can consider any disciplinary proceedings that have occurred in the course of the defendant's imprisonment, yes."
2009.09-6338,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2345.789,2347.882,But he -- but he cannot go below.
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2372.887,2386.46,"I mean, I think that that certainly reinforces the conclusion that I think also arises from other aspects of the provision that -- what Congress had in mind was not the imposition of a brand-new sentence, but simply a discretionary reduction of the old one."
2009.09-6338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2388.336,2398.33,"I am troubled by your response to Justice Kennedy's previous question, that the judge can take into account conduct in prison and all these other things."
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2407.998,2438.627,"Well, I think the answer to that question is resolved by looking at the plain text of 3582(c)(2), Mr. Chief Justice, which directs that district courts have a discretion to reduce sentences in a manner that is consistent with applicable policy statements, but after considering the statutory sentencing factors under section 3553(a), which includes, of course, the need to protect the public from future crimes committed by the defendant, as well as the history and characteristics of the prisoner."
2009.09-6338,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2457.822,2458.808,It's a one-way ratchet?
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2458.808,2460.946,Effectively.
2009.09-6338,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2478.188,2482.486,The Petitioner's brief opens with a statement about his rehabilitation.
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2501.274,2505.521,"I am not aware of the answer to that, Justice Kennedy."
2009.09-6338,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2511.864,2515.503,"And isn't the population of prisoners in the Federal prisons about 185,000 now?"
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2515.503,2517.063,--I think--
2009.09-6338,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2517.063,2517.799,I think it is.
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2531.245,2534.914,"--I -- I'm not prepared to speak to that question today, Justice Kennedy."
2009.09-6338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2561.716,2562.827,May I ask this question?
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2605.23,2622.755,The reason why the commission doesn't do that is because it wouldn't comply with its statutory mandate under 29 U.S.C. 994(u) to specify both which guidelines amendments justify retroactive application and the amount by which sentences may be reduced.
2009.09-6338,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2632.265,2635.42,"You think that the statute would have prohibited a more generous policy statement, then?"
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2635.42,2637.904,I think the statute would have prohibited such a policy statement.
2009.09-6338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2639.624,2662.331,"I -- I still don't understand how you fit into that your answer to the Chief Justice earlier that, in fact, the Court can consider other factors in -- in 3553(a) when it's making the reduction."
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2662.331,2677.356,"Justice Scalia, I think the answer is simply that the 3553(a) factors and their consideration under 3582(c)(2) is designed for a different purpose than for the consideration that goes into the initial imposition of the sentence."
2009.09-6338,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2708.767,2709.905,I see.
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2722.15,2725.306,"It's a factor that would cause you to permit the reduction, presumably."
2009.09-6338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2737.347,2745.516,But it -- it's also a factor that would -- might guide the district court to a decision not to reduce the sentence.
2009.09-6338,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2745.516,2746.686,That's correct.
2009.09-6338,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2777.55,2778.673,"Thank you, Ms. Kruger."
2009.09-6338,2,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,2782.281,2786.251,"I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice, how many minutes?"
2009.09-6338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2786.251,2786.672,Three.
2009.09-6338,2,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,2786.672,2787.623,"Three minutes, thank you."
2009.09-6338,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2858.766,2860.953,Can I get you to go back?
2009.09-6338,2,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,2893.252,2893.908,Justice Ginsburg -- I'm sorry.
2009.09-6338,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2893.908,2898.657,--Did your answer exclude that -- that possibility?
2009.09-6338,2,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,2898.657,2914.447,"Justice Ginsburg, your hypothetical, the court is imposing a sentence or conditions of a sentence, and once those conditions have been met, the defendant is relieved, just as when the conditions of a sentence of imprisonment have been met, the defendant is released from prison."
2009.09-6338,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2958.679,2961.038,"Yes, but they do if Congress says they do."
2009.09-6338,2,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,2961.038,2966.63,"When Congress says consistent with policy statements -- and, Your Honor, I would direct you -- I see my red light is on, if I could finish--"
2009.09-6338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2966.63,2967.597,You can answer Justice Breyer's question.
2009.09-6338,2,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,2967.597,2975.594,--I would direct you to the amicus brief on behalf of the defenders at pages 23 and 24 and our reply brief at pages 25 and 26.
2009.09-6338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2975.594,2976.718,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-6338,2,34431,lisa_b_freeland,,2976.718,2977.47,Thank you very much.
2009.09-6338,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2977.47,2978.843,The case is submitted.
