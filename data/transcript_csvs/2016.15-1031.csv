2016.15-1031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.14,"We'll hear argument next in Case 15-1031, Howell v. Howell. Mr. Unikowsky."
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,8.14,23.11,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Mansell v. Mansell, this Court held that the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act does not authorize State courts to treat waived Military Retirement Pay as divisible property in divorce."
2016.15-1031,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,70.77,100.815,"Suppose that what the court had said is, taking a look at what the retirement pay is now, how much it is total, and had specified then a dollar amount for the wife equivalent to what the half was before the disability benefits, that would be okay; and if it takes disability later, she still keeps the amount that was awarded, the dollar amount."
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,100.815,101.93,"So, I'm sorry."
2016.15-1031,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,115.87,116.2,No.
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,158.17,166.2,"So I -- if -- if that was a settlement, then I think that it would be enforceable. Our position today has nothing to do with the enforcement of settlements."
2016.15-1031,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,200.87,205.47,So could she go back to court now and ask for a dollar figure instead?
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,205.47,213.56,"I -- I don't think so, because I think that that would be a modification imposed by the court that would be -- that Petitioner never agreed to, so he's never waived this protection over --"
2016.15-1031,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,213.56,225.49,She can't go back into court -- I thought in divorce courts you can go back and change circumstances and seek a modification of the monetary awards.
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,226.915,237.66,"Well, I think the question is whether this particular type of changed circumstance, which is a waiver of Military Retirement Pay, authorizes this particular remedy, which is this indemnification order."
2016.15-1031,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,237.66,245.485,Is -- is the answer that there's a difference in adjusting alimony payments and property -- and -- and property settlements that have been concluded?
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,245.485,247.41,"Yes, Justice Kennedy. Absolutely."
2016.15-1031,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,262.87,272.47,An alimony is something that one spouse pays to the other based on economic need.
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,291.37,291.95,Yes.
2016.15-1031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,306.63,314.485,"This -- this is a pretty basic question I should know the answer to, but when you talk about dividing the property, is that by any proportion?"
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,314.485,315.16,Yes --
2016.15-1031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,315.16,317.855,You get two-thirds/one-third? It's not -- doesn't have to be 50/50?
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,317.855,318.38,That's correct.
2016.15-1031,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,336.01,361.935,"Is it under the community property law that the 50 percent that the spouse received of the retirement pay was hers even if they hadn't been divorced? In other words, what is community property? I thought community property is the two spouses' interest in the property, each of which owns half from day one."
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,363.67,364.36,Yes.
2016.15-1031,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,370.16,370.44,So is -- is --
2016.15-1031,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,370.44,372.38,You're not -- I'm not arguing for you.
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,379.82,380.31,Yes.
2016.15-1031,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,381.96,390.22,So how could he take any action that impinges on what's her money or her property right?
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,390.22,390.81,Well --
2016.15-1031,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,390.81,417.475,"I -- I think that's the U.S.'s position and your adversary's, which is, if, as a result of the original settlement divorce decree, it became her property, what right did he have any -- to take any action that would remove that property or take it away from her?"
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,417.475,420.435,"Well, I think the question is what is her property right."
2016.15-1031,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,486.3,511.35,"What about them saying we divided the property based on a certain expectation that the wife would have so much, and now, because the amount is lower, then the divorce decree should be reopened so we can give her more of another asset to make up for what she's missing."
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,511.35,532.42,"So I think that reopening the decree to just give her another asset would be -- which is essentially what happened in this case -- would be preempted by Federal law. Now, we're not saying Federal law preempts the situation where State court says: Okay, when we find as a matter of State law that the ex-spouse just didn't understand what she was signing, there's some kind of mutual mistake. So if -- the reopening of the decree would not be preempted."
2016.15-1031,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,541.25,553.2,What would be noncomplying with Federal law if you reopened the divorce decree and the judge says now you get a share -- a larger share of some other property?
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,553.2,583.57,"Well, I think that that would essentially render Mansell a -- a dead letter because, you know, just returning to the pre-divorce context, the effects of Mansell where the waiver happened before the divorce, it seems to me that if a divorce court just said, I'm going to raise the equitable share by the exact amount of the waiver because I just don't agree with Mansell and I want to nullify it, I mean, that would just directly conflict with the whole point of Mansell's holding, which is that the waiver of the retirement pay lowers the amount of divisible property. I'd also hasten to add that that -- that is not what happened here."
2016.15-1031,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,598.42,616.69,"But could a court say, well, in light of the fact that the woman is not getting the usual community property division, that that factor could -- that that could factor into the determination of alimony or the determination of child support?"
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,616.69,618.44,"So I think it actually could, yes."
2016.15-1031,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,660.095,672.57,"Well, as I pointed out, those are different animals then that -- the -- the property belongs to her, alimony and child support. And alimony, suppose she remarries."
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,674.065,674.58,Correct.
2016.15-1031,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,784.95,816.965,"The problem is, really, that when people are getting divorced and they already know they can't divide up the disability pay, that the courts have a full picture and can then determine alimony and child custody with those factors in mind. And we presume that, at the time of their divorce, this woman was relying on a certain amount of income that would be fixed for the rest of her life, and she planned her life around that income."
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,844.515,845.16,Well --
2016.15-1031,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,845.16,856.279,"-- and one that, you know, the government is taking the position that if you're doing this post-divorce, you're changing the nature of the policy."
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,856.279,862.89,I -- I think that all we're asking for is for parallel treatment in the pre-divorce context and the post-divorce context.
2016.15-1031,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,862.89,863.06,No.
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,866.885,867.63,"Well, I think --"
2016.15-1031,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,867.63,876.255,"I don't -- I mean, I don't know the answer legally, but is -- there is a difference in terms of what Congress might have expected or not expected."
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,876.255,882.29,"Well, first of all, it's not really clear to me that the policy interests are so much stronger post-divorce than pre-divorce."
2016.15-1031,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,897.53,897.67,Sure.
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,903.64,911.54,"Well, then, that -- they may get made up in alimony and child support, but there's -- you know, the deprivation of property in that case has it's own harshness. Now, I think there's a difference --"
2016.15-1031,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,911.54,920.305,"But the point is the divorce court will know if he's already getting disability pay, then her share of the pension will be so much less."
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,927.115,932.52,So I don't think the divorce court can do that in that context because then Mansell would be essentially a dead letter.
2016.15-1031,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,943.785,944.04,Well --
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,944.04,944.805,-- we think they don't have --
2016.15-1031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,944.805,946.64,The judge doesn't have to say that.
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,946.64,948.14,"Well, I mean -- I mean --"
2016.15-1031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,948.14,954.17,"Right? I mean, the alimony -- they're all -- there's not a set number that this has to be."
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,970.525,971.46,That may be.
2016.15-1031,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,989.27,1006.04,"But sorry to come back to this, Mr. Unikowski, but you are making a distinction, right, that the court can take into account this rule when it's setting alimony and child support? It just can't take into account this rule when distributing other kinds of property; is that right?"
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1006.04,1006.3,Right.
2016.15-1031,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1008.36,1008.48,Right.
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1008.48,1009.72,-- is not really a property distribution.
2016.15-1031,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1009.72,1009.82,Right.
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1014.53,1014.94,Yes.
2016.15-1031,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1016.235,1021.425,"And -- and this rule can be taken into account in the former, but not in the latter."
2016.15-1031,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1021.425,1021.79,Right.
2016.15-1031,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1029.215,1041.03,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wirken."
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1041.03,1056.485,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The authority granted to the States by the Former Spouses Protection Act to treat -- to treat marital -- to treat Military Retirement Pay as property and divide it necessarily operates at the time of the divorce."
2016.15-1031,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1168.8,1169.09,What --
2016.15-1031,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1169.09,1181.345,"What is the general answer to that? I mean, it -- I gather there's a distinction between the finality of division of -- with respect to property, as opposed to some other -- as opposed to cash, I guess, or -- or income."
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1182.87,1192.365,"I think the -- I think the general answer, Your Honor, is that the a decree dividing -- to the extent it divides property is final. And for good reason."
2016.15-1031,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1269.11,1274.28,So suppose the only asset is the pension.
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1278.485,1280.14,I'm sorry.
2016.15-1031,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1282.11,1283.94,The retirement is the only asset.
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1283.94,1286.545,And your question is what?
2016.15-1031,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1286.545,1289.965,Then -- then what -- would the family court's order here be proper?
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1289.965,1291.035,Yes.
2016.15-1031,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1310.12,1350.445,"Well, how do you deal with your adversary's position that her borrowing from our prior case that the only reasonable expectation that the Court or she could have had was that his military pay was always subject to a potential deduction for disability pay? That's basically his argument, that the act tells anyone relying on military pay that it can, as a matter of law, be changed by a disability award."
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1350.445,1352.72,"I disagree with my friend, because --"
2016.15-1031,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1352.72,1353.32,I know you do.
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1355.16,1363.285,"Well -- well, Congress gave the States the right to treat this kind of property according to State law."
2016.15-1031,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1417.95,1424.185,"Suppose it turns out that in time one, we enter a divorce decree."
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1468.905,1471.48,"Well, as I understand your hypothetical --"
2016.15-1031,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1471.48,1473.495,Maybe it's too complicated.
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1473.495,1475.56,You're talking about a State court --
2016.15-1031,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1475.56,1486.01,"I'm saying there's a Federal law here, and the Federal law says: I'm very sorry, you cannot give this money to the spouse, for good reason or bad, perhaps bad."
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1496.315,1505.25,"And there are two things going on here, and -- and one of them is at the time of this divorce and many divorces, there is no disability benefit --"
2016.15-1031,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1505.25,1505.83,"Yes, there is."
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1505.83,1506.22,-- paid.
2016.15-1031,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1506.22,1507.38,There is a disability.
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1526.23,1526.67,No.
2016.15-1031,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1534.58,1534.89,No.
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1577.855,1597.19,"The statute in Subsection D(1) in the last sentence contemplates the division of military retirement pay even before the service member has retired, and, therefore, before there could have been any waiver and any disability benefits taken."
2016.15-1031,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1597.19,1598.185,That's true.
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1624.98,1627.57,And -- and I respectfully must disagree --
2016.15-1031,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1627.57,1628.06,That's fine.
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1628.06,1633.9,"-- because it also says -- it doesn't speak in -- in the form of a contingency, as I read it."
2016.15-1031,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1636.53,1636.74,I know.
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1636.74,1641.93,"-- to divide the -- the retirement pay, according to State law, at the time of the divorce."
2016.15-1031,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1681.83,1708.08,"Why isn't your solution, and I think you're saying when he elects the disability, when -- when he does that, then the State court can provide an indemnification for her that's equal to the amount that she's losing."
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1714.7,1715.465,No.
2016.15-1031,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1715.465,1716.705,Why not?
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1716.705,1721.65,Because it's not a -- it's not a division of any disability pay.
2016.15-1031,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1757.53,1757.95,"Well -- well, that's --"
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1757.95,1759.645,It -- it was an enforcement.
2016.15-1031,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1759.645,1772.78,"Maybe this isn't that, but that -- that's very legalistic in the sense that you're saying well, you can't divide this, but you have to pay her money so that's she's put in the same position as if you'd divided this. Is that your suggestion?"
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1772.78,1773.27,"Well, no."
2016.15-1031,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1791.98,1792.94,"Well, if I were --"
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1792.94,1796.06,-- remedy for a lesser or greater amount than what she lost.
2016.15-1031,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1796.06,1811.73,"If I were a legislator and I passed this law for a particular purpose, and at the end of the day the result is the same as if the law hadn't had any -- it has no practical effect at all, I would think that's contrary to -- to what the legislation was designed to accomplish."
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1811.73,1824.65,But you as a legislature sitting across the street adopted this to protect that spouse and to enable States to divide the retirement pay as property according to State law at the time of the divorce.
2016.15-1031,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1824.74,1830.19,"Well, then maybe I'm the one who insisted on the part of the law that says when it's disability, you don't get to divide that."
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1830.19,1834.54,"If it has already been waived, it cannot be divided."
2016.15-1031,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1876.4,1880.2,But when -- when did -- the disability benefits started how many years after the divorce?
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1880.2,1882.825,"13 or 14, Your Honor."
2016.15-1031,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1882.825,1886.605,"Well, then I mean, I think it's -- it's not like there was a bait and switch involved."
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1886.605,1888.75,Not suggesting that.
2016.15-1031,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1933.28,1938.44,"So the -- the agreement, the court's order I know required him to pay a certain amount."
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1959.37,1960.555,Exactly.
2016.15-1031,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1962.07,1963.8,Where he gets it from it doesn't matter?
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1963.8,1972.31,"And where -- where he gets it from, he -- you know, he has his share of the military retirement pay and it can legitimately come from that."
2016.15-1031,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1972.31,1975.1,"And -- and you may not know this, I don't know if it's in the record."
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1979.705,1984.08,"Your Honor, I do not know, and -- and it --"
2016.15-1031,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1984.08,1984.9,More curiosity.
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1984.9,1986.36,-- it is -- it is not in the record.
2016.15-1031,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1989.95,1998.505,"But you said he could pay her this amount, this indemnification out of the disability --"
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,1998.505,2002.669,"He -- no, he can pay it out of his share of the military retirement pay."
2016.15-1031,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2181.1,2197.6,"Well, it's -- concern for former spouses is certainly evident in the Act, but as we've always said, no statute pursues its purpose at all costs, and with obviously a different purpose applicable with respect to the part of the law that says you can't divide disability payments."
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,2205.9,2211.03,"But the primary purpose, according to Congress, was to protect the -- the spouse."
2016.15-1031,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2211.03,2211.56,Yeah.
2016.15-1031,1,62824,charles_w_wirken,,2217.63,2218.69,To be divided.
2016.15-1031,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2246.955,2260.3,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Eisenstein."
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2260.3,2269.285,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me start with the concern that Your Honor has about what the effect of Mansell is under the rule that we propose."
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2324.24,2324.98,Explain this.
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2344.835,2350.11,"So, your Honor, I believe, under your Honor's hypothetical, the answer is yes, but --"
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2350.11,2350.365,Okay.
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2351.61,2354.48,"Yes, but it is up to a State court to determine --"
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2354.48,2356.035,State court says yes. Okay.
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2356.035,2356.52,Yes.
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2356.52,2356.765,Yeah.
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2364.715,2369.12,"So, once again, under -- it depends on State law. So --"
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2369.12,2385.94,"It depends on State law. In other words -- in other words, if you say that 50 percent goes to the wife, 50 percent goes to the husband, and you cut it, then more than 50 percent will go to the wife."
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2385.94,2416.27,"That's right, because -- so let me be clear of what we think the role of the Spousal Protection Act is. The Spousal Protection Act instructs State courts how to calculate the disposable retired pay available for division, and otherwise puts disposable retired pay on equal footing at any other civilian asset so that it allows the State court to treat the disposable retirement pay as any other marital property in a variety of ways. One is it can equitably divide those assets in any way it sees fit, from zero to one hundred percent."
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2416.27,2427.935,"Suppose the statute, it said, following Mansell, that the wife cannot have more than 50 percent of the actual after tax income from retirement."
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2429.525,2431.38,The after tax income from retirement.
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2431.38,2431.71,Yeah.
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2431.71,2436.045,"Well, I think that the state could do, in terms of a remedy, is all they could divide is the --"
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2436.045,2453.86,"I'll tell you what. There's a statute, a federal statute, says if taxes go up, or if the payments are reduced for retirement, under no circumstances can the wife obtain more than the reduced -- half the reduced payment."
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2453.86,2454.49,Right.
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.11,2457.21,And then can the State court do something about that?
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2457.21,2461.03,It couldn't if it limited it to any other sources of income.
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2461.03,2462.95,I'm not keeping that out of it.
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2462.95,2463.39,Right.
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2463.39,2466.12,"I'm saying can the State just say, well, we don't care."
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2479.185,2486.61,"If I understand your Honor's question, which is that there's only military retirement pay, and the question is can the wife get more than 50 percent share of it --"
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2486.61,2488.21,In a state statute that says no.
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2488.21,2489.275,The answer is no.
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2489.275,2489.48,Right.
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2489.48,2489.94,And that would be --
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2489.94,2501.65,"So if that says no, then why, if it goes down because of the choice of the husband, who is protected in this choice by the exception, why is that different."
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2501.65,2511.7,"It's different because there are other assets besides the military -- the disability benefits used to satisfy the indemnification order in this case, and so there's a very --"
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2511.7,2513.405,Is that the only difference?
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2513.405,2515.28,I think that's a significant difference.
2016.15-1031,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2515.28,2515.44,All right.
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2547.975,2555.31,"Well, I think that the economic equivalent is not the only test, and that's the test that Petitioner wants this court to adopt."
2016.15-1031,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2574.01,2588.99,"It seems to me that -- in other words, you're saying -- you're basically saying there's no real substance to this law. All the court has to do is find some charade to get to the same result. I mean, would it be all right under your view if they say, okay, you get 50 percent of -- all the -- no disability payments yet."
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2609.99,2622.36,"Well -- well, your Honor, I think it -- it is -- it is okay to the extent that the court is applying its generally applicable principles of property division to treat the portion that is available under federal law --"
2016.15-1031,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2622.36,2632.9,"The court wants to make sure that the spouse, whether wife or husband, receives half of the military retirement pay, and that -- and going forward."
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2645.805,2646.5,"Well, yes."
2016.15-1031,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2650.695,2661.55,"So you have a law that says -- you have a law that says you can't divide disability pay, and yet, you say it's okay to say, well, I'm not going to divide it, but I'm just going to award you an amount equal to what it would be if I divided it."
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2661.55,2662.13,"Well, let me be clear."
2016.15-1031,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2662.13,2664.79,"That's the sort of thing that gives, you know, law a bad name."
2016.15-1031,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2667.06,2668.72,It makes a charade out of the statute.
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2668.72,2689.01,"Well, your Honor, I respectfully submit that State courts have a lot of experience in treating differently separate property, marital property, separate income, property interest. That is the kind of bread and butter that State courts -- those kind of distinctions are the bread and butter that State courts apply their own state law to. And so this Act --"
2016.15-1031,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2689.01,2690.87,What does -- what does that have to do with my question?
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2690.87,2697.04,"So the question is, your Honor, in terms of the ability -- your Honor was concerned that the State order could be a sham."
2016.15-1031,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2732.19,2734.535,"Well, but again, the law does something else too."
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2737.38,2737.81,Right.
2016.15-1031,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2761.31,2763.84,You know States -- consideration.
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2773.265,2777.22,"Well -- well, your Honor, we don't -- I don't interpret your Honor's hypothetical as a division of property."
2016.15-1031,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2784.98,2791.37,But money is money. Whether it gets the additional amount from the disability pay or from something else doesn't make a difference.
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2791.37,2792.66,"Well, your Honor, money isn't money."
2016.15-1031,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2803.71,2821.015,I think the question is can a State depart -- a -- a State court depart from the rule that the State court would use in dividing property solely for the purpose of making up for the fact that the disability payment cannot be divided.
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2821.015,2821.925,No.
2016.15-1031,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2822.67,2824.76,I thought that's what you were saying they could do.
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2824.76,2825.78,"No, your Honor."
2016.15-1031,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2866.035,2867.285,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.15-1031,2,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2867.285,2868.095,Thank you.
2016.15-1031,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2868.095,2871.32,"Mr. Unikowsky, you have 13 minutes."
2016.15-1031,3,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2871.32,2878.96,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. So I actually agree that finality in divorce decrees is very important."
2016.15-1031,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2936.43,2950.645,"How consequential is the issue before us? Because if you're right, then in all future divorce settlements, they won't say half of the Military Retirement Pay."
2016.15-1031,3,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2960.95,2963.8,"Well, that might be negotiated for consideration."
2016.15-1031,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2966.12,2987.57,"What consideration? I mean, being aware of this possible diminution, the lawyer for the -- for the spouse will say, I don't want to get half of the MRP; I want to get a dollar amount that's equivalent to what half of the MRP is right now."
2016.15-1031,3,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,2987.57,2989.91,"Well, I mean, the veteran doesn't have to agree to that."
2016.15-1031,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3178.55,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
