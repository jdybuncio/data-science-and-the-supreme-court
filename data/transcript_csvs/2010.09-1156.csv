2010.09-1156,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1156, Matrixx Initiatives v. James Siracusano."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,10.189,16.61,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,40.975,43.077,"Mr. Hacker, do we know that from this record?"
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,68.875,77.564,"--All I can speak for is what's alleged in the complaint, and the complaint, no matter how read, doesn't allege any more than 23 adverse event reports."
2010.09-1156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,77.564,80.166,But they might have been able through discovery to find that there were many more.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,80.166,93.343,"That's true, but there's no allegation that what they -- what they know about or what they could find would have been a statistically significant difference between the rate of reported events and the background of--"
2010.09-1156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,93.343,101.58,"But why shouldn't that determination be deferred until there's discovery, and then we can know how many reports there really were?"
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,101.58,108.435,"--Because it's incumbent on a plaintiff to come to court with a case, to plead the facts necessary to establish all of the elements of a claim."
2010.09-1156,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,148.394,154.464,Can there be some situations in which statistically significant evidence would not be necessary?
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,169.223,180.763,I think a distinguished physician would not conclude that there's a connection unless the clinical trials reveal a statistically significant difference between what they've seen and what they would expect to see were there no association.
2010.09-1156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.597,225.727,"Mr. Hacker, the complaint did not rely exclusively upon these adverse incidents but also referred to a study, a report by researchers at the American Rhinologic Society--"
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,225.727,226.227,Yes.
2010.09-1156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,226.227,229.512,--which -- which asserted that there was a connection.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,246.558,247.891,"Well, two points, Your Honor."
2010.09-1156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,267.852,268.554,Why didn't they say that?
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,268.554,278.493,"Well, I think if you look at the -- to be clear, the study is not attached to the complaint, so there wasn't a basis in the complaint for saying the company was aware of a reliable study and here are the details of the study and they failed to disclose it."
2010.09-1156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,278.493,282.212,"Well, I thought the -- you're saying the complaint did not refer to the study?"
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,282.212,282.895,It did refer to it.
2010.09-1156,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,318.868,326.872,You're talking about -- you're talking about who is right or wrong about the connection between Matrixx and anosmia.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,342.031,343.666,"--That's precisely the point, Your Honor."
2010.09-1156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,354.105,354.707,But wait a minute.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,377.386,380.755,"It may make a difference, Your Honor, and I didn't mean to suggest that, you know, these are psychics."
2010.09-1156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,393.73,404.471,"Well, suppose you stipulate in response to the Chief Justice's question that it is irrational, that it is probably baseless, but that the market will react adversely."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,410.025,413.144,"Under the case law, it's not clear that that's true."
2010.09-1156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,437.275,452.369,"But if there's a baseless report and we stipulate that, although it's baseless, it's going to affect the market, could that be the basis for an allegation, assuming the requisite scienter, that there's liability?"
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,452.369,453.619,"Two answers I would say, Your Honor."
2010.09-1156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,466.11,466.443,But it's not the allegation.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,469.209,479.231,"--Well, I understand, but the problem is it's the underlying -- what the rule would say is, because the company is aware the market may be affected, the company in advance has to say: A false report about us is about to come out."
2010.09-1156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,491.372,527.812,"Mr. Hacker -- Mr. Hacker, you just said, if I understood you correctly, that when the -- when the news came out on Good Morning America, accurate or not, there was an obligation to do something about it, but among the -- the charges, it's not simply that there was these reports, but it's the way the company responded to them: Two press releases that said allegations of any link of these drugs to anosmia are completely unfounded."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,534.115,534.882,Right.
2010.09-1156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,534.882,541.452,"--had this presentation, and he was going to put Zicam's name on it and the company said, you don't have any permission to do that."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,553.927,559.163,"Well, what they said was, and this was true, that it was completely unfounded and misleading."
2010.09-1156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,568.436,582.863,"I thought that the scientific report that came out later said, we can't say one way or the other, as opposed to the company saying that any suggestion of linkage is completely unfounded."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,582.863,584.379,"--And that's correct, there isn't."
2010.09-1156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,590.117,590.533,"They didn't say ""unfounded""."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,597.354,600.556,"Well, I'm -- with respect, Your Honor, I'm not entirely sure it is."
2010.09-1156,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,613.463,620.967,"Well, Mr. Hacker, you were saying that the question of whether there is support is reducible to the question of whether there are statistically significant findings."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,651.421,660.36,"--That's true, but the problem with that sort of standard -- well, first of all, to emphasize, to look at the facts of this case, the FDA didn't take any action until 5 years later, but -- which shows--"
2010.09-1156,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,660.36,662.26,"Well, it could and eventually it did."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,662.26,662.646,--But that's--
2010.09-1156,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,662.646,675.119,"And you are suggesting a test for what -- what counts as material, which is statistically significant, a test that the FDA itself doesn't use when it thinks about what it should what it should regulate."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,675.119,676.653,--The problem is ex ante.
2010.09-1156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,711.456,746.51,"Mr. Hacker, suppose Good Morning America made the same claim, categorically saying that this drug caused this condition, but did so simply on the basis of these adverse incidents, and they didn't have Dr. Jafek's, or whatever his name is, reports, but nonetheless Good Morning America comes out on the basis of those incidents saying Zicam causes whatever the condition is."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,751.097,758.068,"I think what you would have to be hypothesizing is evidence that the company, say a week in advance, knew that Good Morning America was going to come out and say that."
2010.09-1156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.911,800.428,Fine.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,800.428,806.982,"Right, and I would say, first of all, we have to be very careful, as I said before, about a rule that requires a company to disclose false facts."
2010.09-1156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,814.502,823.758,"These are unreasonable investors who are relying on some talking head on Good Morning America who says that this is true, even though it isn't true."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,823.758,828.145,"--That's the third point I would make, Your Honor, is it's a different case, a fundamentally different case, if you're talking about a media--"
2010.09-1156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,828.145,829.395,You've neither answered yes or no.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,838.751,839.834,--And I think the answer is no.
2010.09-1156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.786,844.136,No--
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,844.136,847.088,"--the law doesn't respond to irrational, unpredictable, or unreasonable investors."
2010.09-1156,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,850.457,857.646,A reasonable investor is going to worry about the fact that thousands of unreasonable investors are going to dump their Matrixx stock.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,857.646,859.313,I absolutely understand that.
2010.09-1156,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,859.313,862.264,"I mean, there's nothing unreasonable about that."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,870.953,875.088,"The point I would make is, first of all, a company ex ante can't know when that's going to happen."
2010.09-1156,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,878.457,879.64,"It may not know, but it certainly can know."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,888.831,890.748,--That's why it's a meaningfully different case.
2010.09-1156,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,922.033,924.235,In most cases we don't know whether the claim is false or not.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,970.098,974.567,"I would want to know more about the number of uses and all that, but, no, there wouldn't be a basis."
2010.09-1156,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,979.202,981.304,There are a lot of contact lens solutions in the world.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,993.545,997.33,"--The problem is, there has to be some reliable basis."
2010.09-1156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1010.204,1016.691,"This is the same kind of question, but suppose I don't really know how drug companies operate."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1034.003,1035.186,Very much so.
2010.09-1156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1070.409,1035.186,Okay.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1082.833,1088.72,"Well, ultimately it's a question -- it would go all the way to the jury if the plaintiffs were able to plead facts in the complaint that entitled them to--"
2010.09-1156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1088.72,1089.054,"Well, we don't know."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1136.351,1140.755,"--We think the answer is statistical significance, just like the Second Circuit said in Carter-Wallace--"
2010.09-1156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1140.755,1141.189,"Oh, no, it can't be."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1177.345,1184.534,"--But, Your Honor, out of millions of uses, if there was that problem, it wouldn't be hard to plead a case that says there is a significant problem--"
2010.09-1156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1184.534,1184.818,They did.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1216.687,1222.991,"--Well, I think a plaintiff -- I mean, I may just be repeating myself, but a plaintiff has to plead the facts that would entitle them to relief at the end of the day."
2010.09-1156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1223.776,1226.109,"I know, and we are back to my question--"
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1226.109,1226.545,--And--
2010.09-1156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1226.545,1250.843,"--The question is, the facts that are pleaded is -- I think it's assumed that this is above the normal background noise; they certainly argue that at length -- that there was this free zinc ion conversation, that there are 25 people who were hurt, and there is a lot of burning sensation going on, even though it doesn't rise to the level of people being hurt, and that's supported by some of the zinc sulfate studies in the fish--"
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1250.843,1251.543,--I think you need to--
2010.09-1156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1251.543,1251.876,--okay?
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1260.249,1268.138,"--The answer is no, Your Honor, because there is no basis on those pleaded facts for inferring that there's actually a problem with the zinc ion--"
2010.09-1156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1268.138,1268.405,I know.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1269.172,1269.938,--but look at the allegations--
2010.09-1156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1269.938,1275.626,--We're not saying -- you're saying if you are a scientist -- now we're back to Justice Scalia's questions and the--
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1275.626,1281.463,"--But it matters what a scientist would think because it's only then that anybody ex ante, again, remember--"
2010.09-1156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1281.463,1282.096,"--Well, then what--"
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1282.096,1292.753,"--has a basis for inferring that there is a causal link which would be the problem, and the zinc -- to be very clear, to be very clear about the zinc studies, the claim made on the telephone wasn't even a claim of causation."
2010.09-1156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1296.788,1306.244,"--No, because the sulfate -- you see in the abstract, which they didn't put in the complaint, that the problem that they saw arising out of the zinc sulfate studies was the free zinc ion."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1306.244,1309.962,"--No, the zinc sulfate studies were -- totally irrelevant."
2010.09-1156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1322.754,1327.073,"The trouble is, you know, the truth is I don't know, and so I'm back to my question."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1327.073,1330.859,"Well, in terms of scienter, under the securities law there has to be a plausible basis--"
2010.09-1156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1330.859,1354.558,"Counsel, you got cert granted on a limited question, and the limited question was whether in a complaint that alleges only adverse reports can you prove materiality and scienter without proving statistical importance."
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1430.289,1436.126,--Let me -- let me start with the premise of the question presented.
2010.09-1156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1449.501,1450.318,Can I just interrupt a second?
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1450.318,1450.869,Sure.
2010.09-1156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1450.869,1453.102,This wasn't an FDA-approved drug.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1453.102,1453.654,Right.
2010.09-1156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1453.654,1459.725,So there weren't any adverse reports in the legal sense of that word.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1459.725,1461.341,"In the FDA sense, that's true."
2010.09-1156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1461.341,1462.158,In the FDA sense.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1464.924,1466.69,Well--
2010.09-1156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1466.69,1467.274,Continue.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1467.274,1473.678,"--I would just say that adverse event reports are not limited to what qualifies for the FDA, certainly not by the way the case is--"
2010.09-1156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.678,1475.613,"--Of course, if I may interject--"
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1475.613,1476.146,--litigated.
2010.09-1156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1476.146,1478.398,"--the FDA acts in the public interest, doesn't it?"
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1478.398,1478.748,Yes.
2010.09-1156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.748,1482.367,And it doesn't make money by withdrawing a drug from the market?
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1482.367,1482.969,Yes.
2010.09-1156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1482.969,1488.02,"As opposed to somebody who sues, who makes money on the lawsuit?"
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1488.02,1489.705,That's true.
2010.09-1156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1545.251,1549.572,You have said raw adverse event reports.
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1563.23,1568.2,"Well, there's a reference -- I mean, there's a -- 1999 was the first call from Dr. Hirsch, who reported one patient."
2010.09-1156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1576.389,1582.393,"My question is, does it make a difference if these reports come from medical experts in this particular field?"
2010.09-1156,0,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1582.393,1586.345,"No, because a doctor doesn't have unique expertise in diagnosing causation."
2010.09-1156,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1599.736,1600.536,"--Thank you, Mr. Hacker."
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1612.961,1615.144,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1156,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1667.259,1673.829,Suppose the allegations of materiality are based solely on adverse event reports?
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1692.124,1708.316,"Well, probably not sufficient to go a jury absent a drop in the stock price, absent evidence that there was a scientifically plausible link, absent evidence that the product was highly important to the company's long-term financial prospects."
2010.09-1156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1717.922,1724.242,"If it was the only product, they sold that might be enough, five adverse reports out of ten million?"
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1728.98,1748.791,"--Under the Basic test, Your Honor, that very well might if the probability and the magnitude of the harm -- if those five incidents were deaths from a product that was easily substitutable, that might be a relevant decision and information that investors might want to take into account."
2010.09-1156,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1748.791,1754.261,"In response to Justice Alito, I heard you say something about a scientifically plausible link?"
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1754.261,1755.178,Correct.
2010.09-1156,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1755.178,1758.832,That seems to me to be a rather significant concession.
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1774.509,1780.246,"I think this goes back to Justice Kennedy's question as well, Mr. Chief Justice, because there could very well be materiality."
2010.09-1156,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1802.342,1804.028,"Well, I thought this might come up."
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1835.749,1846.121,"They're both analytically distinct and related, Justice Kennedy, and I don't have a simple answer for you because many of the recorded cases raise issues of both materiality and scienter."
2010.09-1156,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1916.247,1926.805,"But Mr. Frederick, suppose you are the CEO of a pharmaceutical company with a new drug, you've just put it back on the market, and you get a report back, this drug has caused a death, right?"
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1932.525,1941.215,"Well, I guess the first thing I would say is if the drug has not been FDA approved, that would be material information that investors might want to know."
2010.09-1156,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1969.9,1982.625,"Now we're told that there are hundreds of thousands of these; for a -- for a typical drug there may be thousands of these adverse event reports in -- in a year, and you're -- basically you're saying all of those have to be disclosed?"
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1982.625,1985.677,"Justice Alito, they already are all disclosed."
2010.09-1156,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1985.677,1986.21,Well they -- already.
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1989.06,1989.495,The--
2010.09-1156,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1989.495,1997.581,Analysts who follow the stock price can easily look at the FDA web site and see the adverse event reports that have been reported--
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1997.581,1998.114,--Right.
2010.09-1156,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1998.114,2001.718,--and draw whatever conclusions seem to be warranted based on that.
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2001.718,2012.758,"That's why I think this presents the issue in a rather artificial way, because the reports here were not the classic FDA-regulated adverse event reports."
2010.09-1156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2022.864,2043.443,"How would you write -- look, I'm asking how do you write this, because what -- where I think where the other side has a point, is if -- with these -- this is a big class of these kinds of things, you know, vitamins, all kinds of things like that -- and if we say that they have to disclose too much, what will happen is people won't pay attention to it, you know."
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2082.068,2089.988,I would start with the language in Basic which says the total mix of information is what has long standing been the test for materiality under this Court's cases.
2010.09-1156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2108.134,2120.091,"Okay, I'll go back and read what you've just said, and -- I will, because it will be in the transcript, and -- and the -- I -- this case, you are very good, your clients, and the lawyers at writing complaints."
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2120.091,2121.026,--Right.
2010.09-1156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2121.026,2121.559,All right?
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2152.563,2179.415,"Well, in 1999, though, Justice Breyer, Dr. Hirsch, and this is outlined at paragraph 25 of the complaint, also said that intranasal application of zinc could be problematic, and he specifically asked about how much zinc is put in Zicam precisely because of his awareness of prior studies going all the way back to the polio period in which zinc had created a problem of persistent anosmia."
2010.09-1156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2181.415,2204.43,"How was your -- that long litany of factors you mentioned a few moments ago about how a company will go about determining whether an adverse event report is material or not or should be disclosed or not, are you saying that companies don't have to respond to irrational securities holders?"
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2218.023,2249.708,"--It really depends, Justice Sotomayor, and I don't mean to be evasive, but if there is a product, say, that has some link to satanic influences, and there is some reason to think that a large body of followers in an irrational way might regard there to be satanic influences on the basis of a particular product, a cautious, reasonably prudent investor might want to know that on the basis of that information that most of us would regard as irrational, might affect the stock price."
2010.09-1156,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2249.708,2255.696,So what protection is there at the summary judgment stage in response to allegations?
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2280.744,2283.112,"There are two answers, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1156,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2299.641,2311.449,"Well, you just told me that it would be enough if somebody says that there's a satanic, you know, impact on this, because a reasonable investor would say there are enough crazy people out there that this is going to affect the price."
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2311.449,2320.721,"--What I said was if the product was one that might be, you know, attractive in some way to people who had that particular following."
2010.09-1156,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2326.391,2338.183,So it matters whether -- I don't know what kind of product has particular satanic susceptibility--
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2338.849,2339.383,--You're--
2010.09-1156,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2339.383,2348.389,"I don't mean to be facetious, but your way of distinguishing the satanic product is that it depends on whether people who follow satanic cults are going to be interested or not."
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2348.855,2358.93,"--Well, Your Honor, there are people who follow those things, and they spend money and they buy stocks, but my second point is that scienter -- scienter is the other way around this problem."
2010.09-1156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.747,2377.308,I don't know if scienter is -- it seems to me ridiculous to -- to hold companies to -- to irrational standards; and we did -- and we did say in -- in Basic that it's viewed -- whether it would be viewed by the reasonable investor.
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2384.545,2389.382,"--Well, Justice Scalia, you can certainly write as a prophylactic here that that isn't part of -- the test."
2010.09-1156,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2402.708,2405.593,--So that -- I'm just trying to get your response to that.
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2431.024,2432.043,"--Now, I'm saying two things."
2010.09-1156,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2455.456,2461.61,Can I give you -- because I'm having a little difficulty understanding the boundaries of the argument you're making.
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2507.838,2511.273,"--On the second one, I would say probably not."
2010.09-1156,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2534.77,2535.087,All right.
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2550.879,2566.657,"It -- by itself, that could be enough, and the reason we know that could be enough, Justice Alito, is that when, you know, some score additional were released and this information was disclosed, the stock price went down by 23.8 percent."
2010.09-1156,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2566.657,2574.728,"Mr. Frederick your time is running out, and there is one thing you emphasize in your brief, and I haven't heard you say one word about it here."
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2601.026,2619.673,"We're relying on those to establish scienter, both at the beginning of the class period when they forced Dr. Jafek, through their legal threats, to take Zicam off his poster presentation, and then later when they said that the reports of anosmia were completely unfounded."
2010.09-1156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2638.068,2649.192,"Mr. Frederick, I'm -- I'm not clear on why you can draw a distinction between materiality and scienter for purposes of the issue before us here."
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2692.369,2694.988,And it would depend on what kind of stock effect occurred.
2010.09-1156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2694.988,2698.09,So there's no difference between the materiality issue and the scienter issue.
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2698.09,2698.407,Well--
2010.09-1156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2698.407,2704.011,You can't push this problem off onto the scienter side of the equation.
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2704.011,2715.151,"--It depends -- it depends on this Court's application of its known precedent, which my colleague here has not even referenced in his opening argument, Basic, which says you look at the total mix of the information."
2010.09-1156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2716.836,2717.27,Okay.
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2740.952,2758.747,"Well, we believe, and they haven't argued that this complaint is not sufficient under the PSLRA, which set the heightened pleading standard for scienter that this Court articulated and construed in the Tellabs decision, so we believe that scienter is adequately pleaded here based on--"
2010.09-1156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2758.747,2765.334,"Well, page 49 of their brief -- they have two pages on it -- it does not give rise to a strong inference of scienter."
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2765.334,2770.221,"--What I'm saying is that there is already a heightened pleading standard, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-1156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2776.125,2794.353,"No, no, I mean -- I just want to know why, if their inference on materiality is enough to survive the background noise reply, is it enough to show a strong inference that they did do this intending to mislead, a strong inference of scienter?"
2010.09-1156,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2794.353,2814.915,"--The key aspects here are their treatment of Jafek when Jafek was going to go public with his scientifically linked claim of anosmia from the Zicam, and then subsequently when they issued press releases saying it would be completely unfounded and misleading to assert any causal link."
2010.09-1156,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2818.719,2819.735,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2830.109,2835.93,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1156,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2863.264,2865.616,"Mr. Shah, what do you think about Satan?"
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2865.616,2874.721,Let me try to unpack the satanic connection hypotheticals a little bit.
2010.09-1156,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2928.44,2929.456,They haven't said that.
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2934.277,2935.327,--Right.
2010.09-1156,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2935.327,2941.748,And they find out that 10 percent of nutty-nuttys out there are not going to buy their stuff because of Satan.
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2944.031,2947.149,"Your Honor, in that hypothetical, it depends on what affirmative statements the companies have made."
2010.09-1156,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2996.73,2999.663,You would have -- you just said they would have a duty to disclose?
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,2999.663,3000.282,"Yes, your honor."
2010.09-1156,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3000.282,3005.484,I thought you earlier just said there's no affirmative duty to disclose; it only is based on what they say?
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3005.484,3006.417,It's based on what they said.
2010.09-1156,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3038.621,3053.798,"What if the company makes the kind of relatively common statements that were made here, poised for growth in the upcoming season, very strong momentum going into the season, extremely well positioned for successful season?"
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3053.798,3054.798,"Sure, Your Honor--"
2010.09-1156,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3054.798,3059.035,That -- that triggers the duty to disclose the satanic rumors?
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3059.035,3072.692,"--In certain cases where there are very generalized statements, for example, we think our product will do well, that may close -- come close to the line of puffery that is a nonactionable statement that no reasonable investor would rely on."
2010.09-1156,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3116.988,3140.687,"So the government's position is that reports of adverse effects that have no scientific basis, so long as they would affect irrationally consumers, have to be disclosed, assuming the company has said we're doing well, right?"
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3140.687,3144.139,"--Well, Your Honor, yes, I think it would depend, again, on the statements the company makes."
2010.09-1156,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3144.989,3149.091,"Well, I mean, if Satan comes in, surely lousy science comes in as well, no?"
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3149.091,3149.341,--Okay.
2010.09-1156,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3219.187,3225.607,"Mr. Shah, what deference do you think that the SEC's understanding of materiality it's entitled to and why?"
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3225.607,3236.249,"Well, Your Honor, this Court in both TSC and Basic accorded what it called due deference to the SEC's views on the application of the materiality standard."
2010.09-1156,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3311.445,3324.355,"Is there any way that consideration of those factors would support a -- a summary judgment in favor of the pharmaceutical manufacturer, other than the fact of having an extremely poor lawyer drafting a complaint?"
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3327.138,3327.64,Sure.
2010.09-1156,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3327.64,3331.758,--I think it's very difficult for the judge to say anything other than that's for the jury.
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3331.758,3335.976,"If you mean at the motion to dismiss phase, Chief Justice?"
2010.09-1156,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3335.976,3336.328,Yeah.
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3336.328,3337.745,I think there would be some cases.
2010.09-1156,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3357.409,3359.778,"No, no, I'm talking about the -- I'm talking about materiality."
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3366.098,3366.482,--Sure.
2010.09-1156,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3366.482,3367.782,--whether it's a scientific basis or not.
2010.09-1156,2,38316,pratik_shah,,3367.782,3368.098,Sure.
2010.09-1156,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3411.043,3411.426,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1156,3,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3416.447,3417.58,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1156,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3493.412,3495.363,Has that -- the solicitor general's argument.
2010.09-1156,3,30716,jonathan_hacker,,3533.322,3534.088,"--Well, two points, Your Honor."
2010.09-1156,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3587.82,3589.32,"Thank you, counsel."
