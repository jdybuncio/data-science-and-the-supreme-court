2012.11-9335,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.42,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-9335, Alleyne v. United States."
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,8.12,10.472,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-9335,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,33.237,40.058,"Counsel, could you address an issue that's very important to me, the one of stare decisis."
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,46.145,48.497,"--Yes, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-9335,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,75.998,94.31,"Well, the problem is, whether you're right or wrong -- and you're absolutely right, it was a plurality opinion -- your adversary says States have passed laws relying on it, the Federal system is now structured around it, why isn't the damage as great as they claim?"
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,96.828,107.969,"--Well, first of all, I would just note that even though McMillan was decided in 1986, there is nothing in the legislative history that indicates that Congress referred on McMillan when it passed 924(c)."
2012.11-9335,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,119.527,122.979,"Address, please, the practical consequences."
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,122.979,123.679,--Certainly.
2012.11-9335,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,123.679,137.072,"How many -- how many Federal courts are you aware are already charging the 924(c) facts to a jury, notwithstanding the -- the fact that it's not required?"
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,137.072,152.248,"Yes, I would say that there is little to no practical effect if the Court is to adopt a rule, because the majority of the Federal courts are already -- and Federal prosecutors are already -- alleging these facts in the indictment and proving them to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt."
2012.11-9335,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,164.472,175.78,Isn't your position that a decision of this Court is not entitled to stare decisis protection if there isn't a majority opinion in that case?
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,175.78,179.066,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-9335,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,184.302,189.256,I can think of some pretty important decisions of this Court that were not the result of a majority opinion.
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,191.356,198.545,"--No, Your Honor, but I would note that in constitutional questions like this one, stare decisis is at its weakness -- weakest."
2012.11-9335,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,199.229,199.662,All right.
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,206.885,215.005,"--Well, and also, Your Honor, what I think is significant in this case in terms of the issue of stare decisis is that McMillan was not a Sixth Amendment case."
2012.11-9335,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,230.014,231.783,You haven't distinguished McMillan.
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,241.722,247.043,"Well, Your Honor, it does in fact refer to the Sixth Amendment in the very last paragraph."
2012.11-9335,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,251.097,252.13,I don't care about “ mostly ”.
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,266.273,267.906,--That's absolutely--
2012.11-9335,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,267.906,272.093,"Ms. Maguire, you don't -- you don't have to take the position that there's no stare decisis effect."
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,292.991,295.441,"--I think that that is exactly right, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-9335,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,319.239,322.676,"Well, I think it's important for this Court to have a consistent doctrine of stare decisis."
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,362.501,376.411,"Because, Justice Alito, another thing that you look to when you are considering stare decisis is whether or not the rule is workable, whether or not the prior decision was badly reasoned, and those are other factors that the Court can consider."
2012.11-9335,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,386.534,388.136,But why is this not workable?
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,408.397,424.492,"--Well, the Harris rule is not workable on a practical level because what happens under the Harris rule is the government is entitled to a fact that drives a more severe punishment, that never goes to the jury."
2012.11-9335,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,432.515,433.165,Can I say--
2012.11-9335,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,433.165,439.919,"That sounds like -- that sounds like an argument that it's wrong and that is, of course, the first step in the stare decisis analysis."
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,445.822,460.932,"Well, I think it becomes unworkable in the drug cases, Your Honor, and in the 9841 statute, because what you have there is you have in some circuits people alleging drug weight, but in other circuits you have what is called mixing and matching."
2012.11-9335,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,481.179,485.147,Why wouldn't that be a problem if the question had to be decided by the jury?
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,493.569,509.013,"Well, asking it to be found by a jury solves the problem because it allows the fact to go to the jury, the jury finds it, and we have a long history in this country that jury verdicts drive punishment."
2012.11-9335,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,515.319,516.852,You mentioned drug weight.
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,535.646,551.942,"If the drug weight is going to trigger a mandatory minimum, Your Honor, yes, we would say that under our rule that that would have to be alleged in the indictment and proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, which, as our amicus briefs point out, is being done already in the majority of circuits throughout the country."
2012.11-9335,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,582.394,592.017,"Now, if you were defending a case involving drug weight and your client maintained that he or she had nothing to do with these drugs, how would you proceed?"
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,599.004,604.241,"Well, Justice Alito, those are strategical questions that come up in every trial case that we have."
2012.11-9335,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,619.6,623.804,"But the question was, what -- what strategic decision do you think the lawyer should make?"
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,623.804,629.125,"Well, any strategic decision a lawyer makes is going to depend on the individual facts of the case."
2012.11-9335,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,629.625,632.327,So you -- but Justice Alito has a real problem.
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,635.612,649.786,"--You don't put the defense in a very difficult position, because in fact if you adopt our rule we believe that you are protecting the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury because this is a fact that is going to be triggering a mandatory minimum."
2012.11-9335,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,656.691,663.695,But isn't it difficult for you to say he had nothing to do with the drugs plus the drugs didn't weigh more than a certain amount?
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,663.695,668.083,"--I don't believe that that is difficult, and I believe that those are decisions that you make in every case."
2012.11-9335,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,671.718,683.609,"I think that I am hearing that in every case you are going to want witnesses, you are going to insist on a jury determination of the amount."
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,684.843,689.58,"--That is the rule, Justice Kennedy, that we are asking the Court to adopt, that if there's a fact--"
2012.11-9335,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,689.58,694.499,Justice Alito says why doesn't that put defense counsel in a very difficult position?
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,694.499,702.685,"--Well, it doesn't put defense counsel in a difficult position at all, because those are the same decisions that you make whether or not you adopt this rule or you don't adopt this rule."
2012.11-9335,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,702.685,703.937,"Well, we're not getting far with this."
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,713.993,716.945,"No, we are not -- we are not asking for a bifurcated trial."
2012.11-9335,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,718.464,720.247,"That's good, because that's an extra problem."
2012.11-9335,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,721.816,724.351,"Ms. Maguire, could I take you to a different kind of question?"
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,724.351,725.168,--Certainly.
2012.11-9335,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,725.168,736.242,Let's assume that there were a statute and it said carrying a gun is an offense and that the range is 5 to 10 years.
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,760.457,764.925,"Yes, Justice Kagan, that would be constitutional, because it doesn't have the mandatory effect."
2012.11-9335,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,764.925,765.275,Okay.
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,792.844,794.028,Okay.
2012.11-9335,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,802.284,805.902,"Well, that seems right as a definitional matter, as a descriptive matter."
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,836.021,856.435,"Well, yes, it is, because in your second hypothetical where it is the mandatory minimum, which is exactly what we have in this case, this notion that somehow Congress is channelling discretion is a fiction, because what it does is it tells the judge, you must impose 7 years and you cannot even consider what is authorized by the jury verdict in this case."
2012.11-9335,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.402,885.954,"Ms. Maguire, could you repeat the first sentence you uttered in this argument?"
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,895.66,897.626,"Thank you, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-9335,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,907.383,908.333,"No, that wasn't it."
2012.11-9335,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,912.019,913.121,It started “ Mr. Chief Justice ”.
2012.11-9335,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,915.556,929.297,I think what you said was: Who has to decide a fact which causes a defendant to be subject to a penalty that he would not otherwise be subject to?
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,991.971,1007.331,"The complaint is that -- and why we believe that the rule we are asking the Court to adopt, Justice Scalia, is a natural -- it follows the logic of Apprendi, is because in both cases you have judicial factfinding that's leading to a more harsh sentence."
2012.11-9335,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1007.964,1010.783,It isn't leading to a more harsh -- more harsh sentence.
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1044.77,1048.991,"--Well, and I think, Justice Scalia, that's -- that's a false presumption."
2012.11-9335,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1064.85,1075.558,--Do you have any statistics on at least 924(c) of how often the greater is the sentence than the absolute minimum required by law?
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1075.558,1094.037,"--Well, Justice Sotomayor, this Court found in O'Brien, and I think that it's also cited in the Lucas briefs and Dorsey briefs that this Court is holding, that the majority of all defendants convicted under 924(c) are, in fact, sentenced at the mandatory minimum."
2012.11-9335,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1094.037,1103.392,"So, in effect, your argument is that fixing a sentence is different than giving a judge discretion because it ignores the fact that a judge might have given you less?"
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1103.392,1104.477,That is exactly right.
2012.11-9335,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1104.477,1105.527,That seems to me--
2012.11-9335,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1105.527,1113.933,So it's depriving you of the constitutional right to have a jury decide what your sentence could be?
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1113.933,1115.516,That is exactly right.
2012.11-9335,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1115.516,1117.985,Of having a judge decide what your sentence could be?
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1117.985,1124.222,"That is exactly right, and it's further depriving you -- it is depriving the defendant of liberty interests."
2012.11-9335,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1129.793,1135.545,I'm not sure that that's -- you've emphasized several times that it takes away the discretion of the judge.
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1141.264,1146.668,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, actually the language of this Court in Apprendi said that"
2012.11-9335,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1159.395,1161.012,"Well, Apprendi goes both ways."
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1201.839,1213.813,"--Well, Justice Kagan, we do believe the Sixth Amendment is implicated because we think the history of the Sixth Amendment in this country shows that the role of the jury is the buffer between the citizen meant to protect and the government."
2012.11-9335,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.11,1273.001,--You quoted Apprendi correctly as saying that the jury has to decide any fact which increases the sentence to which the defendant is exposed.
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1309.672,1313.074,"--Well, I understand that that may not change the exposure."
2012.11-9335,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.811,1319.313,That's true.
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1319.313,1320.313,And that becomes the problem.
2012.11-9335,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1320.313,1323.465,"That's true, but you must acknowledge that that's not the theory of Apprendi."
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1323.465,1336.44,"Well, I think the theory of Apprendi if you -- if you take it out to its logical step is that if you have judicial fact finding that is resulting in a more harsh sentence being imposed, then, in fact, you have a Sixth Amendment problem."
2012.11-9335,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1360.724,1377.85,"I think the logic of Apprendi is that the jury has to decide it if it increases the sentence to which the defendant is exposed, not if it eliminates some discretion of the Court."
2012.11-9335,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1379.019,1380.752,How about Booker?
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1382.67,1383.703,"Well, I think--"
2012.11-9335,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1383.703,1385.105,--to the logic of Apprendi?
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1385.105,1402.484,"--Justice Sotomayor, what I believe that Booker did is that Booker indicated that when you have a fact that drives -- a finding of fact that drives a mandatory sentence to be imposed, that obviously that was the Sixth Amendment problem."
2012.11-9335,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1403.717,1406.869,Even when the statutes had a higher maximum.
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1406.869,1408.138,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-9335,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1408.138,1414.025,Because the jury was -- because the judge was constrained within a different maximum.
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1414.025,1415.325,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-9335,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1415.325,1416.342,Is that your argument here?
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1416.342,1416.811,Yes.
2012.11-9335,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1433.603,1442.459,"It wasn't a mandatory minimum case, Booker was a case in which the maximum was increased on the basis of judge finding of fact."
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1473.663,1489.606,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think the concern in Booker was the mandatory nature of the guidelines, and while I would agree with you that this Court in its constitutional part of the Booker decision did, in fact, look to the increase in the maximums, it is the same problem."
2012.11-9335,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1494.326,1500.23,Why is Booker -- why is Booker entitled to greater stare decisis weight than Harris and McMillan?
2012.11-9335,0,36285,mary_e_maguire,,1500.23,1518.625,"Well, I believe that Booker is -- is entitled to greater weight because it was more recently decided by this Court, and I also believe that it is a more recent interpretation of this Court of the principles held in Apprendi."
2012.11-9335,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1520.742,1522.244,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1526.479,1529.248,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1547.142,1551.929,"Could I go back to a simple question on the stare decisis, the practicality question."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1587.286,1597.308,"Justice Sotomayor, the government's argument here is not that juries are incapable of finding facts under the Federal statutes that involve mandatory minimums."
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1608.283,1618.39,"But what does that have to do with the needs, the constitutional need to make sure that juries are driving a fixed sentence of any kind?"
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1618.39,1626.244,"The -- the constitutional question, in my view, Justice Sotomayor, turns on whether there is a right to the mercy of a tenderhearted judge."
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1632.998,1634.117,"No, no, it isn't quite."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1657.365,1658.882,Correct.
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1658.882,1661.917,"Now, let's put it differently."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1747.422,1748.522,"Justice Breyer, yes."
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1748.522,1756.862,--why the difference in the words should overcome the fact that I can't think of a -- of a difference other than those words that happened to be used in Apprendi?
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1756.862,1764.132,"Well, Justice Breyer, we have a chart in our brief that I think is addressed explicitly to the question that you are asking, and it's on page 36 of our brief."
2012.11-9335,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.656,1776.039,What page?
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1776.039,1779.158,--This is page 36 of the government's brief.
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1779.158,1781.843,I'm afraid the other side was upside down and I saw what you meant.
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1781.843,1784.795,Okay.
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1856.643,1857.843,"You know, but that--"
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1857.843,1858.293,But--
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1858.293,1858.96,--I'm sorry.
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1858.96,1865.433,"--That's the -- that's the -- you've used all the words, which do make the difference in your mind."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1866.783,1867.866,"It's not just in my mind, Justice--"
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1867.866,1869.218,--is why should those words make a difference?
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1893.416,1894.116,--And when he cannot--
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1894.116,1898.804,"In the one case, he cannot go into the low sentencing box; in the other case, he can't go into the high sentencing box."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1903.272,1910.112,"--It matters because the Sixth Amendment protects a right to a jury trial, it does not protect a right to judicial leniency."
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1910.112,1914.947,"No, it's not -- well, you can call it judicial leniency, but you could call the other judicial harshness."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1917.282,1927.155,"No, because in -- in the other situation, it protects the right of the jury to determine the ingredients of the crime that Congress has determined exposed the defendant--"
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1927.155,1931.892,--And here we have the ingredients of a crime that Congress has determined that you have to get the 5 years.
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1931.892,1932.708,"--Well, we know--"
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.708,1941.764,"I mean, in the one case you can say all that Apprendi did -- it never should have been decided; I mean, some of us thought that -- because in fact--"
2012.11-9335,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.764,1943.766,I wonder who that could have been.
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1945.285,1955.924,"--all you're talking about there is that you are stopping the judge from exhibiting his otherwise discretion towards harshness, and that's a matter for judges."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1958.193,1958.509,--Well--
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1958.509,1966.282,"And I've just heard them in the context of harshness, and now I don't know why changing it to leniency makes them somehow more relevant."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1970.334,1985.709,"--They weren't relevant in the first situation, because if there is no cap from the maximum that a judge could impose based on judicial factfinding, the role of a jury can be shrunk to what the Court has called low-level gatekeeping."
2012.11-9335,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1990.845,1999.351,"Well, you said, Mr. Dreeben, and -- and I think it's -- it's a great question: Is the jury functioning as a low level gatekeeper under the Harris rule?"
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2070.949,2088.511,"Well, it certainly doesn't increase the maximum punishment that's authorized under the statute, and it doesn't prevent the judge from making the exact same finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the jury did not make beyond a reasonable doubt, and giving 7 years even if there were no mandatory minimums."
2012.11-9335,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2088.511,2102.251,"Yes, but what I'm suggesting is that in the world of judges, you know, this -- the graph you wrote has very little difference in the Harris situation between five and seven, but in fact most judges want to give five."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2122.232,2129.988,"Well, it's first of all, not entirely accurate that judges do not give higher sentences than the minimum."
2012.11-9335,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2133.94,2134.323,But--
2012.11-9335,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2134.323,2135.54,I know there are plenty of cases.
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2148.799,2157.821,--But taking away judicial discretion to treat a fact within the range differently than what Congress wants doesn't infringe the jury trial right.
2012.11-9335,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2168.629,2171.481,But you could say that with reference to the -- to the maximum.
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2176.217,2194.846,"--I don't think that it's quite true that everything that I said applies to the maximum, Justice Kennedy, because as the plurality opinion in Harris explained, once the court has been confronted with a defendant who's convicted, the judge's discretion extends up to the statutory maximum."
2012.11-9335,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2222.68,2226.482,--How about in deference to the jury's finding?
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2265.124,2274.715,"I think, Justice Ginsburg, that the judge said he would be intellectually honest and not ignore the fact that the -- the finding of brandishing did trigger the mandatory minimum."
2012.11-9335,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2279.017,2286.44,But is it the usual case that a judge when faced with his decision has before him a jury finding?
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2289.308,2292.26,"--It's not the usual case, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-9335,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2292.26,2296.312,--The petitioner is asking these cases to be thrown out even if there has been no jury finding.
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2296.312,2296.679,Correct.
2012.11-9335,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.679,2302.299,"And the judge says, you know, I have to decide whether he brandished or not; I think he brandished."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2339.005,2346.008,"No, there is no inconsistency between it, and I think if you look at the way this case evolves, it's not even clear that the jury rejected brandishing."
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2388.518,2391.137,"Mr. Dreeben, can I go back to a point you made earlier?"
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2480.611,2481.613,Justice--
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2481.613,2486.699,What's the better rule to keep both extremes from happening?
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2486.699,2496.723,"--I think, Justice Sotomayor, that the Court recognized in Apprendi that its role was limited and to certain extent could be evaded by legislatures if they were inclined to do so."
2012.11-9335,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2496.723,2499.259,"Mr. Dreeben, I think that history is wrong."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2513.418,2514.034,Well--
2012.11-9335,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2514.034,2532.58,"And I would think that the risk involved is whether if we come out the way that the petitioner here urges us to do, legislatures will consider going back to -- to where we started from, and simply saying, If you brandish, you get 7 years, period, with no discretion in the judge."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2534.665,2541.252,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I agree in part with both you and Justice Sotomayor on history."
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2613.382,2625.841,"I'm sorry, the historical -- you said earlier that most of the historical evidence was that determinate sentences would be decided by juries; they found facts and a determinate sentence was given."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2625.841,2628.543,"--And there was no judicial discretion, which I think makes--"
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2628.543,2630.709,So what is the judicial discretion now?
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2637.749,2641.201,--The judicial discretion is what the defendant is losing.
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2650.823,2673.186,"You think for a defendant in a constitutional right, that they are more -- that it's constitutional to have a determinate sentence at seven, and still constitutional and make the jury find it by a -- beyond a reasonable doubt and that it's still constitutional to have a determinative sentence of 7 years but have the jury find it by a preponderance of the evidence?"
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2673.186,2675.105,To have the jury find it by a preponderance of the--
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2675.105,2677.221,Those are -- those are equal?
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2677.221,2686.244,--It's not just my position that it's constitutional for a -- a judge to find mandatory minimum triggering facts by a preponderance.
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2688.529,2691.298,"No, I know we said it in Harris; the question here before us today is--"
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2691.298,2692.648,Yes.
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2708.341,2719.215,"Here's another way of putting the same point: With the mandatory minimum, the judge can't go below the 5 years, okay?"
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2729.504,2730.554,Correct.
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2730.554,2731.106,All right.
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2739.21,2741.412,And that's the difference between this and Apprendi.
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2741.412,2742.831,But why does that make a difference?
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2766.36,2767.029,Well--
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2767.029,2772.031,"And -- and I want to know, what is it?"
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2772.933,2773.333,--That's--
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2773.333,2776.135,"--you're just going to say, Well, he could have given the same sentence anyway."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2778.254,2782.722,"--It's descriptively accurate, but it says nothing about the constitutionality of the procedure."
2012.11-9335,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2909.935,2912.203,"Mr. Dreeben, could I take you back to the principles involved?"
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2931.0,2932.95,--The constitutional argument is the same.
2012.11-9335,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2941.64,2942.306,But suppose the legislature--
2012.11-9335,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2942.306,2942.808,I'm sorry.
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2945.008,2946.51,Deemed elements.
2012.11-9335,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2954.699,2974.527,"--Suppose -- suppose that Congress is absolutely clear about it, and you say -- and I think that you're right, you've got to be right about this -- it's a constitutional matter, it's the same, but the hypothetical sort of suggests exactly what you said our inquiry ought to be, is that in a world like that, the jury is in fact functioning only as a low level gatekeeper."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2975.279,2975.829,--No.
2012.11-9335,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2975.829,2981.183,And that the only reason we see it in the hypothetical a little bit more clearly is because the numbers are a bit more dramatic.
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2981.183,2992.073,"I wouldn't suggest that the jury is being a low level gatekeeper in that situation, because the jury's verdict alone -- and this is a serious crime -- exposes the defendant to a life sentence."
2012.11-9335,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3019.156,3032.049,"If it's something deeply incongruous, isn't there, where you have an Apprendi rule which says if the maximum is, you know, five to seven, and then the judge says 7 years and a day, we're going to take that out."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3039.653,3064.937,"--It's not incongruous if you look at it from the point of view of the fact that the jury verdict itself allows a life sentence, and if the defendant draws the proverbial hanging judge who in his discretion or her discretion wants to give that life sentence, the defendant knew from day one when he committed the crime that if the jury finds him guilty of it, he's exposed to a life sentence."
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3078.43,3084.85,"--So how about in O'Brien, if the legislature had said 40 years for a machine gun."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3094.373,3095.756,"--No, I think that--"
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3095.756,3097.658,So how -- what would we do in that situation?
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3097.658,3108.033,"--In that situation, the democratic process would have concluded that firearms brandishing, discharge or use of a machine gun is an extremely serious component of this crime."
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3143.373,3151.06,"That's -- I don't know if you can add anything to this, but remember, I agree with you about the history, but I just apply it to Apprendi, too."
2012.11-9335,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3153.661,3155.596,It is so bad he wants to extend it.
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3156.446,3159.148,--I thought -- are you sure it was Gertrude Stein and not Dorothy Barker?
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3209.748,3213.383,"Well, I agree that you can say them, Justice Breyer--"
2012.11-9335,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3213.383,3214.469,"But I mean, are they true?"
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3215.552,3218.187,"--Respectfully, no."
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3307.761,3313.415,"Why is the legislature being deprived of that right, if they give it to the jury?"
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3313.415,3314.732,The legislature--
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3314.732,3324.456,"I mean, it seems to me that whether you give it to a jury or a judge, the legislature protects itself by declaring a minimum sentence."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3324.456,3325.806,--There are many ways--
2012.11-9335,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3325.806,3327.491,"It determines the sentence, really."
2012.11-9335,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3327.491,3336.045,--There are many ways that a legislature could achieve a goal that allows the judge's fact finding to carry more weight.
2012.11-9335,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3351.44,3352.59,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2012.11-9335,2,36285,mary_e_maguire,,3354.909,3363.764,"It is the effect of the fact finding that is important, not what it is called."
