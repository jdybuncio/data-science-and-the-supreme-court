1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.678,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-6332, Robert S. Minnick v. Mississippi."
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,65.292,67.605,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,261.291,264.164,It's also undisputed that he had seen counsel in the interim.
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,264.164,264.905,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-6332,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,271.667,277.601,Can we say that it's also undisputed that this confession is voluntary?
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,277.601,282.837,It is not undisputed that it is voluntary--
1990.89-6332,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,282.837,285.367,"For purposes of this case, I should have said."
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,290.751,314.326,"--I find that a difficult question, Justice Kennedy, because even the Mississippi... the Mississippi Supreme Court did not make any specific finding on that, except that Minnick had waived, in their view, his Sixth Amendment rights and, perhaps implicitly, his Fifth Amendment rights."
1990.89-6332,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.326,323.973,"Well, but the rule you are asking us to adopt certainly is a rule that takes no account of the fact that the confession was fully voluntary?"
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,341.035,323.973,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,447.303,449.765,"Well, that is pretty much dicta, isn't it?"
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,449.765,459.412,"Yes, it is dicta, but it is then read in, as we read the Edwards case, Your Honor, as a good part of the rationale for Edwards itself."
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,517.138,535.762,"Certainly there is language in Edwards, Mr. Abrams, I just look at what was quoted here by the Mississippi Supreme Court in its... where they say we further hold that the accused, having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through consult, is not subject to further interrogation by the authority until counsel has been made available to him."
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,538.122,548.531,"--And the question, Mr. Chief Justice, before the Court, as a matter of interpretation of Edwards at least, is the meaning of that phrase, and the meaning of that phrase in context."
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,548.531,551.051,But counsel made available to him.
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,557.396,564.599,"I read counsel available to him in the context of this language, Your Honor, as counsel available to him at the interrogation."
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,692.346,704.484,"The defendant can't change... if he said on Friday I want to have the interrogation only with a lawyer, he sees the lawyer, they come back, and he can't change his mind?"
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,704.484,705.836,"--Absolutely, he can change his mind."
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,713.49,715.311,Even though he has seen a lawyer in the meantime?
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,715.311,716.933,Even though he has seen a lawyer in the meantime.
1990.89-6332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,718.994,720.664,And even though the lawyer has told him not to talk.
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,720.664,722.607,Even though the lawyer has told him not to talk.
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,906.226,911.078,"Mr. Abrams, I think many people thought Miranda itself was a bight line."
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,936.043,941.048,"You have had a lot of Miranda jurisprudence, as I understand it, and as I hear you, Your Honor."
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,947.871,953.575,"Well then we've had, we've had discussions as to whether, what was reinterrogation."
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,955.698,959.542,"I just know of one, but I am sure I may have missed them."
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,979.594,985.768,"But all he has to do, all he has to do is tell them again my lawyer told me not to say anything."
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,987.959,988.42,--That's all he had to do--
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,988.42,990.31,--He holds the keys to his interrogation right there.
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,990.31,992.03,--That is all he had to do in Edwards.
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,992.03,992.32,Right.
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,992.32,994.573,But that's all he had to do in Roberson.
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1008.893,1013.464,We have never said that after he has seen a lawyer we won't put him in that position.
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1013.464,1014.376,--Absolutely not.
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1014.376,1015.605,That's what you're asking us to say here.
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1015.605,1016.306,That's right.
1990.89-6332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1074.864,1076.917,"Well, it's clear it's at some expense, though."
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1086.334,1091.717,"--Justice Scalia, every bright-line rule imposes a cost, and I don't deny that for a moment."
1990.89-6332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.993,1150.886,Does the Sixth Amendment get you any farther?
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1150.886,1155.779,"--I don't think we really need the Sixth Amendment, Your Honor."
1990.89-6332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.211,1161.032,What if you lose on the Fifth?
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1161.032,1163.072,--If we lose on the Fifth--
1990.89-6332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.072,1165.245,"You know, it's not unimaginable that you would."
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1165.535,1168.387,"--That's why we need it, and that's why... that's why we argued it."
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1236.602,1247.219,"Is the question which is set forth as the question presented on the first page of your blue brief, is that the same question as contained in your--"
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1247.219,1252.07,"No, Your Honor, it is a rewritten, I thought a clearer form of the question."
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.07,1254.554,--Do you think counsel is free to do that?
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1254.554,1275.335,"I understand from Rule 24 that so long as we are not expanding the scope of what is before the Court, fairly presented to you, that if we can state it in a fashion which fairly presents what was before you at the time of the petition for cert., that we are permitted to do that."
1990.89-6332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.832,1316.054,"Well, assume it did--"
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1319.286,1327.501,"--The argument on the Sixth Amendment is that if we are right, Your Honor, that his Sixth Amendment rights had attached--"
1990.89-6332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.501,1328.082,"Well, that's--"
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1328.082,1331.044,--which is the point I would like to address.
1990.89-6332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1331.044,1331.562,--If you're going to start there--
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1331.562,1331.883,Yes.
1990.89-6332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1398.818,1401.149,--So that's the beginning of formal proceedings?
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1401.149,1401.96,--In Mississippi.
1990.89-6332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1450.11,1454.995,"But they do something more to actually bring, to start the proceeding further."
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1456.965,1457.946,"--Yes, yes."
1990.89-6332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.946,1461.179,"Or they indict, or have preliminary hearings?"
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1461.179,1462.327,They... yes.
1990.89-6332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.246,1479.431,"Wouldn't it be easier to have a bright-line rule, Mr. Abrams, so we don't have to go State by State."
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1482.43,1490.608,"There are some times when federalism comes in more than handy, and I think that this is one."
1990.89-6332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.407,1509.588,"Mr. Abrams, may I just interrupt for a second?"
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1518.514,1519.175,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-6332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1519.175,1522.538,Whereas the dissenters thought that... relied on the Sixth Amendment and felt it had not be waived.
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1522.538,1523.139,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-6332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.139,1524.669,So they all agreed the right had attached.
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1524.669,1530.282,"All of them agreed that the Sixth Amendment right had attached, and the State of Mississippi so urged that position on them."
1990.89-6332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1530.282,1535.307,We seem to have put a lot on State law in the Moore case.
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1535.307,1536.417,"Yes, yes."
1990.89-6332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1536.417,1538.828,And referred to Illinois... was it Illinois law?
1990.89-6332,0,23503,floyd_abrams,,1538.828,1539.459,"Yes, yes."
1990.89-6332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1589.892,1591.304,"Very well, Mr. Abrams."
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1592.132,1596.896,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1701.195,1703.396,May I ask you a question right there?
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1727.733,1728.754,"--I don't think it does, Your Honor."
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1740.432,1743.925,Would it have made a difference if it had been the prosecutor himself who wanted to talk to him?
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1743.925,1746.777,It could have.
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1751.76,1754.25,"He is not in effect an agent of the prosecutor, you don't think?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1754.25,1754.691,"--No, he is not."
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1773.204,1782.199,"Apparently... why do you suppose the dissenting opinion made so much of the canons of ethics, then, and the majority didn't disagree at all?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1783.72,1799.72,"Without being disrespectable to the court below, we don't... that particular justice and I don't see eye to eye on much at all in our opinions and that, and this is I think an extensive ground to--"
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.72,1801.43,"Well, but you do agree, don't you that--"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1801.43,1801.751,--to extend those--
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1801.751,1807.605,"--You do agree, don't you, that it is generally unethical for a lawyer to consult with an adversary's client without notice to the other lawyer?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1807.605,1807.785,--Sure.
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1808.296,1809.525,Which is the principal point he was making.
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1809.525,1810.417,I think so.
1990.89-6332,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1852.906,1866.964,"Mr. White, would you agree that if the defendant's Sixth Amendment right had attached, that there was no waiver of that right?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1866.964,1870.417,"No, I would not agree."
1990.89-6332,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1870.417,1870.707,No?
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1870.707,1886.426,"I mean, I think that he had time to consult with his counsel, and as this Court has said many times, that he has a right to change his mind and to talk to an attorney... I mean talk to the police, even without notice to his counsel."
1990.89-6332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.641,1901.596,"Even though the police approach him, and he is at first reluctant to talk, and finally they get him to talk?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1901.596,1909.731,"--There was no... well, maybe if there is a reluctance to talk, but there was no reluctance to talk in this case when he saw Deputy Denham."
1990.89-6332,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1913.567,1917.5,I thought somebody told him he had to go down and talk.
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1917.5,1923.344,"Well, I think the... given Miranda warnings and of course the advice of counsel, he knew he didn't have to go down there, and he--"
1990.89-6332,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1923.344,1927.946,"But didn't they, didn't they tell him he had to go and he had to talk to the man?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1927.946,1929.847,"--I think that is what he says in the record, yes, sir."
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1935.131,1944.335,"When you say counsel is made available, suppose there is a telephone call between the prisoner and the counsel, and the counsel says I'll be there tomorrow."
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1949.069,1956.654,"--I think that, you know, the bright line that we are suggesting, of course, is that once counsel has... there's been a consultation."
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1956.654,1958.476,"Well, what is a consultation?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1958.476,1961.138,"Well, that's, that would be something to be determined."
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1961.138,1965.201,It's not clear to me that that's a very bright line.
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1965.201,1975.316,It would be a consultation in which the attorney had an opportunity to advise that client of just I think what you've said.
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1976.458,1981.701,"So then before the police know whether they can initiate a conversation they have to say now, did you talk with the counsel and what did you talk about?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1981.701,1982.342,--No.
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1984.452,1985.692,"Well, how would they... how are they going to know?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1985.692,1986.113,I think that you--
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1986.113,1987.174,How is the rule going to be applied?
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1987.174,1994.939,"--I think that you have a right to reapproach and ask if he has in fact consulted with counsel, and if he says no then the police must leave."
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2002.736,2005.067,"What if he says yes, and I don't want to talk to you without counsel?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2005.067,2006.877,"--He must leave, or wait until counsel is present."
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2006.877,2010.26,"Until counsel comes in next time, or can they go back in a half hour?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2010.26,2017.525,"I think until he has consulted with counsel again I don't think that he would, that they would have that opportunity."
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2017.525,2028.03,"So there is kind of a series of leapfrog, one-shot attempts by the police, and every time he says I want my counsel, then they'd wait until he talks with him on the telephone again, and then they can go back?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2028.03,2040.429,"There again I think you get into the analysis much, very similar to that of Michigan v. Mosley of was the waiver voluntary at that point."
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2040.429,2045.862,"No, the question is whether or not the police can... can initiate the conversation."
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2062.893,2074.681,"Well, no, I think that you have a situation that the number of times, I think, would all go to then a... you know, how many times did they go back."
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2079.626,2084.047,"Well, then you are saying then they can go back as many times as necessary in order to get him to change his mind?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2084.047,2088.091,But then of course that... that of course impacts on the voluntariness of that--
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2088.091,2089.1,"Well, assume it's voluntary."
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2090.462,2093.925,"--I don't see anything... if he has consulted with counsel every half hour, yes."
1990.89-6332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2093.925,2104.681,"I assume that conscientious counsel would probably try to delay conferring with his client as long as possible, isn't that right?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2104.681,2106.964,That may be the outcome of that.
1990.89-6332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2106.992,2109.335,For sure.
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2126.856,2141.765,"If the opinion of the Mississippi Supreme Court is read, which, and we contend that the shorthand used there is nothing... deals nothing with the Federal Sixth Amendment rights, it says Sixth Amendment right to counsel under Mississippi law had attached."
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2141.765,2143.618,But you don't concede in this Court that--
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2143.618,2143.956,"No, I do not."
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2143.956,2145.689,--that the Federal right had attached.
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2158.836,2164.472,I think the line is much blurrier there in that situation.
1990.89-6332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2164.472,2165.02,Blurry?
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2166.072,2169.505,Jackson is pretty specific in that... in that area.
1990.89-6332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2169.505,2171.127,"Well, you mean it isn't blurry, is it?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2171.127,2180.571,"Not... not really, but I think that with the furnishing of counsel there, I think that... once counsel has been appointed I think the State does have a duty to stay away."
1990.89-6332,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2180.571,2180.931,Even under the Sixth Amendment.
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2187.086,2188.966,"No, I think that the person can waive at anytime."
1990.89-6332,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2192.329,2193.08,But may the State initiate--
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2199.784,2200.325,"I think they could, yes."
1990.89-6332,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2200.325,2201.104,--under the Sixth Amendment.
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2201.104,2202.286,Yes.
1990.89-6332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.286,2203.555,You don't think Jackson bars that?
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2203.555,2210.411,"I think that under the same test that is used in Edwards, which it says is adopting the Edwards test, I think the same test is there."
1990.89-6332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2210.411,2215.326,You mean that the... you mean the accused has to initiate it?
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2215.326,2218.225,Unless counsel has been provided there.
1990.89-6332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.869,2226.552,"So the Sixth Amendment adds nothing to the case, in your view?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2226.552,2227.181,"--No, it doesn't."
1990.89-6332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2238.808,2253.899,"Well, are you saying the proper way to interpret the opinion of the Supreme Court of Mississippi about the right to counsel is that the Mississippi law respecting the right to counsel, or the Mississippi law respecting the initiation of prosecutions?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2259.693,2281.067,"--Under these latest decisions of the State constitution, they... the opinions dealing with this specifically say we reject the Federal approach, and say that we are not relying... we might be citing Federal cases, but we reject the Federal law, and say that this is purely, exclusively done under State law, this right to counsel."
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.531,2295.806,"Oh, but Mr. White, in the opinion they say the standard for determining whether or not a defendant has waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was set out in Brewer against Williams, 430 U.S.--"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2295.806,2296.147,--That is correct.
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2296.147,2297.208,--That is hardly a Mississippi case.
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2297.208,2298.1,"Well, I agree."
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2298.598,2302.961,And then they argue further that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel under Mississippi law had attached.
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2306.862,2307.844,--And then they say--
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.844,2312.897,"And then they are talking about the... is the right to counsel in the Mississippi constitution in the sixth amendment, or is it in some other amendment?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2312.897,2314.569,--It is not in the sixth amendment there.
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2314.569,2318.243,"So when they use sixth amendment, that is a reference to the Federal Constitution?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2318.243,2318.78,"Well, I--"
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2318.78,2321.282,"That's rather clear, I think."
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2321.282,2326.307,"--The case that they rely on, which is Livingston there, states clearly that they are not relying on Federal law to find that right."
1990.89-6332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.398,2352.734,"Well, I think what they are saying is they are not relying on Federal law for their determination of when it attaches."
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2367.264,2368.633,I think under Coleman v. Alabama it is your call.
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2432.576,2437.639,May I go back to the Edwards argument for just a moment?
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2452.8,2453.491,That's right.
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2453.491,2455.872,But why do you concede that?
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2472.391,2477.436,"In saying that if he says I don't want to talk again, that they can't force him to talk?"
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2477.436,2481.427,Why can't they go ahead and still read him the Miranda warnings and start asking him questions?
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2487.371,2495.058,"Because he also has a right to remain silent there, and I think that, that is, that involves that, the right to silence and the right to have counsel present."
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2503.854,2512.459,"But you're interpreting it as a right to have counsel present, not merely a right to be advised by counsel and have counsel available?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2512.459,2516.75,"No, I think he has a right not to talk to the authorities if he says so."
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2524.106,2528.989,"--Just keep... not use force, of course, but just try to persuade him to change his mind."
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2529.59,2530.061,I think that you would--
1990.89-6332,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2530.061,2544.593,"There's a lot of difference between telling the man in the courtroom that he doesn't have to talk, telling a man in the street that he doesn't have to talk, and telling him in a jail that he does have to talk."
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2546.563,2549.726,"--I am sure there is, I think there is a difference, yes."
1990.89-6332,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2550.423,2551.785,And isn't there also a difference?
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2554.607,2555.939,--That is true.
1990.89-6332,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2555.939,2561.773,So solely because he hadn't got money enough for bail he is subjected to all of these things.
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2561.773,2568.026,"Mr. Minnick was in for a nonbailable offense, so it didn't matter one way or the other."
1990.89-6332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2581.315,2585.849,"Mr. White, can I pursue what Justice Stevens was asking you?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2601.567,2602.118,--No.
1990.89-6332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2609.342,2611.916,But you can go back to him then.
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2611.916,2612.474,Yes.
1990.89-6332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2623.363,2627.435,But if he wants counsel he means he doesn't want to talk to the police without counsel present?
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2631.447,2632.108,Yes.
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2632.108,2637.501,I must say I'm still puzzled by your answer to Justice Stevens and to me.
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2656.575,2657.223,Well--
1990.89-6332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2657.223,2669.262,"And to me, if... I don't understand how you can say that he can waive counsel when they asked him the first time, but they can't, he can't waive it when they ask him the second or third."
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2673.856,2674.885,--Maybe I wasn't clear.
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2738.748,2741.51,That would have ended the matter.
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2762.554,2767.236,"Well, I think he was following that much of his attorney's advice."
1990.89-6332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2767.236,2772.489,"Well, he refused, but the police kept after him and he finally talked without signing a waiver."
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2772.489,2776.412,"Well, I mean, this was not one where they just kept after him."
1990.89-6332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2789.272,2790.542,"Well, what did they do?"
1990.89-6332,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2792.693,2800.118,"No, they brought him down to the room there when the Mississippi deputy arrived from Mississippi."
1990.89-6332,2,23503,floyd_abrams,,3001.43,3003.37,"I would just like to make two points, Your Honor."
