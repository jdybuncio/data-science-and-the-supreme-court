1972.72-419,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,31.171,"We will hear arguments next in 72-419, Pittsburgh Press Company against the Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations."
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,32.427,36.444,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.72-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,120.781,126.194,Who made the decision just as a matter of fact as to which column heading each ad went in?
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,126.194,128.607,As to which column each ad went in?
1972.72-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,151.094,161.895,"So that there are -- in this case there are instances I suppose where we are talking about ads, a part of which the newspaper made the decision as to which column it went in."
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,161.895,164.552,Yeah the newspaper will help.
1972.72-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,164.552,168.579,"Well help, but it's the one who makes the decision as to which column to put it in."
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,168.579,179.373,"It makes the final -- it reserves for itself the final determination, but I would be fatuous and untrue if I told this Court that that's the way it happens in actual practice."
1972.72-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,186.537,192.875,"Invariably then the advertiser is the one who finally says the newspaper, “Well after now that I have talked to you I would suggest to go into this column."""
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,192.875,193.881,Yes.
1972.72-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,202.87,217.73,So this isn't an independent judgment of the newspaper as to which -- it isn't its judgment as to whether this job is more attractive to males or females.
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,217.73,220.537,It isn't its judgment in any specific case.
1972.72-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,246.765,253.724,"But if the advertisers have said -- if in each case the advertisers said to put it in the other column, the newspaper would put it in there?"
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,253.724,254.736,Yes they would.
1972.72-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,255.656,261.32,It's not its judgment in any case as to whether the job was more fitting for male?
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,261.32,262.733,Not on the record.
1972.72-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,283.559,298.846,"Is there a -- again as a matter of fact, is there any question about what the decision to set up the classified ads, the Help Wanted ads, under this format was exclusively the decision of your client, the newspaper."
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,298.846,300.244,Absolutely sir that's why we are here.
1972.72-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,300.244,301.408,That’s what I thought.
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,301.408,319.441,"It is the very strongly held opinion, Scripps-Howard Newspapers who have the controlling interest in the Pittsburgh Press and in the Pittsburgh Press that this does serve a legitimate reader and advertiser function in providing a -- well similar to playing 20 questions."
1972.72-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,347.798,350.13,And the proof is that advertisers utilize them.
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,350.13,368.722,"Yes, and if one reads the record and the allegations of the original complainants in this case, one would assume that these are just placed there solely for the purposes of invidious discrimination that everybody who places an ad for a secretary is seeking to discriminate against male secretaries."
1972.72-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,418.109,421.482,How about the -- now these were all ads for 'Help Wanted'.
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,427.885,430.067,Job seekers are neutered.
1972.72-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,438.602,439.927,All are just neutered indiscriminately?
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,439.927,441.554,Yes sir.
1972.72-419,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,442.265,449.006,Do you mean that they would reject an ad if it said 'Middle aged women wants housekeeping job'?
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,449.006,450.744,"Yes, they do that."
1972.72-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,468.226,482.849,"Well, surely the Chief Justice’s question -- if it is a middle aged woman who wants a job, doesn't she -- and she wants to say she is a middle aged woman who wants a job, you wouldn't reject her ad because of that, because she didn’t say she was a man."
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,482.849,491.084,I believe the City would attempt to get her to dissuade her from placing it because of their agreement with the Human Relations Commission.
1972.72-419,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,497.247,500.292,That's a different subject.
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,500.292,505.883,[Laughter Attempt] We do censor ad content voluntarily based on the editorial judgment of the newspaper.
1972.72-419,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,505.883,514.024,But you see now a First Amendment problem in either rejecting or trying to control an ad 'Middle aged woman wants housekeeping job'.
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,514.024,517.222,"Yes sir, I see a First Amendment problem enforcing a newspaper to do it."
1972.72-419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,536.793,548.48,"Mr. Volk, sometime in the last two or three weeks I remember seeing some sort of a  statement from some paper that it was going to start publishing want ads for nothing, without charging people for them."
1972.72-419,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,560.072,577.835,"Yes, it's part of our contention I would have it later in my argument, that a newspaper Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is a forum, a country market place if you will, a Roman Forum of the flow of information and ideas, and a very significant part of this is the Want ad columns."
1972.72-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,928.829,933.69,But you are not -- does your case hang on that?
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,933.69,934.64,Does our case hang on that?
1972.72-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,938.215,944.466,"I know, but let's assume Valentine survives, it just survives, do you lose?"
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,944.466,954.05,"If Valentine survives in some of its grosser language, its simplistic language, if no distinctions can be drawn, we may very well lose."
1972.72-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,954.05,964.244,"Because I would assume that you wouldn't -- if there is any way around Valentine that's reasonable, you would suggest, we do that first as an overrule --"
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,964.244,969.57,"Yes, Valentine, as I am sure you know Mr. Justice White, is a two page opinion."
1972.72-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,999.422,1007.54,"Well, I thought a major part of your argument perhaps was that even if commercial speech isn't protected, there is more to this speech here than commerce."
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1007.54,1008.771,"Oh, it certainly is, so there is the editorial --"
1972.72-419,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1008.771,1018.721,"Well, what about that part of it if -- I suppose you say that we can decide the case in your favor without overruling Valentine at all."
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1018.721,1026.757,"Yes, you could by deciding -- unless you take an extremely simplistic view of Valentine which is to say if it's commercial, it has no protection."
1972.72-419,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1036.412,1041.161,"Well the advertisement in Times was distinguished from Valentine, wasn't it?"
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1041.161,1042.5,"Yes, it was."
1972.72-419,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1042.5,1046.365,That was an advertisement in New York Times versus Sullivan.
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1046.365,1048.082,"Yeah, it was a political advertisement."
1972.72-419,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1048.082,1062.558,"It was an verdict and it was said that it was in -- Valentine had nothing -- Valentine and Chrestensen had nothing to do with the First Amendment questions raised by that advertisement, that's what Times and Sullivan held when --"
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1062.558,1065.714,Yes. Valentine versus --
1972.72-419,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1065.714,1071.095,"Are you suggesting you may make the same argument, perhaps for different reasons as to this --"
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1071.095,1072.494,Yes.
1972.72-419,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1083.551,1095.629,"I just wonder then if the question Mr. Justice White put to you is when you ought to address yourself which is namely, assuming that Valentine and Chrestesen is not to be overruled."
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1095.629,1096.02,Yes.
1972.72-419,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1096.02,1101.593,Like the advertisement in New York Times and Sullivan ought not we agree that these two should be distinguished.
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1101.593,1103.49,And we certainly think that you should.
1972.72-419,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1103.49,1104.636,Why?
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1104.636,1111.46,"We feel that the Help Wanted arrangement, we have two points on that, both which can be distinguished from Valentine unless as you did in Sullivan."
1972.72-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1213.977,1229.701,"But isn't there a great difference between somebody using its expertise and its political thought and its editorial policy as to Vietnam and as to somebody getting a job, his employment?"
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1229.701,1253.056,"That argument has been made and has attractive merit until we realize that we are in a law explosion at -- we are those of us who labor in this venue out there see every passage of every new act of Congress, we have new guidelines, new regulations, new rules that are imposed upon business and we find that the newspapers --"
1972.72-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1253.056,1256.868,Well business is not protected by the First Amendment.
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1256.868,1262.234,Well I would think that business has some protections under the First Amendment Mr. Justice Marshall. I think a newspaper --
1972.72-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1262.234,1265.184,Well I don't think a plumbing business has any protection under the First Amendment.
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1265.184,1282.168,"Well I think the plumbing business, if he places a commercial advertisement in a newspaper, have certain First Amendment rights to express his -- to put his ad, and I think that’s what our case is, to some degree, all about that the commercial context does not totally devoid of First Amendment protection."
1972.72-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1384.185,1388.079,The newspaper retains the right to take what they like of it?
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1388.079,1390.161,"I am sorry sir, I missed the first part of your question."
1972.72-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1390.161,1404.093,"The newspaper retains the right to take whatever regulations they like and reject those they don't like, and with this the fact that you said that the middle age woman couldn't put the ad in --"
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1404.093,1405.385,In the Pittsburgh Press?
1972.72-419,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1405.385,1405.781,Yeah.
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1412.929,1427.654,"Our position is that those -- well yeah, that was the voluntary act merely by committing a voluntary cooperation with the Humans Relations Commission, I don't think it obligates us to take the whole law if it impinges on us in someway we wish to challenge in Court."
1972.72-419,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1540.19,1553.791,"Mr. Volk, some communities have an ordinance, for example, that prohibits a restaurant from employing waitresses between the hours of 2 a.m. And 6 a.m."
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1555.589,1556.605,"No sir, not to my knowledge."
1972.72-419,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1559.545,1568.926,If you did then the restaurant operator who wanted help for the graveyard shift what would be the attitude --
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1568.926,1572.521,"In our attitude, we could take the ad any way we wanted it."
1972.72-419,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1583.385,1587.717,"Incidentally, you did print a disclaimer in your newspaper."
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1587.717,1588.167,Yes.
1972.72-419,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1588.167,1590.754,Are you placing much emphasis on this?
1972.72-419,0,20251,charles_r_volk,,1590.754,1593.581,"Oh, I wrote it. [Laughter]"
1972.72-419,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1744.007,1747.794,Mr. Strassburger.
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,1747.794,1751.011,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2105.526,2112.419,We will pick that there after lunch counsel. [Luncheon Recess]
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2114.772,2118.253,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.72-419,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2170.703,2186.027,But the newspaper has in setting up this setup on its Help Wanted pages given advanced thought to the proposition that some jobs maybe of more interest to women and other jobs of more interest to men.
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2199.005,2217.024,"Your Honor I don't think that this is anymore an idea than to say that a violator of the Antitrust Law says that well, his violation of the Antitrust Law shows his idea that monopoly is beneficial to society."
1972.72-419,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2217.024,2222.443,"Well, but that doesn't involve -- perhaps you are quite right."
1972.72-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2237.351,2249.457,"No, the newspaper sets up the framework but the advertiser, by placing an advertisement in this sex segregated column is discriminating."
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2290.666,2294.739,I completely disagree with the answer that Mr. Volk gave.
1972.72-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2294.739,2295.887,What would yours be?
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2295.887,2298.1,Well first of all it's not covered by the ordinance.
1972.72-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2312.363,2315.252,"Alright, let me turn it around the other way now."
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2334.08,2344.86,"He can do that, because number one, he is not covered by the ordinance either, because the ordinance excludes situations of five or a fewer employees."
1972.72-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2344.86,2345.664,Alright.
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2352.315,2367.901,"If the job is certified as a bona fide -- as having a bona fide occupational qualification, then either an employer or an employment agency can place this type of ad."
1972.72-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2418.566,2421.132,But the Commission isn't required to give that exemption.
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2427.608,2430.274,"Well, certainly there is a judgment involved."
1972.72-419,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2487.791,2493.525,"Who has to get the exemption, the employer or employment agency or the newspaper?"
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2493.525,2499.325,"The employer -- the advertiser, whomever that maybe."
1972.72-419,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2543.749,2546.069,Did that case involve a newspaper?
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2546.069,2546.852,"No Your Honor, it didn't."
1972.72-419,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2546.852,2548.1,"Well, that's the big difference here."
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2555.406,2558.718,"Well, Your Honor, our first contention is that these --"
1972.72-419,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2558.718,2559.661,Unless they want to speak.
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2559.661,2566.059,-- that these are non-ideas and these headings can't raise non-ideas to the level of ideas.
1972.72-419,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2603.479,2604.845,That was one thing.
1972.72-419,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2605.567,2609.3,Have those holdings been predicated in Valentine and Chrestensen?
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2609.3,2613.286,"Alright, most of them have, Your Honor."
1972.72-419,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2613.286,2640.264,"It's one thing, it would occur to me, to prohibit an employer from discriminating in his hiring policies as among races or sexes or anything else and also to prohibit him from advertising that would indicate any discrimination, but that's quite another thing from the government putting a restriction on a newspaper as to what it can print."
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2640.264,2660.795,"Well, Your Honor, as far as the in-advance a argument is concerned, this Court and other courts have held that the prior-restrain argument does not apply where the speech is not fully protected. For instance, in the Lorain Journal case --"
1972.72-419,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2660.795,2663.402,That all gets us back to Valentine and Chrestensen.
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2663.402,2665.385,"No, Your Honor, it doesn't necessarily."
1972.72-419,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2732.92,2740.119,But that case didn't either involve a government telling a newspaper what it could and could not put in its newspaper.
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2740.119,2767.781,"Well, there have been cases which have so held in this Court -- it's our feeling that what the petitioner says here is that we are entitled to special protection, because we are a newspaper, but in this economic area it's not entitled to more protection just because it has editorial functions, than the ad in Valentine was entitled to protection because it was appended to the back of a political protest."
1972.72-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2809.591,2815.265,"Or at least you can't refuse them on that ground, prohibit more narrowly than that?"
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2815.265,2818.344,I think that's probably true.
1972.72-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2833.093,2843.887,"You seem to separate the First Amendment completely from the economic aspect, but could a newspaper survive if it just sold the newspaper to readers without any advertising?"
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2843.887,2848.802,"Your Honor, we are not saying that the newspaper can't have this advertising."
1972.72-419,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2918.797,2950.019,"Mr. Strassburger, supposing that your Commission applied the regulations and ordinance that it now has and you felt that it just wasn't getting far enough in eliminating employment discrimination, because there were still nuances in the want-ads that it just couldn't seem to eliminate, and supposing, the City of Pittsburgh then decided that there will be no Help Wanted ads permitted in the newspapers, we are going to funnel them all through a public employment agency, where we can make sure that these nuances are eliminated, now would you think that was constitutional?"
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2950.019,2963.377,"But then, you have a situation like the Grosjean case, where the newspaper is really being deprived of its lifeblood and I would think that that would be an entirely different situation than we have here."
1972.72-419,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2995.602,2996.86,What is the conduct?
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,2996.86,3013.896,"The conduct is participating in this discriminatory scheme and again and again, just a last --  few months ago in California against La Rue, Justice Rehnquist said that conduct does not have the protection that pure speech has."
1972.72-419,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3013.896,3026.489,"Mr. Strassburger, in connection with the distinction you are now drawing between editorial and commercial advertising, may I put this hypothetical?"
1972.72-419,1,23229,eugene_b_strassburger_jr,,3067.023,3083.239,"Your Honor, if we are dealing with just the editorial type advertiser, if they are not actually hiring people, then I think it's a New York Times against Sullivan situation and this is protected speech under the First Amendment."
1972.72-419,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3130.663,3138.96,"Mrs. Matson, your colleague Mr. Strassburger has used up some of your time, but in view of these arguments we will give you your full 10 minutes."
1972.72-419,2,36334,marjorie_h_matson,,3138.96,3143.149,"Thank You Chief Justice Burger, members of the Court."
1972.72-419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3469.497,3479.603,Why wouldn't it be enough for the State to move against the employer and forbid the employer from indicating to the paper any preference whatsoever unless he had a certificate?
1972.72-419,2,36334,marjorie_h_matson,,3479.603,3497.478,"Well, Your Honor, the ordinance itself provides for people to get a certificate, if they want -- if there is a bona fide occupation qualification, but we are trying to break down the classification system."
1972.72-419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3497.478,3509.134,Do you think the Press would ever -- do you think the press would continue this if employer was forbidden when the paper asked him to specify a column?
1972.72-419,2,36334,marjorie_h_matson,,3509.134,3509.15,Yes.
1972.72-419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3509.15,3519.992,"Let's assume for the moment that no employer would ever break the law if it was forbidden to indicate a preference and that whenever they were asked, they say “Awfully sorry, we just couldn't care less.”"
1972.72-419,2,36334,marjorie_h_matson,,3523.68,3527.445,"Well, that question, I guess, would have to be addressed to the Press."
1972.72-419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3527.445,3536.702,But don't you have the answer to that question before you can justify putting a prohibition on the Press itself?
1972.72-419,2,36334,marjorie_h_matson,,3536.702,3546.595,"Well, Your Honor, the thing is that we could knock off one employment agency after another and go through all of those, that's clearest cut case here."
1972.72-419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3548.554,3553.186,"Alright, so in this case, it's a conservation of resources, there is only one newspaper."
1972.72-419,2,36334,marjorie_h_matson,,3553.186,3579.063,"It's a way -- well, there are two but they are published together, so it's the same difference, but what we are trying to do is to get at the advertising, which is the thing, which -- the advertising headings, which are the message which is being conveyed to women that they should stay away from applying for a particular job."
1972.72-419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3616.041,3626.821,"Well, I take it that you concede that, don't you that if you could get an injunction against the press you can also get an injunction against the employer for communicating with the press as to what column to put it in?"
1972.72-419,2,36334,marjorie_h_matson,,3626.821,3627.949,"Well, then you see you would be left --"
1972.72-419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3627.949,3630.169,But could you or couldn't you?
1972.72-419,2,36334,marjorie_h_matson,,3630.169,3636.302,"I don't know that you could, and as a communication of that kind I shouldn't think that we can reach that very readily, Your Honor."
1972.72-419,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3636.302,3638.2,"Well not readily but legally, couldn't you?"
1972.72-419,2,36334,marjorie_h_matson,,3638.2,3651.479,It seems to me that you would have to enjoin the individual employment agency or employer from advertising under a Male Help Wanted column or a Female as the case maybe.
1972.72-419,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3708.047,3709.09,Thank you.
1972.72-419,3,20251,charles_r_volk,,3713.978,3718.816,"I don't think I will need that Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1972.72-419,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3796.136,3803.594,"Mr. Volk if the Equal Rights Amendment is ratified, does your your First Amendment argument then (Inaudible)?"
1972.72-419,3,20251,charles_r_volk,,3803.594,3804.779,"No, I don't think so."
1972.72-419,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3884.582,3885.47,Thank you Mr. Volk.
