1983.83-218,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,40.625,"Mr. League, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,40.625,42.16,Thank you.
1983.83-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,473.885,475.401,Could I interrupt to ask you a question--
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,475.401,476.218,"--Yes, sir."
1983.83-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,476.218,477.252,--About the case?
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,482.99,483.656,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,483.656,490.143,And is it also true that the period... he would have completely served his sentence now if he hadn't been released when he was?
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,492.176,493.012,"No, sir."
1983.83-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,517.128,518.66,What will happen if you win?
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,518.66,523.131,"If I win, he will return to custody."
1983.83-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,541.159,550.849,"So the net result would be that by winning and lose, if you win, he would merely have postponed what would otherwise have been his total release."
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,550.849,551.551,That's right.
1983.83-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.201,559.12,There's really hardly a vital state interest in the case at this point.
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,560.071,561.506,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-218,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,581.32,584.938,Do you know exactly how much time he'd have to serve?
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,584.938,585.705,"No, sir."
1983.83-218,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,766.221,769.922,"Well, what was... what was the court doing when it said it reviewed the instructions?"
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,769.922,780.397,"--Your Honor, I assume that it was reviewing those instructions on its own to see if there was any plain error at that time under state law."
1983.83-218,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,781.63,794.24,And... but you think that's a completely different thing than... than forgiving a procedural lapse?
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,794.24,801.144,"You mean in the cases Mr. Nakell cited, the later cases, as opposed to--"
1983.83-218,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.144,822.057,"Well, I suppose if... if the Supreme Court of your state regularly accepts some constitutional challenge to a set of instructions even though those challenges weren't presented below, there wouldn't be any lapse at all, would there?"
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,822.057,823.926,"--Your Honor, they don't do that."
1983.83-218,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.961,830.33,But they will always review it for plain error?
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,830.33,845.69,"--Apparently on request, at least in these cases... and I believe there were five of them that fit that mold... the lawyer says I cannot find anything wrong with this... with this appeal; I am abandoning my assignment of error; would you please look it over?"
1983.83-218,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,846.773,858.765,So you think it might... you think the case might come out differently if he had raised his objection below and preserved it and presented it to the Supreme Court of the state?
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,858.765,864.483,"Well, he wouldn't have had to raise it below under the law at the time of the trial."
1983.83-218,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,892.234,899.721,"Well, of course, the cause in prejudice is beside the point if there hasn't been any lapse."
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,899.721,902.775,"Oh, I understand."
1983.83-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1044.634,1047.42,Could you explain how you think the interest in sandbagging applies here?
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1048.27,1048.953,--Okay.
1983.83-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.953,1059.727,"I can understand in the trial context, but why... why if the lawyer had a good point... and presumably he has here if it's... if... why wouldn't he raise it on direct appeal and win as soon as he could?"
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1059.727,1066.964,"Well, Your Honor, I think where it would come into play would be where there'd be a factual dispute about it and the lawyer would say--"
1983.83-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1066.964,1068.916,"Well, he's either entitled to the instruction or he isn't."
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1071.785,1073.735,"--Oh, I don't say sandbagging occurred here."
1983.83-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.735,1074.737,Pardon me?
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1074.737,1075.32,"No, sir."
1983.83-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.807,1087.978,"Well, in an issue like this, how could sandbagging ever occur in the appellate context, unless you have a stupid lawyer?"
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1091.013,1095.648,"--Sandbagging, I would say, comes into play, Your Honor, when you're dealing with factual problems."
1983.83-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1095.648,1096.131,Yes.
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1096.815,1097.483,"No, no."
1983.83-218,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1162.275,1168.179,Do you think in that respect self-defense and malice are on the same footing?
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1168.179,1176.666,"As far as going ahead and making the argument, Your Honor, because you're dealing with argument by analogy, by and large."
1983.83-218,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.163,1204.036,"Well, what... have we held that the... have we... is there a decision in this Court on self-defense?"
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1204.036,1205.653,"--Not to my knowledge, no, sir."
1983.83-218,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.772,1216.426,"Well, we haven't held, have we, on a decision on the burden on self-defense, did we?"
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1216.426,1217.61,Not to my knowledge.
1983.83-218,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.61,1219.193,And--
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1251.097,1251.731,"Oh, yes."
1983.83-218,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1252.197,1252.764,That's clear.
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1252.764,1253.283,Yes.
1983.83-218,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1253.283,1254.066,That's clear.
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1258.068,1258.701,"No, sir."
1983.83-218,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.701,1262.072,But a lot of states put the burden on the prosecution.
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1262.072,1262.722,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-218,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.722,1269.709,But is there any... none of those cases... or do any of those cases rely on the federal Constitution for that?
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1270.293,1271.411,Putting on the burden of proof?
1983.83-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1305.382,1306.918,But you're not raising--
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1309.286,1312.738,"Well, that's their interpretation of Mullaney."
1983.83-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.94,1320.325,"Of course, you're not raising that question here, are you?"
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1320.325,1322.277,"No, sir."
1983.83-218,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1336.703,1338.387,You're now cutting into your colleague's time.
1983.83-218,0,39742,richard_n_league,,1338.387,1340.139,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1983.83-218,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1340.139,1354.649,Mr. Kneedler.
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1354.649,1358.451,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-218,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1765.578,1770.748,"Mr. Kneedler, can you think of anything that would constitute cause for failing to appeal a point like this?"
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1770.748,1772.35,For failing to appeal it?
1983.83-218,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1772.35,1772.984,Yeah.
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1776.219,1776.752,Right.
1983.83-218,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1800.433,1801.251,"Well, then it wouldn't be a default."
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1801.251,1801.851,--Pardon me?
1983.83-218,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1801.851,1802.851,Then it wouldn't be a default.
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1802.851,1803.787,That's right.
1983.83-218,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1804.32,1811.39,"But I'm trying to think of a case where there would be... I can understand ineffective assistance of counsel, of course, which would be an independent reason for setting aside the conviction."
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1815.591,1820.579,--I would think that the... I would think that the situations would be rare.
1983.83-218,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1820.579,1822.947,I think they're nonexistent.
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1822.947,1828.601,Ordinarily... ordinarily... ordinarily cause would be where the state has done something to prevent the... the--
1983.83-218,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1828.601,1830.435,"Then there's no default, by hypothesis."
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1830.435,1838.291,"--Well, through... through ineffective assistance of counsel, or... or one... one other circumstance where it might be as if the factual basis for the claim was not known at the time."
1983.83-218,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1838.291,1840.041,But then it wouldn't be in the record.
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1844.711,1847.095,"Ordinarily that's true, yes."
1983.83-218,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1847.73,1849.03,So I don't think there could be a case in appellate--
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1849.03,1850.063,"--In the appellate process, that's true."
1983.83-218,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1864.072,1868.393,"--Well, other than ineffective assistance of counsel, even on a total failure of appeal what could be cause?"
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1868.393,1869.36,--Well--
1983.83-218,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1869.36,1874.214,"There probably couldn't be, could there?"
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1874.214,1887.188,"--Well, a total failure to appeal, depending on the... if the defendant was not informed of his right to appeal in some fashion, that... that... either by the lawyer or by the court or was unaware of it, in those circumstances that might be true."
1983.83-218,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.005,1923.611,"Well, suppose they didn't appeal it because there was a decision of this Court that would have indicated that his appeal was wholly out of bounds?"
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1923.611,1927.229,"Well, the only way--"
1983.83-218,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1927.229,1931.466,And then later this Court reversed itself.
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1931.466,1935.335,"--Well, occasionally this Court has reversed itself, and it's done so presumably in cases--"
1983.83-218,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.335,1936.37,"Well, 175 times."
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1936.37,1942.357,--In cases in which litigants have chosen to reopen the issue even though it appeared to be foreclosed by this Court.
1983.83-218,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.976,1948.678,So even then you would say there would not be cause for not raising it.
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1948.678,1949.128,--That's right.
1983.83-218,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1950.211,1951.38,I suppose you have to say that.
1983.83-218,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1951.38,1953.213,--That's correct.
1983.83-218,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2013.37,2013.586,Very well.
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2020.457,2025.678,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-218,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2041.354,2050.543,"Well, the state can't concede in a federal constitutional issue, can it, say like on self-defense?"
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2050.543,2059.482,"--Your Honor, the state has conceded that he suffered prejudice from the constitutional violation."
1983.83-218,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.199,2062.267,What constitutional violation?
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2062.267,2064.45,"--Well, I'm not sure what they would refer to."
1983.83-218,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.135,2068.171,On malice.
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2068.171,2070.121,"On the malice issue, yes."
1983.83-218,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.123,2071.889,But not on the other.
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2071.889,2073.239,"Well, that's enough, Your Honor."
1983.83-218,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2073.239,2075.408,"Well, I agree that's enough."
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2077.443,2081.562,"Well, the self-defense question is open, I believe, Your Honor."
1983.83-218,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.412,2084.097,Yes.
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2087.216,2088.835,--In Engle the Court said that it wasn't... that it had... at least had... was not without merit.
1983.83-218,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2131.16,2134.112,"The court of appeals for the Fourth Circuit didn't pass on this question, did it?"
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2134.112,2135.362,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.83-218,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2202.471,2203.505,Wouldn't--
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2203.505,2205.923,Exactly the same as Mr. Ross' case.
1983.83-218,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2205.923,2224.485,"--Wouldn't our practice indicate that if we were to resolve against you the questions that were decided by the Fourth Circuit, that we would leave to the Fourth Circuit, the district court or some other court than this one this inquiry as to whether... what practice the Supreme Court of North Carolina followed?"
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2228.122,2241.263,"Well, Your Honor, I would not doubt that that is one option available to the Court, and I would certainly think that it's a mandatory option if the Court were to rule against me on the other issues, which I hope it would not do."
1983.83-218,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2541.277,2544.562,"Well, now, you say... you say with respect to an affirmative defense."
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2560.238,2578.45,"--Your Honor, under the law of North Carolina at the time, and indeed, the law of North Carolina as it had prevailed for over a century since 1864, for 105 years at the time, the North Carolina courts had declared this to be an affirmative defense; that is, a matter of excuse or extenuation."
1983.83-218,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2618.46,2627.299,"But the... it was also true that... that malice was an element of the defense, but it was just presumed."
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2627.299,2629.335,"Well, Your Honor, the--"
1983.83-218,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.335,2629.8,Isn't that right?
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2629.8,2638.204,--The North Carolina courts indulged in two rationales in order to... in order to impose the burden of proof on the defendant.
1983.83-218,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2644.976,2653.916,"But nevertheless, the... nevertheless, an ingredient of the offense was malice, and it was presumed."
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2653.916,2655.266,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.83-218,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2655.266,2659.32,And then the... then the defendant had to overcome it.
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2659.32,2660.47,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.83-218,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2786.336,2790.788,"Well, how did it get raised in Winship if it was so foreclosed?"
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,2790.788,2807.499,"--Well, Winship was an unusual case, Your Honor, in which the trial judge in a juvenile proceeding said that he would... he found the defendant guilty by a preponderance of the evidence, but not if the test were beyond a reasonable doubt."
1983.83-218,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3398.385,3402.853,Do you think there's a difference in logic?
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,3402.853,3404.372,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-218,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3405.922,3413.727,Don't you think an appellate court has the same entitlement to be put straight that a trial court does?
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,3413.727,3430.356,"--Your Honor, there certainly are some policies supporting a rule requiring an issue to be raised on appeal, and comity considerations suggest that a federal court should treat respectfully state rules in that regard, requiring issues to be raised on appeal."
1983.83-218,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3652.046,3655.981,"Well, now, do you really think it makes... it's that much more difficult?"
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,3667.907,3668.673,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-218,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3681.148,3685.933,"We don't know, but the point was saving the... saving the issue."
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,3688.118,3698.592,"Well, Your Honor, if that is going to be the rule, then attorneys will do that, and attorneys will have boilerplate briefs that they file in every case."
1983.83-218,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3698.592,3703.294,Do you think they don't... do you think they do not do it now in this Court and in most appellate courts?
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,3703.294,3707.615,"Your Honor, I think that there is too much of it now."
1983.83-218,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3707.615,3708.265,"Well, it doesn't--"
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,3708.265,3711.567,But I think that this will require it to be done in all cases.
1983.83-218,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3711.567,3713.269,--It doesn't bother the system.
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,3715.804,3721.708,"Well, I'm not sure what would be achieved by requiring it."
1983.83-218,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3744.454,3751.91,"Well, of course, the only thing you're really talking about is access to federal habeas corpus, which is an important matter, I suppose."
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,3759.548,3770.022,"What we're talking about is getting relief from an unconstitutional conviction, no matter how long after--"
1983.83-218,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3770.022,3771.589,"Well, 15 years after the crime is committed."
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,3771.589,3775.26,"--Well, Your Honor, not entirely 15 years."
1983.83-218,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3779.544,3781.579,When was the crime committed?
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,3781.579,3784.531,"Your Honor, the crime was committed in 1968."
1983.83-218,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3784.531,3788.983,"Well, then, it's 16 years after the crime was committed, wasn't it, from then until now?"
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,3788.983,3791.769,"Until now, yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-218,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3843.487,3855.045,But suppose in Oregon there are a number of inmates in the prisons who are there because of Leland against Oregon.
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,3889.449,3891.468,"Good question, Your Honor."
1983.83-218,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3941.0,3943.435,"Well, your time has expired, counsel."
1983.83-218,2,17910,barry_nakell,,3943.435,3943.969,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1983.83-218,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3943.969,3946.304,"Thank you, gentlemen."
