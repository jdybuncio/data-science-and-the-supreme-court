1962.38,0,19236,charles_k_hackler,,825.278,829.711,That comes Your Honor as rather a surprise.
1962.38,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,917.348,944.237,That is according to you that [Inaudible] and that was asked for by the Government regarding your case?
1962.38,0,19236,charles_k_hackler,,944.237,945.137,That's correct.

1962.38,0,19236,charles_k_hackler,,994.227,1006.776,"They had no -- they had no officers but according to the stipulation they met separately in sort of ad hoc meetings in this committee and the record doesn't show where it came from, I (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1006.776,1010.47,But did they participate in the general affairs of 626?
1962.38,0,19236,charles_k_hackler,,1010.47,1011.396,That is correct.

1962.38,0,19236,charles_k_hackler,,1032.473,1040.319,The record does not state but as a fact they were entitled to and they did subject of course to their being absent because they didn't care to attend.
1962.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1040.319,1042.537,Members have charges to them the same as to (Voice Overlap) --
1962.38,0,19236,charles_k_hackler,,1042.537,1052.206,"Slightly higher, initiation fee and slightly higher dues, but again that was not thought to be by the Government, it isn't a part of the stipulation but it is a fact."
1962.38,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1052.206,1057.355,"Did any of them belonged prior to this understanding, the recruitment?"
1962.38,0,19236,charles_k_hackler,,1057.355,1078.799,"The record is silent as to that and no, sir, as to whether they all -- as a matter of fact the record only shows the beginning in 1954 after the 10 fellow members of this group came to the union to ask for its assistance that only that a majority of them joined, entered at or about that time."
1962.38,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1078.799,1084.245,"Could the processors, drivers -- I understand they had drivers, is that right?"
1962.38,0,19236,charles_k_hackler,,1088.096,1089.297,"Yes ,Your Honor, I think --"
1962.38,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1089.297,1090.377,[Inaudible] belonged to a union that --
1962.38,0,19236,charles_k_hackler,,1090.377,1090.999,Yes.
1962.38,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1260.389,1265.787,"As I understand it, the only peddlers it would reach would be the independent one that had no employees?"
1962.38,0,19236,charles_k_hackler,,1265.787,1269.215,"That isn't -- that is correct, that is correct."

1962.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1380.662,1382.994,Isn't there a finding that there was no competition here?
1962.38,0,19236,charles_k_hackler,,1382.994,1389.86,There is a finding by the Court and that moves me to I think our fundamental difference with the Government and with the Court.
1962.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1400.71,1403.58,"Where is that finding on -- in the record, what page?"
1962.38,0,19236,charles_k_hackler,,1403.58,1416.373,It's in the Court's decision actually.

1962.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1484.84,1490.065,"Would you concede that if that were true, that this order is not improper?"
1962.38,0,19236,charles_k_hackler,,1490.065,1495.493,"No Your Honor, for this reason I take really two approaches to the thing."
1962.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1612.102,1617.726,"Now, let's take a case of -- where there clearly was not actual or potential economic competition."
1962.38,0,19236,charles_k_hackler,,1637.102,1643.999,"I would say no, assuming the factors as follows, that this is not a separate labor organization."
1962.38,1,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1952.891,1957.021,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."

1962.38,1,39534,robert_b_hummel,,2090.125,2096.498,"This was the only case that I'm aware of, yes, Your Honor."
1962.38,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2192.244,2209.114,"Well, the real issue between you and your opponent is [Inaudible]"
1962.38,1,39534,robert_b_hummel,,2209.114,2215.371,"Well, we submit Your Honor that there is power because the power of the equity court is to remedy --"

1962.38,1,39534,robert_b_hummel,,2216.652,2218.512,I was not certain Your Honor --
1962.38,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2218.512,2219.781,[Inaudible]
1962.38,1,39534,robert_b_hummel,,2219.781,2234.58,What is the nature of ? We think it's quite clear that there was power that the power of the equity court is to remedy a situation to prevent future violations and to restore possibility of competition.
1962.38,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2296.306,2302.56,Was there other opinions [Inaudible]

1962.38,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2307.025,2314.403,[Inaudible]
1962.38,1,39534,robert_b_hummel,,2314.403,2322.041,These members were independent businessmen and this we think makes a difference.
1962.38,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2322.522,2335.036,[Inaudible]
1962.38,1,39534,robert_b_hummel,,2335.036,2336.124,"Your Honor, if Your Honor please, I am --"
1962.38,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2336.124,2339.554,[Inaudible]
1962.38,1,39534,robert_b_hummel,,2339.554,2351.737,"Yes Your Honor, but I am also suggesting that these members would have reason to fear retaliation and therefore would not get out of the union as a result of that fear."
1962.38,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2435.744,2442.559,"Do you think you're as -- assuming, assuming that the District Court did have power to do what it did?"
1962.38,1,39534,robert_b_hummel,,2485.5,2487.723,We submit that wound is left Your Honor.
1962.38,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2522.259,2526.026,"Well, did the Government object to a [Inaudible]"
1962.38,1,39534,robert_b_hummel,,2526.026,2529.671,We would not Your Honor.
1962.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2529.671,2541.904,"Mr. Hummel, do you make any notice of stipulation of 69 at page 33, indicates that presently there are only two processors, is this right?"
1962.38,1,39534,robert_b_hummel,,2541.904,2542.457,"Yes, Your Honor, and that (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2542.457,2556.553,"To make any purchases and both of them, one apparently, the owner about those processors is a member of the union and the other processor, one of the truckers is a member of the union according to this stipulation."
1962.38,1,39534,robert_b_hummel,,2562.331,2577.445,"No, Your Honor and I think this reflects the fact that this could not result from a general policy of the Department of Justice to ask that independent peddlers be excluded from union membership whether independent businessmen."
1962.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2577.445,2592.814,"Well, do you support this dissolution in any ways on the basis of the fact that there are only two processors that which provide a market now for this grease?"
1962.38,1,39534,robert_b_hummel,,2592.814,2594.046,I was coming to that Your Honor.
