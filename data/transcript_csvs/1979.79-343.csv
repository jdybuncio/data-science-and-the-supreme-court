1979.79-343,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,74.105,We'll hear arguments next in Sun Ship Company against Pennsylvania.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,83.783,86.901,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-343,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,249.43,259.719,"You have told us that in this case, it's conceded that the -- that the respondents were within the coverage of the federal statute."
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,259.719,260.117,Yes sir.
1979.79-343,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,260.117,266.547,Because of the location of their injuries as well as their status.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,273.851,274.325,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-343,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,280.66,281.269,About -- that it's covered.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,281.269,282.971,-- at the edges of federal coverage.
1979.79-343,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,282.971,290.994,"And therefore, wherever the line may be under -- there -- there's going to be a twilight zone, I suppose."
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,292.571,294.312,Well Your Honor it -- it's certainly possible.
1979.79-343,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,324.422,325.656,But there still is a line.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,325.656,326.07,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-343,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,327.211,330.907,And -- and it's not -- it won't always be a clear line.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,330.907,331.795,It will not always be a clear line.
1979.79-343,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,331.795,350.949,"And therefore, if -- if you should be correct and if an injured workman or the survivors of a deceased workman that was killed honestly believe that they're under the coverage of the federal statute."
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,368.598,376.978,"Your Honor, I think that that is a question that would have to be addressed to the States, many of which have equitable tolling principles that operate in other contexts and I think that the --"
1979.79-343,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,376.978,378.946,"I think they do, but I gather some don't."
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,378.946,379.911,"Some may not, Your Honor."
1979.79-343,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,379.911,381.154,(Inaudible) the nature of your answer.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,381.154,399.584,"And I think that the statutes may well be tolled or ought to be tolled under any number of principles because plainly, the purpose to be served by a statute of limitations would not be met because the employer of course would be on notice of the claim and would realize that it's a jurisdictional dispute."
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,414.542,428.173,Have the maritime -- do all the maritime states purport to extend coverage that is clearly within the admiralty jurisdiction?
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,428.173,439.821,"Your Honor, in fact I would -- I think it's clear from some of the decisions that are cited in the various briefs that Florida for example is a state that plainly does not purport to extend its remedy to --"
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,439.821,440.01,Pennsylvania does.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,440.01,441.81,-- least claims within the Longshoremen's Act.
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,441.81,442.786,Pennsylvania does.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,442.786,447.43,Pennsylvania statute is a statute of general application applying to all employers injured within the common law.
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,447.43,448.682,Isn't that the general rule?
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,450.45,450.69,"Well, Your Honor --"
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,450.69,453.092,I mean is that the general situation not to rule?
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,453.092,468.164,"Well, I think Florida as I -- as I've already indicated, expressly limits the Longshoremen's Act -- I'm sorry, limits its statute and it doesn't apply where the Longshoremen's Act does apply and there are other such statutes in other maritime states which -- which work in a similar way."
1979.79-343,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,468.331,482.734,"Of course the Constitution continues, I suppose, to impose a limit upon the exertion of state power over -- over accidents or deaths that occur at sea."
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,482.734,483.887,"Yes sir, I believe it does and I think that the --"
1979.79-343,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,483.887,485.282,Or -- or navigable waters.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,485.282,485.741,And -- and it plainly --
1979.79-343,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,485.741,489.625,I mean the Jensen case has not been overruled ever as --
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,489.625,491.675,"As a -- no, I don't believe it has, Your Honor."
1979.79-343,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,525.857,535.485,"Well, quite powerful whether or not Congress has moved in the States, there's a constitutional limit upon the exercise of state jurisdiction over navigable waters, isn't there?"
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,535.485,535.832,Yes sir.
1979.79-343,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,561.467,562.601,The Jensen line.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,562.601,575.881,"And I think that there you have two kinds of jurisdictional disputes that you might have to answer, perhaps not in any individual case, but certainly over the course of the whole series of cases that are presented to the Court."
1979.79-343,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,575.881,582.859,"Mr. Hayes, the Pennsylvania statute, I suppose, purports to extend three miles out from shore, doesn't it?"
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,584.752,585.682,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-343,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,585.682,585.875,And it --
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,585.875,592.678,And it purports indeed to extend to injuries that might arise out of contracts of hire entered into in -- in Pennsylvania.
1979.79-343,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,645.547,651.505,"Well, there was some suggestion that in some cases, there will be a twilight zone or a gray zone."
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,655.475,656.677,"No Your Honor, there is no question."
1979.79-343,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,659.242,659.909,No.
1979.79-343,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,659.909,665.189,"What you're -- you're really here because of the financial aspects of the case, wholly apart from all the theory."
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,671.677,683.1,"Your Honor, in this specific case, the statement is correct that the state remedy would have made it possible for these claimants to receive more money than they could under the Pennsylvania Act."
1979.79-343,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,716.276,718.884,You don't believe you can live with concurrency.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,718.884,720.379,Your Honor?
1979.79-343,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,720.379,724.712,I take it you feel that your client can't live with concurrency.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,724.712,726.435,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-343,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,726.477,727.57,Why not?
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,727.57,740.333,"It introduces a level of uncertainty into the administration of a longshoreman -- I'm sorry, a shipbuilding type of operation which is what Sun Ship has."
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,791.888,803.281,"So if they were a claim from permanent disability under the federal Act and it was denied -- if there was concurrency, you could try it over again in the state system."
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,803.281,815.402,"He might, yes, Your Honor I -- I suppose that's true, although, he might be able to try it again in the state system if the State had a tolling kind of principle of its statute of limitations, recognizing if the federal decision --"
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,815.402,817.407,"Well, he might've filed at both places at the same time."
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,817.407,818.746,He might file in both places.
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,818.934,824.48,"And that if he loses in a -- in a higher level of jurisdiction, he tries it out in the other."
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,824.48,829.054,"He may, Your Honor, although I think that that introduces a whole set of difficult problems also."
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.054,829.992,"Well, I -- I understand that --"
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,829.992,831.179,If -- if you assume that -- that --
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,831.179,833.29,That that would follow from concurrency.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,833.29,862.283,"That would follow from concurrency and it would follow -- the problems would be introduced in any situation where the decision by the federal tribunal that there was no federal jurisdiction if the denial of the claim was based on anything other than a lack of jurisdiction, you have difficult problems of res judicata and collateral estoppel introduced into the state system at that point just as you do in the federal system which the cases already point to."
1979.79-343,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,949.28,965.227,But -- hasn't our rule been generally that it requires an affirmative showing by Congress to -- to preempt state of actions rather than just lack of a negative showing?
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,965.227,979.092,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I don't that has been the test and I think the Court specifically, in City of Burbank versus Lockheed, made it clear that there is not a requirement that there'd be an expressed statement of congressional intent to preempt."
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,980.385,991.643,"(Inaudible) frustration, the federal objective, an -- an actual conflict or a frustration of some federal objective."
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,991.643,992.496,"Well, Yes Your Honor in the sense that the federal --"
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,992.496,999.705,"Does not either -- either, there hasn't have to be a -- some affirmative statement but --"
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,999.705,1003.719,"That does not have to mean affirmative statement that the states are asked for, that's correct."
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.719,1004.525,And -- but --
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,1004.525,1005.255,But Section 5 will provide that.
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.255,1015.766,"But just the -- just -- just the general existence of a federal law doesn't preempt the state law in the same area, does it?"
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,1015.766,1016.517,"Well, Honor, that's what I meant to --"
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1016.517,1019.755,Unless there's a conflict or a frustration of the federal --
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,1019.755,1033.223,"In the admiralty area, there may well be an absolute preemption of the States where Congress comes in as it has done here with a comprehensive and complete remedy."
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1033.223,1043.281,What remedy -- what -- what congressional authority did Congress purport to be exercising in the 1972 amendments.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,1043.281,1048.765,"Its -- its authority -- its -- I think the legislative history, Mr. Justice White, is unclear."
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.661,1059.094,"Well, certainly in the commerce power, you don't have any automatic preemption."
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,1059.094,1099.125,"No, but you may -- but under the commerce power as you do in the case of the Federal Employers Liability Act if as in -- pursuant to an exercise of the commerce power, Congress moves into an area and defines a complete remedy and provides a -- an -- a solution to a problem which is complete and total in and of itself as -- as it did in the case of the Federal Employers Liability Act and there is no expressed preemption there and there is no statement that that Act is exclusive nonetheless this Court held that state efforts to provide a remedy for injured railway workers was preempted by the fact that Congress had acted affirmatively under the FELA."
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1099.125,1102.553,They found an intent to -- to preempt the field.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,1102.553,1104.48,That's correct and I think that that attempt --
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.48,1109.071,But -- but that isn't -- that just doesn't automatically follow from the passage of a law.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,1109.071,1109.384,"No, sir."
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.44,1115.159,"Well, what -- where do you find that kind of intent here?"
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,1115.159,1128.014,"I think, Your Honor, we find that the Act has -- has changed substantially in 1972 where you have Congress exercising its full admiralty powers in both maritime and in contract."
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.554,1169.695,"Well, Gilmore -- Gilmore and Black used the elimination of that language or just the opposite to prove just exactly the opposite."
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,1169.695,1170.022,Yes sir.
1979.79-343,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.993,1199.183,That's a considerable -- that's a considerable retreat from saying that it proves it.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,1199.183,1199.84,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-343,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1265.043,1275.243,"Well, if Congress intended that, can you suggest any reason why they didn't say it more clearly or say it at all?"
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,1275.243,1297.952,"Well, Your Honor, I think that they were probably relying upon the decisions of this Court which had previously held Section 5 to be exclusive in a situation where the remedy applies and it acts against that background just as the Court found in Parker, that Congress in enacting the statute of 1927, was acting against the background of the Jensen line without examining the validity of the Jensen line as such."
1979.79-343,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1334.101,1356.311,"And this is the -- the reasoning in -- is it Davis that -- that if jurisdiction -- federal jurisdiction were clear, remedy would be exclusive, did that rely on the notion that -- as in Jensen that where you got admiralty jurisdiction, it's got to be federal remedy or did it rely on the notion that Congress intended it to be exclusive."
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,1356.311,1358.016,Your Honor it's not -- it's not clear.
1979.79-343,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1362.2,1375.204,"Well that this is going to be idea of it that after the Calbeck decision, you certainly have Section 5 still reading or then reading as it still reads and it was then assumed, there was an area of overlap."
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,1375.204,1382.385,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't think -- I -- I agree that it was assumed that there was but I don't think either Calbeck or Davis compelled that result."
1979.79-343,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.004,1462.554,Thank you.
1979.79-343,0,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,1462.554,1478.451,"We think that the totality of the circumstances evidenced in the language of the statute in addition to the legislative history, manifest congressional intent to adopt a uniform system which a system of concurrent jurisdiction simply is not and cannot be."
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,1847.403,1847.548,Mr. Chief --
1979.79-343,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1847.548,1848.522,Mr. Lurie.
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,1848.522,1854.176,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.79-343,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2223.453,2228.333,"But in this particular case, if he had come to you, where would you have gone?"
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2228.333,2229.565,State.
1979.79-343,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2230.185,2232.307,"So that's the only problem, he didn't come to a lawyer."
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2232.307,2234.492,"No, they did come to a lawyer."
1979.79-343,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2234.492,2235.621,But he didn't come to you.
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2235.621,2236.914,He sure did.
1979.79-343,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.686,2242.04,Yes.
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2244.173,2245.275,"No, sir."
1979.79-343,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2335.346,2337.807,And then what did the federal side do?
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2337.807,2349.307,Absolutely nothing because no proceeding has ever been instituted by the shipyard in the federal court to pay them -- in the federal administration to pay them benefits.
1979.79-343,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2349.307,2350.487,They didn't get any benefit --
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2350.487,2356.99,They got absolutely not one cent as a result of their industrial injury from this employer.
1979.79-343,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2356.99,2359.31,Until today.
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2359.31,2364.062,"Even as of today, [Attempt to Laughter] haven't, no."
1979.79-343,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2373.158,2375.174,"If it's not money, what is it?"
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2375.174,2380.087,"Well, I think what we're talking about is -- is its -- its -- in a short range, it's money."
1979.79-343,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2380.087,2380.59,"Oh, I know."
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2381.322,2391.583,"But in the long range, it's -- it's rather the principle that there's going to be substantial delays and uncertainty if jurisdiction is exclusive."
1979.79-343,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2436.155,2441.953,"But until it is under Magnolia -- under Magnolia, it is a final judgment, isn't it?"
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2441.953,2453.964,"Well, I don't think it really were -- should work like that because for example, conversely, that the -- the modification order under -- under Pennsylvania could come 10 years after the decision."
1979.79-343,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2455.456,2461.111,"Even though under federal Act, the modification could come only within one year."
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2465.005,2465.594,Right.
1979.79-343,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2481.592,2485.228,"Well, that would be a flat overruling of Magnolia Petroleum, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2485.228,2492.941,"Well, I don't think the -- what we're talking about is the way -- that may very well be but that's the way the workmen's compensation law works."
1979.79-343,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2500.634,2507.351,But Magnolia Petroleum held that a workmen's compensation judgment was a final judgment for purposes of full full payment of benefits.
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2507.351,2514.445,"Well, I think in Calbeck the -- the Court sort of just ignored it."
1979.79-343,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2523.176,2524.385,What page are you referring to?
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2524.385,2530.587,"Page 131, where they're talking about binding elections."
1979.79-343,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2547.685,2551.877,"I thought Magnolia is a case from this Court, not from a Court of Appeals."
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2551.877,2567.555,"Well, I'm suggesting by inference, sir, that in Calbeck, this Court has -- has sort of ignored Magnolia and said, “We don't think” -- for example, one of the people in Calbeck did receive state benefits under an order."
1979.79-343,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2591.832,2592.278,Well --
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2592.278,2597.987,Would you think you could proceed under both acts for the same injury at the same time?
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2597.987,2599.253,Well --
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2599.253,2612.178,"What about -- could you -- could you get your award under the State -- under the -- under -- say, could you get your award here in Pennsylvania and get attorney's fees under the federal Act?"
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2612.178,2614.068,I -- I think as a practical matter.
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.393,2629.505,So the Pennsyl --
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2629.505,2646.979,"And as long as there are set offs, I think he should go whichever way he goes and that he shouldn't be hooked with the uncertainties there of going to a lawyer who did advise him of the -- what were the correct benefits or choosing himself to proceed on benefits without having competent counsel."
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2648.045,2653.238,So if the -- suppose he applies under the Pennsylvania law and he's paid.
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2653.238,2654.392,Right.
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2654.392,2659.825,And he finds out when he's getting paid that his attorney's fees come out of it.
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2663.25,2664.047,No.
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.094,2665.047,-- might -- how do I put it.
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2666.397,2678.481,"Well, because under federal -- federal law that -- the cases have held that attorney's fees could not be paid for issues of law, would simply file -- involve attorney's fees."
1979.79-343,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2731.754,2734.359,But not -- but only through one.
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2734.359,2740.389,"Well, only -- he only gets one -- paid from one person anyway i.e. his employer."
1979.79-343,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2749.634,2753.622,What's -- the -- the employer has the (Voice Overlap)
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2753.622,2775.636,"Well, not usually because -- because what I'm saying is, is that if this Court is -- comes down to weigh in this decision the way we hope it will, the employer will certainly get the message that since there is full concurrent jurisdiction and since he's been paid under State, they put him involuntarily under State and if there is full concurrent jurisdiction --"
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2775.636,2775.782,Well --
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,2775.782,2777.503,-- then the employers don't want to litigate twice.
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.856,3195.847,"The very first compensation for injury wasn't involved there, was it?"
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3195.847,3198.166,The -- the same exact issues were involved.
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3198.436,3214.555,"How do you distinguish this case from -- how would you argue -- why is this different from the employer's liability cases on -- on -- covering the railroads, workmen's compensation laws don't apply to railroad."
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3214.555,3217.245,"Well, that's -- you have the -- goes to different act entirely."
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3217.245,3221.038,"Well, of course, it's a different act but what's in it that's different than this?"
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3228.618,3229.409,Exactly.
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3229.409,3231.112,Well --
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3231.112,3232.998,"Well, they're not saying that here."
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3232.998,3235.266,"Well, that -- the -- the question."
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3235.997,3236.301,"Well, what they do is (Voice Overlap) they say that --"
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3236.301,3237.663,-- is that what Congress.
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3237.663,3237.969,We're -- we're --
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3237.969,3240.9,Is that what Congress intended to do?
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3245.166,3246.038,"No, I think they did."
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3259.225,3260.555,At that time -- when?
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3260.555,3260.824,This is when --
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3260.824,3261.508,Employer's liability?
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3261.508,3261.942,Yes.
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3264.569,3266.474,"Well, they're going to get up here to get settled --"
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3266.474,3266.636,Well --
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3266.636,3268.704,-- in the Winfield case.
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3268.704,3276.622,"Well, that -- that may very well be but what the Court did there is saying you're going to -- that the legislature said, “You're going to apply federal law."
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3286.675,3287.245,"Well, that's right."
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3301.422,3302.265,Right.
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3307.744,3318.85,I know that's -- I know that's your position but that's the question in the -- here whether -- you still haven't indicated to me why any evidence that --
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3318.85,3318.965,No.
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.965,3324.537,And the reason to -- to distinguish this case from the Winfield case.
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3324.537,3357.177,"Well, I would suggest that the -- that the history of the -- of Section 3 (a) under the 1972 Act which I've just mentioned is -- is -- you could -- you could get no other interpretation that Congress in 1972 realized what Davis said, what Calbeck said and therefore, eliminated from the Act language that would give state courts exclusive remedy where you have a -- an injury which occurred within the twilight zone."
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3357.177,3363.855,But Longshoremen's Act originally was just a gap-filler wasn't it?
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3363.855,3375.348,"Well, I don't it was a -- I don't think -- I - -I know that the word -- I -- I don't think it was -- it -- it was supposed to cover injuries which occurred --"
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3375.348,3378.615,It's supposed to cover injuries that state compensation systems been (Voice Overlap).
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3378.615,3380.092,"Right, exactly, exactly."
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.092,3384.605,"Well, certainly, there was more of an intent than that in this case."
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3391.526,3406.676,"No, the -- the intent was the quid pro quo was to give up the common law action that Zurichi in return for which, the jurisdictional limits of the Act were to be opened."
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.685,3419.703,"But for the first time, in 1972, they departed for the first time from -- form the notion that the Longshoremen's Act applies only when a state act may not."
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3419.703,3420.761,"They -- who, the Congress?"
1979.79-343,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3420.761,3422.053,Yes.
1979.79-343,1,31586,joseph_lurie,,3422.053,3435.467,"Well, let me -- I would suggest that in 1962, this Court came down with -- with Calbeck and Congress took no action from 1962 to 1972 to say, “Wait a minute, Supreme Court, you were wrong in Calbeck.”"
1979.79-343,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3461.889,3464.179,"Very well, do you have anything further, Mr. Hayes?"
1979.79-343,2,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,3467.851,3468.214,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1979.79-343,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3505.071,3507.441,"Mr. Hayes, is that in this record?"
1979.79-343,2,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,3507.441,3508.006,"No, Your Honor."
1979.79-343,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3537.292,3539.363,"Mr. Hayes, just one question."
1979.79-343,2,30765,jeffery_c_hayes,,3559.434,3561.624,"No, Your Honor, I do not agree with that statement."
1979.79-343,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3582.504,3583.54,I see.
1979.79-343,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3583.54,3584.189,"Thank you, gentlemen."
