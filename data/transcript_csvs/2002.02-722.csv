2002.02-722,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.426,"We'll hear argument now in Number 027-22, American Insurance Association versus John Garamendi."
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,9.757,13.81,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2002.02-722,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,99.628,130.497,"Mr. Geller, I... let me mention a couple of things that I find troubling about the case, and one is that when Congress passed a law in this area it didn't include any language preempting State laws such as California has, and when the President put out his executive order or agreement it doesn't expressly do so, either."
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,133.953,138.589,"--Well, the statute that Congress passed was the Holocaust Assets--"
2002.02-722,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,138.589,140.075,"Yes, right."
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,140.075,147.481,"--Commission Act, which clearly gave authority to the President to take control of this issue, and didn't provide any role for the States whatsoever."
2002.02-722,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.481,149.426,But it didn't preclude a role.
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,149.426,156.8,"But in the area of foreign affairs, under this Court's decision in Zschernig, and in the area of foreign commerce under many of this Court's decisions--"
2002.02-722,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,156.8,159.845,"Well, Zschernig has never been cited since it was written."
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,162.707,165.733,--Our whole case does not depend on Zschernig--
2002.02-722,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,165.733,176.459,"--case on, and we have in the meantime decided, for instance, Barclay's Bank, which has some language in it that speaks against recognizing the kind of--"
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,176.459,177.324,--I don't--
2002.02-722,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.324,184.793,"--authority you talk about, and we have the Breard case, that criminal case, Breard versus Greene."
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,187.516,193.48,"--Well, to begin with I think Barclay's is completely distinguishable, Justice O'Connor, on at least three grounds."
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,233.922,239.54,But the United States must have been aware that the California legislation existed.
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,239.54,239.951,--I--
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,239.951,260.137,"And the... part of the story is that this State legislation was on the books before the executive agreement with Germany and Austria that you've just applauded, so when California acted there wasn't any such accord."
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,260.137,265.391,"--Well, several things, Justice Ginsburg, and then I want to get back to answer Justice O'Connor's question."
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,326.895,330.002,Zschernig involved criticism of a foreign government.
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,330.002,330.974,--So does this statute.
2002.02-722,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,332.451,341.579,"Is that really a sound basis for a decision like Zschernig, to say Oregon probate judges were inquiring about the policies of Eastern European countries?"
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,345.158,353.41,"--But this case, Chief Justice, is much stronger than Zschernig because this is not a case, unlike Zschernig, where the President has done nothing in the area."
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,389.021,393.719,"But Mr. Geller, said in that very agreement there is to be no preemption."
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,397.713,399.985,--I don't think it specifically says there's to be no preemption.
2002.02-722,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,429.398,440.667,"Well, if we can look just at the agreement, isn't this what is usually called an executory agreement, rather than a... than a fully executed agreement?"
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,455.186,456.702,"No, I think, Justice--"
2002.02-722,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,456.702,459.075,"--It sounds to me like executory, rather than fully--"
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,459.075,505.163,"--I think what the agree... Just... Mr. Kneedler is probably better equipped to address the meaning of the executive agreement, but it seems to me what... what the President has chosen to do there is to promise to use his best efforts to look to see whether any States or localities are taking actions which interfere with the promises that the President has made to foreign countries and foreign insurance companies to try to achieve legal peace in the United States, and in those instances where the States have taken action which interferes directly with that... with that promise, the President has promised to use his best efforts, such as to file briefs in this Court and others, arguing that these... these State statutes are preemptive, so it's... there's no... I think in the lingo of a statute there is no express preemption here, but there's clearly implied preemption under the Supremacy Clause."
2002.02-722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,505.163,508.486,"--Mr. Geller, I may have misheard you, but didn't you describe the agreement a little more broadly than its terms?"
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,522.215,534.952,"Well, the... the international commission not only set up a claims resolution process, it also has procedures for the disclosure of information which take into account European privacy laws, Justice Stevens."
2002.02-722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,535.571,536.448,But that's a different argument.
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,539.044,555.418,"--Well, the executive agreement chose the... the President chose through the executive agreement and through his negotiations with foreign countries to use the ICHEIC system, rather than any parallel system, in part because of the concern about violating European privacy laws."
2002.02-722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,559.863,566.813,"Well, but as I understand it, the California... one of the purposes of the California statute is to... to uncover claims that might not be known about."
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,571.406,580.944,"--But the international commission has a separate... separate policy for divulging information that... and right now the, it's in the process of finalizing that."
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,586.874,598.352,"--But all, Mr. Geller, would you clarify all, because I had the impression from the briefs that there were only five companies, and that they cover something like a little over 35 percent--"
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,598.352,599.48,"--No, that's... that's--"
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,599.48,599.949,--of the universe of... of claims?
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,599.949,601.349,"--false, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.993,630.74,It's still a wholly voluntary--
2002.02-722,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,630.74,637.302,--How... how specifically does the... does the California statute interfere with the operations of the commission?
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,637.302,640.442,"--It interferes in a number of different ways, Justice Kennedy."
2002.02-722,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,650.744,652.292,"Well, that's assuming there's a suit brought later, but--"
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,652.292,654.935,"That's assuming, that's... this is all a part of the California system."
2002.02-722,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,656.033,658.175,--And that doesn't meet Justice Stevens' point that this is just a disclosure--
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,658.175,662.642,"--Well, that's... I want to get to that as the second reason, but I want to make sure the Court appreciates the first reason."
2002.02-722,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,667.131,667.691,--I... I don't understand.
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,669.811,686.275,"--It would be because under the international commission these companies have already made a substantial payment, over $100 million, to settle their claims, but if the California process is allowed to continue, it's possible that people will be able to bring suit in California and recover separate--"
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,686.275,687.012,This case is about a disclosure statute--
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,687.012,687.281,--It's--
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,687.281,689.822,--there's other legislation that is not before us.
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,689.822,690.547,--I under--
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,690.547,695.006,We are talking about a statute that doesn't authorize anybody to bring suit.
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,697.056,718.941,"--But the only purpose of the statute, and this is as clear as can be from the face of the statute, is to provide information so that Californians can bring suit in California, but the second way in which the California statute, Justice Kennedy, interferes with the ICHEIC process is that all of these companies agreed to the ICHEIC process on the assumption that European privacy laws would be respected."
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,724.707,728.755,"Mr. Geller, one... would you explain one thing that is troubling?"
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,762.261,764.461,"--But Justice Ginsburg, this is very important."
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,803.107,803.84,How does one know that?
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,803.84,833.917,"It... it know... under I... under the ICHEIC system, all of the policies written during this era that are on electric data base are to be... are to be put into a system, and independently ICHEIC has done a census of all of the possible Holocaust victims in Germany during the pre-war period through various records and come up with several hundred thousand names which will be matched against the list of policyholders, and when there is a match, that list will be put out on a public data base."
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,834.52,834.714,There was a list--
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,834.714,835.174,--The German--
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,835.174,837.164,--There was a list that was due out in April.
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,837.627,852.72,"--That will... I'm told that list will be out by the end of this month, and the German insurance authorities have concluded that publication of that list would not violate any privacy laws because it would be for the benefit of the people who are trying to recover on these unpaid Holocaust era insurance policies."
2002.02-722,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,853.805,858.037,--I take it you could make that argument even absent the claims commission.
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,858.037,860.453,--Absolutely.
2002.02-722,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,885.025,893.562,How... how does it relate to the... suppose we want to link the harm that this does under the privacy laws to the operation of the commission.
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,900.627,903.756,It's simply that California has no relationship to any of these policies.
2002.02-722,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,909.386,911.21,--But that's a separate argument from the operation of the commission.
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,911.21,914.072,--It is a separate argument from the... I think the... the--
2002.02-722,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,914.072,919.038,Tell us briefly the principle of Federal law that you say governs this.
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,922.161,922.637,--Yes.
2002.02-722,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,923.819,929.789,"And I thought earlier in the argument you had said, oh, that really isn't our case, we don't need that, and that's what Zschernig--"
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,929.789,934.729,"--No, I... that's not true, I was... I was trying to distinguish the Barclay's case... the Barclay's case."
2002.02-722,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,934.729,934.928,--All right.
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,935.679,936.168,In addition--
2002.02-722,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,936.168,937.828,--What do you say is the principal flaw?
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,937.828,941.547,--There are... there are three arguments that we have made to attack this California statute.
2002.02-722,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,964.192,968.672,"And what case... what case establishes that principle, clear conflict?"
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,968.672,978.293,"--I would submit, United States versus Pink, United States versus Belmont are two cases in which the President issued executive agreements and the Court found that they preempted State law."
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,979.1,981.776,"Yes, but here you... that's the big difference between those."
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,989.353,994.709,"--Those case... those executive agreements, I do not believe, had any express preemption provisions in them."
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,996.162,1002.548,"But when you take what the President undertook, which was just to use best efforts, that doesn't sound like--"
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1002.548,1005.02,--Under the Supremacy--
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1005.02,1005.26,--this Court would have much to--
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1005.26,1008.689,"--Justice Ginsburg, I think it's the operation of the Supremacy Clause."
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1023.615,1027.673,"--With full knowledge, when the President did that, that there were these laws in California."
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1027.673,1059.143,"--And at the time that the... that these laws were in the process of being passed, the President's personal representative, Stuart Eizenstat, wrote a letter to the Governor of California saying, please do not pass this law because it will interfere with what the United States is trying to do in the area of foreign policy, and I think it would be a shame if this law went into effect because of the disastrous impact it would have on the ICHEIC system, which the President of the United States... which two successive Presidents of the United States have concluded is in the best foreign policy interests of the United States, and the best interest of Holocaust victims in order to get money into their hands quickly."
2002.02-722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.915,1080.938,Why do you say they have no nexus to California?
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1088.33,1091.063,"--Yes, but this... first of all, this Court has held that the fact that someone--"
2002.02-722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1091.063,1092.339,Am I right on that assumption?
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1092.339,1099.229,"--You're right on that assumption, but to begin with, Justice Stevens, we're talking about 10 million policies that you're trying to regulate, and at the maximum they say they may--"
2002.02-722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1099.229,1101.256,"Well, you have to go through a big data base to find the 5,000."
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1101.256,1107.715,"--Well, I don't... I don't think that there, that under this Court's decisions that the fact that there may be a few thousand people in the State gives--"
2002.02-722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1107.715,1114.521,"But if they do nothing more than identify policies people don't know about, how will that interfere with the basic program?"
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1119.362,1137.971,"--Because ICHEIC has set up an alternative disclosure system and the... which respects European privacy laws and secondly because the... the State of California simply has no power to exert its influence, even in the form of a disclosure obligation, on contracts that have no... absolutely no nexus to the State."
2002.02-722,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1137.971,1140.562,"Mr. Geller, as I understand it, this ICHEIC system is wholly voluntary."
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1166.992,1182.379,"I think most of the information in the record, Justice Ginsburg, and the information that the State relies on relates to several years ago, not to the current ICHEIC process before the German foundation and the Austrian foundation and a number of the Dutch companies had decided to participate fully in that process."
2002.02-722,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1182.379,1183.042,--Is this in the record?
2002.02-722,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1183.042,1186.838,These are all events that... they're in the public record.
2002.02-722,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1196.167,1197.017,"Very well, Mr. Geller."
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1198.978,1207.238,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-722,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1245.258,1251.482,"Mr. Kneedler, I thought that the only requirement is put on a company licensed to do business in the United States."
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1266.545,1269.596,But disclosure is a form of regulation.
2002.02-722,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1289.927,1290.096,Did we do that?
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1303.8,1321.3,"--Under blue sky laws, under the, I believe it's the Hall decision, the Court said that a State could require disclosures... with respect to in-State transactions it could require disclosures about issuance of securities out of State that are related to in-State transactions."
2002.02-722,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1408.155,1433.954,"--Mr. Kneedler, suppose there were no Federal efforts in this area, which there weren't for sometime, and as I said, the executive agreements we're talking about post-dated this California disclosure law, suppose there was nothing, would you still say that because of the potential for interference there could be no State disclosure legislation of this character?"
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1433.954,1434.465,--Yes.
2002.02-722,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.525,1487.204,"Mr. Kneedler, could I ask you to comment on one aspect?"
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1497.98,1512.841,"--Not, not directly, but... but we do think that the executive agreement manifests the executive branch's policy with respect to the resolution of Holocaust era claims, and there are, I think, two principal conflicts with respect to the United States policy."
2002.02-722,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1573.363,1576.366,That's... that's part of the problem I have with the executive agreement argument.
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1581.04,1593.449,"Well, but the best efforts was, it will use its best efforts with State and local governments, in other words in direct communications, and... and Assistant Secretary... Secretary Eizenstat and others communicated--"
2002.02-722,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1593.449,1600.099,"Well, it could sign a supplemental agreement saying that we now agree that these laws should be superseded, just like we did in Pink."
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1600.099,1628.144,"--But this... this agreement says that... says two things, that it would be in the interest of the... this is on page 155a of the... of the petition appendix, that it would be in the interest of the two countries for the foundation to be the exclusive remedy for the forum of the resolution of claims, and on page 156a the agreement provides for the resolution of claims through ICHEIC and supplemental procedures to be developed through ICHEIC, which includes the development of this... of this list."
2002.02-722,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1628.144,1641.534,"Mr. Kneedler, how does that relate to the litigation that was ongoing in the Eastern District of New York that I think involved a slave labor question?"
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1654.683,1655.022,No.
2002.02-722,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1664.063,1671.338,"But you were... one branch of this was that the... the United States people who moved here after, there was no connection with them."
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1671.338,1672.162,"Right, and if... if--"
2002.02-722,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1672.162,1676.655,"Well, those plaintiffs were all people who were certainly not in the United States when this happened."
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1676.655,1681.384,"--Right, and if... if there are sufficient adjudicatory connections to the United States, that would be fine."
2002.02-722,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1682.161,1683.486,What were they in that case?
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1683.486,1689.103,"--Well, if the, if the... if the defendant was doing business in the United States, if a... if a suitable class action--"
2002.02-722,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1689.103,1692.214,Was that so of the companies that were defendants in that case?
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1692.214,1694.99,"--It wasn't... it wasn't entirely, but there was a settlement there."
2002.02-722,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1697.141,1699.811,"My only question was, did the United States take the position--"
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1699.811,1700.323,I don't--
2002.02-722,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1700.323,1701.667,--to stop that litigation--
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1701.667,1702.213,--I... I don't believe so.
2002.02-722,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1702.213,1704.051,--because it was interfering with the executive--
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1704.051,1708.747,"I don't... I don't believe so specifically, but that was early in the... in the... in this settlement effort."
2002.02-722,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1801.088,1815.198,"--Mr. Kneedler, would your argument be different if California, instead of providing this registry in public disclosure said, we want this information in order to decide whether we will allow these companies to do business in California?"
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1815.198,1816.881,May I... may I answer?
2002.02-722,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1831.452,1832.757,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2002.02-722,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1832.757,1833.334,--to investigate the suitability.
2002.02-722,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1833.334,1835.111,"Mr. Kaplan, we'll hear from you."
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,1835.111,1840.495,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-722,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1868.234,1873.608,Was the United States unaware of this problem when it negotiated an executive agreement?
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,1873.608,1875.816,"--Absolutely not, Justice Kennedy."
2002.02-722,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1894.891,1916.593,"No, my... my question was, was United... the United States unaware of... of the wrongdoing that you're describing to us, or the... or the inappropriate corporate response, and the answer is, I assume that they were, and they did nothing about it in the executive agreement, other than to have this very specific claims procedure."
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,1916.593,1918.132,"--That... that's correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-722,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1918.132,1923.244,It's not as if California has uncovered something the United States didn't know about.
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,1923.244,1924.465,That's right.
2002.02-722,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1944.732,1951.663,"I... I don't think... the problem, at least for me, doesn't concern the desirability of the insurance company practice."
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,2073.297,2074.159,"I will, Justice Breyer."
2002.02-722,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2100.644,2110.477,Do you think that the... the President cannot effectively preempt on foreign policy grounds by his action an agreement?
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,2113.403,2127.37,"I... I take the position, Your Honor, that in limited circumstances such as this Court dealt within the Pink and Belmont case, where you... you had the recognition of a foreign Government, or in the Dames & Moore situation where you had a foreign policy crisis and you--"
2002.02-722,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2127.37,2128.968,I think you could answer yes or no.
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,2128.968,2129.988,"--I apologize, Your Honor."
2002.02-722,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2133.558,2142.61,"Well, do you take the position that there can never be a preemption on foreign policy grounds by action of the President alone?"
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,2142.61,2145.661,No.
2002.02-722,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2164.176,2169.458,"Well, of course... of course, if there were a preemptive... I'm trying to bring you back to my question."
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,2169.458,2169.825,--Sure.
2002.02-722,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2169.825,2184.774,"I mean, if, in fact, we had a preemptive statute, or if we had a preemptive treaty, and I think, but I'm not sure, that an executive agreement is a kind of treaty, we would be dealing with the Supremacy Clause."
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,2221.503,2232.584,"Our view is that where the executive simply expresses an aspiration where... which is the situation here, where he's indicated he'll use his best efforts, it's no different than--"
2002.02-722,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2232.584,2235.026,"Oh, no, it's... what I've read to you is not an aspiration."
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,2240.9,2242.009,--Yes.
2002.02-722,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2242.009,2248.173,--that said the California statute is totally contrary to the efforts that they were trying to make.
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,2257.617,2261.668,"The response, Justice Breyer, is this."
2002.02-722,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2267.438,2269.479,I thought Barclay's had to do with the Commerce Clause.
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,2269.479,2272.64,--It dealt with both the Commerce Clause and the foreign affairs power.
2002.02-722,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2286.433,2295.107,"The... Barclay's dealt with the Foreign Commerce Clause, and it made the point that the one voice in that area was Congress, not the President."
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,2304.172,2305.392,Yes.
2002.02-722,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.392,2346.112,"And that being so, you see, the... this is not the same for that reason, and also what we're talking about here is, the Governments of Switzerland and the Governments of Germany, not private people, saying that if California enforces this statute, 98 percent of which has nothing to do with Holocaust victims, that is, the insurance policies don't, that is, what we're worried about under our privacy statutes is Gwendolyn finds out that Uncle Harry in England left all the money to Cecily instead of Gwendolyn and, of course, Cecily doesn't want that to occur."
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,2364.368,2371.884,Foreign Governments were extraordinarily upset about the... the tax that was the subject of the Barclay's case.
2002.02-722,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2389.161,2395.279,"Yes, but... but that's... the Congress has principal concern with revenue and fiscal policy."
2002.02-722,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2399.537,2411.326,"And that was the reason that Barclay said you... yes, you're right that the executive branch was in there saying look, all these foreign countries are upset, and we think that they have a good case."
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,2431.318,2473.124,"--I... I believe, Justice Ginsburg, the issue here is whether the President, by engaging in some negotiation, or expressing an aspiration as to what the President thinks the foreign policy ought to be, can trump a State regulation, and I think the consequence of that being so would be dramatic for matters of State regulation, because State regulation often has some sort of foreign implication to it, since we're dealing with a global economy and there are often foreign affiliates that are called upon to report on information, and if... if that law was overturned because a foreign Government or the executive branch complained about that conduct, State regulatory law would effectively be thwarted."
2002.02-722,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2473.124,2474.91,"Well, we can... we can distinguish those cases."
2002.02-722,2,24187,frank_kaplan,,2484.353,2486.177,"No... no, Your Honor--"
