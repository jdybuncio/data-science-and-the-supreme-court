2012.11-597,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.152,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case No. 11-597, Arkansas Game & Fish Commission v. The United States."
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,10.072,13.758,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,63.082,88.916,"What about this Court's precedent in, what is it, the Sanguinetti case, where the Court said that for there to be government responsibility it is at least necessary that the overflow constitute a permanent invasion of the land amounting to an appropriation, not merely an injury, to property?"
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,97.815,112.449,"Justice Ginsburg, we would say that you would not have to overrule Sanguinetti because the language there, “ permanent flooding invasion ”, was -- was not how the case turned on the result."
2012.11-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.097,145.969,Was Sanguinetti -- had we had any temporary takings cases before Sanguinetti?
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,145.969,147.701,--Justice Scalia--
2012.11-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,147.701,158.947,"In other words, was Sanguinetti expressing a special rule for flooding, or was it -- was it simply saying there can't be a temporary taking?"
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,167.99,171.913,"--Justice Scalia, there -- you're correct."
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,195.965,196.761,Which ones?
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,255.784,275.323,"--Justice Breyer, in the Dickinson case in 1947 where the Court found a taking from flooding, Mr. Dickinson reclaimed his property, effectively reclaimed most of the property that had flooded, effectively ending the flood invasion."
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,295.817,297.938,Dickinson -- I got written down Dickinson.
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,297.938,298.706,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,298.706,300.266,Kimball Laundry.
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,304.547,305.655,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,305.655,311.729,"They took the laundry facilities for 3 years, but there what they did is they went in and they took this building, you know, took the whole thing."
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,311.729,312.431,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,312.431,315.696,The problem with a flood is you don't take all the land.
2012.11-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.095,339.155,We have cases about flying over land--
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,339.155,340.298,"Yes, Causby."
2012.11-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,340.298,343.422,--cases about shooting -- shooting over lands.
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,343.812,344.935,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,347.184,353.228,"That's not water, but it ain't taking, either, in the -- in the narrow sense that Justice Breyer has talked about."
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,353.228,353.727,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,360.992,369.034,"Yeah, but in Causby, what they did -- there was a question about whether just flying some airplanes over is a taking or a trespass."
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,376.86,377.234,Yes.
2012.11-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,420.874,422.122,What if it hadn't harmed the timber?
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,458.231,460.01,"Your Honor, no."
2012.11-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.774,468.491,"Well, he has."
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,471.006,480.658,"If -- Your Honor, if he can show that the -- he has the right to exclude superinduced invasions of water, that -- so it doesn't interfere with his use and enjoyment."
2012.11-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,481.048,481.565,--It does.
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,485.485,486.905,"--Well, and it very may well, Your Honor."
2012.11-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.468,489.17,--So it would be a taking.
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,490.937,499.168,"--I'm saying, yes, if he can show that it intruded on his use and enjoyment, and as you said, indicated, that type of interference, yes."
2012.11-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,507.241,509.35,So that would cover a one-time flood.
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,509.35,511.334,"--Not necessarily, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,527.295,527.904,I don't understand that.
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,552.381,554.971,"And, Your Honor, what I'm saying, it's a proof of facts."
2012.11-597,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,613.15,639.079,"Counsel, all of our cases in this temporary versus permanent, as I read the cases and I read what the multiple facts that each are relying on, it seems to me that our cases have been attempting, in the term “ temporary ”, to encompass a lot of different concepts."
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,697.773,699.723,"Yes, Your Honor, you're correct."
2012.11-597,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,738.052,751.766,"I guess the problem with this case, and it's part of what's interwoven in your adversary's arguments, is that with flooding it's going to occur naturally anyway."
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,841.182,858.285,"Your Honor, the -- the two elements of the rule, that there must be direct physical invasion by the United States and not from some other cause, and there must be substantial intrusion upon these protected property rights, the right to exclude, the right to use and enjoy, and the right to dispose, that--"
2012.11-597,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,858.285,858.955,But that's every flood.
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,858.955,861.346,--That runs throughout this Court's--
2012.11-597,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,861.346,862.282,But that's every flood.
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,862.282,863.924,"--Yes, Your Honor, it is."
2012.11-597,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,867.562,869.453,"No, no, no, I don't -- why is that every flood?"
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,877.841,878.574,--That's--
2012.11-597,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,878.574,881.854,"--you get a note from the Corps of Engineers saying, we're sorry, it won't happen again."
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,883.808,886.023,"--Not -- you're correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,889.396,896.426,"I guess what we're asking you is, how do you define the baseline of protected expectations for the property?"
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,896.426,897.799,Your Honor--
2012.11-597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,897.799,901.25,"You've indicated, I think, in your brief that one year won't do it."
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,919.415,929.472,"--Your Honor, the -- certainly, the government is not the insurer of -- of flood control, how they just carry it out."
2012.11-597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,966.303,986.575,"But my question is how do you define the baseline that gives a legitimate expectation, if the Corps of Engineers -- did not happen in this case, but in the hypothetical case -- makes the finding that there is a more urgent and -- and a higher priority for other lands, and it changes its policy?"
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,988.041,994.445,"--Your Honor, it can go through its law, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Water Act."
2012.11-597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1000.022,1004.397,"Well, what you're saying is that it can't make that change without paying, right?"
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1004.397,1014.828,It -- it cannot make that change where it's going to burden the landowner and interfere with that -- those property rights that the Fifth Amendment is guaranteeing.
2012.11-597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1015.343,1021.87,"Now suppose, at the very outset of the dam, the government says, we've got to put this water someplace, we're going to put it on the left bank, not the right bank."
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1025.528,1027.088,--Your Honor--
2012.11-597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1027.088,1028.854,--if the land was always flooded anyway on the right?
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1028.854,1030.917,--That may not be a taking.
2012.11-597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1043.396,1050.47,But what I want is the definition of the operable baseline that we can use in order to define whether or not there has been a taking.
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1050.47,1055.017,"--And, Your Honor, I guess I must say it may not be a bright line."
2012.11-597,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1071.554,1075.13,Should the baseline be what would have happened if the dam was never built?
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1075.13,1078.662,"--Perhaps, Your Honor."
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1119.974,1122.708,But what do you suggest -- what do you suggest -- I looked at the consent.
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1122.708,1123.503,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1123.503,1124.798,"To tell you the truth, I think it's permanent."
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1128.893,1129.813,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1129.813,1131.875,The flood comes like three months a year every year.
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1185.306,1191.959,"And, Your Honor, I know it cannot be the Federal circuit's rule that you can never have temporary flooding as a taking."
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1194.037,1198.518,"You know, but I want to know what your idea -- I understand the difficulties are there--"
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1198.518,1198.989,--Yes.
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1198.989,1200.892,--and I'm willing to accept a lot you mentioned.
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1200.892,1201.236,Yes.
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1201.236,1207.94,But what I'm asking -- which I just did ask -- is what's your idea of a substitute that would be better?
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1207.94,1221.401,"Your Honor, the substitute would be to remain consistent with how this Court analyzes the physical takings, not use anything from regulatory analysis here, but looking at these elements."
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1239.924,1253.592,"So a Department of the Interior employee trespasses on Jones's land, trampling paths, and even limbs fall off trees."
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1256.247,1257.433,"--No, Your Honor, it's not."
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1257.433,1257.776,Because?
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1257.776,1269.977,"And because the Court said in the Cress case, it's the character of the government's action, not the amount of damages resulting from it, so long as that is substantial."
2012.11-597,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1295.247,1309.943,"So our department employee trying to find a shortcut drives his bulldozer through Jones's land knocking down his favorite redwood, it's a taking?"
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1309.943,1330.061,"Your Honor, I think we would, again, use the analysis, separate out the torts, where the action is direct, it's been predictable what would that would result in, the United States should know that, and then the intrusion or interference with those property rights is substantial, there will be a taking."
2012.11-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1344.554,1351.894,"So our cases -- our cases treat physical occupations differently from other -- from other cases, don't they?"
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1368.748,1370.561,"It is, Your Honor."
2012.11-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.651,1379.211,"Yes, but what you say -- here's what troubles me."
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1401.547,1402.389,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2012.11-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1403.282,1413.402,"And I wouldn't say every -- you know, every flood that goes across a land, even two years or three years in a row, would not necessarily be a taking."
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1413.402,1418.947,"--You could look at the economic part -- yes, definitely, Your Honor."
2012.11-597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.294,1442.858,What was the Kansas City case that you are referring to?
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1443.513,1452.37,"--The Kansas City Life Insurance case in 1950, Your Honor, was underflow invasion of water percolating up on property in Missouri from the Mississippi River."
2012.11-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1473.095,1486.544,"--Mr. Goodhart, maybe it would help to know what you think if we accept your position would be left over for the Federal Circuit to consider on remand."
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1512.113,1518.563,"Your Honor, if I may, after answering your question I would like to reserve the remainder of my time."
2012.11-597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1529.934,1533.182,"Well, the question is what do we say to the circuit?"
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1536.712,1549.47,--We want the remand to say: Apply the rule of law here for physical taking and look at it as the Court of Federal Claims did: Was there a direct physical injury?
2012.11-597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1558.17,1561.243,But what were the other issues that you just mentioned?
2012.11-597,0,30423,james_f_goodhart,,1565.946,1575.785,"The United States raised several issues and the commission cross-appealed in asking for regeneration damages, Your Honor, and those would need to be addressed on the remand."
2012.11-597,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1577.239,1578.253,"--Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1583.782,1587.358,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1609.601,1615.287,"So it's -- there is a little confusion about the Government's position, there was in the court of appeals."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1635.088,1638.59,"--I think the intent point, I guess I would modify that."
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1710.622,1711.324,I don't -- I don't understand what you're saying.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1725.834,1726.083,No.
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1726.505,1728.022,"No, I didn't think you were saying that."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1728.022,1735.049,"--No, but what I'm saying is this would be a particularly bad or problematic context for the Court to depart from that."
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1735.049,1739.299,"Well, there are pretty clear findings in the Court of Claims on the question of causation, right?"
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1739.299,1750.934,"I don't think it's a question of causation, and if I could just point out two cases, one of which was cited in Loretto in its summing up of this Court's flooding cases is Bedford."
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1785.949,1803.929,"So, so if the Government comes in and tells a landowner downstream that every March and April we are going to flood your property so that you can't use it, from now on, that's the way -- that's part of our plan, that's a taking for those 2 months, correct?"
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1803.929,1804.257,No.
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1804.912,1805.193,No?
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1817.063,1820.483,"--I don't, and let me explain why."
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1834.614,1837.769,I'll grant you that it can decide whose land it wants to take.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1840.05,1844.66,Because this is a classic example of the Government adjusting benefits and burdens.
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1861.982,1873.851,"So if the Government says we've got to release the flood waters and what we're going to do is we're going to have water trucks pull up behind the dam, we're going to load them up and we're going to drive them downriver to this person's property and we're going to dump the water there?"
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1873.851,1883.409,--I think that's a different situation because the Government itself is actually putting the water -- I think that's very close to being the reservoir behind the dam.
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1887.516,1889.329,But your answer is that would be a taking?
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1889.329,1893.856,--I think because it would be -- it would be specifically deposited on that landowner's land.
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1893.856,1894.671,"Well, I thought--"
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1894.671,1896.496,It would be the same as if they put a pipe from the dam--
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1896.496,1896.933,--Right.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1896.933,1897.779,--to that person's land.
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1906.213,1909.758,"Again, I think the Court of Claims' findings are to the contrary."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1909.758,1910.008,Well--
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1910.008,1914.144,"They said the Government knew that this water was going to go right here, right?"
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1914.144,1921.815,"--Well, it was not -- there is no suggestion that it was targeted at this land, which is -- which is I think something quite different."
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.248,1932.874,A foreseeable and certain incidental consequence.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1932.874,1935.277,"--No, I don't believe foreseeable is enough."
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1972.622,1982.118,What if the Government decides for purposes of flood control -- I don't know -- I don't know the ecological way -- but the water has to percolate or whatever down in this area.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1994.221,1995.473,I think that would be--
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1995.473,1995.988,Okay.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1995.988,1998.285,--Unless there was some emergency justification.
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1998.285,1998.597,"Sure, sure."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2018.745,2019.088,Yes.
2012.11-597,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2039.939,2042.111,What is the legal rubric?
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2088.808,2101.1,"--I think, under this Court's takings decisions, and specifically those dealing with effects caused by something outside the property, I think it is basically a per se rule."
2012.11-597,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2101.1,2119.049,"Well, then, suppose what the government said is, Mr. Smith, you live 150 miles from here, and we have a rule, and our rule is you can't cut down any of your trees, and you can't farm the land, and you can't even walk on it without a boat."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2122.843,2124.731,"Well, it would be -- it would be analyzed as a regulatory taking--"
2012.11-597,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2124.731,2129.73,"So why -- now, they're doing exactly the same thing here, but, instead of a regulation, they send some water in to do it."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2132.728,2139.147,--It has certain parallels in that respect in the sense that the government has to make a choice.
2012.11-597,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2153.251,2155.532,"Well, but that's the issue."
2012.11-597,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2155.532,2156.39,I'm totally confused now.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2159.311,2159.935,--No.
2012.11-597,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2159.935,2160.718,They built a dam.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2166.685,2166.966,Yes.
2012.11-597,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2167.356,2177.475,"But you just said two minutes ago -- or I thought I heard you say -- that when the government builds a dam, even if it floods some people and not others, that there's no taking."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2177.475,2180.833,"--I'm talking about downstream, not the -- not the reservoir."
2012.11-597,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2182.194,2183.146,After it's--
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2183.146,2184.224,--after it goes through--
2012.11-597,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2184.224,2187.239,--So the baseline -- tell me what the baseline is.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2196.578,2202.155,"--Well, assuming it's permanent in the reservoir, which it's likely to be when the government is constructing it--"
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.155,2203.699,"Well, no, not necessarily."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2218.443,2218.833,--Right.
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2218.833,2225.551,"So you could say, just -- just as here, that there's only been a temporary taking of some of the land behind the reservoir."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2228.893,2229.158,Yes.
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2229.58,2232.61,--even that which would be only temporarily flooded?
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2232.61,2249.168,"--Well, but that -- that is covered by this Court's decision in Cress, in which the Court said that if you have a situation where property is permanently liable to inevitably recurring flooding, that that's the same thing as a permanent -- even though sometimes it's not -- it's not covered, it is permanently liable."
2012.11-597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2249.168,2256.163,And the only difference in that formulation and this case is that it was for seven years and not permanent?
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2257.052,2260.395,"Well, insofar as we're looking at the temporary aspect of it."
2012.11-597,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2289.367,2297.319,I must be -- I must be slow today because I'm -- I'm having significant problem with your articulation of your test.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2312.749,2317.279,"--I -- I -- I think, under this Court's current precedence, there would be no claim downstream."
2012.11-597,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2317.279,2320.481,"It doesn't matter whether it's permanent, reoccurring--"
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2320.481,2321.605,Foreseeable.
2012.11-597,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2321.605,2323.558,--foreseeable or anything else?
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2323.558,2330.024,"No, because Jackson, Spokenbarger -- Sponenbarger, the revetment case, Bedford were all cases where--"
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2330.024,2330.305,Right.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2330.305,2332.788,--where it was -- where it was permanent.
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2334.551,2341.036,"Well, just before you get off, because I think part of the confusion, at least for me, is the difference between what the Federal circuit decided and what you're arguing."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2363.871,2364.199,--No.
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2364.199,2376.989,"It seems to me that if we disagree, and we think it makes a difference that it doesn't have to be 50 years, but it might be something less, then maybe you've preserved all these other arguments or maybe not, but--"
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2376.989,2385.876,"But I think it's -- we have argued, both below and here, that -- that this is consequential, and that -- that it's downstream and had those effects."
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2398.09,2404.414,"--I know, but you agree -- you agree with the Federal circuit, but then you're presenting all these other arguments in which it doesn't depend."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2411.679,2415.941,"Well, but -- but I think, in deciding what's temporary, you shouldn't divorce it from context."
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.196,2483.898,"Of course, that can't overrule the Takings Clause, can it?"
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2483.898,2486.428,I think what it--
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2486.428,2489.692,"I mean, that's nice that Congress doesn't want to be liable."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2489.692,2493.44,"--No, but Congress -- no, it's -- the point is more fundamental than that."
2012.11-597,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2539.969,2548.685,"What about -- Mr. Kneedler, what was wrong with Judge Newman's position on this temporary versus permanent?"
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2575.939,2578.828,--I don't believe that that's correct.
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2621.469,2626.687,"I mean, the issue is who is going to pay for the wonderful benefit to these farmers."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2637.71,2638.884,--It is in the nature--
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2638.884,2640.35,That doesn't seem to me particularly fair.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2640.35,2641.929,--It is in the nature of living along a river.
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2654.049,2659.235,I don't think -- one of those risks has to be the Government's going to make you pay for protecting somebody else.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2660.093,2668.357,"--Well, when -- picking up on what I said about Congress, Congress would not have gotten into the flood control business without this protection of liability."
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2668.716,2669.168,I doubt that.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2669.168,2680.054,"--Well, this Court in James said it was an important condition for Congress getting into it, that it was not -- Congress was not going to be held liable for the -- for the damages downstream."
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2684.598,2687.253,"--Or upstream, under your theory."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2687.253,2696.281,"--Well, if it's -- but the construction of the project itself and the flooding of the reservoir, the Government condemns that land, purchases that land."
2012.11-597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2697.564,2699.389,"--Well, the hypothetical is, suppose it doesn't."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2707.309,2714.258,"--Well, the question would be whether it falls within the Cress test of whether it is permanently liable."
2012.11-597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2714.258,2719.443,"Your -- but your position seems to be that if it's downstream, somehow it's not the Government."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2735.873,2751.229,"It -- it was basically -- I mean, it was the rationale of this Court's cases in -- in Bedford, in Sponenbarger, and reaffirmed by this Court in Loretto, a modern takings case dealing with the question of physical occupation."
2012.11-597,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2766.706,2778.14,"But building a Government project, let's say an electricity plant or high tension wires, you could require the taking of some land to build it."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2818.137,2820.028,"--Well, again, it depends."
2012.11-597,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2836.192,2848.408,The collateral consequence is to make some piece of land 4 miles away quite unexpectedly but totally uninhabitable.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2857.093,2863.699,I think it would depend on whether -- and there was a -- a case -- I believe it's the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad--
2012.11-597,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2863.699,2864.338,What does it say?
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2864.338,2870.023,--It says if the -- it had to do with releasing smoke from -- from a train.
2012.11-597,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2871.821,2873.178,"Yes, but they made this--"
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2873.178,2875.926,--but -- but if you focus it on someone--
2012.11-597,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2875.926,2876.193,--Yes.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2876.193,2883.8,"--If -- if you pipe it -- if you pipe it to the person's property, that's a -- that may be a different matter."
2012.11-597,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2883.8,2884.081,All right.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2902.666,2906.351,"It was focused, and that's not -- not true in the operation of the dam."
2012.11-597,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2906.351,2909.054,"Well, here they're focusing it on his land."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2909.054,2910.665,They're not focusing it on his land.
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2925.471,2926.532,Not flooding that time of year.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2930.684,2937.591,But it is land -- it is land in a floodplain that would be suitable for any sort of construction or development.
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2968.061,2969.983,It strikes me that that's a valuation question.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2981.616,2982.727,Yes.
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2983.414,2983.804,Okay.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2992.395,2996.271,"--First of all, the Court -- the Court did not say that the Government knew."
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3010.121,3014.527,"What about 6 years later, when it was doing the same thing and the water went to the same place?"
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3014.527,3020.478,The taking goes -- the taking claim here goes from 1993 to 1998.
2012.11-597,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3045.841,3061.287,"Are you saying there's a difference between the situation where the Government particularly wants the water to go to a -- to a place, and the situation where the Government knows that's where it's going to go but doesn't particularly care where it's going to go?"
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3061.287,3064.242,--I think there's a -- I don't know about the “ intend ”.
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3155.722,3169.4,"You -- you would say that even -- even if this land was permanently flooded, okay, permanently flooded so he couldn't use it at all, since it was downstream, no harm done, right?"
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3169.4,3173.823,--I think that's the consequence of this -- but there's no -- the Court doesn't have to decide that here.
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3173.823,3175.633,But that's your position.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3175.633,3185.678,"That -- that's I think the necessary consequence of this Court's holdings in Bedford, in Bedford and related cases."
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3205.261,3209.605,"If there's notice and comment -- so the choice is, there are 10 landowners downstream."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3219.88,3221.725,"--No, that's not -- that's not what happens."
2012.11-597,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3244.774,3246.479,But what difference does that make?
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3255.943,3256.851,--Well--
2012.11-597,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3256.851,3266.285,"--you're saying permanency -- permanency, repetition, nothing counts, he's just -- loses."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3266.285,3266.581,--No.
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3281.247,3293.304,"Yeah, but he loses because the Corps comes in and says, yeah, indeed, we did flood 2, but, in order to save, you know, 1 and 3 through 10."
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3294.303,3297.363,"--Well, the Corps cannot be arbitrary in doing that."
2012.11-597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3297.363,3298.163,Okay.
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3299.114,3311.5,"But the -- but the Corps requires a broad ambit of discretion in managing a river over time, and it has to be able to change to update circumstances without exposing the United States to massive liability."
2012.11-597,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3311.5,3319.013,"Mr. Kneedler, does your essential argument turn on this being indirect, as you say?"
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3332.584,3335.489,We have two submissions.
2012.11-597,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3372.07,3386.03,"Why should it make a difference whether the court had -- the Corps has a plan which says, we're going to release this water every summer, and a situation where, year after year after year, somebody makes an ad hoc decision in the summer that we're going to release the water?"
2012.11-597,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3386.03,3400.805,"I don't think analytically, for the reasons I said about -- about the downstream; but, to the extent the Court is focusing on temporary, these were self-limiting, and there was no guarantee they were going to be renewed."
2012.11-597,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3409.755,3411.615,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."

2012.11-597,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3537.488,3548.246,"Is the baseline -- go back to Justice Kennedy's question -- is it before the dam or after the dam, and why is it one or the other?"
2012.11-597,2,30423,james_f_goodhart,,3561.554,3584.294,"--Your Honor, under that -- under those facts, if it could have happened and the landowner knew that, and that that is -- that is a cause, not the United States, if -- if the United States takes away its flood protection and this land goes back to what it would be naturally, then the landowner can't prove that it's direct from the United States."
2012.11-597,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3588.95,3596.355,"Even though after the dam and the dam's plan was to ensure that it didn't happen, you would still lose?"
2012.11-597,2,30423,james_f_goodhart,,3598.96,3599.743,--Your Honor--
2012.11-597,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3599.743,3602.772,"--would have possibly caused this, you would lose?"
2012.11-597,2,30423,james_f_goodhart,,3602.772,3611.956,"--If -- if it's not super-induced invasions directly from the United States, the landowner is going to have that as a natural condition."
2012.11-597,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3617.844,3618.234,Pre-dam.
2012.11-597,2,30423,james_f_goodhart,,3619.514,3624.186,In the pre-dam or during the whole first 40 years of how this was operated.
2012.11-597,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3632.168,3635.198,I'm not sure that's not open to dispute.
2012.11-597,2,30423,james_f_goodhart,,3644.599,3644.958,And I--
2012.11-597,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3644.958,3649.614,I think that there is -- at least that's what I understood some of the factual argument to be.
2012.11-597,2,30423,james_f_goodhart,,3649.614,3650.019,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.11-597,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3663.013,3663.559,"Thank you, counsel."
