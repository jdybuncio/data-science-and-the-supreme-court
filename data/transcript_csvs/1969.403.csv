1969.403,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,42.976,"Number 403, United States against Van Leeuwen."
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,53.186,56.477,May it please the Court.
1969.403,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,240.642,242.833,"That was the address here, the return address?"
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,242.833,248.436,"The return address, the return address."
1969.403,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.445,1018.284,"You could have -- you could have gotten a warrant and seized the package on the other end of the shipment, I suppose, couldn't you?"
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1018.284,1019.927,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1969.403,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1163.833,1173.244,I suppose it doesn't weaken your position in any that the articles were in and of themselves contraband?
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1182.099,1192.143,"Well Mr. Justice, I thought about that argument and I'm not sure that I can say that gold coins as such are contraband."
1969.403,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1192.143,1192.418,Is it smuggle --
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1192.418,1201.06,"I suppose any United States citizen who has a collection of gold coins, can legally transmit them by mail to somebody else, to a dealer –-"
1969.403,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1201.06,1207.007,Across -- across the line from Canada?
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1207.007,1215.394,"Here, we have only the suspicion that these have come across from Canada."
1969.403,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1229.402,1235.018,"But if you were sustained here, your position is sustained, what happens to the coins?"
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1236.951,1243.133,"I believe they would be forfeited under the Customs Law, Mr. Justice, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.403,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1243.133,1250.601,"Isn't it illegal to possess gold coins, quite a part from the Customs Law?"
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1250.601,1252.054,"No, Mr. Justice."
1969.403,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1276.338,1282.313,"I thought there was a time, almost a generation ago when everybody was required to turn in all these gold?"
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1282.313,1283.342,"Yes, yes, Mr. Justice."
1969.403,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1283.342,1285.702,"And thereafter, it was illegal to possess them?"
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1285.702,1290.627,"But there was an exception of bona fide collectors' items, whether that was due to the fact –-"
1969.403,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1290.627,1297.269,I am very -- very happy to hear that because I was disturbed the other day when I found a $5.00 gold piece in my safe deposit box.
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1301.711,1312.833,"Well, that raises all kinds of questions about self incrimination that I -– that I don't think we need to go into here."
1969.403,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1650.395,1659.977,"But Mr. Solicitor General, I gather the justification in Terry that was emphasized was the safety of the officer, wasn't it?"
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1659.977,1660.693,"Yes, Mr. Justice --"
1969.403,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1660.693,1663.24,Do we have anything comparable to that in this situation?
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1663.24,1689.266,"No, there's no question of safety here, but it is suggested that the only duty of a post office clerk is to send the package on forth with and I suggested if on the exam -- on handling the package in the process of putting it into the mail bag and he hears it ticking that he may find it quite reasonably that he has some duty other than to send it on –-"
1969.403,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1689.266,1698.488,What I'm getting at is I wonder if the result reached in Terry would have been reached if that factor of the safety of the officer was not involved?
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1698.488,1699.955,I think perhaps not.
1969.403,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1737.114,1743.43,But isn't the analogy the Terry more with the stop rather than the search?
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1743.43,1747.363,"Well yes, Mr. Justice, I suppose it is with the stop and the search, although the –-"
1969.403,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.363,1754.481,"Because safety or not, they could still stop him, could still stop the –-"
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1754.481,1754.755,Yes.
1969.403,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1759.347,1762.79,"Well, it's for long enough perhaps to ask him a question?"
1969.403,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1762.79,1777.483,Long enough to ask him with questions and we have a somewhat longer time here.
1969.403,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1777.483,1779.274,Mr. Davis?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,1779.274,1783.465,"May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.403,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1925.425,1937.541,But will it disturb you very much if law enforcement officers take a -– have certain reactions to that when they see it?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,1944.33,1959.157,"Sir, if it were brought to the law enforcement officer's attention by yourself and my using your return address, I would say yes, it should be in their hands, but otherwise, I would say it is not their business."
1969.403,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2064.462,2070.239,But are you –- are you now addressing your arguments to the lack of probable cause to be concerned about any of this?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2070.239,2077.297,"I'm addressing my own remarks, sir, not only to the lack of probable cause because I'm attacking this on two basis."
1969.403,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2088.291,2106.71,"Well, this Court on a number of occasions and many other Courts similarly have said that in probable cause, you add up a total of the great many often insignificant things to reach your conclusion."
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2127.574,2130.303,"Oh, very definitely, sir, very definitely."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2208.513,2208.974,What time?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2212.031,2212.839,Five hours?
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2213.419,2213.597,Two hours?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2213.597,2214.669,…faster than that.
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2216.378,2217.671,One hour and five minutes?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2217.671,2219.556,One hour and five minutes.
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2219.556,2222.465,You find nothing wrong as of that time?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2222.465,2223.705,I find nothing wrong.
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2226.427,2230.859,"And it took a little time to type an affidavit up, didn't it?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2230.859,2234.168,"24 hours later, it did."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2234.168,2237.067,It does take time to type an affidavit?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2237.067,2238.156,"It does, sir."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2238.156,2244.822,"And to recheck, it's –- so how many hours would you think would be maximum in this case?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2244.822,2262.252,"Considering the fact that the affidavit was applied for at approximately 2:30 pm the following day, I think the affidavit could have been applied on the day that the packages were mailed, considering that Mt. Vernon is 60 miles from Seattle, a drive of one hour on a super freeway."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2265.02,2267.73,"How many hours is that, five hours?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2267.73,2271.461,"No sir, about 2:30, we have the facts."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2287.257,2290.52,So you're complaining about approximately 24 hours?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2290.52,2294.713,"I am complaining about the additional 24 hours, very definitely sir, because there, that is sloppy police work."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2294.713,2298.289,And how did that injure your –-
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2298.289,2300.23,How did it injure my client?
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2302.705,2304.241,Other than that?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2304.241,2307.4,"Other than that, the Fourth Amendment protects our –-"
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2307.4,2310.05,How did it affect his Constitutional Rights?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2310.05,2327.53,"It affected his Constitutional Rights, and that this Court way long ago in Ex parte Jackson, held that the first class mails are protected by the Fourth Amendment and have the same rights as those possessions within our own private homes and that those rights have been violated."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2327.53,2336.703,"Now suppose at the end of the 29 hours, they decided not to do anything and had shifted."
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2339.775,2341.768,"Then I shouldn't be here, sir."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2341.768,2343.624,"He wouldn't be injured at all, would he?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2343.624,2344.751,That's right.
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2344.751,2349.226,"So what are you complaining about, the seizure or the stop?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2349.226,2350.324,Excuse me?
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2350.324,2357.601,"What are you complaining about, the seizure and the opening of it, or the timing of the 29 hours?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2357.601,2361.525,I am complaining about the timing.
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2384.499,2391.28,"That's the record, wouldn't you agree that at times, even registered mail is lost?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2391.28,2400.572,"Lost, yes, and this is what Chief -- or what Judge Chambers referred to that oftentimes, my mail goes astray, but I submit that this was not lost."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2402.04,2403.059,I didn't say that.
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2410.554,2412.95,"They had two packages, sir."
1969.403,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2419.026,2419.833,Mr. Davis?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2419.833,2420.539,Sir?
1969.403,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2420.539,2428.781,"Certainly, the officer who got this good job of getting this information altogether in an hour and five minutes."
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2432.656,2435.127,"I'm saying at that point, there was probable cause."
1969.403,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2435.127,2435.929,There was?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2435.929,2436.664,There was.
1969.403,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2436.664,2443.137,"Well then, what about your argument that this affidavit or this warrant is not supported by probable cause?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2444.333,2448.96,"I am not saying as I understand it, sir, that it is not supported by a probably cause."
1969.403,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2457.092,2459.208,So the attack is on the form of the affidavit?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2459.208,2460.045,"That is correct, sir."
1969.403,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2466.316,2471.585,Yes.
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2471.585,2476.409,"Now, here we have these packages supposedly on their way."
1969.403,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2648.748,2651.576,Do they keep a postal inspector at this station?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2651.576,2652.235,"They do, sir."
1969.403,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2652.235,2653.787,Permanently?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2653.787,2665.553,"I don't know about permanently, but I know there was one involved because he did sign and witness the return on the search warrant."
1969.403,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2685.195,2696.393,"I think we'll stop at the wedge and take lunch, counsel."
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2699.476,2705.979,"If the Court please, the wedge I had for lunch was not the one I was instructing the Court on I hope."
1969.403,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2728.838,2731.467,"And we can always take care of that, can't we?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2731.467,2734.005,"I leave it in your able hands, sir."
1969.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2801.979,2804.167,That's a –- Terry against Ohio.
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2804.167,2807.218,"Terry, I beg your pardon, sir, thank you."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2861.004,2867.162,Suppose there is no magistrate that's available for 29 hours?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2867.162,2891.028,"If no magistrate were available for 29 hours and this could be shown, then I think there we have mitigating circumstances but I still would not like to say categorically that this is reasonable because always, there is a judge available, if not, a commissioner and in this case, there is a commissioner available not only in Seattle but in Bellingham."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2895.941,2898.904,"Or you could have come to this Court, too?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2898.904,2906.24,"And this Court, I'm surely –- for sure would have issued a warrant on the facts that they knew at 2:35."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2906.24,2911.32,That's assuming you give us the jurisdiction.
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2911.32,2911.873,That I cannot do.
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2911.873,2920.695,"Well, get –- I had great problems with the number of hours as being your only complaint."
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2920.695,2922.834,"This is not my only complaint, sir."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2923.154,2927.495,Didn't you say that they could've gotten a warrant in two or three hours?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2927.495,2929.436,That is correct.
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2929.436,2932.051,"Well then, what is your complaint?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2932.051,2936.398,My complaint is that they didn't do it in two or three hours but did it in 25 to 27 hours.
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2936.398,2939.6,It is all –- it's the point of 26 hours?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2939.6,2940.416,"That is correct, sir."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2940.416,2942.521,And that didn't affect the property.
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2947.518,2948.394,If I may analogize –-
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2948.394,2955.57,"Nothing happened to the place where was the gold because it was sent back, wasn't delivered?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2955.57,2959.016,"First, no one knew that this was gold."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2963.013,2969.26,"No, I'm saying that –- what damage was done to him or his property?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,2969.26,2984.126,"The damage that was done to him was that guarantee of our Constitution under the Fourth Amendment which applies to any man legally in this country, being a foreign national as this man was, a petty subject or not."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3001.753,3007.003,Does the Fourth Amendment require that to be obtained in less than 29 hours?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3007.003,3011.27,I don't know that the Fourth Amendment speaks on this particular issue.
1969.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3041.102,3053.896,"You concede as I understand it, that there was reasonable cause for the issuance of -– probable cause for the issuance of a warrant on the day –- on the previous day."
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3053.896,3055.291,"I do, sir."
1969.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3055.291,3066.321,"And implicitly, as I gather, would have no complaint if a warrant had been issued and the –- and the packages had been seized under that warrant on that day."
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3066.321,3069.149,That is correct.
1969.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3069.149,3074.516,"Well then, I particularly have this same difficulty as my brother Marshall has."
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3087.467,3088.506,"Sir, that problem arises –-"
1969.403,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3088.506,3090.953,"Or the -- or what you concede, as I understand it?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3090.953,3093.847,"True, but the problem arises this way."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3152.718,3159.004,"And now, I could see between that case and this case if the heroine was in package at the post office?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3159.004,3170.795,"If the heroine were in the package at the post office, they have no right whatsoever to open it, and that happened in one case, once where a package did open."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3171.54,3175.912,You mean that you can't open a package of heroine until you get a search warrant?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3175.912,3176.698,"Oh no, sir."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3178.594,3180.037,"Well, that's what -– that's this case."
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3181.893,3184.531,They got a search warrant but when did they get that search warrant?
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3197.532,3202.313,Do I have the right of action every time my mail is held up for now?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3202.313,3204.413,"I wish you did, sir."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3204.413,3206.887,"I hope it's the damages, too."
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3206.887,3209.06,"It would be nice if it were, but on this particular –-"
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3209.06,3209.702,Is that true?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3209.702,3211.069,There is nothing for damages.
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3211.069,3212.283,It says that's not true.
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3212.283,3218.876,"That's true, but there I submit to you, sir, that this is an unintentional holding up."
1969.403,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3241.525,3255.342,"Oh, Mr. Davis, I think that as possibility of a decision being written against you and not reach any of those things you are now talking about."
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3255.342,3258.711,"I'll take your word for it, sir."
1969.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3508.901,3521.555,"Well, I suppose you'd be making the same argument if the –- if the coins were seized after -– without delay –- or without any delay at all, the coins were seized with a good search warrant."
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3521.555,3524.059,"I would not be making this argument, sir."
1969.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3524.059,3525.93,"Well, what's the difference?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3525.93,3530.036,"The difference is the amount of time in which it is done, where reasonable cause –-"
1969.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3530.036,3533.522,"I know, but the postal regulations and the laws remain the same?"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3533.522,3533.849,The postal re –-
1969.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3533.849,3537.583,And here is the government seizing the mail?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3537.583,3548.061,"This is correct but we have here the issue raised, we must detain while we obtain a search warrant, and I submit that it's already in the government's hands."
1969.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3548.237,3550.874,When would these packages have reached their destination?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3550.874,3551.546,"Excuse me, sir?"
1969.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3551.546,3556.249,When would these packages have reached their destination?
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3556.249,3561.528,"It takes airmail, for my brief, to reach this city –-"
1969.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3561.528,3561.891,"Well, how long --"
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3561.891,3564.652,"…approximately three days, and these were sent airmail."
1969.403,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3568.008,3582.032,"And if the government just hadn't seized them at the point of origin, but had seized them at the destination, they would've had their warrant by then and they would've ended up with the same result as here."
1969.403,1,18822,craig_g_davis,,3582.032,3591.95,"That's correct, but the question is do we begin at the beginning or at the end, and I submit that the government began in the wrong fashion in this case."
1969.403,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3617.525,3622.927,"Thank you, Mr. Davis."
1969.403,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3622.927,3627.668,I have just two points that I would like to make.
1969.403,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3668.816,3672.083,He then have penalty of failure to do that?
1969.403,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3672.083,3673.719,"Sorry, Mr. Justice."
1969.403,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3673.719,3675.681,Is there a penalty of a failure to do that?
1969.403,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3675.681,3685.089,"No, this is an internal housekeeping part of the post office statute, a direction to postal employees."
1969.403,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3802.175,3804.283,"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General."
