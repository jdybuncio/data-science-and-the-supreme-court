1991.90-1791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.76,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-1791, Connecticut National Bank v. Thomas M. Germain."
1991.90-1791,0,31038,janet_c_hall,,52.866,56.253,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,115.023,121.779,How much weight do you think those pre-bankruptcy code enactment provision... cases have?
1991.90-1791,0,31038,janet_c_hall,,121.779,134.937,"--I believe they're important, Mr. Chief Justice, because they demonstrate that there was an existing scheme, which recognized jurisdiction in the courts of appeals under section 1292 as well as other sections which granted jurisdiction of bankruptcy cases."
1991.90-1791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.937,142.693,"But the bankruptcy court was tied much more closely to the district court before the enactment of the Bankruptcy Code, wasn't it?"
1991.90-1791,0,31038,janet_c_hall,,142.693,149.03,"That is correct, although, the bankruptcy court is still described in the '84 legislation as a unit of the district court."
1991.90-1791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,219.841,230.648,"Ms. Hall, why do you suppose Congress enacted section 158(d) if the courts of appeal already had jurisdiction?"
1991.90-1791,0,31038,janet_c_hall,,236.135,242.789,In part it was needed because of initially the House's desire to create the bankruptcy appellate panels.
1991.90-1791,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.806,400.61,You also achieve a second interlocutory appeal.
1991.90-1791,0,31038,janet_c_hall,,466.386,470.521,"It is plausible, Your Honor, and it is something Congress could have done."
1991.90-1791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,689.899,692.215,"Where is this in your brief, Ms. Hall?"
1991.90-1791,0,31038,janet_c_hall,,692.215,697.803,"Your Honor, it is addressed, I believe, as the last point, at pages 34 and 35."
1991.90-1791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,697.803,698.755,Thank you.
1991.90-1791,0,31038,janet_c_hall,,698.755,701.973,Roman numeral VI.
1991.90-1791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,733.009,738.563,Does one of the footnotes on 34-35 set forth the statute you're talking about verbatim?
1991.90-1791,0,31038,janet_c_hall,,738.563,743.284,"--It does, Your Honor."
1991.90-1791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,750.604,755.424,That's the one on footnote on... the last part of your footnote 41?
1991.90-1791,0,31038,janet_c_hall,,755.424,758.876,"Yes, Your Honor, on the bottom of page 34 and then up to 35."
1991.90-1791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,758.876,759.659,Thank you.
1991.90-1791,0,31038,janet_c_hall,,759.659,767.913,"The amendment in 1990 that Congress passed was to amend 305, first to make it clear that a denial of such a motion would also not be appealable."
1991.90-1791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,923.447,924.697,"Very well, Ms. Hall."
1991.90-1791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,950.395,951.764,"Mr. Germain, we'll hear from you."
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,951.764,954.549,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1047.059,1049.261,"Yes, but isn't there an answer to that?"
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1072.793,1075.995,"I believe, first of all, that there is still a review by the district court."
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.861,1100.377,It would not have been necessary?
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1100.377,1100.911,That's correct.
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.911,1105.348,But why would they repeal the normal 1292(b) review?
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1108.217,1113.101,"Well, there is no specific reason that was set forth by Congress in the legislative history."
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1133.531,1134.131,Right.
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1134.131,1142.137,"And in fact, if you permit interlocutory... appeals of interlocutory orders to the circuit court of appeals, that policy may be restricted because--"
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1142.137,1143.421,It's entirely up to the court of appeals.
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1150.208,1162.082,"--Certainly, but it may have been Congress' intent that they didn't even want to subject the bankruptcy court administration or the bankruptcy court estate to the possibility that that would have to undergo this additional review by the circuit court of appeals."
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1162.082,1167.319,"Yes, but on the other side of the coin, every now and then there is a very important issue that arises in an interlocutory posture."
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1175.092,1175.425,Certainly.
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1181.412,1189.018,"Then why doesn't it make more sense to say, well, leave it to the discretion of the court of appeals, and they can identify those that are important and dismiss those that are just dilatory?"
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1189.018,1201.825,"First of all, I think this case is still governed by the fact that there is no reason... I don't know whether you have to get into intent, even, because there is no reason for 158(d) to be passed, if in fact it wasn't meant to restrict the appellate court review."
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.175,1206.729,"Well, if that was the reason, they surely could have done it more direct language than they did."
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1214.233,1219.971,"--That's correct, but it speaks only to final orders judgments in section 158(d)."
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1222.489,1224.358,"No, because it's already authorized."
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1224.741,1235.63,"In fact, if they wanted to have these type of appeals of interlocutory orders, they simply either could have included the language of interlocutory orders in that section, or simply not have passed it at all."
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1254.56,1256.344,--Partial repeal.
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1256.344,1269.487,"Partial repeal, preemption, whatever it is that... petitioner's brief speaks a great deal about the high standard that the Court has to find when a statute repeals another statute and doesn't do it explicitly."
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1292.419,1297.287,"Yes, but it's partial repeal to the extent that 1292(b) applied in bankruptcy before."
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1297.287,1300.673,"--It may be just a matter of semantics, whether it's repeal or preemption."
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1300.673,1304.41,"Well, you don't normally talk about one Federal statute preempting another Federal statute."
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1306.51,1307.012,"Yes, but--"
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.012,1309.029,It preempts State law or other things.
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1309.029,1324.038,"--In this case, the fact that it's only a partial repeal and not a total repeal, as that involved the cases that we cited by the petitioner in support of the statutory rule of interpretation, I think, would limit the effect or limit the burden that the respondent has in order to overcome that."
1991.90-1791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1324.038,1348.839,"Mr. Germain, it seems to me another response to the seeming anomaly of not being able to take an interlocutory appeal from the bankruptcy panel, although you can take it from the district court under the petitioner's interpretation, is that you wouldn't be before the bankruptcy panel, except voluntarily."
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1360.146,1366.467,"That's correct, Your Honor, but that still wouldn't resolve the situation where if this issue was important enough--"
1991.90-1791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1366.467,1370.519,"No, right, you'd still be left with the fact that you could not take an interlocutory appeal."
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1378.358,1389.833,"--It may be, but it still doesn't answer the question of why 158(d) includes district court jurisdiction in addition to the jurisdiction for the interlocutory panels."
1991.90-1791,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1504.189,1508.16,How do you read it in relation to 305(c)?
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1508.16,1515.08,305... I think the argument that's made by the petitioner in their case is that 305(c) is inconsistent with the respondent's position.
1991.90-1791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.377,1642.996,"Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, though, Mr. Germain."
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1659.374,1660.074,--Absolutely not.
1991.90-1791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1718.163,1723.983,"Of course, that isn't the test for mandamus under our cases, an extraordinary situation that would cause great injustice."
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1735.041,1744.98,"Well, I think effect of the result of the failure to have that appeal is a consideration in issuing a writ of mandamus, even though that is not the only consideration."
1991.90-1791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1901.532,1918.228,"Do you contend, Mr. Germain, that section 158 covers the subject from orders of bankruptcy judges, more or less from A to Z, so that you no longer need 1291 or 1292 when you're talking about... you can just read 158?"
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1918.228,1924.381,"No, it does apply... well, it does apply to all orders that are issued by bankruptcy judges."
1991.90-1791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1978.682,1988.638,Do you think 158(d) wholly supersedes 1291 and 1292 when you're talking appeal from bankruptcy orders from the district court and the court of appeals?
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,1988.638,1989.49,Yes.
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2045.676,2047.143,"Mr. Germain, can I ask you a question?"
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,2067.074,2070.626,"As far as a final judgment, it would go to the Second Circuit."
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2070.626,2071.359,Go to the court of appeals.
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,2071.359,2072.143,That's correct.
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.194,2079.232,So it is correct that 158(d) was necessary to take care of appeals from that panel?
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,2079.232,2079.947,That's correct.
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2079.947,2091.289,"And that goes... and there's... ironically, though, that is treated as an order of the district court, is it, when the three-judge... three-bankruptcy-judge panel resolves an appeal from--"
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,2091.289,2093.141,I don't think it's necessary to find that.
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2099.378,2099.678,--Right.
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,2104.865,2105.415,That's correct.
1991.90-1791,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2106.549,2107.734,But it does go directly to the court of appeals.
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,2107.734,2109.853,"--Yes, it's clear that 158(d) does provide for that."
1991.90-1791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2109.853,2110.153,That's what I thought.
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,2125.879,2126.545,"Well, that's correct."
1991.90-1791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2238.134,2239.168,I have only one small question.
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,2241.836,2243.938,"--No, we do not."
1991.90-1791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2243.938,2245.205,"Thank you, Mr. Germain."
1991.90-1791,1,42741,thomas_m_germain,,2245.205,2245.974,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-1791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2245.974,2251.878,"Ms. Hall, you have 15 minutes remaining."
1991.90-1791,2,31038,janet_c_hall,,2251.878,2253.711,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-1791,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2323.474,2336.798,"The standard by which a court of appeals decides to accept submission under 1292(b), it's whether the issue would be dispositive in the particular case, isn't it?"
1991.90-1791,2,31038,janet_c_hall,,2338.484,2344.721,That is the standard by which the district court must first certify the appeal to even be considered by the court of appeals.
1991.90-1791,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2356.861,2364.651,"But there's nothing indicating that a court of appeals must look for something of general importance in that question is there, beyond the particular case?"
1991.90-1791,2,31038,janet_c_hall,,2364.651,2375.859,"Only in the words of the statute which address the fact that it not only be controlling, which presumably speaks in terms of that litigation, but that it be a question as to which it is unsettled."
1991.90-1791,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2381.061,2386.048,So you say that means beyond that case it should be something of general importance.
1991.90-1791,2,31038,janet_c_hall,,2386.048,2386.748,It has a benefit.
1991.90-1791,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2467.452,2472.254,"And 305 applies only to bankruptcy courts, not to district courts."
1991.90-1791,2,31038,janet_c_hall,,2472.254,2473.373,I don't think that's exactly correct.
1991.90-1791,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.057,2489.632,"Well, then that would explain why you had to refer to both 158(d) and 1295 and 1292, for those cases that might arise... might be coming up from the district court."
1991.90-1791,2,31038,janet_c_hall,,2495.019,2496.652,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-1791,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2632.475,2633.491,"Thank you, Ms. Hall."
