1955.162,1,21291,david_g_macdonald,,3005.277,3007.71,May it please the Court.
1955.162,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3043.281,3045.918,Is there (Inaudible)
1955.162,1,21291,david_g_macdonald,,3045.918,3051.772,The difference between fresh poultry and frozen poultry is very slight in actual rates.
1955.162,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3156.957,3172.083,"Is -- is that what the issue before the Court, I hope it isn't Mr. Macdonald because you said it -- well, rather to me, a difficult, sort of (Inaudible) that economic is a social problem that I hope we won't have to decide on."
1955.162,1,21291,david_g_macdonald,,3172.083,3187.213,"Well, I don't ask the Court to go beyond the rules of -- of the interpretation and construction that the Court has made clear and I think 47 Columbia Law Review is one of the best guides that I found in my research as to the principles."
1955.162,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3354.917,3382.134,"Because they -- is that before the Court because I'm looking at these briefs or in the record, is that before the Court, evidence or other materials here, which shows to what extent there was a severance of the two aspects of the enterprise, to what extent of the raising (Inaudible)"
1955.162,1,21291,david_g_macdonald,,3382.134,3382.416,I believe so --
1955.162,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3382.416,3385.44,"To what extent, in other words, the farmers have the ability."
1955.162,1,21291,david_g_macdonald,,3385.44,3386.175,I believe so.
1955.162,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3391.067,3391.863,4% of the --
1955.162,1,21291,david_g_macdonald,,3391.863,3394.384,-- that is processed by -- by the farmer.
1955.162,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3394.456,3396.109,All -- all of these he does himself.
1955.162,1,21291,david_g_macdonald,,3396.109,3402.062,"Actually it's not the farmer, it's the Long Island Duck Association, other cooperative organizations but by the grower."
1955.162,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3402.062,3403.61,What about poultry?
1955.162,1,21291,david_g_macdonald,,3403.61,3407.102,"That is a -- as to poultry and -- and meat, I think it's about the same."
1955.162,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3407.102,3411.275,Both are the same and arrested by independent process?
1955.162,1,21291,david_g_macdonald,,3411.275,3431.954,"The greatest poultry -- part of the poultry industry is what is now known as the broiler industry centered in the Delmarva Peninsula across the Chesapeake Bay and in Georgia and other sections where the birds are raised in large broiler houses and go in a truck operated by the -- usually by the packer, two packing plant and the birds come out as broilers and fryers and so on."
1955.162,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3431.954,3435.967,It must have happened to (Inaudible)
1955.162,1,21291,david_g_macdonald,,3435.967,3446.046,The reason that the -- this case as before the court starts with the Kroblin case which is the only basis for the court's decision below and the poultry should be classified as exempt.
1955.162,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3548.449,3553.756,"With all due respect Mr. Macdonald, I think we both respected life (Inaudible)"
1955.162,1,21291,david_g_macdonald,,3553.756,3567.55,"I recognized that that is true, but in recalling certain language of the Court by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I remember that the reason why that Congress didn't usually know what had happened, well in this instance, the Congress did know what had happened."
1955.162,1,21291,david_g_macdonald,,3610.455,3611.848,Mr. Phinney
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,3611.848,3615.363,Thank you sir.
1955.162,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3982.414,3989.686,"May I trouble you this, at least tell me what -- based on (Inaudible) what is it, qualifying the court, until what?"
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,3990.664,3991.195,"Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4378.69,4379.945,Was that happening?
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4379.945,4382.151,"Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4554.317,4555.439,May I ask you if the same --
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4555.439,4555.727,"Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4555.727,4559.79,-- question of statutory interpretation is involved in both.
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4559.79,4560.315,"Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4560.315,4561.321,Precisely the same?
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4561.321,4561.808,"Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4562.676,4569.691,You get nothing more decided if you get -- so far as the statutory interpretations if you get that determined.
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4569.691,4577.38,"If -- there --may I -- Your Honor, may I put it this way."
1955.162,2,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,4608.415,4616.298,"Oh you mean that one of them decides poultry and one meat, you -- you won't get both question decided in one case."
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4616.298,4617.31,No sir.
1955.162,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4629.17,4630.657,"Well, you have two complaints here --"
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4630.657,4630.917,"Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4630.917,4633.056,One has been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction --
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4633.056,4633.725,"Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4633.731,4634.986,The other has been acted on.
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4634.986,4635.854,"Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4635.854,4641.453,"What is the difference and if that's it, is there any difference at all in the merits that would have be to be decided --"
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4641.453,4641.863,No sir.
1955.162,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4641.863,4642.631,-- in the two cases?
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4642.631,4642.775,No sir.
1955.162,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4642.775,4644.312,Provided you reach the merits?
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4644.312,4644.406,Sir?
1955.162,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4644.406,4645.572,Provided you reach the merits?
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4645.572,4647.242,"Provided it reached them, Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4647.242,4648.419,Just precisely the same.
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4648.419,4649.868,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
1955.162,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4678.872,4685.842,Mr. Phinney do you agree with Mr. Ginnane that you are now subject to similar penalties without more?
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4685.842,4686.97,"Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4701.594,4712.838,"The reason I asked that was that I -- I read your complaint not this afternoon, but earlier and I -- I didn't think you mentioned criminal penalties."
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4719.488,4742.889,"Well, we -- we certainly agreed with -- with his position that if -- if the Interstate Commerce Commission has the authority to enter the determination case and to determine what constitutes agricultural commodities, we are subject to criminal prosecution just as much as if we were holding some item that was not an agricultural commodity."
1955.162,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4742.889,4745.581,Without any other intervening procedure?
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4745.581,4746.25,"Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4758.209,4759.149,Yes.
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4759.149,4759.818,"Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4759.818,4760.885,Thank you.
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4760.885,4761.333,"Thank you so much, Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4761.333,4762.146,"Mr. Phinney, I just wonder if --"
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4762.146,4762.262,"Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4762.262,4767.922,-- suppose the Court was to enter a conclusion --
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4767.922,4768.398,"Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4768.398,4789.082,"We finally say that this determination of the order was subject to be isn't the view, it went back down to the previous court, (Inaudible) they only passed on the poultry items, wouldn't they pass on all the items covered by the determination order?"
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4789.082,4810.759,"Justice Clark, we have raised all of the items in the determination case, we -- we are taking the position that we can transport all agricultural commodities and I -- I presume if the court would write on that -- on that feature of it that it -- it would cover all of the agricultural commodities."
1955.162,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4810.759,4820.159,"Upon the merits then, my determination case in view -- in view of that case, covered all the items while your complaint (Inaudible)"
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4820.159,4820.756,"Yes, sir."
1955.162,2,19847,carl_l_phinney,,4860.997,4863.44,Thank you Mr. Phinney.
1955.162,3,21291,david_g_macdonald,,4871.636,4882.418,The thing I was referring to is an article on how to reinspect this (Inaudible) I don't remember the exact page but --
1955.162,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4882.418,4885.851,Is that general practice or my general remarks on that --
1955.162,3,21291,david_g_macdonald,,4885.851,4886.177,I believe that's correct.
1955.162,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4886.177,4887.548,Oh.
1955.162,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4900.638,4902.401,Mr. Weston.
1955.162,4,20266,charles_h_weston,,4902.401,4904.634,If it please the Court.
1955.162,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5050.951,5057.35,"Well, is there any distinction in your opinion between dressed chicken and dressed beef?"
1955.162,4,20266,charles_h_weston,,5057.35,5071.222,"Yes, I think there is a difference because of the source of the statutory exemption, one is derived from the livestock exemption and the other from the agricultural commodity exemption."
1955.162,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5071.222,5074.312,Why do they have to be derived from a different source?
1955.162,4,20266,charles_h_weston,,5081.614,5102.589,"Because the livestock exemption by adopting the definition, it's using the word ordinary livestock it adopted the definition of those words in Paragraph 1 --, Section 1, Paragraph 22 of the Act which specifically refers to live animals."
1955.162,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5112.415,5119.618,"Is there any reason why fresh meat would have to come under that livestock exemption, why couldn't it come under agriculture --"
1955.162,4,20266,charles_h_weston,,5119.618,5119.977,"Well, --"
1955.162,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5119.977,5121.37,-- just the same as poultry?
1955.162,4,20266,charles_h_weston,,5121.37,5123.614,I think that it could.
1955.162,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5135.258,5140.161,"Well, I was just asking if in your opinion, was any distinction between -- difference between that?"
1955.162,4,20266,charles_h_weston,,5140.161,5173.013,"That was -- well, I do think there is this difference that they do derive from different statutory provisions and there is a possible implication that Congress having specifically provided for livestock meant to include it under those words, everything relating to livestock, poultry being outside that and livestock exemption could not -- possibly be so -- so covered."
1955.162,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5173.013,5176.766,(Inaudible) the Secretary of Agriculture is a party -- is a party --
1955.162,4,20266,charles_h_weston,,5176.766,5177.629,Yes.
1955.162,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5177.629,5182.488,And the Secretary of Agriculture did not appeal from the legal --
1955.162,4,20266,charles_h_weston,,5182.488,5185.257,That's right.
1955.162,5,19847,carl_l_phinney,,6502.678,6504.093,"Yes, and only --"
1955.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6504.093,6504.646,(Voice Overlap)
1955.162,5,19847,carl_l_phinney,,6513.57,6538.674,"If you follow both the reasoning of the Commission and the District Court that the livestock exemption fixes the limits as far, as meats are concerned, if that is as far as meats derived from those animals which come under the livestock exemption."
1955.162,5,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6561.222,6569.229,By the fact.
1955.162,5,19847,carl_l_phinney,,6569.229,6581.538,"If there are no other question, we submit the case."
