1989.88-2102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.044,We'll hear argument now in Stewart v. Abend.
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,7.957,9.94,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,87.699,92.254,That was an express assignment of the right to renew?
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,92.254,92.985,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,95.516,103.249,"And if the author hadn't died, could the assignee have exercised that right or would the author have had to do so?"
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,103.249,109.854,--It has always been the law that only the statutory successor named in the statute may exercise the right.
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,109.854,113.477,"So this case would be the same, in your view, if he had... never had assigned the renewal right?"
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,113.477,114.366,No.
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,121.131,126.504,"Well, even if he had assigned it, you couldn't exercise it."
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,126.504,128.768,We could not renew.
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,132.411,132.851,"Well, what if he didn't renew it?"
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,132.851,136.032,"Well, I misunderstood your question."
1989.88-2102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,230.437,231.598,Mr. Abend is an agent?
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,231.598,235.012,"Well, he's listed as a literary researcher."
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,387.964,394.488,"xxx even if he assigned... even though he had assigned, if he had lived, could you have forced him to renew?"
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,394.488,396.349,We could not force him to renew.
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,396.349,400.713,"And you couldn't force his statutory successor to renew... I mean, his executor?"
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,400.713,401.122,No.
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,414.432,415.594,"Well, you couldn't do it, could you?"
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,415.594,416.795,I think we could.
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,416.795,418.157,An assignee could have gone in and--
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,418.157,419.089,"Yes, we could."
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,433.16,440.593,--So even if... so he could not have even... if he'd of lived he couldn't have prevented you from renewing it in his name?
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,440.593,441.324,--No.
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,442.606,443.174,What do you mean no?
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,444.025,444.767,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,452.444,453.663,"Well, he's just contrary."
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,453.663,454.444,"Well, that could happen."
1989.88-2102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,517.048,526.375,"Under the Second Circuit's view, the owner of the Woolrich copyright could make another movie based on it, could it not?"
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,526.375,529.046,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, could I have that again?"
1989.88-2102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,529.046,529.246,Yes.
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,535.631,535.781,Right.
1989.88-2102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,535.781,540.195,--could he not now make another movie based on that short story?
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,540.195,540.646,Absolutely.
1989.88-2102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,546.411,552.556,But he could use any of the new matter that was incorporated in the Hitchcock movie?
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,552.556,553.277,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,555.22,555.36,No.
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,557.89,558.832,"--Well, that--"
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,558.832,560.972,"Now, he's the entire owner."
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,560.972,565.024,--The problem is that only a part of the short story was used in the film.
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,565.024,565.274,Right.
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,565.274,570.289,He could make a literal version of the short story and have no problem from us.
1989.88-2102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,581.65,583.461,And he couldn't infringe those additions to the story?
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,583.461,586.764,--He could not use the new matter that was added by us.
1989.88-2102,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,634.819,647.184,"Well, Mr. Petrich, I gather that the Rohauer decision has certainly not been unanimously acclaimed in the scholarly community, one might say."
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,647.184,652.799,"Well, Professor Nimmer hasn't liked it, but he also was counsel for the Writers Guild at one time."
1989.88-2102,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,652.799,657.853,"And the Registrar of Copyrights, I guess, has filed something indicating--"
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,657.853,658.444,Correct.
1989.88-2102,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,672.664,675.146,"--Well, perhaps that's up to Congress."
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,695.14,707.119,"That's not altogether clear, Your Honor, because there's nothing in the record to show that... or the legislative history, that show that the 1909 act intended to discriminate in favor of one set of authors against another set of authors."
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,734.679,751.392,"If the copyright holder who made the assignment had renewed, you say that he could not interfere with your plan, if he had lived?"
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,751.392,757.379,"If he had lived, he would have or we would have had the assignment he had given us, which would give us the assigned right to make--"
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.379,760.798,Is that... do you derive that directly from the act or is that a judicial--
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,760.798,761.459,"--Oh, no."
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,763.522,764.334,"--Well, I know."
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,772.05,776.955,"That... that's based on the decision of this Court in 1943, the Fred Fisher case."
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,776.955,780.267,And that assignment is an assignment?
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,780.267,786.344,"So that Congress intended for authors to have the right to assign their interests, including their renewal interest."
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.344,789.193,"Well, what about our later decision... which one is it... Miller?"
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,789.193,790.124,Miller Music.
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,790.124,795.149,And it... what if assignment isn't an assignment; it's just an expectancy?
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,795.149,813.671,"In Miller Music, where you had a competition between an author on one side and a mere publisher on the other, it said that the clear intent of Congress was that the author's successors... in this case the author is dead... the author's successors ought to get the new renewal and they ought to get the renewal term of the--"
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,813.671,815.922,"What if he assigned to what... in that case, what did he assign?"
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,815.922,819.034,"--Apparently, the entire term, all the copyrights--"
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,819.034,820.196,Including the renewal?
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,820.196,821.726,--Including the renewal.
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.726,823.068,To the publisher?
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,823.068,823.839,That's correct.
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,823.839,828.19,But who... all he had was the assignment.
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,831.843,832.343,That's right.
1989.88-2102,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,897.182,905.396,Unless they reached an agreement with the respondents to allow for the use at some compensation.
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,905.396,924.259,"--Well, the Ninth Circuit expressed the view that, while they understood that there were important policy reasons for reconciling these conflicting interests, they chose not to bring those policy interests into play until the remedies portion of the analysis."
1989.88-2102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.915,1057.207,May I interrupt with a question here?
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1057.207,1057.347,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.347,1064.633,Supposing... instead of giving a right to just the derivative work of motion pictures there had been an assignment of all rights in the copyright.
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1067.946,1068.627,Yes.
1989.88-2102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1085.779,1091.394,So you relied primarily on the fact that you did create a new work before the first copyright term expired?
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1091.394,1091.813,Entirely.
1989.88-2102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.087,1098.558,"Well, then, if that's the case, does it make any difference whether you've got a copyright on the derivative work?"
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1098.558,1099.489,Yes.
1989.88-2102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.972,1103.333,I know you couldn't get it.
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1111.51,1120.655,I don't think so because we rely entirely on the fact that we have a copyright which was... gives us rights under Section 24 of the old law.
1989.88-2102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1120.655,1125.42,"But the right the copyright gives you is the right to exclude others from your new matter, and you still have that right."
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1125.42,1129.541,"Well, if we had not gotten a copyright we couldn't exclude others from using our new matter."
1989.88-2102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1129.541,1135.696,"But I'm suggesting that normally you can either use it or not use it at your will, as long as nobody can interfere with your right."
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1142.131,1143.493,"Oh, I understand that."
1989.88-2102,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.074,1188.517,But you still have... I think Justice Stevens was saying you still have the value of that new copyright that's come into existence.
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1201.485,1202.005,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1206.74,1207.031,"Oh, no."
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1224.264,1224.985,No.
1989.88-2102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1229.198,1230.62,But that's not what a copyright gives you.
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1230.62,1233.102,"--Well, yes."
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1299.131,1308.565,"To get a copyright on Rear Window, did all you have to do is just make the film and present it for a copyright?"
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1308.565,1309.226,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.322,1322.035,And do you have to demonstrate that... in getting your copyright that you have those permissions?
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1322.035,1322.846,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1322.846,1326.317,The Copyright Office doesn't really care about that at all.
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1326.317,1326.728,No.
1989.88-2102,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1362.893,1371.018,"Well, now under the work made-for-hire-arrangement, presumably the motion picture industry can solve some of these problems."
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1371.018,1371.169,Sure.
1989.88-2102,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1420.685,1424.755,"Well, they will, depending on the price that they negotiate for them."
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1439.906,1444.22,"But under the Ninth Circuit view, he can't give away the right to use that work in the future."
1989.88-2102,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1447.403,1450.645,Not until within a year of--
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1450.645,1450.785,Correct.
1989.88-2102,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1450.785,1452.325,--the renewal.
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1452.325,1452.986,That's correct.
1989.88-2102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1468.847,1470.309,"Mr. Petrich, let's assume."
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1483.489,1493.236,"We rely on the fact that Congress in Section 7 gave derivative works the same standing as copyrights, as all other copyrights."
1989.88-2102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1506.965,1516.041,"So that it ultimately gets back to your contention that the same standing, as all other copyrighted works, includes not only the right to exclude people--"
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1516.041,1518.192,But the right to enjoy it.
1989.88-2102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1518.192,1519.073,--but the right to use yourself.
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1519.073,1519.975,Exactly.
1989.88-2102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1519.975,1522.238,Okay.
1989.88-2102,0,34929,louis_p_petrich,,1530.956,1542.245,"We need the right to renewal because the original owner, when he has to give us consent to make the work in the first place, at that time, he can put any restriction on us he wants."
1989.88-2102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1554.384,1556.305,"Very well, Mr. Petrich."
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1558.268,1564.94,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1685.663,1689.315,Decided by a very closely divided Court.
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1689.315,1690.237,"That's true, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1701.105,1701.306,Yes.
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1715.147,1722.493,But it's not actually clear that this would be an extension of Miller Music beyond its facts.
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1748.031,1750.763,"There weren't two copyrights involved in Miller, were there?"
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1750.763,1752.383,Implicitly there were.
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1752.383,1754.236,"Well, but there were not expressly."
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1754.236,1755.157,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1776.01,1779.243,"Well, that's an extension of Miller."
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1779.243,1791.252,"Your Honor, we think it would actually be a complete undercutting of Miller because of the practical fact that's... publishers of music don't just get the copyrights in a completed song."

1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1814.639,1815.581,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1819.184,1823.398,And how about if he dies and the executor refuses to renew?
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1827.659,1831.723,If there was privity of contract between the executor and the party compelling--
1989.88-2102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1831.723,1831.873,No.
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1834.747,1834.927,--No.
1989.88-2102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1837.2,1843.114,"Because it's already the... the renewal assignment is already a dead letter, is that it?"
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1843.114,1846.406,"Well, the renewal assignment is not a dead letter."
1989.88-2102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.577,1860.036,"Well, at least the executor isn't bound by it."
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1860.036,1860.346,--No.
1989.88-2102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1867.421,1869.354,But the renewal is... it just expired.
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1874.599,1875.718,--It's worthless.
1989.88-2102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1883.586,1892.672,"Well, it must not mean anything unless you could go ahead and renew in the author's name unless, if the executor refused."
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1893.814,1896.976,"Well, I'm not too sure I understand."
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1924.134,1929.817,"Isn't there some tension, as lawyers say, between the Fielding case and the Miller case?"
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1929.817,1931.209,The Fred Fisher case?
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.209,1931.53,I'm sorry.
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1932.551,1934.872,"There is, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1976.094,1981.629,But the policy can be defeated by the author assigning the renewal right in advance of its exercise?
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1981.629,1982.749,Absolutely.
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1983.621,1992.858,"So in effect that... you know, if you say the entire policy is to give authors a second chance, Fielding does not carry that out... or rather Fisher."
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,1997.041,2003.235,"--Well, there is a second policy that's been recited, and it's interesting the petitioners elevate it to the primary policy."
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2036.994,2048.797,"Certainly one can read the Fielding opinion and not have... I'm sorry, the Fisher opinion, and not get the feeling that that was the primary purpose of the copyright."
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2058.405,2081.301,"--Actually I think, Your Honor, that a careful reading of Fred Fisher, first of all, recites the statements in the House Report 60-2222, that authors were often making unremunerative transfers because of their unability... or the inability, rather, to evaluate when they first created a work its public appeal."
1989.88-2102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2247.105,2248.226,"Mr. Anderson, can I interrupt you for a second?"
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2248.226,2248.705,--Absolutely.
1989.88-2102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2248.705,2253.96,"You're... it's true, I suppose that... well, let me put it this way."
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2284.051,2284.332,Yeah.
1989.88-2102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.651,2301.345,"Well, say it's done, you know, just the year before the 27th year."
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2301.345,2305.976,Films are often also delayed for quite a period of time before they actually are released.
1989.88-2102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2344.351,2347.734,"Well, of course, they made it at a time when they thought the Rohauer rule was the right rule."
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2347.734,2350.267,"--That's not accurate, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2439.801,2445.344,"Does that make it binding on the courts, that it was the view of the studios?"
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2445.474,2455.092,"--Well, Your Honor, I think to the extent that Petitioners are claiming a lack of fairness in this result, then I think it is something that the Court should consider."
1989.88-2102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.508,2468.651,"You know, it also goes to show, I would assume, whether the skies will fall if we continue what they have assumed to be the rule."
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2468.651,2470.123,"--And that was my second point, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2490.959,2497.644,"I suppose the other side of this is that maybe these all did turn out well, but there's also been some motion picture companies that have gone bankrupt over the years."
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2497.644,2505.848,"--I know of no, and there is no indication in the record of a motion picture company that went bankrupt because of this issue."
1989.88-2102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2505.848,2505.988,For this reason.
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2517.408,2528.554,"I understand the Court's point, and I would again note that Universal, which is the subsidiary of Petitioner MCA, never came up with a single instance of deadlock."
1989.88-2102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.84,2558.877,"Well, didn't it even... the dissent in Miller agree that a widow and children would take precedence over the assignee of the renewal term?"
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2558.877,2560.119,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.425,2567.054,And that was the dissent's point?
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2567.054,2567.654,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2567.654,2582.314,"But is that still the case, that widows and children are especially protected?"
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2582.314,2582.965,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.923,2598.886,So assignees have always had the risk of being upstaged by a widower or children?
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2598.886,2599.648,--Yes.
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2636.825,2640.348,From who did Paramount get the right to distribute the film for eight years from?
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2640.348,2640.638,--From Patron.
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2640.638,2641.409,The Patron?
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2641.409,2642.02,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2713.679,2720.284,"Well, did the studios pay no attention to Rohauer after it came down, when it was the only court of appeals opinion in the field?"
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2720.284,2734.333,The petitioners and the motion picture studios who filed their amicus brief claimed that they had relied on Rohauer for the 11 years and that that should be a fact that the Court should consider.
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2769.696,2771.546,"Well, all that would do was create a conflict."
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2774.608,2776.721,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2782.337,2783.346,It might go the other way.
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2783.346,2783.997,--Exactly.
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2792.382,2793.604,Wait.
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2801.399,2804.082,--My point is the weight that the studios give Mr. Nimmer.
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2805.594,2807.795,To what extent does that bind this Court?
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2807.795,2810.367,"--Your Honor, it's a treatise; it's a commentary."
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2812.2,2813.329,"Well, I hope you're not."
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2813.329,2828.088,"But I am saying that for the studios to say that they reasonably relied on Rohauer, when the premier authority in the field said that it was plainly wrong, I think that someone should think twice about how much reliance they actually did put on Rohauer."
1989.88-2102,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2900.508,2905.422,Does your position differ in any way from that of the Registrar of Copyrights?
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,2905.422,2907.392,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3013.828,3017.401,xxx the office created by statute?
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,3017.401,3018.342,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3033.181,3038.867,What is he supposed... what is he supposed to know about the substantive meaning of the Copyright Act?
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,3038.867,3048.903,"--Your Honor, I think the Registrar is the person... or is the person who is in charge of the administration of the Copyright Act."
1989.88-2102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3050.685,3053.708,"He isn't entitled to issue regulations about what the statute means, does he?"
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,3053.708,3061.435,"--They do issue guidelines or the Registrar's compendium of practice whether that is a ""regulation""--"
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3061.435,3067.82,"Is the Registrar authorized to appear in court on his own, without appearing through the Solicitor General?"
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,3067.82,3071.84,"--Since they have, I sure hope they are, but I... frankly, I can't answer that question."
1989.88-2102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3281.538,3288.824,"Mr. Anderson, before you get into all those other works, do you agree with the Ninth Circuit's ruling on remedy, that you have no right to an injunction?"
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,3288.824,3297.861,"Well, Your Honor, the problem that I have with that is... first of all, we didn't ask for an injunction before that appeal went up."
1989.88-2102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3297.861,3301.24,I'm very interested in whether you agree with the Ninth Circuit's view.
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,3301.24,3302.642,"Well, I do not agree--"
1989.88-2102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3302.642,3302.993,You do not agree.
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,3302.993,3308.127,"--as to our case for the simple reason... for instance, the court says that we haven't made a showing of irreparable injury."
1989.88-2102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3319.754,3323.708,You don't think the remedy is limited to just some kind of statutory damages or royalties?
1989.88-2102,1,37656,peter_j_anderson,,3326.921,3337.269,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that the court properly said... the Ninth Circuit properly said that injunctive relief has always been discretionary."
1989.88-2102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3352.929,3354.612,"--Thank you, Mr. Anderson."
1989.88-2102,2,34929,louis_p_petrich,,3357.764,3358.503,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.88-2102,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3381.912,3382.583,"Well, let me be sure I understand that."
1989.88-2102,2,34929,louis_p_petrich,,3386.136,3386.697,--That's right.
1989.88-2102,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3386.697,3388.46,--But what if... what if he hadn't produced anything?
1989.88-2102,2,34929,louis_p_petrich,,3392.243,3394.483,"If we had not produced the film, we would have nothing."
1989.88-2102,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3394.483,3396.385,"Well, then, why can you produce videotapes?"
1989.88-2102,2,34929,louis_p_petrich,,3396.385,3399.647,Because they're simply a version of the film; they're just a copy.
1989.88-2102,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3400.738,3401.159,"Well, that's the point."
1989.88-2102,2,34929,louis_p_petrich,,3401.82,3405.623,But they are just additional copies.
1989.88-2102,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3420.953,3425.156,"Well, you don't have to take one book around from one bookstore to another."
1989.88-2102,2,34929,louis_p_petrich,,3425.156,3425.817,I would hope not.
1989.88-2102,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3570.904,3572.446,"Thank you, Mr. Petrich."
