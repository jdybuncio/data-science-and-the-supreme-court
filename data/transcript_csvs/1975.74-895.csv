1975.74-895,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.748,"We will hear argument next is 74-895, Virginia’s Board of Pharmacy against Consumer’s Council."
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,31.242,35.05,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1975.74-895,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,116.955,120.656,How do you define a profession?
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,120.656,126.531,"Your Honor, the general assembly has defined this profession."
1975.74-895,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,280.096,282.955,"If this is the case, why doesn’t he write a prescription?"
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,282.955,283.838,I’m sorry Your Honor?
1975.74-895,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,283.838,287.296,"If that’s the case, why doesn’t he write prescriptions?"
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,287.296,297.691,The reason that he does not write prescriptions of course that is his education is to the extent of knowing the chemical elements of drugs and their contraindications.
1975.74-895,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,306.208,308.614,And their contraindication.
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,308.614,312.896,"And their contraindication is some cases, but as the record in this case—"
1975.74-895,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,312.896,314.025,In some cases?
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,314.025,330.521,"Is in some cases, yes Your Honor because as the record shows in this case, pharmacist do keep medical profile records containing a patient’s allergies, sensitivities, or reactions to drugs."
1975.74-895,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,408.73,414.651,"Well, what happens when somebody gives the prescription to their butler and tells him to go and get it filled?"
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,414.651,423.836,"Under the medical profile records that a pharmacist would have Your Honor, the prescription of course would be written in the name of the individual."
1975.74-895,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,433.039,437.616,Can he fill one with somebody he doesn’t have a record of?
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,437.616,438.147,Can he?
1975.74-895,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,438.147,438.257,Yeah.
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,438.257,439.219,"Yes he can, Your Honor."
1975.74-895,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,439.219,441.144,Of course.
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,442.991,443.965,No by no means.
1975.74-895,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,444.604,450.083,"Some time people just send it in and send the money, and if you put down the money, you get the prescription."
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,450.083,466.775,"Exactly Your Honor and as Judge Butzner found speaking for the three-judge court that although monitoring is not completely effective because of the mobility of customers or because of the availability of non-prescription, OTC items that could be antagonistic."
1975.74-895,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,473.253,485.944,"Mr. Troy, you’ve mentioned the importance of drug as compounding drugs, as I understand the stipulation 95% of the drugs dispensed do not require compounding?"
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,485.944,488.232,That’s exactly correct Your Honor.
1975.74-895,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,537.072,539.55,"Mr. Troy, may I ask you a question?"
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,556.291,558.065,Exactly Your Honor.
1975.74-895,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,558.065,559.298,Does everything you’ve been saying everything there?
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,559.298,561.74,Yes it does Your Honor for this reason.
1975.74-895,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,561.74,572.431,"I can understand if you were arguing a compelling interest argument assuming that there was First Amendment protection, but I thought the question you gave me was whether or not commercial advertising had First Amendment protection?"
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,572.431,576.167,Correct and this is the connection.
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,593.407,595.261,Wasn’t Head a due process case and not a First Amendment case?
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,595.261,597.702,"Exactly, yes it was Your Honor."
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.841,621.327,And you disagree with this.
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,621.327,622.685,Yes Your Honor for this reason.
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.685,625.596,You say then this is a due process case?
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,625.596,626.212,No Your Honor.
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.347,734.824,What is the state’s interest in forbidding the advertising to forbid to do away with competition or what?
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,734.824,737.519,"No Your Honor, it’s a health matter."
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,737.519,740.2,"Well I know, how does it protect health?"
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,740.2,745.333,As I’ve indicated -- let me answer this directly.
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.335,772.196,"Well if you advertise and if you advertise prices so called price studying, you think it might lead everyone to cut prices which lowers profits which would put the druggist in a poor position to do his job?"
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,772.196,773.577,No Your Honor.
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,798.89,801.912,"But now, has that advertising impinge on that?"
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,801.912,815.134,The advertising of course would induce consumers to think of this as a mere commodity and would be deceptive in and of itself because they would not realize what the general assembly --
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,815.134,828.237,"Well, the general assembly in its wisdom doesn’t fix prices on drugs, and it doesn’t prevent a druggist from cutting a price at the request of the consumer?"
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,828.237,829.695,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.034,838.381,And it wouldn’t prevent—it wouldn’t prevent I suppose consumers picketing a drug store to say that druggist is charging too high a price?
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,838.381,840.867,No I don’t think it would at all.
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,840.867,847.338,"And it wouldn’t even prevent one druggist from picketing another, would it?"
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,847.338,851.606,The statute does not intend to regulate price.
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.606,857.997,So if the druggist wants to sell the drugs cheaper than his competitors who made do so without interference.
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,857.997,859.8,That is correct.
1975.74-895,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,859.8,889.338,"If you’re talking about the Fourteenth Amendment type of analysis where you talk about any conceivable side effects, don’t you have to get back to Justice White’s earlier question that if you have price advertising here, you’re going to have price wars and if the pharmacist does have a responsible position, the less he can charge for the unit of the less time he is able to devote to supervising its distribution."
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,889.338,897.617,Well that is perhaps an analysis Justice Rehnquist -- sorry that came out.
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,932.07,945.303,"Does the law prevent me from writing a letter to my friends in the lodge, if I belong to one that there’s an awful good price on certain drugs at a certain drug store?"
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,945.303,945.952,No sir.
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,945.952,952.109,So everybody but the druggist can advertise the fact that there is a cut rate druggist down the street?
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,952.109,962.952,"Exactly, and the fact is of course that the statute does not in anyway intend to state to a consumer that you cannot shop around."
1975.74-895,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,981.411,985.287,Does the record show that they do go the same pharmacist?
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,985.287,990.649,"Well, in those cases where the monitoring has worked of course yes Your Honor."
1975.74-895,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1015.237,1029.345,Does this law reach the pharmacist to put a sign on his prescription counter says “I sell drugs 10% less than you can buy anywhere else”?
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,1029.345,1030.459,Yes it would Your Honor.
1975.74-895,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1061.599,1076.357,"Okay, can you put on something my price for some of these we’ll say Achromycin tablets on his prescription counter as $2.00, they do that?"
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,1076.357,1079.038,No I don’t think it could under this statute.
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1079.038,1081.981,But if you ask him what his price is he can certainly tell you.
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,1081.981,1082.748,Yes he could --
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1082.748,1085.621,And then you can go outside and tell everybody else you wanted.
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,1085.621,1087.954,You could or you could go down to the next pharmacist.
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.05,1109.737,Well do we -- must we take in to account of the First Amendment interest here of the druggist or not?
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,1109.737,1114.969,The First Amendment interest of the druggist Your Honor brings us to Bigelow --
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.969,1118.679,Is there any First Amendment interest of the druggist to take account of in this case?
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,1118.679,1119.183,No.
1975.74-895,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.161,1123.259,But what if there is?
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,1123.259,1142.179,"Well, if there is then I suggest that you have a balancing test and the balancing would be the governmental interest in regulating versus any First Amendment rights that maybe existing and this brings us to this Court’s recent decision of Bigelow."
1975.74-895,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1142.179,1150.367,"Mr. Troy, I wanted to be sure you would touch upon Bigelow because you didn’t -- your brief of course was filed before Bigelow came down."
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,1150.367,1150.944,Yes Your Honor.
1975.74-895,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1150.944,1155.467,And you haven’t seemed fit to file a supplemental so I’m particularly interested in your comment.
1975.74-895,0,17091,anthony_f_troy,,1155.467,1161.378,Because the Bigelow is simply not applicable for this reason.
1975.74-895,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1342.68,1346.927,Mr. Morrison.
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1346.927,1349.653,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-895,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.366,1579.66,The case involved not the criminal conviction of the publisher of the newspaper?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1579.66,1581.376,It did Your Honor.
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1581.376,1585.532,And this case involves -- there's no newspaper course involved?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1585.532,1585.834,That is correct.
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1585.834,1589.347,Does this case involves on an action for declaration judgment?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1589.347,1590.455,And injunction.
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1590.455,1591.176,And an injunction?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1591.176,1597.945,Yes and that we sought the convening and retained the convening of the three-judge court and hence the direct appeal on this court because of the injunction that was granted below.
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1597.945,1600.773,Right.
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1600.773,1602.271,Let me say a word about the--
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1602.271,1605.596,No free press question in this case is here?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1605.596,1612.011,Well none of the plaintiffs is a newspaper.
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1643.292,1652.144,Is this law directed at all against newspapers?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1652.144,1653.887,I don’t believe so --
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1653.887,1655.508,Or only against pharmacist?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1655.508,1662.754,Well it's not a -- the way the law works is it prohibits pharmacist from doing certain things and it's not a criminal offense.
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1662.754,1663.79,Are there criminal sanctions?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1663.79,1664.829,"No, I don’t believe so Your Honor."
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1664.829,1666.803,No criminal sanctions against anybody?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1666.803,1669.901,"I'm pretty certain that’s correct, is that correct?"
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1669.901,1671.945,What are the sanctions against pharmacist?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1671.945,1677.858,"Disciplinary proceedings, the equivalent of disbarment, I don’t know what's called in the pharmacy profession but--"
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1677.858,1678.942,You’re drummed out of the professional way.
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1678.942,1683.985,"Yes, so your white coat is removed or whatever may happen."
1975.74-895,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.993,1702.243,"If you’re right that this will not serve the Virginia statute won’t even survive a rationale basis test, I would think you could prevail on the Fourteenth Amendment as well as on the First."
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1702.243,1708.213,Well it's not clear after the North Dakota Pharmacy that I can even make a substantive due process argument under the Fourteenth Amendment.
1975.74-895,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1819.842,1823.204,Is that a constitutional interest that you’re talking about?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1823.204,1843.361,"Yes it is Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it is the right to receive information under the First Amendment and the concomitant right on the part of the pharmacist to speak freely and while the pharmacist is subject to regulation under the Fourteenth Amendment, there are still specific First Amendment prohibitions that cannot be overruled."
1975.74-895,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.554,1883.205,"What if your argument is applied to the legal profession putting aside the antitrust problem, is the state bar regulation prohibiting lawyers from advertising a violation of the First Amendment?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1883.205,1894.245,"Well, I want to answer that question directly because it's something that’s been alluded to a number of times."
1975.74-895,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1989.982,2003.149,"Now, in weighing your submission, the state's interest, do we get any help in evaluating the state's interest out of Williamson and those other cases?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2003.149,2036.794,"Well, I think that those cases do stand for the proposition that the state has an interest in seeing that professionals do not engage in broadly called over reaching activities and it may very well be that in the context of analyzing what professionals, who after all are licensed by the state, given an imprimatur of going out to the public and say “you’re a professional, state says that you can do a good job” the state may well and I don’t suggest that there is definite answer but may well be able to say “hold on, you can't say the same thing to soap maker.”"
1975.74-895,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2036.794,2044.421,"But you can't, you can't do that I gather from what you’re suggesting, your next step is going to be, but you can't do that as to assume that."
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2053.974,2059.208,"No, I would say Mr. Justice Brennan that both of those interests can properly be focused."
1975.74-895,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2095.17,2099.425,And what do you perceive the reasons for preventing this?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2099.425,2100.234,In this case?
1975.74-895,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2100.234,2102.632,"Yes, in preventing dissemination."
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2102.632,2114.153,Well the only ones that had been suggested is the fact that pharmacy is a profession and I think that NAACP against Button case eliminates that as a blanket excuse for all kinds of First Amendment restrictions.
1975.74-895,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2123.746,2130.494,"Well, but what about the monitoring, how do you tie that in, I mean why does that fit in as a reason?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2130.494,2134.65,"Well I don’t think it fits in at all, but the state has said--"
1975.74-895,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2134.65,2141.886,"I gather they make that benefit that if unless the pharmacy makes an adequate profit, they won’t deal to engage in this kind of activity, is that your argument?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2141.886,2143.267,"No, that’s not the monitoring argument."
1975.74-895,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.267,2144.294,"Well, what is it?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2144.294,2146.851,"Let me give you the monitoring argument, as I understand the state's --"
1975.74-895,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.851,2147.702,That’s what I want to know.
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2147.702,2149.308,Okay fine.
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2150.822,2153.489,You’re being asked in other words to argue your opponents case now.
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2153.489,2154.602,"No, I'm stating their case."
1975.74-895,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.771,2162.685,You’re the one who says that your interest outweigh the state.
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2162.685,2163.409,Interest in monitoring.
1975.74-895,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.409,2166.422,"Now, can you please tell me how it outweighs the state's, when you’re telling the state is --"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2166.422,2171.185,That’s right and that’s what I'm going to do right now.
1975.74-895,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2266.066,2268.872,"Well, did they have a word about anything else in the statute?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2268.872,2269.184,Not a word.
1975.74-895,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2269.184,2272.561,"Then how do you know what was in the back of their minds, how do you know that monitoring was --"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2272.561,2287.355,"Well I'm suggesting there's no evidence of it and there's subsequent evidence of conduct which supports that inference, and that is first that the pharmacy board has never urged upon the state to pass a regulation, a statute."
1975.74-895,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2298.073,2314.544,"Would you be out of here, if in fact what they had in mind and said so was we think it's best for people who have to use drugs, patronize a single dispenser so that we can have a record of everything that the patient buys."
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2316.309,2318.885,"That’s right, if that was in the legislative history of this statute?"
1975.74-895,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2318.885,2319.229,Yes.
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2319.229,2325.676,"No, we wouldn’t be out for the next reason I'm going to get to and that is that the statute goes much too far."
1975.74-895,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2467.513,2479.425,"Do you agree, Mr. Troy that this prohibition goes so far as to prevent the pharmacist from putting a sign even on his prescription counter that I sell such and such for a $1.20?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2479.425,2481.864,I certainly think it could be interpreted that way.
1975.74-895,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2513.908,2524.012,There’s nothing to suggest that the labor union for example couldn’t go to a pharmacist or to a chain drug store and negotiate for lower prescription rates for its members.
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2524.012,2525.883,"Absolutely nothing, in the statute it says--"
1975.74-895,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2525.883,2531.292,And nothing to forbid the labor union from circulating that among its members.
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2531.292,2546.913,"Circulating that fact among its members, well, I don’t know whether the pharmacist -- the pharmacist who cooperate in that venture, if he knew that the information was going to be circulated might be guilty under this rather broad statute."
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2551.582,2554.407,"Well, this law is directed only against pharmacists."
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2559.717,2564.04,"That’s right, because that only goes to the mechanism for enforcing it."
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2564.04,2564.258,Right.
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2564.258,2573.425,And I would suggest that -- similar to the other statutes that I mentioned earlier also involved only doctors in one case I’m thinking of particularly.
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2584.497,2599.028,"I suggested a moment ago Mr. Morrison, I think that this was almost price control law, was there anything implicit in that suggestion that a state would violate the constitution by enacting a law regulating prices?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2599.028,2602.669,"No, I misspoke and I wanted to correct that and I was in the middle of--"
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2602.669,2603.906,"Well I’m glad, I gave you an opportunity."
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2603.906,2605.759,Thank you very much sir.
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2668.497,2675.515,"Now, there’s a policy for rightly or wrongly or rationally or irrationally against advertising, price advertising by pharmacists?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2675.515,2677.684,"That’s the policy, yes."
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2683.031,2684.029,It’s that policy?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2684.029,2685.439,It is.
1975.74-895,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2685.439,2689.826,"Mr. Morrison, let me ask you this and I hope it isn’t irrelevant."
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2713.801,2724.684,"Well, I would first say that my first offhand reaction is that that would not be a First Amendment issue."
1975.74-895,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2750.56,2763.21,"Would you think that in the answer to furtherance of Justice Blackmun’s question, that the physician had a First Amendment right not to prescribe in the generic name and you then balance the state's interest to see whether he would prevail or the state?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2763.21,2768.799,"Well, I don’t see the speech element of First Amendment coming in."
1975.74-895,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2768.799,2772.83,"Call it freedom of expression, he is writing on a prescription pad rather than speaking."
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2772.83,2784.048,"Well, I would say that would very much come on to the O’Brien, United States against O’Brien where it’s a mixed act of speech and conduct and is much more having to do with the conduct and the content."
1975.74-895,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2786.757,2802.422,"What if the doctor is to prescribe a certain proprietary drug, if he thinks his better or he just wants his customers to use that drug?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2802.422,2803.526,Well--
1975.74-895,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2803.526,2805.834,And why isn’t that this is a First Amendment issue?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2805.834,2812.917,But it might be -- as I say I haven’t focused on it and it would seem to me that it’s not traditional kind of expression issue.
1975.74-895,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2847.185,2853.929,"Mr. Morrison, has there ever been any advertising in Virginia of prescription drugs?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2853.929,2858.434,"Oh yes, since we won this case, almost a year a half ago there has been advertising going on."
1975.74-895,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2858.434,2860.419,And that’s what --
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2860.419,2861.286,There’s been no stay Your Honor.
1975.74-895,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2861.286,2868.16,The point I’m driving at is how come the pharmacists are not involved?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2868.16,2871.042,"I’m sorry, Your Honor."
1975.74-895,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2872.925,2873.713,Yeah.
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2873.713,2880.382,"Well, the pharmacists had a try at this, in 1969 in Patterson against Kingery, they didn't win that case."
1975.74-895,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2880.382,2880.848,I see.
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2880.848,2886.243,"These are consumers, we thought, that we could do a little better [Laughter]."
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2903.229,2914.827,"You stated as I understood you that it would depend on the facts, I’ll try to put a fairly straightforward factual situation."
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2956.162,2962.852,"Well, my first reaction would be that that's certainly an item of information that consumers would want to know."
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3025.872,3046.432,"Well, even if there were according to your submission, as I understand it, the First Amendment of the constitution would override it, and if there is a right to know, if there is as you submit, a constitutional right to know on the part of potential clients or potential customers or pharmacist."
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3046.432,3050.959,"Well, in every case of course, there would be a strong presumption that the right to know would be --"
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3050.959,3052.603,"Right, if there is a right to know."
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3052.603,3058.724,"Yes, but it’s always engaged in the permissible balancing test that there are certain kinds of cases --"
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3058.724,3060.804,Well some people think some and other’s don’t.
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3071.414,3072.887,I think that is correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1975.74-895,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3072.887,3074.454,That’s not your submission is it not?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3074.454,3074.956,No and--
1975.74-895,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3074.956,3079.563,"Your suggestion is that in this instance, the state interest does not override the right to know."
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3079.563,3084.26,"Well, that’s one way of looking at it, but it’s not the way that some constitutional lawyers do."
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3084.26,3085.772,I think that’s right.
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3105.583,3106.565,"Well, if --"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3106.565,3117.447,"The compelling state interest and it was a least restrictive way they could prevent this dissemination, then that case might be cited against the dissemination of the information but we have to look at the facts."
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3118.909,3123.287,"Well, first of all, on an absolutist view or any other view, you have to look at the constitution, don’t you?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3123.287,3123.712,That’s correct.
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3123.712,3126.588,And where do you find that the constitution any right to know?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3126.588,3127.169,"Well, it’s the --"
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3127.169,3128.79,"Strictly, if you’re an absolutist."
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3128.79,3132.896,It’s the correlative -- I would say of the right to speak.
1975.74-895,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3147.671,3149.847,(Inaudible) wasn’t I alone?
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3149.847,3150.479,You were concurring it.
1975.74-895,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3150.479,3151.929,"That’s Lamont, isn’t it?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3151.929,3152.382,Yes.
1975.74-895,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3152.382,3161.754,"Well, one may fully accept that and still say that the constitution protected the right to know by guaranteeing the right to speak or the right to a fair press."
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3169.877,3177.036,"Well, we would certainly say that to the extent that there is a direct right to speak that would plainly support the right to receive the information."
1975.74-895,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3200.002,3207.619,"Well you’re not suggesting are you, that the consumers have the right to know even though the pharmacists don’t have the right to speak?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3207.619,3211.394,I think the pharmacist do have the right to speak in this case.
1975.74-895,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3241.424,3249.608,"Mr. Morrison, maybe this is why I for one anyway, I was a little uneasy about using the phrase such as the right to know."
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3266.624,3268.924,I agree with you a hundred percent Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1975.74-895,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3296.433,3305.22,"But you don’t suggest that the First Amendment, the right to free speech means that you must have something to say, do you?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3305.22,3308.045,"No, I don’t."
1975.74-895,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3309.47,3321.572,"Yes, then if you’re going to measure it by the free flow of information, and information presumably meaning something to say, you put limit on the First Amendment, haven’t you?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3321.572,3323.663,"Well, I don’t think so."
1975.74-895,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3324.587,3333.006,"Person has the same right to speak or to write even when he's speaking or writing is utterly foolish, doesn’t he?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3333.006,3334.045,That is absolutely correct.
1975.74-895,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3351.03,3353.627,"Well, I take it that information and not noise?"
1975.74-895,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3353.627,3358.203,"Yes, thank you very much."
1975.74-895,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3358.203,3362.165,Do you have anything further Mr. Troy?
1975.74-895,2,17091,anthony_f_troy,,3362.165,3365.385,Yes Your Honor.
1975.74-895,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3414.95,3417.745,"Well, you can see this is the First Amendment case, of course, don’t you?"
1975.74-895,2,17091,anthony_f_troy,,3417.745,3430.563,"In the context that we have brought it to this court, it has been -- come by an independent right to know granted under the First Amendment and therefore is a First Amendment case."
1975.74-895,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3430.563,3436.014,"Well, by that you mean that it was on the basis of the First Amendment that this case was decided by the District Court?"
1975.74-895,2,17091,anthony_f_troy,,3436.014,3436.47,Exactly.
1975.74-895,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3436.47,3437.724,Do you mean anything more than that?
1975.74-895,2,17091,anthony_f_troy,,3437.724,3439.175,Nothing more than that at all.
1975.74-895,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3439.175,3442.121,I’ve read your brief this is the First Amendment case.
1975.74-895,2,17091,anthony_f_troy,,3444.185,3460.345,"In the context that the court decided of the case below, it was decided on a First Amendment basis and the entire argument that we are presenting is that that First Amendment basis was analytically unsound."
1975.74-895,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3460.903,3463.831,Then this is not a First Amendment case in your view.
1975.74-895,2,17091,anthony_f_troy,,3463.831,3464.471,"No, Your Honor."
1975.74-895,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3508.168,3513.933,Was there anything as to the standing of these people to sue in the District Court?
1975.74-895,2,17091,anthony_f_troy,,3513.933,3528.554,"Yes, there was Your Honor but that was overruled and it was a overruled on the very basis that as the court said, the Patterson case concerned pharmacy, the case here concerns First Amendment rights of consumers to know."
1975.74-895,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3540.922,3552.056,"I suppose the consumers would never be hurt – would only hurt to the extent that the druggist would advertise, if it weren’t for this long?"
1975.74-895,2,17091,anthony_f_troy,,3552.056,3564.399,"Well as I’ve indicated in the monitoring situation as Mr. Morrison indicated, if a doctor prescribes a drug that is bad, we have a malpractice suit on our hands."
1975.74-895,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3619.055,3619.746,Thank you gentlemen.
