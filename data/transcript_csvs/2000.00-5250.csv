2000.00-5250,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.031,"We'll hear argument next in Number 00-5250, Shafer v. South Carolina."
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,62.665,67.039,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-5250,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,149.434,161.323,"Well now, the court of appeals decision here did not really reach that issue--"
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,161.323,162.044,No.
2000.00-5250,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.044,166.524,"--of whether future dangerousness was argued, did it?"
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,166.524,166.978,"No, it didn't."
2000.00-5250,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,167.821,173.666,"I think the trial judge thought that the prosecutor had not, in fact, made that--"
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,173.666,174.863,--Yes.
2000.00-5250,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.54,175.706,--argument.
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,175.706,203.775,"--focused entirely on this word argue which, of course, came from Simmons, because Simmons was a case where the State presented no evidence in the penalty phase, no new evidence in aggravation, except, I think, for the indictments about Simmons' prior record, but all the facts of his prior conduct had come in in the guilt phase, and what the court did in Simmons was present a veiled metaphorical argument which a majority of the Court found to raise the issue rather indirectly."
2000.00-5250,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,203.775,207.741,You said the court presented a veiled metaphorical argument.
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,207.741,208.317,Excuse me.
2000.00-5250,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,208.771,209.597,The prosecutor... yes.
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,209.597,229.676,"The prosecutor presented a veiled metaphorical argument that the majority of this Court found raised the specter of future dangerousness in the Simmons case, and therefore on occasion members of this Court in the various opinions in Simmons referred to the rule in Simmons as one involving a triggered by argument relative to future dangerousness."
2000.00-5250,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,240.062,253.519,"Well, Justice O'Connor's opinion in that case, which two of the rest of us joined, does say that one of the conditions of Simmons is the prosecution argued that the defendant will pose a threat to society in the future."
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,253.519,254.262,--Yes.
2000.00-5250,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,255.832,259.091,Why shouldn't we take that as a holding of the case?
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,259.091,272.261,"--Because of the fact that at other points in Justice O'Connor's same opinion she used the term, show future dangerousness, where the State seeks to show that the defendant would be dangerous in the future."
2000.00-5250,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.717,287.865,"Well, even if we thought that future dangerousness must be argued or, as you now put it, shown, the supreme court of South Carolina didn't reach that question."
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,287.865,288.404,--That's correct.
2000.00-5250,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.404,307.201,"So what we really are left looking at here, I suppose, is whether this other sentencing option that the trial judge would have if the jury does not find an aggravating circumstance would trigger Simmons."
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,307.201,316.317,"That's correct, and here I think the State court is simply confused about what Simmons required."
2000.00-5250,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,362.723,364.581,Would I be right to observe... maybe it's not right.
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,371.807,376.803,They were not instructed about the 30-year option because it's none of their concern.
2000.00-5250,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,378.373,387.039,"So far as the jury knew, it was determining just between life imprisonment, however they might define that, and the capital punishment."
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,387.039,389.723,"--Well, that's correct, because that's all the jury needs to know."
2000.00-5250,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,403.226,408.798,And the 30-year alternative doesn't exist if aggravating circumstances have been found.
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,408.798,424.152,"That's... if they have them, that's exactly correct, and so the judge correctly told the jury, if you find aggravation, then you become the sentencer, and there are only two alternatives, the death penalty or life imprisonment."
2000.00-5250,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,618.417,619.531,"Well, yesterday's--"
2000.00-5250,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,619.531,621.117,--The... go ahead.
2000.00-5250,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,621.117,622.504,Yesterday's case... is it Williams +/?
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,654.044,661.763,"--Yes, before Kelly I would have said that the South Carolina supreme court required the word dangerousness to actually be used in jury argument."
2000.00-5250,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,691.317,718.066,"Do you associate yourself with the position that was taken by a friend on your side that inevitably, in any capital murder case, future dangerousness is present as a factor, so that it isn't a case by case thing, that the jury in every case is determining whether it's going to be death rather than life?"
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,718.066,728.635,"Well, as a lawyer who tries these cases in the trial court I think there is considerable merit to that view, but I don't endorse it or embrace it on behalf of my client, because there's no need to."
2000.00-5250,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,736.825,740.691,"Mr. Bruck, you said that the State asks us to remand."
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,747.499,748.697,--I stand corrected.
2000.00-5250,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,817.49,821.205,It has to be future dangerousness to the general public.
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,853.377,874.925,"--Yes, but the fact that a person is dangerous in prison is ipso facto evidence that if the bars are removed, and the jail door is opened, and he's allowed to go into the far less protected and restrictive environment of society... I mean, it would be farcical to argue, well, this person will be dangerous in prison, but if you let him out there's no reason to think he won't do just fine."
2000.00-5250,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,880.581,892.098,"So you're saying that a prosecutor cannot argue that, you know, the death penalty is the only adequate remedy here because this person is a brutal murderer."
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,900.81,902.129,--Certainly--
2000.00-5250,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,902.129,912.177,"--and you're saying if the prosecutor makes that argument, Simmons is triggered, because obviously if he's going to be dangerous in prison he's going to be dangerous out of prison, although the prosecutor does not make that point."
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,912.177,912.732,"--Yes, and--"
2000.00-5250,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,912.732,915.111,But you're saying you can't say he's going to be dangerous in prison?
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,915.111,923.339,"--He can say it, but the defense is entitled to Simmons instruction, and seven members of this Court joined opinions which said that in Simmons."
2000.00-5250,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,924.316,925.059,Which said what?
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,925.059,939.548,"--Which said that the... that when a Simmons instruction is given, of course the State may still show... Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion made this point, as did the... Justice O'Connor's concurrence, as did the plurality opinion."
2000.00-5250,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,966.381,970.384,"Well, but that doesn't necessarily follow so far as I can see."
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,988.467,1003.578,"--That is exactly my point, that the fact that even under all this supervision he is explosively angry, and the jailer has to slam the door, the cell door to constrain his rage when his... the telephone is cut off--"
2000.00-5250,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1003.578,1005.147,This argument proves too much.
2000.00-5250,0,20632,david_i_bruck,,1041.223,1058.479,"--Well, if that had been the holding of Simmons, then Simmons would stand for the very strange proposition that the State is entitled to prove future dangerousness, to call witness after witness, and indeed that's what they did here, and the State's own pretrial notice described this evidence as evidence of future dangerousness."
2000.00-5250,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1058.479,1062.65,"--I dissented, of course, so I do think it stands for a strange proposition, but--"
2000.00-5250,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3261.549,3266.546,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2000.00-5250,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3371.686,3382.626,"Mr. Bruck, do you know the answer to the question that was asked about... I was under the impression that defense counsel had asked to be allowed to say this, or was told he couldn't say it."
2000.00-5250,2,20632,david_i_bruck,,3382.626,3388.859,"Your Honor, I was under that impression, too, and I was just looking through the joint appendix right now."
2000.00-5250,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3411.029,3411.772,"Thank you, Mr. Bruck."
