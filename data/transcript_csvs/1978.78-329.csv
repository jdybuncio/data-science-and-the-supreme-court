1978.78-329,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,0.993,This case is submitted.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,85.103,85.391,Thank you.
1978.78-329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,286.875,290.975,Is there any possible disagreement as to this note between the parties?
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,290.975,292.905,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, as to the meaning of the statute?"
1978.78-329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,292.905,299.989,"No, as to just what you said, that the best interest of the minors is the rule under the Massachusetts statute."
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,299.989,301.573,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, I believe not."
1978.78-329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,309.515,317.353,"That's the way I read it, but I wonder whether you knew as between counsel on the opposing side of the putty and whether there's any disagreement as to this."
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,317.353,317.492,I think --
1978.78-329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,317.492,318.766,Maybe I'll ask them.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,318.766,319.527,"Perhaps you might, Your Honor."
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,324.503,357.003,"Well, in any event, what the Court clearly also held was that the district judge was not permitted to find that this was a mature minor capable of -- as an equivalent to an adult so far as being able to decide his -- her best interest by her own lights, and that that was sufficient, therefore, to approve the abortion."
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,385.296,386.363,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,386.473,389.591,"And, I think that is one of the issues between you."
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,389.591,395.633,"Well, let me just suggest why I don't think that means that an answer to Justice Blackmun's question should've been different from what --"
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,395.633,396.819,I didn't suggest it should've.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,396.819,396.983,Alright.
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,396.983,397.804,I just placed it.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,397.804,406.935,"I think it's important, in responding to your question, that we realize that the Supreme Judicial Court placed its comments in that regard in a context."
1978.78-329,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,448.468,468.996,"I suspect, for the purposes of your case, you might be willing to accept the very emphatic arguments that you've just heard in the preceding case that a 16-year-old is not capable of making any decision in f -- affecting his rights or her rights alone and without advice."
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,468.996,471.158,"Well, Your Honor, we don't share that view."
1978.78-329,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,487.586,492.569,You're not arguing for any per se rule in any event.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,492.569,494.203,"No, Your Honor, we're not."
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,496.439,498.559,"But, as I understand it, just to be -- I want to be --"
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,498.559,498.725,Sure.
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,498.725,499.369,I do understand this --
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,499.369,499.496,Sure.
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,499.496,500.885,-- because it's quite important to me.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,500.885,501.397,Yes.
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,501.397,530.542,"As I see this, your Supreme Judicial Court held that even though the trial judge finds that this particular minor is the equivalent of a rational mature adult so far as decision making goes, nonetheless, since she is in fact a minor, then the district judge, despite her wish to have an abortion, can say “I find it's in your best interest not to.”"
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,530.542,531.152,The judge?
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,531.152,533.833,"Which, of course, he could not do if she were in fact an adult."
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,533.833,536.008,"That's absolutely true, Your Honor."
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,581.842,593.419,"Well, it's undoubtedly true that most adults, during the course of their lifetimes, make decisions which are foolish decisions but a free society allows them to do so."
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,593.419,593.77,Absolutely.
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,593.77,595.328,And protects them in doing so.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,595.328,613.521,"Absolutely, Your Honor, and I think that, as this Court has recognized in other contexts, it's peculiar circumstances of minority which sometimes justify, indeed do justify, the states taking a more protective role than it otherwise would be permitted to do in a case of an adult."
1978.78-329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,621.285,623.649,"Mr. Cole, just straighten me out."
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,631.996,649.315,"Well, the situation is that -- your honor is referring to Section 12 (f) of the statute and the answer is yes, as a result of the provision, except for the proposition that Section 12 (s) does not apply to abortions."
1978.78-329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,829.489,837.014,"Mr. Attorney General, how about a young, below 18, who has left home?"
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,837.014,837.947,As to a question that was --
1978.78-329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,837.947,839.687,I'm trying to find it.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,839.687,843.003,As a person to -- who has no parental --
1978.78-329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,843.003,843.538,Yes.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,843.538,845.678,"Yes, the statute deals with that Mr. Justice Marshall."
1978.78-329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,845.678,847.223,We could -- I couldn't --
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,847.223,852.562,"The statute deals with the parents who have left home, parents who deserted their child."
1978.78-329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,852.562,858.191,How come about the child who leaves and gets an apartment and lives by herself.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,858.191,861.745,Right.
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,861.745,863.541,It doesn't seem to make any exception for that.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,863.541,865.377,"Well, there is a s -- I'm sorry."
1978.78-329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,872.501,873.065,Yes.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,873.065,877.595,The situation in which a no-substitute parent is available.
1978.78-329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,877.595,878.022,Right.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,878.022,888.522,"And the situation there would be that, I suppose, that someone either who could perform that function would do it for the child or on the child's behalf --"
1978.78-329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,888.522,895.855,"Well, here's a child that's living by itself, taking care of herself, and not depending on anybody."
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,897.946,898.765,Right.
1978.78-329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,900.292,902.322,It seems a lot different from the ordinary case.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,902.322,904.671,"Yes, I agree with you."
1978.78-329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,907.297,908.363,"Would be an exception, I gather."
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,908.363,910.637,"Is the -- yes, is the emancipated minor situation."
1978.78-329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,910.637,912.157,"Yes, that's what I mean."
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,912.157,915.581,"Yes, and I see the thrust of that argument."
1978.78-329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,932.131,937.319,She also has to face suicide when she gets over that.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,937.319,938.088,"If she doesn't do it, yes."
1978.78-329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,938.088,940.551,We're going to need them here so they need to go out from that.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,940.551,942.783,"Right, I understand your point, Your Honor, and I--"
1978.78-329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,942.783,951.728,"I guess a real question, is there some people that you and I know that are mature at 17 and some who are not mature at 30?"
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,953.437,958.425,"It's absolutely true, Your Honor, and we use bright lines, somewhat arbitrary distinctions."
1978.78-329,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,969.964,971.098,I didn't get the volume.
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,971.098,971.638,I'm sorry.
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1055.981,1071.686,"While we're talking about what the record shows as to the facts of life, am I correct in my recollection or understanding that I read in this brief that there are cases on record where girls as young as five years old can become pregnant?"
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,1071.686,1073.962,"Yes, Your Honor, that's true."
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1093.778,1094.719,In the United States of America?
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,1094.719,1095.458,"No, it was not."
1978.78-329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1102.225,1105.206,Are years the same length down there as they are here?
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,1105.206,1118.497,"Your Honor, it's an astonishing fact, but there are children who, I believe she commenced menstruating at 18 months."
1978.78-329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1254.823,1260.277,"Of course, the important word in your phrasing of it is “supporting,” isn't it?"
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,1260.277,1262.037,"Yes, Your Honor, that's quite so."
1978.78-329,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1273.235,1274.102,Am I not correct?
1978.78-329,0,25121,garrick_f_cole,,1279.487,1292.007,"Your Honor, on its face, the statute applies to the relationship does not probe beneath it and, yes, consultation is required even though some parents may not be supportive."
1978.78-329,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1305.42,1318.048,Mr. Riley.
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1318.048,1320.74,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-329,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1532.086,1536.257,"That depends on the wealth of the parents, doesn't it?"
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1536.257,1545.509,"I think there are many various facilities that are available that could be provided to a minor, and some may be more expensive or less expensive."
1978.78-329,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1545.509,1547.255,You think?
1978.78-329,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1547.922,1549.575,Do you think?
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1549.575,1557.034,I think that some doctors would be -- may charge a small fee and provide a better service than someone who may charge a large fee --
1978.78-329,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1557.034,1558.905,"But, do you think?"
1978.78-329,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1558.905,1560.521,"Some are free, are they not?"
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1560.521,1560.937,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1978.78-329,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1560.937,1562.558,Some are free.
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1562.558,1565.563,"Yes, Your Honor, some are free."
1978.78-329,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1565.563,1569.069,The psychiatric is free in Massachusetts?
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1569.069,1571.05,"Alright, depending upon the --"
1978.78-329,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1571.05,1574.968,That's depending upon whether or not a young girl should have an abortion.
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1574.968,1577.522,"There are neighborhood counseling services, Your Honor, and --"
1978.78-329,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1577.522,1578.07,For free?
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1578.07,1588.444,"That are available, and I don't think that it -- that that -- it's the availability the parents have to seek this type of assistance whether or not that --"
1978.78-329,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1588.444,1588.59,Of course --
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1588.59,1589.865,-- assistance should be available to --
1978.78-329,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1589.865,1592.488,One year is an important factor.
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1592.488,1599.097,"That is, Your Honor, but then, again, the girls, if they need it, should be given the opportunity to get it."
1978.78-329,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1717.729,1719.267,"Mr. Riley, can I interrupt with one question?"
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1719.267,1720.091,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-329,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1720.091,1724.064,Are you and your associate asking the Court to overrule Danforth?
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1727.711,1728.512,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1978.78-329,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1728.512,1730.863,Are you asking the Court to overrule the Danforth case?
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1730.863,1732.115,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-329,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1732.115,1734.953,Have you said anything that really isn't an attack on that case?
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1734.953,1748.421,"I think that -- I believe I attempted to make the point earlier that the statute, first, provides for parental consultation and, secondarily, provides for judicial review of that decision."
1978.78-329,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1748.421,1750.37,The only difference- - there are two differences that I want.
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1755.156,1755.419,One of the re --
1978.78-329,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1755.419,1757.929,"All these other arguments fit that statute too, don't they?"
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1757.929,1772.797,"One of the reasons advanced in the -- by the District Court for declaring the statute unconstitutional was because it required consultation in all instances, and I don't think that that was resolved in the Danforth case."
1978.78-329,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1920.637,1921.072,"Your time has expired, counsel."
1978.78-329,1,17969,brian_a_riley,,1921.072,1925.298,Such untenable situation should not be tolerated by the Court.
1978.78-329,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1928.467,1929.997,Mr. Balliro.
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,1929.997,1933.273,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-329,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1973.996,1976.997,Against whom do the criminal sections run?
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,1976.997,1978.968,"The ones performing the abortion, if Your Honor please."
1978.78-329,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1978.968,1979.876,Not against the minor?
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,1979.876,1981.598,Not against the minor.
1978.78-329,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2001.793,2005.881,"That is, minors who have not received the consent of their parents."
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2005.881,2008.646,Or who don't have a great deal of money.
1978.78-329,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2008.646,2011.641,"Well, now, this doesn't talk anything about money."
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2011.972,2013.034,No.
1978.78-329,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2013.034,2013.995,-- consent of parents.
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2013.995,2016.574,That's correct.

1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2021.29,2021.568,That's possible --
1978.78-329,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2021.568,2024.509,I think we have some free clinics in Massachusetts.
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2024.509,2038.356,"We not only have free clinics, but even clinics run by the appellees in this case, Mr. Chief Justice, provide, in a very substantial percentage of cases, free services for those who they're satisfied are indigent."
1978.78-329,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2040.301,2047.092,Do those free clinics supported by the State of Massachusetts or by private funding or do you know?
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2047.092,2052.928,None of them is supported either by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or by Federal funding.

1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2224.985,2226.05,Under 18.
1978.78-329,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2226.05,2226.706,Under 18?
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2226.706,2227.612,"Under 18, Your Honor."
1978.78-329,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2227.612,2229.675,"If she's reached her 18th birthday, she's not a minor."
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2229.675,2230.907,She's an adult.
1978.78-329,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2230.907,2232.033,Thank you.
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2232.033,2253.698,"And, as a matter of fact, this record, with respect to the appellee Mary Moe, describes exactly that kind of a hostility and aggression having been expressed by at least one of her parents or father who, she testified, had indicated that, this was before she was pregnant, that if she ever got pregnant he was likely to kill her boyfriend."
1978.78-329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2454.02,2471.956,"Mr. Balliro, just to use that as an example, as I remember the Supreme Judicial Court's comments on the case, they suggested that if the statute were too broadly construed, the Federal Court might sustain its constitutionally on -- constitutionality only in part rather than taking it as a whole."
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2492.81,2493.184,Mr. Justice --
1978.78-329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2493.184,2496.16,"Is it necessary to examine the whole thing on a facial basis, in other words?"
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2496.16,2500.791,I believe that it is and I would adopt the District Court finding that respect.
1978.78-329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2534.663,2539.746,"Well, I'm sure you would, but do you want to try and persuade us why we should do it?"
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2539.746,2547.006,"Well, first of all, I think you wouldn't be doing justice to the legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts."
1978.78-329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2566.301,2573.875,"No, but the highest Court of the state has said that if we can't have the total picture that's been presented, we want as much of it as can possibly be saved."
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2573.875,2575.577,That's what the Supreme Judicial Courts held --
1978.78-329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2575.577,2575.942,That's right.
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2575.942,2576.042,-- in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
1978.78-329,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2576.042,2577.501,That's the highest Court of Massachusetts.
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2577.501,2580.34,"That's correct, but that's not the legislature of --"
1978.78-329,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2580.34,2591.149,"Well, but our cases have said many times that when the Supreme Court of a state speaks interpreting a statute, it's just as if the legislature had spoken."
1978.78-329,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2591.149,2594.587,They have said what the legislature provides.
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2594.587,2621.105,"Well, Justice Rehnquist and Mr. Chief Justice, perhaps the greatest difficulty I have with severing out that portion of the legislature -- legislative requirement is in my strong feeling that, with respect to the rest of the statute, in almost every aspect it's so unduly burdens that it would not survive if that were to be done anyway."
1978.78-329,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2621.105,2623.539,"Well, that's a separate argument."
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2623.539,2630.668,"But, it's my answer to your question."
1978.78-329,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2630.668,2653.318,"Mr. Bellotti -- Balliro, have you ever known of another instance where your Supreme Judicial Court has said, “this is the way the statute is construed, but if it isn't alright and the Federal Court thinks it ought to go another way, we'll go along that way”?"
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2653.318,2653.62,I don't --
1978.78-329,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2653.62,2658.932,Is this common in the holes of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts?
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2658.932,2676.18,"Your Honor, it's not only uncommon in Massachusetts and nor do I know of any other instance in -- with respect to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts where the Supreme Judicial Court has ever spoken in that sense, but I don't know of any other decision, at least I've never been acquainted with one in which --"
1978.78-329,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2676.18,2684.961,"Well, there are a couple of Harvard law professors, ex-Harvard law professors on that Court and I wondered if this is what they're teaching these days."
1978.78-329,2,29224,joseph_j_balliro,,2684.961,2690.774,"I don't think they teach that at Harvard, if Your Honor pleases."
1978.78-329,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2722.912,2727.324,Mr. Henn.
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,2727.324,2729.717,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-329,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2822.315,2830.4,"Is it possible, under Massachusetts law, this statute or any other where a parent to compel the child to submit to an abortion?"
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,2830.4,2831.966,"It is not, Your Honor."
1978.78-329,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2832.817,2841.115,"The law makes all sorts of distinctions between married and unmarried people, minors, doesn't it?"
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,2841.115,2842.246,The were law in Massachusetts law --
1978.78-329,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2842.246,2856.157,"I mean, until a person is married and during his or her minority, under the ordinary concepts of common law, her parents speak for the minor."
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,2866.701,2869.816,"There are a number of distinctions with respect to minority, obviously --"
1978.78-329,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2869.816,2871.279,And with respect to marriage.
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,2871.279,2883.812,"And with respect to marriage, but I'm focusing now on the medical treatment area and I want to distinguish how uniquely Massachusetts has treated only the minor who has the status of being unmarried and who wants the treatment of abortion."
1978.78-329,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2884.213,2891.37,"It treats unmarried minors differently from married minors in many, many other different ways, doesn't it?"
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,2891.37,2892.198,"It does, Your Honor."
1978.78-329,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2892.198,2895.632,"The very concept of emancipation does so, does it not?"
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,2895.632,2916.558,"That does, Your Honor, and emancipation has now been statutorily codified so that, if I may turn to the third case of the minor who wants any form of medical treatment whatever other than abortion from plastic surgery to amputation, she may obtain that in one out of three ways, all of which are more liberal than what the unmarried minor wanting an abortion uniquely faces."
1978.78-329,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2953.804,2963.219,"Mr. Henn, if these are all equal protection arguments, as I understand it, the remedy for that I suppose would be to enjoin the enforcement of the statute to the extent that there's any disparity."
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,2968.827,2985.361,"In response to that and in response to your earlier question to Mr. Balliro with respect to preservations of some portion of the statute, we suggest the statute cannot be preserved, first, for the reason my brother already mentioned, namely that the State Court has authoritatively spoken as to the legislative intent."
1978.78-329,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3021.646,3026.757,"Well, I suppose the doctors have to make that precise judgment in the non-abortionary in the cases you just described."
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,3026.757,3033.425,"They do -- they do, Your Honor, but they do only with respect to exposure to a potential battery suit in connection with an immature minor."
1978.78-329,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3086.717,3095.663,"Your argument is that it's irrational, or close to that, for the legislature to say that the abortion decision is different from these other medical decisions."
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,3095.663,3101.295,"It -- that is, in terms of all of the range of other abortion decisions, it is -- it's probably even irrational --"
1978.78-329,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3101.295,3107.784,"No, you are saying the distinction between abortions and other medical procedures where only one parental -- consent of only parent is required."
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,3107.784,3108.619,We suggest that --
1978.78-329,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3108.619,3113.851,That there is -- the legislature could not rationally consider one of those decisions more serious than the other.
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,3113.851,3131.08,"I think the test would be a test of more heightened scrutiny, namely the significant state interest test, but I think it -- think it is even irrational to single abortion out where there is still a system which provides substantially the same kind of protection for minors who at least are incapable of making decisions."
1978.78-329,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3140.236,3144.846,"But I was focusing on the cases outside the common law rule, those where you do not have a mature minor."
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,3145.786,3147.155,Those cases --
1978.78-329,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3147.155,3147.399,That you have --
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,3147.399,3149.35,"But, the two common law rules, Your Honor."
1978.78-329,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3152.079,3156.284,"Well, let's take the case of the minor who is not a mature minor."
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,3156.284,3156.724,Correct.
1978.78-329,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3156.724,3163.32,"There, on the -- your argument is that, in medical procedures other than abortion, the consent of one parent is sufficient and whereas --"
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,3163.32,3163.626,Correct.
1978.78-329,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3163.626,3165.783,"And, whereas, consent of two parents is required in an abortion case."
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,3165.783,3166.37,In this case.
1978.78-329,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3166.37,3175.519,"And, you're saying there is no valid distinction between abortions and other medical procedures that would justify a difference in the kind of parental consent required."
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,3175.519,3190.447,"That's -- there, at least, is no significant state interest in that distinction because the two-parent consent rule here is not only intermently burdensome in itself, adding an additional consent requirement, but it triggers the minor's exposure to all the other burdens of the statute."
1978.78-329,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3223.836,3278.951,"Mr. Henn, it may -- probably is not terribly important, but I wonder if either in presentations to the legislature on the arguments in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts there was any -- discretion of any kind about the predicament of the physician who performs the abortion after this Supreme Judicial Court decision, assuming it is sustained, who is later confronted with a malpractice suit or a battery suit by a 14-year-old or 15-year-old girl after she's matured several years later on the grounds that she was incapable of giving consent and, therefore, it would be a battery, in most states, if there was no adequate consent?"
1978.78-329,3,30827,john_h_henn,,3278.951,3303.971,"Well, if Section 12 (s) were invalidated, I think -- in other words, if the District Court opinion in this case were upheld, then I think the physician would have a good faith defense under the, I believe, third paragraph of Section 12 (f) which, in my view, ought to apply which would provide a good faith defense either if he was reasonably mislead by the minor as to her competence or mislead as to her age."
1978.78-329,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3566.893,3567.553,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
