2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.522,"We'll hear argument next in Case 11-460, Los Angeles Flood Control District v. The Natural Resources Defense Council."
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,10.539,13.558,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-460,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,83.32,88.439,So why don't we just remand and let it sort it out under the right understanding of the legal rule?
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,99.08,99.63,--Correct.
2012.11-460,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,121.529,122.145,Everybody agrees.
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,122.145,122.979,--Correct.
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,146.977,150.798,"Well, it seems to me that they present a very direct syllogism."
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,163.106,166.408,"Well, because the nature of the monitoring here."
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,180.918,181.284,Right.
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,206.266,210.253,"Well, I think, again, the rules say that you look at the permit's terms to interpret it."
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,222.811,226.862,"Well, you don't -- you don't question that there was an actual discharge."
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,230.25,230.683,--Correct.
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,231.316,232.433,"So there are discharges, right?"
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,232.433,235.368,"--But not discharges of pollutants, and that's what's reported."
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,235.368,247.026,"You don't dispute that there was at least some small amount of pollutant, even below the permit level, from your point sources, do you?"
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,247.026,247.843,"Well, we don't know that."
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,249.278,254.866,"Well, I'm asking you whether -- I mean, isn't it -- doesn't common sense suggest -- you have asked in your permit for a limit on how much of a--"
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,254.866,255.382,--Sure.
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,255.382,258.401,--particular pollutant you can discharge.
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,258.401,259.084,"But, again--"
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,259.084,261.62,You wouldn't do that unless you expected to discharge some.
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,261.62,261.92,--Right.
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,270.625,277.195,"Well, why did you put the monitoring sources where they are if that wasn't what was going to measure your compliance with the permit?"
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,277.195,285.301,"Because you're required, in a system-wide permit like this, to suggest -- to propose monitoring which is subject to the approval of the regulatory agency."
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,293.324,304.215,"Well, the Government says that that question -- you're saying, I understand, there are other discharges -- well, you're by far the dominant discharger, but I understand there are others, and they may contribute as well to what the monitoring station says."
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,316.606,324.11,"Well, except for the fact that the permit terms themselves say that each permittee is only responsible for its own discharge."
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,338.903,339.722,Where is that?
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,342.424,343.14,Let's see.
2012.11-460,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,348.327,350.543,What page again?
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,350.543,358.516,"Volume I of the Joint Appendix, page 93, and it's the fourth paragraph."
2012.11-460,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,366.039,379.347,"Suppose that the district has 85 percent of the water by volume that's put into this river, and then you have this high pollution index."
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,383.751,389.368,It's just irrelevant unless you show that in that bulk of water there is a higher concentration of pollutants.
2012.11-460,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,404.414,405.93,"Well, I have one different question."
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,433.397,437.301,I don't believe so.
2012.11-460,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,439.051,439.837,Would there be any--
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,439.837,444.055,--imagine circumstances where you create an outfall unintentionally by -- by funneling.
2012.11-460,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,459.565,462.084,"--And that's -- that's a separate part of the statute, nonpoint source pollutions."
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,462.084,471.272,"Well, it doesn't sound like, you know, the -- the way it's defined under 1362 is a, you know, like, enclosed conveyance that -- that discharges--"
2012.11-460,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,471.272,472.808,"Well, that's not in this case."
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,472.808,473.441,"--Yes, that's not in this case."
2012.11-460,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,473.841,475.676,"It was just a background, background question for you."
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,475.676,479.628,"--Yes, but I think that that -- that probably wouldn't be a discharge from a point source."
2012.11-460,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,479.628,482.247,"Mr. Coates, I am -- I am still perplexed."
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,482.247,482.714,Yes.
2012.11-460,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,482.714,507.162,"You say, and it seems to be correct, that each -- each alleged polluter is only responsible for his own pollution, but you also say that these monitors are so situated that it is impossible to tell from the monitor who is responsible for the pollution."
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,510.031,512.649,"I think that -- I think that is right, but you look for the--"
2012.11-460,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,512.649,513.733,So whose fault is that?
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,513.733,530.028,"--Well, the reason why, the reason why that that's there, is to measure essentially the health of these rivers so that you can fine tune the MS4 permit, the systemwide permit, and so that you can gauge general water quality standards, and if necessary you can fine tune it to try and measure individual permittees."
2012.11-460,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,549.739,552.274,What -- what it is -- what is it that provides for that?
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,552.274,553.441,There is a renewed permit.
2012.11-460,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,580.008,582.377,So this was a regulatory void?
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,582.377,583.51,This was a--
2012.11-460,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,583.51,590.781,A regulatory void that these -- that there was no requirement previously that you monitor the outfalls?
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,590.781,593.416,"--Monitoring, correct, that there be specific outfall monitoring."
2012.11-460,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,594.133,599.803,"So how do you envision this permit was -- by the way, just one side question and then to this one."
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,609.945,610.495,--That is correct.
2012.11-460,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,610.495,612.48,So it has resolved this issue.
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,612.48,613.997,It has resolved this issue.
2012.11-460,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,613.997,614.597,All right.
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,619.716,620.566,Yes.
2012.11-460,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,620.566,625.287,"But putting that aside, how do you think the system was supposed to work before?"
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,625.287,626.287,Well--
2012.11-460,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,626.287,636.678,"Did you have any obligation, once you saw the excess pollutants, to start the reiteration process to try to figure out who was the cause of this?"
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,636.678,653.807,"--Well, if they attribute a -- a violation to a particular permittee -- for example, the district court noted and the Ninth Circuit re-emphasized that you could at least, if you wanted to try and hook it to a single permittee, you could at least try and sample at an outfall for that permittee and then provide evidence that that contributed to exceedances."
2012.11-460,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,656.676,658.441,You mean the Respondents could have done that here?
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,658.441,659.524,The Respondents could have done that here.
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,663.142,668.879,So what -- what percentage of discharges come from you as opposed to the other members of the MS4--
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,668.879,670.346,We have -- we have the most infrastructure.
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,676.569,676.952,--Give me an estimate?
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,676.952,679.771,"--You know, I can't in terms of total water volume."
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,698.898,703.469,What -- what goes into these discharges besides the rainwater runoff?
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,703.469,704.419,Here it's just stormwater.
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,704.419,704.852,Okay.
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,704.852,707.171,"I mean, a municipal separate storm sewer system--"
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,707.171,720.848,"So your -- your hypothesis is in some of these minority dischargers, that for some reason their rainwater would have a different amount of pollutants than your rainwater?"
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,720.848,724.132,"--Well, they could -- they could very well have storm discharge different."
2012.11-460,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,748.462,748.862,I'm sorry--
2012.11-460,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.862,765.34,"Was the Ninth Circuit's error -- was the Ninth Circuit's error here a factual one, because it was based on the location of the stations, or was it a legal one because it misinterpreted our Miccosukee case?"
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,765.34,766.69,It -- it's a legal one.
2012.11-460,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,822.094,825.462,You just said there were polluters upstream.
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,828.998,830.364,There are -- there are--
2012.11-460,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,830.364,833.902,"--or industrial facilities, are they within your MS4?"
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,833.902,835.135,--They are not.
2012.11-460,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,837.02,841.888,But what you're saying is that there are outfalls from different people into the same river.
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,841.888,842.388,Correct.
2012.11-460,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,843.354,843.604,All right.
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,848.472,851.674,"Correct, because they are all upstream of the monitoring station."
2012.11-460,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,851.674,852.141,Okay.
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,891.918,892.418,That's correct.
2012.11-460,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,892.418,893.168,Okay.
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,893.168,893.668,That's correct.
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,895.303,895.803,Okay.
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,897.819,899.005,Excuse me?
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,899.005,901.021,Where is that requirement that you're now doing?
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,901.021,906.909,"We, in our reply brief we cite the fact that a -- a -- the permit has just been renewed."
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,915.966,917.149,So you are not doing it now?
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,917.149,919.918,We are not doing it now.
2012.11-460,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,962.995,967.565,Is it your position that the rivers -- the two rivers in question are outside the MS4?
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,973.303,983.325,We have -- in the lower courts the district personnel refer to the channelized portion as part of our MS4 because it's all flood control to us.
2012.11-460,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1012.178,1018.332,What was the purpose of having the monitoring station if nothing can be done?
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1053.005,1061.444,"Well, again, the Water Act makes you responsible for a discharge in violation of permit terms, so you have to have a discharge by the permittee."
2012.11-460,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1202.982,1220.21,"Is -- is your description of the statute meant to conclude, or does it -- does it conclude, that these outsource monitoring stations which exist under the new permit are not really required?"
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1220.21,1227.466,"Well, not necessarily statutorily required, but they are part of the permit, yes."
2012.11-460,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1229.866,1230.384,"Oh, I understood that."
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1230.801,1231.334,--We've agreed--
2012.11-460,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.334,1234.12,Can you put in the permit stuff that the statute does not require?
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1234.12,1236.655,"--Well, you can -- I think you can agree to terms in a permit, yes."
2012.11-460,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.655,1237.072,Okay.
2012.11-460,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1237.072,1237.555,Yeah.
2012.11-460,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1240.607,1241.892,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1253.699,1256.433,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-460,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1301.18,1308.168,"Mr. Shah, what about the problem that one of the amici brought up concerning dredged material?"
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1330.081,1330.649,Right.
2012.11-460,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1368.456,1370.158,"Counsel, tell me why remand?"
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1440.505,1444.54,"Justice Sotomayor, I agree with your reading of both opinions below."
2012.11-460,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1464.203,1464.586,How would it--
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1464.586,1465.419,--that it had before it.
2012.11-460,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1465.419,1467.019,--what could it do differently?
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1467.019,1484.131,"I think, in particular, the Ninth Circuit construed this permit on the understanding that there was a discharge of polluted water after it flowed past the monitoring station and said that the district could be liable based simply on the exceedance measured by the mass emission station alone."
2012.11-460,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1484.131,1493.319,How does that change the answer to the legal question that the permittee -- both courts have said the permittee is only liable for their own discharges.
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1504.794,1505.477,"Well, it--"
2012.11-460,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1505.477,1507.913,--how can that alone establish liability?
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1507.913,1525.041,"--Well, again, I think the Ninth Circuit predicated its permit interpretation on the understanding that there would be at least some way to hold a permittee -- in this case, the district -- liable based on the mass emission exceedance alone, and that's because it misapprehended that there would be a discharge of flow of the polluted water."
2012.11-460,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1544.538,1550.775,So -- so -- so what follows from that; that the district is liable because it's a lousy permit?
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1550.775,1552.958,"Well, Your Honor, if--"
2012.11-460,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1552.958,1571.188,"I do not see how this court -- how the -- how the court of appeals is going to be able to do anything different other than say there's no liability here, unless, of course, it adopts another fanciful interpretation of the statute, which is something I worry about."
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1571.188,1577.425,"--Well, Your Honor, we think that this permit -- again, the terms of this permit are both complex and ambiguous."
2012.11-460,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1589.483,1596.804,"I -- I agree with that, but how can this permit possibly be interpreted in such a way as to hold a district liable?"
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1596.804,1613.848,"--Well, I think the most persuasive -- and, again, we don't take a firm position on this, but I think the most persuasive argument on the other side would be that when permit writers issue a permit, they -- they assume that the permitting regime provided in the permit would provide a basis to seek enforcement of that permit."
2012.11-460,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1614.732,1616.3,"They would assume that; but, if it doesn't, it doesn't."
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1616.3,1617.15,--Well--
2012.11-460,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.15,1618.117,So what do you do if it doesn't?
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1618.117,1627.858,"--Well, one could imagine a regime where the permittees, that is, the municipalities who apply for a joint permit, would agree to a shared presumption of liability."
2012.11-460,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1629.292,1630.477,They have -- they have not agreed.
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1630.477,1631.927,"--Well, again, we don't--"
2012.11-460,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1631.927,1634.096,So you're going to impose a shared thing?
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1643.951,1650.788,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think it's a cert-worthy issue, how to interpret the terms of this specific -- this is a fairly--"
2012.11-460,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1650.788,1659.829,"But, anyway, you say that the court held the same thing in two other cases involving two other rivers, and they didn't cross-appeal from that, and so that issue isn't really in front of us."
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1659.829,1660.963,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2012.11-460,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1660.963,1665.567,"And if they did hold what you said, then they'd have to reopen the other two cases."
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1665.567,1665.9,--Right.
2012.11-460,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1676.506,1677.039,Okay.
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1684.528,1684.994,"Well, Your Honor--"
2012.11-460,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1684.994,1686.396,It's that issue that what we have to decide.
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1686.396,1698.038,"--Your Honor, it's established that this Court -- even if a cross-petition were required, it's established that this Court has the authority to remand for disposition of any further issues once a case comes before this Court."
2012.11-460,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1699.054,1701.656,Why should we in light of the clarity of the permit?
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1703.942,1704.342,--Sure.
2012.11-460,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.381,1722.403,But that is not our ordinary practice when nothing can happen on remand except -- except to give judgment for the Petitioner here.
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1722.403,1728.473,"Well, I think it would be unusual for the Court to reverse and then instruct that judgment be entered in favor of Petitioner."
2012.11-460,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1736.211,1743.317,"Sometimes the Court says in the bottom line in that italicized thing, which I've never fully understood when and when we don't do it, but it just says “ Reversed ”."
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1743.317,1744.1,Right.
2012.11-460,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1744.1,1746.519,And then sometimes it says “ it is so ordered ”.
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1762.712,1763.73,Right.
2012.11-460,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1768.248,1770.467,Doesn't that always say that in the judgment of the Court?
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1770.467,1772.752,"--Doesn't it always say what, Your Honor?"
2012.11-460,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1772.752,1774.954,Does it say “ It is so ordered ” in the judgment that we release?
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1774.954,1775.354,"Yes, yes."
2012.11-460,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1781.775,1805.24,"Mr. Shah, am I right about that this other theory, if it were open to the Ninth Circuit, would apply equally to the other rivers that Justice Breyer mentioned, and those were out of the case because when it got to the Ninth Circuit we were talking about only the Los Angeles and the San Gabriel?"
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1805.24,1806.757,"That's right, Your Honor."
2012.11-460,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1806.757,1811.044,That -- that other theory would apply to all four.
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1811.044,1817.798,I -- I think that is correct and the Ninth Circuit may decide that therefore it's not going to revisit its permit interpretation.
2012.11-460,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1825.387,1830.958,The reason it would not look at Malibu and -- what's the other one that we're already--
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1830.958,1831.591,The other watershed.
2012.11-460,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1831.591,1835.993,"--Yes, would be because it wouldn't comply with the cross-petition rule."
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1835.993,1836.41,No.
2012.11-460,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1836.41,1837.945,We're are not going to send it back to them to--
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1837.945,1838.629,I'm sorry.
2012.11-460,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1855.073,1857.692,--Do -- do you have a position on the cross-petition issue?
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1857.692,1859.442,"No, Your Honor, we do not."
2012.11-460,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1859.442,1860.308,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-460,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1860.308,1860.81,Thank you.
2012.11-460,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1860.81,1875.987,Mr. Colangelo.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,1875.987,1877.954,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-460,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1896.817,1898.769,"Well, where is the permit's own terms?"
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,1908.875,1914.195,"Your Honor, let me point you to three provisions in the permit that, taken together, compel this result."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.591,1961.426,Wait.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,1980.887,1981.387,--Correct.
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.387,1982.006,So you got more--
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,1982.006,1983.023,"Yes, You Honor."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.023,1984.791,--more besides 195.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,1984.791,1989.743,"Well, and what 195 adds is it says any violation is grounds for enforcement action."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2041.462,2044.997,"Of course, the very first step is A,"
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2066.577,2067.945,"--That's -- that's incorrect, Your Honor."
2012.11-460,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2089.359,2094.096,"But as I read it and he explained it, I thought that, look, what they're thinking is this."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2156.837,2158.622,"There are two answers to that, Your Honor."
2012.11-460,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2222.611,2229.782,"But how do -- the district is a big contributor, but there are other contributors."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2240.09,2247.744,"Your Honor, the permit includes a blueprint that sorts that out, and it parallels the traditional notion of several liability."
2012.11-460,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2253.398,2256.183,But you still have to show that there is a contributor.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2272.478,2279.198,"--It can be, Your Honor, and that's the -- that's the solution that the permit works out and that the permittees negotiated for in advance."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2279.198,2281.281,"What's the third section, Mr. Colangelo?"
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2284.416,2285.852,"The third, Your Honor--"
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2285.852,2286.835,I've got 195.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2288.637,2290.82,"--The third, Your Honor, is JA 109."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2290.82,2291.589,109.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2291.589,2294.874,And this parallels a provision in EPA's regulations.
2012.11-460,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2344.806,2368.672,"Looking at 109, it strikes me as a little bit circular to say they have the responsibility to carry out inspection and surveillance and monitoring to ensure compliance with the permit; and, their point is, well, we're not -- we're not not in compliance with the permit because you haven't -- there hasn't been an allocation of the discharges to them."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2368.672,2376.076,"Well, and the problem with that, Your Honor, is that it leads to no liability ever for the discharger, even though it concedes--"
2012.11-460,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2376.076,2382.848,"Well, I think that might be -- I think that might be right, but that gets back to the question of whether the permit is -- is poorly drafted."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2382.848,2383.331,--Right.
2012.11-460,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2383.331,2388.133,And I guess the idea is they're changing the permit so to cure that problem.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2388.133,2390.185,The permit has changed.
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.273,2402.077,"Well, why -- why do you need that if -- if the present permit covers it as clearly as you say?"
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2404.845,2406.131,--That is absolutely--
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.131,2411.183,"My goodness, you're going to go through all of this how many -- how long did it take you to challenge this, and blah, blah, blah, blah."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2416.32,2418.272,--The present permit is adequate.
2012.11-460,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2431.912,2438.5,"Well, wouldn't you still -- I'm not clear if you gave me an answer to how the district share would be determined."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2445.089,2446.839,"No, Your Honor."
2012.11-460,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2455.962,2458.73,So how do we find out what is its part -- what is its share?
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2458.73,2460.349,--The permit sets that out.
2012.11-460,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2479.243,2480.845,Is that the 109 language you cite?
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2480.845,2481.362,"No, Your Honor."
2012.11-460,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2486.333,2487.483,Okay.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2513.316,2514.783,"No, not at all, Your Honor."
2012.11-460,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2557.095,2559.279,"Well, this is all fine and good."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2568.135,2574.022,"Your Honor, the relief we seek would not expand the judgment below because the two rivers on which we lost are out of the case."
2012.11-460,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2574.022,2582.545,"Well, I understand that, but -- it seems reasonable, but they do cite a lot of cases that say you can't do that."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2588.364,2591.65,"Accepting this argument, Your Honor, would not change the judgment."
2012.11-460,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2609.378,2618.151,Why was it giving up -- you're giving up on the two rivers even though your theory would work the same way with respect to them?
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2618.151,2619.17,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-460,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2629.275,2646.087,"But do you think that the trial court was wrong, the district court was wrong, and the Ninth Circuit, both times, when they said, well, you didn't prove -- there was no proof that the district was responsible for a given part."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2650.939,2652.641,"--On that legal question, Your Honor, yes."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2702.824,2707.459,"Mr. Colangelo, did you raise this argument in your brief in opposition?"
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2707.459,2708.576,"Yes, Your Honor, we did."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2708.576,2710.11,Where is it in that?
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2711.679,2720.951,"It's in two places in the brief in opposition; page 4 to 5, where we set out this compliance monitoring framework, and page 18 to 19."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2720.951,2726.32,"That may be, but you don't support -- and page what?"
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2726.32,2727.839,Page 18 to 19.
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2731.391,2735.795,But you don't--
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2735.795,2736.428,At the cert stage.
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2736.428,2742.715,--you don't say that that's the basis for supporting the decision below.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2744.317,2751.304,"We do -- let me just quote what may be the most explicit thing, Your Honor, which is at the very bottom of page 4 in our supplemental brief at the cert stage:"
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2767.766,2774.753,I don't have your supplemental brief in front of me.
2012.11-460,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2774.753,2779.222,Where on 4 to 5?
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2779.222,2783.776,"--At the very bottom of page 4, the last two lines, and the top of page 5."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2804.355,2813.561,"Well, but that's just to say you can rely on -- on the extant monitors."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2813.561,2814.645,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2815.747,2817.413,"So you say, you know, they were correct."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2832.173,2842.064,"--Your Honor, that was the -- that was our argument in the Ninth Circuit and at the cert stage, and that -- we do lay out exactly how the permit works."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2846.282,2849.301,"You -- you told this to the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit said no?"
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2849.301,2850.251,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-460,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2857.407,2862.126,"Counsel, suppose we did what the -- the Solicitor General says to do and vacated this."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2878.487,2890.811,"--There is one reason, Your Honor, and that is that a permit is interpreted like a contract, and it is a cardinal rule of contract interpretation that a contract should be read where -- where possible to be both lawful and enforceable."
2012.11-460,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2940.478,2951.369,Why is there no -- where do I look to find out that the district is making a discharge of polluted water other than under the Ninth Circuit's theory that it's in the river itself?
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2951.369,2952.436,"Two places, Your Honor."
2012.11-460,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2979.269,2996.897,"So is your theory that if the district is permitted to, on a scale of 1 to 10, to discharge up to 2, but that if the monitoring station in the river shows an 8, then it is automatically liable for the increase, even though other dischargees might have made this?"
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,2996.897,2999.016,"--Yes, yes, because--"
2012.11-460,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2999.016,3000.516,I don't get that from what you have read.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3001.384,3003.684,"--Your Honor, because--"
2012.11-460,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3003.684,3006.77,--the text you've read and it looks to me like it's permittee by permittee.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3006.77,3010.074,"--It says that the MS4 is in violation, that's correct."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3026.417,3026.934,Finish that.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3028.786,3029.619,--I'm sorry?
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3029.619,3031.488,Therefore each one of them is liable for all of it?
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3031.488,3032.354,"No, no, Your Honor."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3040.759,3041.793,But they haven't done so.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3042.076,3057.419,"So that's a permit violation, and result is that this pollution continues year after year after year, when the point of the permit and the point of the Clean Water Act was to eliminate what everybody agrees is the biggest source of water pollution in Southern California."
2012.11-460,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3057.419,3069.41,"So if each permittee is allowed to put in a 2, but one permittee puts in an 8; then both permittees are liable?"
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3069.41,3070.51,"Correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-460,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3075.214,3077.749,"No, no, we now know the facts because it's the hypothetical."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3077.749,3078.082,Okay.
2012.11-460,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3109.369,3116.624,"Are the provisions -- excuse me, the provisions we've been talking about, the three that you cited and the one that your -- are they boilerplate?"
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3120.242,3132.067,"Well, 109, the fact that the permittees must conduct all monitoring to demonstrate compliance, if “ boilerplate ” means that they are in all permits, then yes, because that's a requirement of EPA regulations."
2012.11-460,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3132.067,3132.5,Yes.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3138.454,3140.59,"That's from a EPA regulation, too, yes."
2012.11-460,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3179.965,3186.285,"So your basic argument is this permit requires you, L.A. County, to do monitoring to decide if you're violating it."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3191.773,3192.173,Yes.
2012.11-460,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3192.173,3200.461,"--in the other two rivers, so now you're going to go back if we permit it, and you want to make the argument and tell the Ninth Circuit: Three times and you're out; in this case, hold the opposite."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3200.461,3201.228,Well -- yes.
2012.11-460,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3203.913,3204.38,I understand it.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3205.065,3209.217,"--But correct, the lower court did not -- neither lower court accepted this argument fully."
2012.11-460,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3243.307,3245.14,Couldn't you get some expert who--
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3245.14,3250.627,"Well, we did, Your Honor, in district court as an alternative theory have an expert who said all of this came from them."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3256.198,3262.369,"I don't understand why you didn't cross-appeal on -- on this theory that, that the lower court rejected."
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3262.369,3265.654,"Because, Your Honor, we were satisfied with the judgment; and that's the rule."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3269.875,3270.791,I didn't say you need to.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3284.217,3289.186,--And the reason it would not be expanding the judgment below is that we are on the opposite side of what happened in Kent.
2012.11-460,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3314.57,3316.772,I just don't remember now.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3326.377,3326.761,No.
2012.11-460,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3361.55,3361.767,--I see.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3371.44,3375.042,"Your Honor, we would be most satisfied with an affirmance on the grounds we have presented."
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3379.679,3386.333,"What if this panel found -- found for you on the ground that they used; they will surely find for you on this other ground, which--"
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3386.9,3387.535,--Yes.
2012.11-460,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3388.535,3390.737,--which has at least an inkling of plausibility.
2012.11-460,2,15732,aaron_colangelo,,3390.737,3392.237,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.11-460,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3392.737,3393.522,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-460,3,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3399.224,3400.46,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.11-460,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3442.437,3443.12,Let me ask a quick question.
2012.11-460,3,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3443.12,3443.437,Sure.
2012.11-460,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3443.437,3451.042,Does it satisfy you if we just write in the judgment what you -- we usually write and you can all argue what it means below?
2012.11-460,3,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3455.762,3460.298,It -- it's -- it's acceptable because a reversal is always better than an affirmance.
2012.11-460,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3509.897,3517.337,"Did we use our usual language, and did it go back, and the -- and the court of appeals considered--"
2012.11-460,3,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3517.337,3517.67,"--I think in one of the cases, the Court--"
2012.11-460,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3517.67,3519.637,--considered the issue we had refused to consider?
2012.11-460,3,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3519.637,3522.205,"--In one of the cases, the Court simply affirmed, and so it didn't go anywhere."
2012.11-460,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3522.205,3523.122,Okay.
2012.11-460,3,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3523.122,3523.623,But--
2012.11-460,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3523.623,3527.275,Don't we have two -- I don't know that we do this all the time.
2012.11-460,3,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3535.131,3541.285,"--Well, I do know that in the context of a lot of the Court's opinions, the Court will specify that judgment be granted in terms of a party."
2012.11-460,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3584.779,3585.564,But they might change their mind now.
2012.11-460,3,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3586.831,3594.253,--It would be a very odd judgment because you'd have two claims that are -- continue to be dismissed that are not properly before any court.
2012.11-460,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3622.67,3626.206,"Well, I understand, and you do cite a lot of cases for that, but I can't figure out what sense it makes."
2012.11-460,3,42553,timothy_t_coates,,3634.562,3636.597,"Well, the Court does it for two reasons."
2012.11-460,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3684.645,3685.645,"Thank you, counsel."
