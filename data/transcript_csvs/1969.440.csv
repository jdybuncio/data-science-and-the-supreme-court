1969.440,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.872,"Number 448, the National Labor Relations Board against Raytheon Company."
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,27.872,29.807,"Mr. Chief Justice, and the Court please."
1969.440,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,29.807,31.691,"Mr. Kleindiesnt, you may proceed."
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,31.691,36.707,This case comes of the Court on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
1969.440,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,192.085,197.759,Does the record show Mr. Kleindienst whether the union's votes increased or decreased?
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,199.871,204.085,I believe my recollection of record is that the union's votes decreased.
1969.440,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,204.085,204.621,Decreased?
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,204.621,213.304,"Yeah, that the union's position became stronger in the situation that I -- it's in the record here but that's my recollection of it."
1969.440,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,219.386,240.398,"Well, if their votes -- if their total ballot decreased as each election went on it might suggest some relationship between the companies the continuing impact, the continuing effect of the companies at a union activities would it not?"
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,240.398,241.448,That could possibly be it but I think --
1969.440,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,241.448,243.208,At least it's an arguable connection?
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,243.208,251.202,"Possibly but there's so many other factors that could occur, turnover employees, other conduct the issues raised in the election."
1969.440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,268.0,272.256,Does the record show -- since you are already been interrupted.
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,276.389,284.076,"No, and I don't believe that any inference can be gained from this record as to the fact that it was set aside."
1969.440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,302.342,302.93,Thank you.
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,302.93,304.755,In the part of the company.
1969.440,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,832.181,849.226,"But you, Mr. Attorney General, you seem to agree that if a Court determined there is no really substantial chance of the conduct ever being repeated that it could be dismissed as a moot."
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,849.226,852.231,"Yes, either Jones & Laughlin Steel case of 1936."
1969.440,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,852.231,874.351,"So this is just really amongst to us a sort of the fact bound case then the here -- you just want us to disagree with the judgment of the Court of Appeals that this conduct contrary to their taking really, really might occur again."
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,874.351,877.361,"I don't think the Court of Appeals really went into that question, Mr. Justice White."
1969.440,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,877.361,881.075,You think they applied the wrong standard or any standard at all?
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,881.075,894.01,"I don't believe they applied in a standard at all, if they been aware of the Mexia case of this Court when it came down with the General Engineering case in 1962, I don't think they would have ever arrived at that result."
1969.440,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,894.01,902.121,What you're saying is we should vacate the judgment and have them reconsidered under the right standard?
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,902.121,930.207,"In my opinion, what should be done is to vacate the act of the Court of Appeals, send it back to it, have it determine the unfair labor practice on the merits and the record consider just a whole and as a matter of law, and then get the Court of Appeals which I wouldn't expect it to do but I came forth with an erroneous application of the law or exercise of its discretionary power, you'd have something before this Court of some substance in merit."
1969.440,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,930.207,947.335,"But I suppose that certain unfair labor practice could be so tied to a particular election like for example within the first election, they had a poll watch or something that they shouldn't have."
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,948.431,961.649,"Well Mr. Justice White, that raise is a good point because not all conduct that the Board looks that as being improper conduct at the time of the election constitutes with unfair labor practice."
1969.440,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,961.649,962.649,"Well, I agree, I agree."
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,962.649,964.816,-- like the 24-hour rule for instance.
1969.440,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,964.816,970.369,And also I suppose there's some kind of conduct in connection with the election that no reasonable man would take whatever be repeated.
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,970.369,971.276,Right.
1969.440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1094.212,1103.034,Of course Section 10 (e) of the Act does give to the Court of Appeals a very great deal of discretion as to what they shall do in response to the enforcement proceeding.
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,1103.034,1104.211,Yes.
1969.440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1104.211,1147.199,"And do we both know that the Court of Appeals like other courts are overburdened with a great deal of work, and as I gather it's your adversary's position that while and it's almost one of confession and avoid this file perhaps moot is the wrong word here and nonetheless Section 10 (e) does not absolutely require in the Court of Appeals to give full consideration on the merits to every single enforcement petition and here in this particular case that there was perfectly good reason for them to exercise the flexibility conferred on the Court of Appeals by Section 10 (e) to simply watch this case out."
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,1147.199,1149.12,I respectfully disagree with that --
1969.440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1149.12,1150.407,"Well, I gather you do."
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,1150.407,1154.993,"Mr. Justice, I'd like to quote from your recent decision."
1969.440,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1162.727,1165.594,"No, I joined in the opinion of this Court. (Voice Overlap)"
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,1165.594,1198.827,"This Court stated in there that the remedial power of the Board is a broad discretionary one subject to limited judicial review and let me just indicate the facts of that case, that was a backpay case where the Court of Appeals going to cut off part of that backpay award because the Board then there like in this duty the properly process and Mr. Justice Marshall, I think appropriately planned out of this act is for the benefit of employees, and not for the benefit of the Board or an employer with respect to the backpay orders."
1969.440,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1242.459,1262.562,"But Mr. Attorney General, if in effects there is to be an open end injunction which is what this amounts to, it gives the Court with continuing contempt powers, there ought to be some pretty clear guidelines as to how to define a continuing impact, is that not so?"
1969.440,0,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,1262.562,1265.814,"I think it pretty well pleases itself, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.440,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1320.938,1321.499,Thank you.
1969.440,1,19878,charles_h_resnick,,1327.647,1329.703,May it please the Court.
1969.440,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1347.003,1347.678,More favorable.
1969.440,1,19878,charles_h_resnick,,1347.678,1348.475,More favorable.
1969.440,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1363.533,1374.849,"Well, perhaps the Attorney General was correct that it's -- that you can't give it much weight to one way or the other but it seems to me as practical matter if you were to give it any weight."
1969.440,1,19878,charles_h_resnick,,1384.757,1387.315,"I fully concur with that, Your Honor."
1969.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1586.539,1587.613,"Oh, what laughter?"
1969.440,1,19878,charles_h_resnick,,1587.613,1590.122,Laughter from the audience.
1969.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1754.572,1759.921,How recent was that earlier decision of General Engineering decision?
1969.440,1,19878,charles_h_resnick,,1759.921,1762.782,"General Engineering was decided 1962, Your Honor."
1969.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1762.782,1765.308,"So, it was well-known long before this --"
1969.440,1,19878,charles_h_resnick,,1765.308,1765.789,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.440,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1765.789,1766.52,-- the case arose.
1969.440,1,19878,charles_h_resnick,,1776.429,1778.225,"That's a good question, Your Honor."
1969.440,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.627,2337.366,"Mr. Resnick, what's the consequence of holding an issue moot in a situation like this, does the Board adjudication stand?"
1969.440,1,19878,charles_h_resnick,,2337.366,2337.916,"No, Your Honor."
1969.440,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.575,2343.183,"Well, no enforcement but the Board has issued a final order."
1969.440,1,19878,charles_h_resnick,,2343.183,2345.258,I supposed the order would nonetheless stand.
1969.440,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.809,2350.904,And the finding of an unfair labor practice in connection of the representation proceeding would stand?
1969.440,1,19878,charles_h_resnick,,2350.904,2353.515,"I believe it would, Your Honor."
1969.440,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2353.515,2361.269,But that's not the way we ordinarily when we dispose -- something is moved to ordinarily we like to sweep clean them around back.
1969.440,1,19878,charles_h_resnick,,2364.249,2376.532,"We don't view this as the is the classical case of mootness, Your Honor, but only as mootness being in a shorthand term here for the Court deciding that the case was so little remaining significance that that the petition to be dismiss."
1969.440,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2376.532,2379.459,And what about enforcement?
1969.440,1,19878,charles_h_resnick,,2385.698,2387.922,"It was not reversed, no, Your Honor."
1969.440,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2387.922,2406.799,"You haven't yet made an argument that courts ought to be very careful about having a prior restraint on First Amendment -- exercise of the First Amendment rights, speaking to their employees."
1969.440,1,19878,charles_h_resnick,,2406.799,2412.871,"Your Honor, I feel very strongly and we argue that positions strenuously to the Court of Appeals below."
1969.440,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2460.894,2462.723,Thank you Mr. Resnick.
1969.440,2,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,2466.742,2472.745,I won't burden the Court with more than just a couple of minutes as the Chief Justice please.
1969.440,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2640.838,2663.489,"It would have some of the fact, would it not, Mr. Attorney General in the sense, I'm speaking now of the existence of the determination of an unfair labor practice that if a new complaint were issued on at a later time and the conduct was similar conduct the Board certainly would have its eye on the prior determination, it would have a carryover."
1969.440,2,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,2663.489,2664.669,"Yes, it would."
1969.440,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2676.601,2691.497,"Well, I'm speaking -- I'm on going on the assumption that there would be no continuing effect if the Ninth Circuit's judgment was left standing and you have no enforcement order."
1969.440,2,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,2697.045,2706.365,"Well, that might have some impact on the Board's decision and than you get into problems of whether or not improper inferences or illegal influences were drawn as the result of prior conduct."
1969.440,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2733.132,2752.254,That seems to me to be a little inconsistent with what you said earlier that you seem to concede that if the Court of Appeals had made the determination that there wasn't any substantial chance of any recurrence of this conduct that it could have reach properly refuse (Voice Overlap).
1969.440,2,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,2752.254,2757.109,"If you interpreted my remarks of saying that Mr. Justice White, I think you misunderstood me."
1969.440,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2766.3,2767.355,"Well, I certainly did."
1969.440,2,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,2767.355,2768.222,"Well, I'm sorry."
1969.440,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2768.222,2784.925,"You mean a Court -- a Court can find that in can be conceded by the union that no there's no -- really no substantial chance, no meaningful chance that this conduct will every reoccur?"
1969.440,2,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,2784.925,2786.329,I can take --
1969.440,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2786.329,2802.158,"And but nevertheless we insist that you adjudicate this -- adjudicate this unfair labor practice which will take you a lot of time and energy and then if you would agree with the Board, you must enter a cease-and-desist order?"
1969.440,2,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,2802.158,2806.938,"Oh, I agree with you that, Mr. Justice White but I do not believe that this is that kind of the case."
1969.440,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2806.938,2825.39,"Well, I know you and that's -- but that's another point of why should we -- you apparently take there is some standard by which of mootness or non-enforceability should be judged, and you -- at the very least you claim the Court of Appeals didn't apply it."
1969.440,2,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,2825.39,2826.343,Right.
1969.440,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2826.343,2835.0,"If there is that kind of a standard that didn't apply, why shouldn't that have the job of the not us of the first applying of the standard?"
1969.440,2,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,2835.0,2840.688,"Well, I think this Court has applied the standard generally, and I think the Ninth Circuit has misapplied it."
1969.440,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2847.065,2852.929,(Voice Overlap) the Court of Appeals that have job to doing in the first instance under the right standard?
1969.440,2,39661,richard_g_kleindienst,,2855.353,2856.061,I fully agree to that.
1969.440,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2862.772,2864.671,"Thank you, Mr. Attorney General."
