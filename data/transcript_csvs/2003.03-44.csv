2003.03-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.371,"We'll hear argument now in No. 03-44, Basim Omar Sabri v. the United States."
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,10.197,13.912,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,48.259,55.69,"Yet there's no doubt, Mr. Birrell, is there, that in some circumstances the statute could be constitutionally applied?"
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,55.69,74.432,"There are no circumstances where 66(a)(2)... 666(a)(2) could be constitutionally applied, Your Honor, because the... because the statute never requires that the jury find a connection between the Federal spending and the offense conduct."
2003.03-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,92.553,97.194,Why... why can't it be constitutional under the Commerce Clause?
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,126.611,128.097,"A couple things, Your Honor."
2003.03-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,135.239,136.642,That's not necessary.
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,144.238,152.579,"Well, if Congress could create commerce... Commerce Clause jurisdiction everywhere that it could spend money, then--"
2003.03-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,152.579,154.269,"No, no, not everywhere it could spend money."
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,172.762,182.05,--Because without... without a showing that in each case there was a connection between interstate commerce and the transaction--
2003.03-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,182.05,183.991,That's not what our cases require.
2003.03-44,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,183.991,189.73,Is that true of the drug statutes too?
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,189.73,191.876,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2003.03-44,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,191.876,200.709,"I mean, is it true whenever the Feds prosecute a person for a drug transaction, a jury has to determine there was a connection between these drugs and interstate commerce?"
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,216.153,223.416,"Well, unless... unless there was an understanding that in every instance there was an effect on interstate commerce, then--"
2003.03-44,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,223.416,230.764,"I mean, there might be instances where there's no effect on interstate commerce, a home... you know, that... that will be an issue, homegrown marijuana."
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,248.392,257.225,--I... I think that it is different because the Commerce Clause is... is a regulatory power that permits Congress to regulate.
2003.03-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,261.478,269.213,And you say here Congress does not rely on the Spending Clause because it... it makes conduct criminal against an individual.
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,269.213,276.089,--I believe that Congress passed this law under the Spending Clause power.
2003.03-44,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,278.484,286.286,To spend for the general welfare was the basis in the court below and that combined with Necessary and Proper.
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,286.286,287.484,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2003.03-44,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,287.484,296.483,"And that's the position that was taken below, and I think most of the courts of appeals went on that same ground."
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,296.483,305.028,It's my understanding that every court that has looked at this has said that Congress attempted to pass this... this particular statute under the Spending Clause.
2003.03-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,305.028,307.507,Does... does it matter what they intended to pass it under?
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,313.284,314.688,"That is true, Your Honor."
2003.03-44,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,320.055,332.853,"The justification sounds like a Spending Clause justification, doesn't it, that the... that they could not by a lesser means safeguard these Federal funds?"
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,348.207,349.776,That... that's what they said they were trying to do.
2003.03-44,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,364.471,367.981,And why is that not satisfactory?
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,367.981,380.818,It's not satisfactory because the statute doesn't require any connection between the spending... Federal spending and the criminal conduct.
2003.03-44,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,380.818,404.018,"Suppose that, just to use an analogy in the private sphere, a major corporation has a choice of two subcontractors and one subcontractor is known for engaging in lots of bribery and kickbacks, et cetera."
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,421.814,424.164,"That's not what the Government is doing here, Your Honor."
2003.03-44,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,434.074,442.247,"Well, it has relation because it wants to give its funds to those entities that it has confidence in with respect to all of their operations."
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,442.247,448.935,"Well, it can make a choice about giving money or not without criminalizing conduct."
2003.03-44,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,465.569,473.371,"They really say if we find a city council that takes money and... from us, the city council takes the money for us for some of its programs here."
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,492.857,502.804,"--Because, Your Honor, there is... it may be that what... that is what the Government wants to do, but the question is whether the Government has the power to do that."
2003.03-44,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,502.804,504.307,"That's true, but why doesn't it?"
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,504.307,516.179,It doesn't have the power to do that because there's not an element in the statute that requires there be a connection proved between the Federal spending and the wrongful conduct.
2003.03-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.366,545.341,"Suppose the Federal Government had recast the statute and said no State can get... what's the limit... $10,000 or more from the Federal Government unless it agrees to criminalize and impose the same penalty set forth here for any State corruption."
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,550.997,554.257,It might be if--
2003.03-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,554.257,556.198,"It unquestionably would be, wouldn't it?"
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,557.513,558.135,--Assuming it wasn't--
2003.03-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.135,558.999,--it's connected to the grant.
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,574.769,587.856,"--In... in Your Honor's hypothetical, it might be coercive, unduly coercive, but other than that, I don't see a problem with your hypothetical."
2003.03-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,611.262,612.97,"Well, have we ever said it can't?"
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,612.97,618.066,"--Well, only inferentially by Dole."
2003.03-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,620.772,623.623,I think it's kind of hard to read Dole for that proposition.
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,645.458,656.688,--I... I say that we... we properly bring a facial challenge because the statute has no element requiring a connection between the Federal spending--
2003.03-44,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,656.688,663.58,I don't... we don't normally entertain facial challenges to statutes on a ground like that.
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,671.92,674.975,--This statute cannot be properly applied in any case.
2003.03-44,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.381,684.635,You say because it lacks the requirement of a jury finding that there was the connection.
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,684.635,684.801,--Yes.
2003.03-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,693.551,705.03,"Well, what if... what if Congress had found that interstate commerce is involved here and did not provide for an individual jury finding in every case, would your argument be the same?"
2003.03-44,0,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,705.03,717.329,"I don't know, Your Honor, but Congress didn't make that finding."
2003.03-44,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,717.329,719.724,It's a very candid answer.
2003.03-44,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1070.184,1074.187,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-44,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1089.875,1091.482,"What... what is the basis, Mr. Dreeben?"
2003.03-44,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1095.752,1107.791,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Government has relied on Congress' Necessary and Proper Clause authority to protect its Spending Clause expenditures and programs in this case."
2003.03-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.526,1155.345,How far does that go?
2003.03-44,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1184.362,1202.073,"--Justice Scalia, I think that this Court recognized, as recently as last terms in Jinks v. Richland County, that analysis under the Necessary and Proper Clause is deferential, tracing its roots back to M'Culloch v. Maryland, but there is an attenuation element to the analysis."
2003.03-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1219.285,1226.51,"Do you think $10,000 is... is clearly... what's... what's the... what's the annual budget of New York State, do you know, or California?"
2003.03-44,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1226.51,1227.087,Okay.
2003.03-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.139,1237.74,242 billion dollars.
2003.03-44,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1237.74,1238.278,And the Federal Government--
2003.03-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1238.278,1248.226,"And because there's $10,000 of Federal money, a drop of Federal money in this sea of... of California funds, the... the Federal Government can control the whole thing."
2003.03-44,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1248.226,1249.135,--But there's not a drop.
2003.03-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.198,1252.107,"No, no."
2003.03-44,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1254.891,1262.304,"--It does, Justice Scalia, but Congress was well aware that every State is the recipient of billion upon billions of dollars in Federal aid."
2003.03-44,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1279.865,1281.168,How much does it give California?
2003.03-44,2,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,2567.579,2568.61,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2003.03-44,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2609.006,2613.548,"You... you think Salinas, had the constitutional been raised, would have... should have come out the other way."
2003.03-44,2,15606,andrew_stuart_birrell,,2613.548,2621.721,"--I think that if the constitutional issue had been raised in Salinas, it would have come out the other way, yes."
2003.03-44,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2703.167,2704.903,"Thank you, Mr. Birrell."
