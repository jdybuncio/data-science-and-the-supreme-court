1989.88-6613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.547,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-6613, Richard Boyde versus California."
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,40.628,44.439,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-6613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,376.511,380.655,You're referring now to the so-called factor (k) instruction?
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,380.655,391.142,"--The factor (k) instruction, the instruction which directed the jury to crime related circumstances that extenuated the gravity of the crime, such as the seriousness--"
1989.88-6613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,391.142,392.482,"Well, I don't see why the jury couldn't consider that."
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,401.778,405.572,"--Well, there are a number of reasons why it wouldn't, beginning--"
1989.88-6613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,405.572,406.283,Give me some of them.
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,406.283,406.594,--Surely.
1989.88-6613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,485.98,487.66,This was the change they made?
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,487.66,489.382,"Yes, in 1983."
1989.88-6613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,489.382,493.926,"Well, of course, the fact that the instruction might have been improved upon, may have been more precise, surely isn't controlling."
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,505.344,505.825,I understand.
1989.88-6613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,505.825,507.475,It says and any other circumstance.
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,507.475,516.063,"Well, there are definitely other circumstances, and I think the most telling aspect of this case is what we find in the record, taken from the prosecutor's argument."
1989.88-6613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,546.463,547.904,We'll resume there at one o'clock.
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,547.904,548.274,--Very well.
1989.88-6613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,551.587,567.818,"Mr. Fischer, you may continue."
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,567.818,570.149,Thank you.
1989.88-6613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,897.107,915.029,"Mr. Fischer, let me ask you, I agree that that, that example is quite clearly an argument that it simply can't be used under the gravity factor, quite simply and plainly."
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,927.778,927.928,Yes.
1989.88-6613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,927.928,929.01,You want factor (k) out.
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,929.01,929.551,That's right.
1989.88-6613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,929.551,940.57,"Must we establish that it does, it cannot be misdescribed in any case, or that it does not lend itself to misdescription in any case?"
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,940.57,965.116,"Well, I think that the constitutional test... and when I say that we want it out, in agreeing with you, I really would quality that by saying that we are comfortable, certainly, representing this Petitioner, and comfortable with the notion that the CALJIC modification in the instruction which is given throughout the state, very satisfactorily resolves that particular dilemma."
1989.88-6613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.074,978.456,Let's take every case before that.
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,978.456,978.627,Sure.
1989.88-6613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,998.501,999.44,In the particular case.
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,999.44,1000.511,--In the particular case.
1989.88-6613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1000.511,1000.782,Right.
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1013.581,1022.747,"Well, for one thing, it does our case, hopefully, some good, because I believe it supplants, it reinforces, excuse me, reinforces the point we have made in our case."
1989.88-6613,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.93,1059.635,Wasn't the court below unanimous on this phase of the case?
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1059.635,1060.824,"They were, yes."
1989.88-6613,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1060.824,1065.94,And they said that it was inconceivable that a reasonable juror would have been misled.
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1065.94,1078.768,"Well, what I read in Justice Arguelles' dissent on the second issue, which I will turn to in a moment, in some respect, because there was no discussion by him of that, in some respect I think carries over."
1989.88-6613,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1087.704,1090.198,"Well, I thought they said they agreed with the majority on the other aspects."
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1090.198,1094.98,"Yes, they did, but they also indicated how the jury might be misled, and it seems--"
1989.88-6613,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1094.98,1097.542,"Well, about the scope of his discretion under the shall language."
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1097.542,1097.702,--Yes.
1989.88-6613,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1097.702,1099.245,That is what they were talking about.
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1099.245,1120.52,"But remember, they also allowed, since they rejected both errors, we don't... it seems to me that it has a crossover effect, even a symbiotic effect, that could be found, since the jury neither could give weight to, could give effect to Boyde's evidence of his--"
1989.88-6613,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.52,1126.293,"Well, at least the majority said it was inconceivable that the jury, that the jury might have been misled."
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1126.293,1128.727,"--Well, I certainly don't want to quarrel with your characterization."
1989.88-6613,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1128.727,1129.736,I know that is what they said.
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1132.761,1135.161,The dissent did not disagree with them.
1989.88-6613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1148.912,1150.272,"I don't see what it proves, the empirical study."
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1170.907,1175.321,"--Well, I certainly think he did, when he described the factor incorrectly."
1989.88-6613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1175.321,1178.063,"Well, fine, we can talk about this trial, and--"
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1178.063,1179.282,It seems to me we could stop there.
1989.88-6613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1179.282,1181.415,"--and this language, but I don't see how that is helped by--"
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1181.415,1181.423,All right.
1989.88-6613,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1181.423,1184.197,--by saying that another prosecutor misdescribed it in another trial.
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1184.197,1193.074,"I believe it reinforces, in sort of real world terms, what one would only know to speculate about without that."
1989.88-6613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1361.468,1370.234,"Suppose the jury is not in doubt as to the appropriate penalty, and that the penalty is death."
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1383.042,1397.942,"--Under California practice as it presently exists in the adorned and clarified instruction, the sentence of death must be imposed if the jury makes the determination that death is the appropriate punishment."
1989.88-6613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1397.942,1404.597,And isn't that just another way of saying that the jury must follow the law?
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1404.597,1405.548,Yes.
1989.88-6613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1417.405,1420.838,I said if suppose it is satisfied that it is the appropriate penalty.
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1420.979,1421.567,--Yes.
1989.88-6613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1421.567,1427.063,"--Would you object to an obstruction which says, if you are satisfied that this is the appropriate penalty, then you must impose it?"
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1427.063,1427.601,No.
1989.88-6613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1427.601,1430.305,That that would be unconstitutional?
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1430.305,1433.796,Would I object to an instruction that said--
1989.88-6613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1433.796,1433.936,Yes.
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1433.936,1436.149,--if the jury finds death is the appropriate punishment?
1989.88-6613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1448.548,1449.069,Assume all of that.
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1449.069,1449.689,--Yes.
1989.88-6613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1464.699,1469.334,It seems to me that this case is not far removed from that.
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1469.334,1471.786,"Well, I think there is a critical difference in this case."
1989.88-6613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1494.022,1495.735,xxx--
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1495.735,1496.456,I am sorry?
1989.88-6613,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1496.456,1512.418,"--With reference to the mitigating factors, it is instructed that it can and should consider all evidence in mitigation, and that it need not give any particular weight to any one of the factors, and that any one mitigating factor can outweigh all aggravating factors."
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1517.733,1521.534,As long... I am not certain I understood your question fully.
1989.88-6613,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1550.766,1563.482,"Or to put it another way, you are saying that even though aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances, there still should be a window where the jury could say death is not the appropriate penalty."
1989.88-6613,0,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,1563.482,1564.063,That is all.
1989.88-6613,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1564.924,1567.436,"Thank you, Mr. Fischer."
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,1569.308,1578.505,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1989.88-6613,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1638.948,1641.189,"That's a pretty mandatory word, isn't it?"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,1641.189,1645.172,"Well, Your Honor, our position is that the jury would understand that word--"
1989.88-6613,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1645.172,1646.262,"To mean ""may""."
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,1646.262,1647.694,--No.
1989.88-6613,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1680.197,1684.571,"Well, that has to be your argument, of course, but certainly the statute could be better drawn, couldn't it?"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,1684.571,1693.216,"--I don't believe that is the constitutional issue in this case, Your Honor, as to whether it could be improved upon, or the instructions could be better worded."
1989.88-6613,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1763.541,1769.037,"At least the situation has been ameliorated since this case, hasn't it?"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,1769.037,1776.691,"The California Supreme Court suggested that the language be clarified to prevent any possibility, possibility--"
1989.88-6613,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1776.691,1778.39,Clarified or improved?
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,1778.39,1784.805,"--I think it could be described either way, Your Honor, improved in the sense of making it clearer."
1989.88-6613,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1803.783,1805.613,"But it is important when a man's life is in danger, isn't it?"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,1805.613,1807.446,"--I am sorry, Your Honor, I missed that."
1989.88-6613,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1807.446,1810.317,"I say it is important when a man's life is at issue, isn't it?"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,1810.317,1817.781,"I think it's important, and the test that this Court has applied in California versus Brown is what reasonable jurors would do."
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1919.273,1926.857,"But they only relate to matters that extenuate the gravity of the crime, not the, reflect the character of the individual who committed the crime."
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,1926.857,1928.159,"But, Your Honor,--"
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1928.159,1932.113,"I mean, how does the fact that he had a bad childhood extenuate the gravity of the crime?"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,1936.254,1940.658,"--Same thing could be true, said, of the other factors (b) through (j)."
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1945.052,1945.282,That's right.
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,1945.282,1945.692,--in a terrible way.
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1945.692,1947.014,That is precisely the point.
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,1947.014,1948.253,"But, I--"
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1948.253,1951.726,The test is whether this evidence extenuates the gravity of the crime.
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,1951.726,1952.617,--My point--
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1952.617,1953.559,And I don't see how any of it does.
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,1953.559,1954.307,--Excuse me.
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1965.756,1967.287,Extenuates the gravity of the crime.
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,1967.287,1968.008,--to relate to the culpability of the defendant.
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2014.482,2024.3,"Let me ask you about the prosecutor's argument in the other case that your opponent referred to, and I understand that we have to deal with this case, but that prosecutor must in good faith have misread this instruction, wouldn't you say?"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2029.115,2037.318,"I don't believe, and I would... our position is this Court should not get into a discussion of what particular prosecutors did--"
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2037.318,2042.253,"No, but we're only trying to decide whether reasonable people might read this language in a particular way."
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2053.042,2058.205,"--Well, in the first place, Your Honor, we're talking about two cases that the defendant has been able to cite--"
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.205,2059.286,"Well, just even if we had one."
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2064.391,2065.931,"--But, the issue here--"
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2065.931,2066.621,Wouldn't you agree with that?
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2066.621,2068.411,"--Well, the issue here is whether--"
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2068.411,2069.083,Wouldn't you agree with that?
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2069.083,2071.755,"--I would say that, that--"
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2071.755,2073.678,Or do you think he was acting in bad faith?
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2073.678,2079.141,"--I would say that he misled the jurors in those case, as far as what the face of that--"
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2079.141,2082.433,But don't you suppose he did so because that is the way he read the instruction?
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2082.433,2087.395,"--Well, I think we are speculating as far as what particular prosecutors did in particular--"
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2087.395,2092.036,"Well, normally we presume that lawyers act in good faith, at least I do, and I assume he was acting in the best of faith."
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2093.639,2097.743,"--He may have, Your Honor, but these jurors did not hear that prosecutor."
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2097.743,2099.974,"No, but they all, they read the same language he read."
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2106.08,2112.916,"Well, if that is the test then, Your Honor, then the test is whether anyone could possibly misunderstand the instruction."
1989.88-6613,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2124.842,2129.648,The prosecutor might have had an incentive to misunderstand the meaning of the instruction as well.
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2133.3,2134.302,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-6613,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2226.084,2229.364,"Well, that is consistent with his just saying it is not mitigating."
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2229.364,2230.606,--Well--
1989.88-6613,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2230.606,2231.887,"I mean, that is all he is saying."
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2231.887,2235.509,"--Yes, he argued that in the--"
1989.88-6613,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2235.509,2236.31,xxx--
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2236.31,2238.38,"--Yes, exactly, Your Honor."
1989.88-6613,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2260.805,2272.404,--Somewhere in your argument you are going to touch upon the prosecutor's behavior at voir dire?
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2272.404,2273.916,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-6613,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2362.579,2372.977,"Well, that has to be your position, of course, but I guess I don't whitewash it as easily as you do."
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2372.977,2400.726,"Well, I certainly respect Your Honor's right to disagree with what I am arguing, but I believe that... well, first of all, the California Supreme Court, the majority of the California Supreme Court, said, with respect to the prosecutor's voir dire examination, that it was no more in substance than a capsule summary of what this Court has required of jurors."
1989.88-6613,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2426.476,2429.808,"Of course your California Supreme Court split four to three on this, didn't it?"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2429.808,2440.538,"Well, the court was unanimous, as has been pointed out previously, I believe by Justice White, was unanimous on the factor (k) issue, and split four to three on the ""shall"" issue."
1989.88-6613,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2440.538,2446.712,"Well, they split also on the voir dire propriety remarks, didn't they?"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2446.712,2448.996,"Yes, Your Honor, the majority said two things--"
1989.88-6613,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2448.996,2450.065,Four to three.
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2450.065,2452.739,--Yes.
1989.88-6613,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2488.096,2492.939,Don't misunderstand me.
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2507.682,2510.871,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2655.213,2668.002,"Let me ask in this argument, Mr. Millar, is it your position that the outweigh ""shall"" instruction is the functional equivalent of an instruction that says, if after listening to all the evidence you think death is the appropriate penalty, you shall enter it?"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2678.4,2693.808,"--Well, I think that, that it's the functional equivalent to the extent that, as our California Supreme Court has said, that what the jury is supposed to do is to weigh the various factors--"
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2693.808,2694.028,Right.
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2694.028,2695.83,--and decide what outweighs.
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2700.235,2700.625,Right.
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2700.625,2703.587,"And to that extent, I think that it is a functional equivalent."
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2704.458,2704.588,"Well, if--"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2704.588,2707.59,--is there is no separate and independent requirement of appropriateness.
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2707.59,2726.272,"--If, if that is your position, what do you have to say about the amicus brief that points out that in Oakland there were some 15 cases, and about half of those, I guess eight of them, the jury found that the factor, that the aggravating circumstances did outweigh the mitigating circumstances, but nevertheless, death was not the appropriate penalty."
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2726.272,2729.505,What I would say is that those cases really prove nothing.
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2735.281,2735.431,"Well, don't--"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2735.431,2739.134,"--for death in California versus Virginia, which has a different system."
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2751.695,2751.906,--Right.
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2751.906,2753.598,--and the jury is told may.
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.441,2770.161,"But don't those cases demonstrate that at least in those eight cases juries concluded one, that aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating circumstances, and two, that nevertheless, death was not the appropriate penalty?"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2770.161,2777.896,Except that we don't know what they are doing when they are deciding outweighs in the first step of that two-step process.
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2778.394,2782.798,"Well, is there any reason to believe they were doing anything different there than they were doing in the case before us?"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2782.798,2791.844,"--Yes, because in the case of the one-step process we know that they are applying their discretion and moral judgment, because that is the only opportunity they have to do that."
1989.88-6613,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2830.752,2834.113,"Mr. Millar, does Alameda County have some sort of home rule under the death penalty statute?"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2834.914,2842.721,"--Well, what I would say in that regard is that may be a constitutional variation."
1989.88-6613,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2863.083,2864.903,This case came from Riverside County?
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2864.903,2865.584,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2900.894,2910.371,"But couldn't one also at least speculate that under the one-step process, one cannot be sure that the jury did make the moral judgment that you assume they did."
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2933.348,2938.951,"I guess anything is possible, but we don't believe that reasonable, common sense jurors would have done that."
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2945.205,2946.697,"Well, where were they not told that?"
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2967.085,2971.457,"--Well, we don't... they were not specifically told that that is what they were doing."
1989.88-6613,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2974.251,2975.671,That that is implicit in the weighing process.
1989.88-6613,1,24302,frederick_r_millar_jr,,2975.671,2979.464,"And when I say they weren't told, I want to point out in the arguments they were clearly told that."
1989.88-6613,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3106.773,3108.165,"Thank you, Mr. Millar."
1989.88-6613,2,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,3110.995,3129.597,"Very quickly, the Respondent points to the 250 pages of transcript that it took to elicit the evidence, and tries to make some point about it must have had some effect."
1989.88-6613,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3216.881,3222.814,"xxx, he expressed no disagreement on the other issue."
1989.88-6613,2,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,3222.814,3226.117,"--Well, Justice White, I believe, in looking at that--"
1989.88-6613,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3226.117,3227.068,"Well, at least that is the way I read it."
1989.88-6613,2,20832,dennis_a_fischer,,3227.068,3227.899,"--Yes, I understand."
1989.88-6613,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3284.106,3285.628,"Thank you, Mr. Fischer."
