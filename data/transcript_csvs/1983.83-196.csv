1983.83-196,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,72.262,"Mr. Wallace, you may proceed when you're ready."
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,72.262,79.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-196,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,277.778,283.682,"Mr. Wallace, don't you think the district court meant that Congress had exceeded its powers unless it wanted to pay compensation?"
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,283.682,289.42,"--Well, that is probably what it meant, and I don't intend to belabor anything else."
1983.83-196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,396.189,413.234,"Mr. Wallace, before 1978 the law was clear, was it not, that none of the information supplied by a registrant would be released to anyone else?"
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,413.234,416.853,"Well, it would not be released to the public."
1983.83-196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.853,417.569,Right.
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,417.569,418.903,That was part of the--
1983.83-196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,418.903,420.037,It would just be used by EPA.
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,420.037,422.672,--It would be used by EPA or the Department of Agriculture.
1983.83-196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,422.672,423.556,"Yes, right."
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,437.016,440.634,"Well, it could be protected."
1983.83-196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,447.955,451.859,"Well, you take the position that it isn't even property?"
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,451.859,458.762,"--Yes, we are taking that position, and let me get to that question."
1983.83-196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,514.499,524.205,"Well, certainly the district court thought that the law, the state law in Missouri created a property interest."
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,524.205,531.311,"--I understand that, although we happen to think that that was an erroneous view of the law."
1983.83-196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,549.522,558.544,"Well, if the district court is right about what the Missouri state law is, why wouldn't we accept that and say, yes, it is property?"
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,558.544,578.172,"--The Fifth Amendment... the question of the meaning of the word ""property"" in the Fifth Amendment is a question of federal constitutional law, Justice O'Connor, rather than something that a state is free to define."
1983.83-196,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,578.172,583.659,"Mr. Wallace, would a copyright be property, or patents?"
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,583.659,588.397,"We think they probably would be, Justice Powell."
1983.83-196,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,588.397,591.349,You address a distinction between them?
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,591.349,592.115,Yes.
1983.83-196,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,751.669,758.74,"Mr. Wallace, you speak of the law of trade secrets as though perhaps there was one fount for that kind of law."
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,763.244,765.679,"Yes, it is, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.83-196,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,775.951,780.105,"Well, I mean, I think there's perhaps a little more implied in this question."
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,801.936,807.09,--I can't recall the Court specifically saying that.
1983.83-196,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,853.302,855.337,Just a minute.
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,878.936,912.157,"I recognize that the effect of holding that this is a property interest protected by the Fifth Amendment would be that Missouri would have to freeze its own law with respect to trade secrets, or otherwise a change in the law would be a taking under the Fifth Amendment, and that is part of the reason why I'm trying to explain to the Court that trade secret law is basically a law of evidentiary privileges rather than a law of property, which is qualified by additional tort duties."
1983.83-196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,912.157,922.346,"Don't you think it has a market value, that someone can sell a trade secret and that it has economic value?"
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,922.346,923.696,"Of course it does, of course it does."
1983.83-196,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,965.958,972.712,"Let me suggest a possible analogy, hypothetical, but it's been in the Courts of Appeals."
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1011.571,1018.426,"Well, compulsory licensing systems have been... are possibilities under the patent and copyright laws."
1983.83-196,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1041.523,1042.792,"Well, but it puts a price on it."
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1042.792,1047.244,"Yes, a price for copying it."
1983.83-196,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1049.279,1052.481,"Well, a price for using, a price for using the original work."
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1052.481,1056.616,"--Well, one, yes, in the form of copying it."
1983.83-196,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1098.961,1104.798,"Mr. Wallace, you're talking again as if there were some uniform body of law on trade secrets."
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1113.304,1119.458,You're not wrong that it does depend on the law of the 50 states.
1983.83-196,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1124.862,1127.229,Do we ordinarily review that sort of a claim?
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1127.229,1128.831,Not ordinarily.
1983.83-196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1162.219,1180.413,"Well, Mr. Wallace, let's just suppose that the Court were to disagree on whether we are bound by the determination of state law and were to find that the trade secrets in this instance constituted property under the taking clause."
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1197.558,1231.465,"We think there is not a difference with respect to pre-1978 data, even on that premise, because there was no legitimate expectation that the duties of federal officials in administering a federal program were prescribed by Missouri law or by the law of any other state, rather than by federal standards, which have long governed the duties of federal officials with respect to the handling of information that has been disclosed to them."
1983.83-196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1231.465,1237.452,"Well, but those standards provided before 1978 that they would be maintained secret."
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1237.452,1246.641,"I understand, but not every possibility of a change in the law constitutes a taking of property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment."
1983.83-196,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1266.119,1280.029,"You know, it's just hard to understand why the company wouldn't have had a legitimate expectation of privacy or maintenance of secret information before 1978."
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1280.029,1283.148,Well--
1983.83-196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.148,1285.283,May I ask you... I'm sorry.
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1286.683,1288.568,"--Well, I'd like to if I may."
1983.83-196,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1418.687,1428.744,"Mr. Wallace, I don't exactly understand how the compensation provision would operate."
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1439.433,1459.097,The statute provides that that disclosure provision does not affect the provision with respect to the use of this information to support an application for registration.
1983.83-196,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1475.357,1480.61,"--Not because the Constitution requires it, because the statute does."
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1480.61,1504.626,"That is our view, that Congress could have simply done it by another method, saying that if a pesticide has already been recognized as fit for marketing other persons who are able to duplicate it, because it's unpatented and they have figured out how to make it, don't need a registration in order to sell it."
1983.83-196,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1516.1,1522.087,Is there a parallel here with the mandatory licensing that I spoke of?
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1522.087,1543.833,"There's a parallel in the sense that Congress is providing for a scheme of compensation by competitors to the innovator that the innovator is not entitled to under the Constitution once his patent has expired, so that the innovator is actually better off under this scheme than he would be without it."
1983.83-196,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1598.302,1603.956,But you could equally well argue that the claims in cases like Kaiser-Aetna should have been equal protection claims.
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1611.145,1622.619,"The difference is there's no use of the property in the second instance, under my hypothetical where the statute doesn't refer to any use of the data by the second applicant."
1983.83-196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1640.664,1642.564,"Mr. Wallace, let me ask you one question."
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1665.529,1674.818,"Well, not in that form... there have been other suits to enjoin the enforcement--"
1983.83-196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1674.818,1676.104,I understand that.
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1676.104,1676.587,--from the outset.
1983.83-196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1676.587,1680.456,But has there been any specific litigation over specific disclosures--
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1680.456,1681.172,No.
1983.83-196,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1681.172,1682.074,--or proposed disclosures?
1983.83-196,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1682.074,1692.514,"There is an exception to disclose normally protected information, if that's what you're adverting to, when there is a finding that the needs of public health require it."
1983.83-196,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1732.424,1734.207,Very well.
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1740.078,1742.279,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1806.889,1816.745,"Mr. Randolph, given all the complexities, it would be helpful to me if you'd tell me, give me a specific example of something that's been taken, or when the taking occurs in your understanding."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1816.745,1822.999,"We have an injunction, Mr. Justice Stevens, and the injunction has prevented EPA--"
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1822.999,1824.1,"Well, assume there were no injunction."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1831.27,1846.597,"--Well, with respect to disclosure, we don't believe that there would be a taking until the information was disclosed, so long as EPA retained possession of it and did not disclose it, as was the situation prior to 1978, when indeed there was a federal criminal statute that--"
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1846.597,1850.334,"Well, taking specifically the example that Mr. Wallace gave us just a minute age."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1855.053,1858.774,"--I don't believe so, because I believe the companies consented to that."
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1858.774,1861.976,"If they had objected, would it have been a taking?"
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1866.443,1867.795,I don't know whether that would have been a trade secret.
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1867.795,1869.745,Assuming it was a trade secret.
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1869.745,1872.597,If it were disclosed with the objections--
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1872.597,1873.949,"For the reasons that he gave, yes."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1873.949,1874.633,--Yes.
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1874.633,1876.485,That would have been a taking?
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1876.485,1878.035,I think there would have been compensation that would have to be paid.
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1878.035,1881.103,And would there have been a Tucker Act remedy if that were the case?
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1881.103,1883.889,"No, I don't believe so."
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1889.376,1890.293,"No, no, no."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1895.011,1896.947,Let me state my position clearly:
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1919.543,1920.478,My question--
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1920.478,1924.014,"Four, we don't believe that we have a Tucker Act remedy in this statute."
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1924.014,1925.347,--Back to three.
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1927.299,1931.168,"If it's with respect to disclosure, it would be upon the disclosure."
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1949.832,1951.232,Let me ask just one other question.
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1959.103,1962.139,"--Yes, because we've lost our right to exclude at that point."
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1963.072,1968.543,"So you've got two takings: one, when someone else uses without disclosure; and two, when there's a disclosure."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,1968.543,1980.767,"--Yes, but there will always be disclosure preceding use, because the information, once it gets filed, is available for release 30 days after the registration."
1983.83-196,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2037.037,2050.53,"Tell me, Mr. Randolph, are you arguing that the pre-1978 submissions are taken under the 1978 amendments and also the post data submissions?"
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2050.53,2051.33,Yes.
1983.83-196,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2276.808,2280.01,How does that bear on the taking issue?
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2280.01,2284.629,"I think it doesn't, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and I'll explain why."
1983.83-196,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2314.85,2316.833,Let me ask you one more question if I may.
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2333.479,2337.763,"Well, the Corn Products case... I don't make a distinction."
1983.83-196,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2355.492,2364.914,"Well, I wonder if you would address the question I asked you a moment ago, and that is... perhaps I should rephrase it."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2379.34,2383.392,"If I may, I think you've asked two questions."
1983.83-196,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2418.549,2431.089,But Justice Pitney's opinion states the contention of the parties that the requirement that they publish the ingredients on the labels amounted to a taking of their property.
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2431.089,2441.747,"But it was a state regulation, and the state in that sense is redefining what the person's property, what the company's property right was with respect to trade secret protection."
1983.83-196,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2487.757,2491.328,"No, but the Principle is a lot closer than that, I think."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2507.771,2512.157,You cannot sell without disclosing--
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2512.157,2518.395,"Without having a label on it that discloses all its ingredients, even though some of them may be trade secrets as a matter of Missouri law."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2518.395,2521.597,--I would say that's unconstitutional today.
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2541.075,2546.463,"No, but Mr. Randolph, the last sentence says the reason is to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2548.931,2551.116,"--The disclosure, Justice Stevens, here--"
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2551.116,2553.318,"Right, and that's the only disclosure."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2553.318,2561.155,--comes after the EPA has passed upon the data and registered the product and it is being sold.
1983.83-196,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2561.155,2563.507,"Right, but this is the only kind of material that may be disclosed."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2563.507,2565.292,That's right.
1983.83-196,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2565.292,2572.696,"Mr. Randolph, do you think the Government or the Congress could condition registration on the applicant's waiver of confidentiality?"
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2572.696,2574.565,No.
1983.83-196,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2574.565,2576.615,Why?
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2576.615,2578.6,Several reasons.
1983.83-196,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2623.396,2631.735,"What if the EPA provided that for every application to use a pesticide there shall be a filing fee of $25,000?"
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2631.735,2634.536,I believe it could do that.
1983.83-196,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2634.536,2643.792,"Well then, why can't it require the sacrifice of other kinds of property as a condition for filing the thing, so long as it isn't just way out of sight?"
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2643.792,2651.898,"Well, it is way... there is no relationship between disclosure here and compensation to Monsanto."
1983.83-196,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2657.968,2661.836,"Well, Monsanto is getting federal registration for a product."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2686.635,2699.545,"--Because if it is, if it is the basis for requiring companies to give up property, then there isn't a Fifth Amendment taking clause, and I'll explain why."
1983.83-196,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2699.545,2702.247,"Well, but you give up property if you pay a fee."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2703.78,2705.865,You're relinquishing private property.
1983.83-196,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2731.514,2739.92,"Would you think in a zoning case that a city can say, sure, we'll let you build a new high rise apartment provided you dedicate a street?"
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2739.92,2742.038,--Yes.
1983.83-196,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2825.859,2845.939,"Of course, this Court held that some entity in New York could take away a valuable right worth millions and millions of dollars from the Penn Central Railroad because it alone among a very few buildings could not build a high rise building over the site of the old depot."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2853.295,2857.163,"Well, I think the Court held it wasn't a taking."
1983.83-196,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2857.163,2858.313,"Yes, I know."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2858.313,2858.949,Yes.
1983.83-196,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2858.949,2865.269,Are you any better off than Penn Central?
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,2866.186,2867.303,I certainly here so.
1983.83-196,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2986.743,2989.095,Let me ask you a hypothetical.
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,3011.127,3013.36,"I don't believe so, Justice O'Connor."
1983.83-196,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3014.629,3019.298,Why aren't you in substantially the same position after 1978?
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,3019.298,3026.637,"In the situation you describe, the inventor still would have property because he'd be entitled to a trade secret."
1983.83-196,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3042.314,3046.55,"Well, I guess it's in a position of either giving a registration or not."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,3046.55,3047.167,Yes.
1983.83-196,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3128.169,3132.906,"Of course, the Government does make an argument here that this is not property."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,3140.06,3141.345,Yes.
1983.83-196,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3260.589,3265.659,"Your colleague has it for you, Mr. Randolph."
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,3265.659,3270.98,I think this states Monsanto's position better perhaps than we have.
1983.83-196,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3287.922,3291.476,What page were you--
1983.83-196,1,16855,a_raymond_randolph_jr,,3291.476,3293.31,"--I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.83-196,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3397.859,3402.394,Mr. Wallace.
1983.83-196,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3402.394,3423.176,"Although it's not always dispositive, one of the principal indicia of whether Government regulation is permissible regulation or constitutes a taking is whether it applies to an entire category of persons or whether it singles out someone for special treatment."
1983.83-196,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3423.176,3425.726,Like singling out Penn Central for special treatment?
1983.83-196,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3425.726,3427.044,That is correct.
1983.83-196,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3574.474,3575.174,I have a question.
1983.83-196,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3617.751,3636.029,"--I think that the most difficult hypotheticals would involve expropriation by the Government of formulas and manufacturing processes that are needed in wartime or other national emergency and the allowing other contractors, for example, to use them to supply the equipment."
1983.83-196,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3650.539,3654.259,"Would you think this was a trade secret, this hypothetical I mentioned?"
1983.83-196,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3654.259,3665.448,"Well, perhaps it could be, since it's a formula that the company chose not to disclose and keep to itself."
1983.83-196,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3669.436,3671.036,Very well.
