2019.19-161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.6,"We'll hear argument next in Case 19-161, the Department of Homeland Security versus Thuraissigiam. Mr. Kneedler."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,9.6,22.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress established the expedited removal system in 1996 for aliens who arrive at our borders or enter illegally and have no entry documents."
2019.19-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,150.8,160.36,"Mr. Kneedler, it's one thing when an alien comes and has no protected ground to stay here."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,217.88,218.04,Well --
2019.19-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,218.04,259.72,"Meaning those are two different provisions of the Constitution, one predated the other, and the finality era cases were very clear, if you have a claimed right to be in the United States, whether you're on the shore from a boat that's landed or you're from Puerto Rico and you think that your citizenship gives you a right to come in, a whole slew of cases from the finality era under the Suspension Clause who said you have a habeas right. So I don't know how that's the same thing."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,270.4,271.84,Several responses to that.
2019.19-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,302.84,329.28,"Suppose -- suppose that Congress passed a law which said -- we'll make it an alien who has been here for some time, but perhaps illegally, walking down the street and an officer picks him up and puts him in prison. And he would like to say to a court: Judge, the officer was wrong on the law."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,422.76,427.6,"Well, that is -- what you're describing is quite different from what we have here."
2019.19-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,452.44,456.76,"Yeah, he's saying I have a right to be here because I have a -- a claim for asylum."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,456.76,458.72,But it's -- it's very -- it's very different.
2019.19-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,476.08,483.88,"I guess I just don't understand this, Mr. Kneedler, because, on certain conditions, if he shows certain things, he has a right to asylum."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,492.52,493.2,Well --
2019.19-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,493.2,498.24,"So, you know, on certain conditions, he has a right to release. He has a right to live in this country."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,500.12,500.48,But --
2019.19-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,500.48,505.04,-- is whether -- is -- is his getting a fair hearing to determine that question.
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,505.04,529.04,"This is a very different context where someone is saying not that he has a right under domestic law to be in this country but that he -- he doesn't want to be sent back to another country because his -- of his fear of conditions there. This is directly like the rule of non-inquiry that has been applied for many, many years in extradition, which is one of the analogies that Respondent draws."
2019.19-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,540.96,556.6,"But you don't contest, do you -- I guess I'm just not really quite understanding this argument, because you don't contest that, under this statute, if he shows certain things, he has a right to remain in this country as a -- per the asylum statute."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,556.6,560.12,"Well, for -- again, asylum is discretionary."
2019.19-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,607.76,608.32,He might.
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,667.88,668.36,Well --
2019.19-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,668.36,669.28,Tell me why there are no --
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,669.28,686.08,"-- actually, I don't see the analogy because this is a very different and limited and focused context where an alien who -- who has entered illegally has no right to be in the country and, nonetheless, is asking for basically mercy under the statutes that Congress has enacted."
2019.19-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,686.08,686.64,Maybe that's it.
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,686.64,687.48,But under the -- under the --
2019.19-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,687.48,691.56,"I -- I don't know. You'd have to at least, if he has a right to mercy under the statute -- look --"
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,691.56,692.68,It's not -- it's not --
2019.19-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,692.68,705.0,"-- there are all the Chinese cases and so forth, you know, the Chinese exclusion cases and so forth, which analogizes it very much for habeas purposes in terms -- being put into jail, I mean, for habeas purposes."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,709.52,734.76,"Even looking at it in that way, what those courts repeatedly hold, all the way back to the Court's decision in Ekiu more than 100 years ago, is the fact-finding, the -- the -- the -- whether the person as a matter of fact comes within the scope of the statute, may be committed entirely to an executive officer. And that is due process."
2019.19-161,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,849.4,849.96,Does -- does your --
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,849.96,851.6,-- examine the condition --
2019.19-161,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,851.6,851.84,Sorry.
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,862.32,868.96,"Well, we think Congress is entitled to make a judgment about -- about how long the -- that period should be."
2019.19-161,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,876.68,879.2,"Is there an outer boundary to that, do you think?"
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,879.2,886.96,"There -- there may well be, but I -- but, again, this is an act of Congress, and we think Congress's judgment along those lines should be respected."
2019.19-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,886.96,889.08,"I wasn't going to bring it up, but I will."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,951.92,954.88,My response is Congress did not take away habeas corpus.
2019.19-161,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,976.8,977.12,I see.
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,977.12,980.2,-- courts did not review factual determinations.
2019.19-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,985.56,1027.16,"So is your -- so is your position, so I understand it -- let's assume -- and I'm borrowing Justice Breyer's assumption -- that there is an error of law, either of law or of fact -- application of facts to law. And I know you'll dispute that, mixed questions, but assuming there's a mixed question or there's an error of law, are you still saying that habeas relief is unwarranted, cannot be given? Because, as I understand this statute, there are only three reasons that you can get judicial review, and none of them have to do with errors of law."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1027.16,1028.04,Yes.
2019.19-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1032.92,1033.96,So how -- how do you --
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1033.96,1035.56,-- in this -- in this context.
2019.19-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1035.56,1035.92,All right.
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1056.36,1063.28,"Well, those cases don't actually hold in our view that the Suspension Clause required that."
2019.19-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1082.64,1083.04,I'm sorry.
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1131.68,1132.04,No.
2019.19-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1132.04,1137.52,It's when the government stops your liberty of remaining --
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1137.52,1137.72,Well --
2019.19-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1137.72,1138.96,-- if you have a right to remain.
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1140.8,1150.96,"-- I -- I -- I don't think the Court can look just at the finality cases, although we think they answer the question here because this is a fact-laden review. The Court also has to --"
2019.19-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1150.96,1152.2,"No, but you're going further now."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1152.2,1174.32,"No, but the Court also has to consider the rule of non-inquiry cases in which the Court has repeatedly held, all the way back to Neely, with a lineage as -- as old as our immigration laws, that habeas review is not available to review the conditions or what will happen to the person when he goes to another country --"
2019.19-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1174.32,1174.8,That's not the issue.
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1174.8,1176.16,-- even for questions of law.
2019.19-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1176.16,1181.36,The -- the focus is -- of habeas is not the issue of where you're going to be released to.
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1183.72,1186.44,But -- but -- but if someone --
2019.19-161,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1186.44,1187.28,So you're right.
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1187.28,1208.6,"-- if someone is sought for extradition purposes and they are in the United States and -- and they are claiming don't send me to another country that has requested my extradition because of what the procedures will be there, what treatment I will be -- I will receive there, the rule of non-inquiry has sustained the ability of -- of Congress not to provide for judicial review."
2019.19-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1210.32,1210.64,I guess I'm not --
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1210.64,1211.64,-- in this Court's unanimous decision.
2019.19-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1211.64,1213.56,-- quite understanding why that would be.
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1263.48,1273.32,"Again, in the finality era -- era cases, the courts did not review the fact-based determination about whether someone came within the statute."
2019.19-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1299.92,1300.36,But your --
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1300.36,1301.16,But the Court didn't suggest --
2019.19-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1301.16,1305.0,"-- your view, you know, does not only speak to pure factual matters."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1311.2,1313.88,But there's no statutory interpretation question here.
2019.19-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1315.2,1320.4,"Well, there's a view as to whether the hearing officer filed the -- followed the appropriate procedures."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1320.4,1328.36,"But that is a fact-laden review that would require unpacking what happened, would require the -- the -- the -- the record --"
2019.19-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1328.36,1338.12,"Usually, we don't think that, you know, did you follow the law as to the procedural requirements that the law states as a fact-laden review."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1338.12,1338.36,But --
2019.19-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1338.36,1340.48,We think it's a pretty common thing for courts to do.
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1340.48,1340.8,No --
2019.19-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1340.8,1345.24,"It's like, did this executive officer follow the procedures that he was supposed to follow?"
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1345.24,1351.84,"No, the courts -- there are no decisions in the finality era that are pointed to that -- that provide for that kind of review."
2019.19-161,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1354.04,1358.2,"But why should that kind of review be so different? I mean, that's a pretty basic question."
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1361.68,1381.48,"If I could just step back for a moment, the -- the -- the common law, the finality era cases, all the sources that are looked at, nothing affirmatively establishes a right of judicial review of this sort of screening determination that Congress decided could be attached to the expedited removal system."
2019.19-161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1386.8,1387.16,Mister --
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1387.16,1389.76,-- especially against the background of the rule of non-inquiry.
2019.19-161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1389.76,1392.76,"I -- I think you've been trying to make a point about Munaf, and I --"
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1392.76,1393.36,Yes.
2019.19-161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1393.36,1394.76,-- I wonder if you could tell me what it is.
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1394.76,1395.04,Yes.
2019.19-161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1409.08,1409.48,Right.
2019.19-161,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1411.48,1435.64,"The same thing here, where the person is saying: Don't -- don't -- I want a court to determine whether -- to review an executive determination as to whether I will be tortured in another country. And in Munaf, the Court didn't try to separate whether the executive had decided a question of law, a question of fact."
2019.19-161,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1514.84,1518.0,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gelernt."
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1518.0,1550.4,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statute here eliminates any meaningful role for the courts, even to ensure that the statutes and regulations were followed. During the 60-year finality period, Congress also tried to exclude the courts, leaving only that review that was ""required"" by the Constitution. This Court, nonetheless, continued to review legal claims in habeas."
2019.19-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1778.32,1778.72,"Well, what --"
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1778.72,1779.36,-- not discretionary.
2019.19-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1779.36,1787.28,-- what's unusual about this situation is that your client really doesn't want to be released.
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1813.52,1813.92,Right.
2019.19-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1837.88,1842.84,"Well, he wants to be -- he wants to be released in this country so that he can remain in this country."
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1857.84,1862.48,"Well, absolute, Your Honor, he wants review of the removal order, which entails custody."
2019.19-161,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1913.12,1913.24,Well --
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1913.24,1916.36,-- because the restraint point would be the same with respect to them.
2019.19-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1916.36,1916.56,In the --
2019.19-161,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1916.56,1918.28,"-- that's not what they're saying at all, though."
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,1929.24,1930.8,"So you're absolutely right, Justice Kavanaugh."
2019.19-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1962.24,1974.92,"But there's the -- just following up on Justice Alito's point and the government's reliance on it, Munaf does say that there they were not seeking simply release."
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2009.56,2011.64,"Well, Your Honor, a few -- a few points on that."
2019.19-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2050.44,2061.48,I -- I think that the analogy that they press depends upon the fact that it's conceded that the individual does not have a right to be in the United States.
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2061.48,2061.8,Right.
2019.19-161,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2114.12,2142.44,"But -- but on the -- on the question of history, you make a point. But, on the question of precedent in Landon versus Plasencia -- and I just want to get your reaction to this, you know what sentence it is -- Justice O'Connor writing for eight justices says: ""The Court has long held that an alien seeking initial admission to the United States requests a privilege and has no constitutional rights regarding his application."" So that's a statement of law for eight justices."
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2146.96,2151.48,"Well, I -- I think what the Court was saying there, as we understand it, was specific to due process."
2019.19-161,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2166.56,2168.64,"For context, the sentence says no constitutional rights."
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2168.64,2169.0,Right.
2019.19-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2212.16,2232.48,"But wasn't it true in the -- in the finality era cases that the individuals, once it was determined that they had not been properly detained, they did have a right to be in the United States, because, in those -- in that era -- for most of that era, or much of that era, there were not very many restrictions on immigration to the United States."
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2236.4,2239.32,"Well, I don't think so, Your Honor, I think for -- for two reasons."
2019.19-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2287.2,2298.44,"In any of those cases -- and it's -- it's -- did the court say anything more than -- when relief was granted, did they -- was the relief anything other than you are released?"
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2298.44,2299.04,"Well, absolutely."
2019.19-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2300.12,2302.64,Other than Accardi and the other case you cited.
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2302.64,2303.04,Right.
2019.19-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2303.04,2305.88,Which are -- which are in a -- perhaps in a category of their own.
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2310.6,2311.8,"No, Your Honor."
2019.19-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2326.8,2327.0,Yeah.
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2328.12,2329.04,"-- Muler, Johnson. Right."

2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2418.12,2418.96,Right.
2019.19-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2418.96,2422.28,"It says all he can say is, was there or was there not a notice."
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2480.04,2481.68,Right.
2019.19-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2481.68,2483.24,What -- what would -- what do you think of that?

2019.19-161,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2486.92,2487.08,Yeah.
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2487.08,2488.48,-- things packed into your question.
2019.19-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2603.16,2613.2,What are the concrete issues that could be raised on habeas in this case?
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2613.2,2669.0,"So, Your Honor, our two principal claims are statutory and regulatory. And let me -- let me deal with the statutory claim. What we're saying is, on these historical facts, no asylum officer could reasonably have concluded that he did not meet the low significant possibility standard, the very low standard, which is a significant possibility of ultimately satisfying the asylum standard, which in itself is just a one-in-ten chance. And I'm going into the merits now, but the reason we say that we are okay with a standard that says egregious error, clear error, no reasonable adjudicator, because, at that point, you are reaching a legal error, is because the asylum officer, by statute, is required to look at the reports on country conditions. Every report, as the amicus briefs from the asylum experts and the Sri Lanka experts point out, there is an exact M.O. in how Tamil people are persecuted in Sri Lanka."
2019.19-161,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2710.84,2751.24,"But the -- see, what you've just said illustrates how far-reaching the argument that you are making is, because, as I understand it, there was nothing in the administrative record -- now maybe your client didn't understand what was going on, but all he said was that people drove up and they beat me. And that's it. And he -- the officer said: Are you a member of a political party? And he said no. So that -- you're saying that, on those facts, knowing nothing more than the fact that he was beaten up in Sri Lanka and he's a Tamil, that that's enough to provide that -- that provides a sufficient basis for asylum?"
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2751.24,2751.72,Right.
2019.19-161,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2801.76,2802.24,Can I -- can I just --
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2802.24,2803.04,Yes.
2019.19-161,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2803.04,2807.8,-- I want to understand the limits of your theory.
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2820.68,2826.16,I would just put it as I read the court of appeals' decision differently and that --
2019.19-161,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2826.16,2826.56,Okay.
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2826.56,2829.2,-- there was not review of historical facts.
2019.19-161,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2841.8,2847.0,"Why are you using the word ""egregious""? Where -- that almost seems like whole cloth."
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2849.08,2856.84,"Well, Your Honor, I think if you wanted to say for this -- purposes of this case only legal claims and reserve whether mixed questions."
2019.19-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2904.68,2936.8,"May I just ask you, if you're not trying to get any mileage out of the fact that the alien was on U.S. soil, he didn't have any documentation, he surreptitiously got here, you're not distinguishing him because he managed to get to U.S. soil from somebody who never got here, who was never in the United States in the first place?"
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2936.8,2939.12,"We -- we are distinguishing them, Your Honor."
2019.19-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2939.12,2939.36,You are?
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2939.36,2949.48,"We -- we believe someone outside the country, unless for some reason U.S. forces were overseas restraining him, and that would be a different situation."
2019.19-161,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2962.72,2969.64,And does that -- that cover the person who comes to the port of entry and is stopped there?
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2969.64,2970.8,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.19-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2972.68,2975.6,Yes what? Your concession or -- or not?
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2975.6,2976.84,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2019.19-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2976.84,2981.8,"I -- I didn't understand your ""yes."" Is it that the person at the port of entry is covered or not covered by your position?"
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2981.8,2986.88,"They are covered by habeas, and the reason is because the ports of entry are typically on U.S. soil."
2019.19-161,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2992.44,2995.8,Do you think there's a way of distinguishing that case from yours?
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,2995.8,2999.08,"I think, historically, the Court has not for habeas."
2019.19-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3025.76,3025.84,But -- but --

2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,3034.32,3037.68,"Well, Your Honor, so -- so that goes to, I think, the burden."
2019.19-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3052.0,3054.44,That includes the people at -- at a port of entry?

2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,3113.92,3114.36,-- in the country.
2019.19-161,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3114.36,3132.76,"-- can I pick up on the Chief Justice's question? You're saying a non-citizen who arrives at a port of entry, has never been in the United States, not lawfully admitted to the United States, nonetheless has a right under the U.S. Constitution to judicial review of the executive's decision to say they're not admissible?"
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,3132.76,3133.16,Right.
2019.19-161,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3134.24,3134.76,Is that correct?

2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,3183.52,3184.36,There's just no grounds --
2019.19-161,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3184.36,3188.0,I don't think the concern is people who come here to go to Disneyland.
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,3188.0,3197.92,"Well, I -- I think the people who come here and don't have asylum claims or those type of claims and are clearly inadmissible are not going to file habeas petitions."
2019.19-161,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3252.04,3254.68,"You're -- you're reviewing mixed questions, though, correct?"
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,3254.68,3258.84,"But only as part of the record, which, again, is very, very small."
2019.19-161,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3258.84,3260.92,"That's very -- that's very difficult in many cases, though."
2019.19-161,1,34522,lee_gelernt,,3263.88,3301.04,"Well, I think certainly there's going to be deference, but I think, Your Honor, even to decide our case, we are -- we are okay with you saying not every mixed question where we have a difference of judgment needs to be reversed. But at least where it's so egregious that you can't possibly have under -- understood the standard, we believe we go back to district court and the district court looks at the few pages from the U.S. State Department reports on Sri Lanka, there is no way that the -- the district court could say, well, the asylum officer clearly understood what was going on. Maybe the asylum officer didn't think he could use circumstantial evidence and, therefore, made dispositive our client not telling him who persecuted him."

First of all, by our count, since the Ninth Circuit's decision, there have been 100 habeas cases filed, and the -- the potential for a flood would be, of course, far greater if this Court holds that there is a right to file a habeas seeking review of a negative credible-fear determination. This Court's decision in St. Cyr referred to review of pure questions of law and constitutional claims, in other words, statutory interpretation."
