1968.750,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,14.188,"Number 750, Glen Martin Harrington, petitioner versus California."
1968.750,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,15.367,18.043,"Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court."
1968.750,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,607.851,610.648,Did Harrington take the stand himself?
1968.750,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,610.648,612.627,"No, Your Honor he did not."
1968.750,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,614.108,617.579,"One of the codefendants testified, did take the stand."
1968.750,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,617.579,619.113,Mr. Rhone took the stand.
1968.750,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,619.113,621.563,You don't have to prove Rhone's stand?
1968.750,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,621.563,623.809,"No, actually we don't."
1968.750,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,624.496,626.856,The two did not take the stand?
1968.750,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,626.856,630.001,That's correct.
1968.750,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,630.001,635.732,(Inaudible)
1968.750,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,635.732,637.716,No question about it.
1968.750,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.716,645.619,"Mr. Rhone's -- I take it if only Rhone had involved here, there wouldn't been any problem on the root?"
1968.750,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,645.619,657.043,"Apparently not, had he taken the stand and he being the only codefendant apparently we wouldn't have the Bruton problem but as I read the Sixth Amendment it says you have a right to be confronted by all the witnesses."
1968.750,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.149,669.436,"But it did concern the harmless error where the confessions of any -- where Rhone as far as Harrington was concerned, was there any measure or difference mean Rhone's confession and the confession of the other two?"
1968.750,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,669.436,678.666,"No actually not, as a matter of fact they probably were not near as damaging for the reason I didn't name him per se like Mr. Rhone did."
1968.750,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.791,699.007,"So, in terms of the -- so, in terms of impact on Harrington, his ability to cross-examine Rhone maybe -- wouldn't that in many go to be in the cross examine of the other two?"
1968.750,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,699.007,701.238,"Well, that's a good question."
1968.750,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.038,705.117,Definite it would?
1968.750,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,705.117,707.62,It has to -- has to be the all the witnesses.
1968.750,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,724.077,730.67,Did you say the confessions of the other two did not name Harrington?
1968.750,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,730.67,740.96,"Well, did not name and explicitly it's referred to him as the white man, the Caucasian, the Paddy and things of this nature in such a way that with all four of them, sent them to witness table."
1968.750,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,740.96,746.889,What other conclusion could you come to that they were likewise referring to Mr. Harrington.
1968.750,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,746.889,750.773,There's a little doubt about it in my opinion.
1968.750,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,825.505,828.702,Are the statements of those three in the record?
1968.750,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,828.702,832.627,"Yes, every confession is in the record."
1968.750,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,832.627,835.947,Can you tell me quickly where at?
1968.750,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,835.947,844.809,"Well, I pointed it out; I did not index my copy of the single appendix."
1968.750,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,886.183,887.037,Thank you very much.
1968.750,0,39544,roger_s_hanson,,887.037,887.506,And so forth.
1968.750,1,31252,james_h_kline,,1367.884,1373.292,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.750,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1814.484,1821.698,With that there's one more to the extent of how many confession named in the same men were introduced?
1968.750,1,31252,james_h_kline,,1821.698,1822.212,I'm sorry.
1968.750,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1823.678,1828.428,"Well, suppose you had five men jointly tried six."
1968.750,1,31252,james_h_kline,,1828.428,1829.359,Yes.
1968.750,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1829.359,1839.142,"And five may confront his name into six one, would you take that in consideration which had five different wounds over emphasizing -- and over and over again?"
1968.750,1,31252,james_h_kline,,1839.142,1839.646,Yes Your Honor.
1968.750,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1844.325,1846.071,"Well, there were three here, weren't they?"
1968.750,1,31252,james_h_kline,,1846.071,1847.616,Yes.
1968.750,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1861.261,1862.347,He took stand?
1968.750,1,31252,james_h_kline,,1862.347,1865.903,Because he was -- he did testify on the stand.
1968.750,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.379,1918.835,The other two confessions didn't mention here.
1968.750,1,31252,james_h_kline,,1918.835,1919.951,That's correct.
1968.750,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1921.085,1925.295,The other two confessions mentioned the only white man in the group.
1968.750,1,31252,james_h_kline,,1925.295,1944.411,"Yes, that's true Your Honor but before I turn my attention to the other two confessions, I would like to emphasize the fact that Rhone is the only person that does name petitioner Harrington and he's the only one that details the activities of Rhone both before the robbery and after the robbery."
1968.750,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.71,1961.245,But Rhone never said in the other two in their confession never said that the only white man was Harrington?
1968.750,1,31252,james_h_kline,,1961.245,1962.236,"No, they did not."
1968.750,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1970.385,1989.673,"Well, excuse me if we should decide that harmless error doctrine is applicable here in this Bruton type of situation, do you think we ought to decide whether this record shows that the error is harmless or send it back?"
1968.750,1,31252,james_h_kline,,1989.673,2012.12,"Your Honor, I'm very happy you asked the question because I think the lower court has used a standard which is the equivalent of Chapman and may I refer Your Honor to page 437 of the single appendix in which the -- is part of the opinion of a lower state court."
1968.750,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2055.022,2078.096,"You mean -- but that means virtually inconceivable to the Court, is there a difference between the Court saying it's virtually inconceivable to us on the one hand and on the other hand that is virtually inconceivable that a jury could've found it virtually or a juror could've found it virtually inconceivable?"
1968.750,1,31252,james_h_kline,,2078.096,2090.679,Your Honor I think the precise language of the Court is that it is virtually inconceivable that any jury could have escaped to conclusion.
1968.750,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2094.697,2118.764,"Well, that's still -- still a difference between saying a jury or in the juror because if you had just one juror who felt that Harrington was not the man and that would've prevent him returning a guilt of verdict, wouldn't it?"
1968.750,1,31252,james_h_kline,,2118.764,2122.637,"Your Honor, I would disagree with the test as you proposed it."
1968.750,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2122.637,2165.296,"Well, I'm not sure that's the right test but if that were the test but what I'm asking, what I'm suggesting to you is there is a difference between a court saying that it doesn't believe that a jury could've escape the conclusion and the Court facing up to very difficult problem which is whether a single rational jury, juror where a single rational juror might have arrived at the conclusion that he could not find Harrington guilty beyond the reasonable doubt absent these statements of the -- in the confessions."
1968.750,1,31252,james_h_kline,,2165.296,2171.49,I would agree would appear -- goes two different matters but I would disagree with the applicability of that particular statute.
1968.750,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2171.49,2175.23,You would say that we ought to look at it from point of view of the jury as a whole?
1968.750,1,31252,james_h_kline,,2175.23,2177.275,"Yes, the jury as a whole because after all the juries --"
1968.750,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2177.275,2185.706,"But it is different, do you agree that that is different from looking at it from the point of view of the Court himself?"
1968.750,1,31252,james_h_kline,,2185.706,2206.937,"Well, I think the Court can look at the case as a whole, evidence as a whole and determine if any particular error in the context of the evidence as a whole is prejudicial whether a jury could've conceivably risk any different verdict but for the fact there was not admitted."
1968.750,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2206.937,2223.828,I understand that these are subtle psychological inquiries that psychological differences are the greatest certainty in perhaps useless man.
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3177.337,3180.138,"Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court."
1968.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3250.516,3252.989,Will that contribute?
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3254.496,3255.526,"Well, I simply --"
1968.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3255.526,3260.366,You say this in terms of the jury or the juror or which?
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3260.366,3272.661,"Well, in the Chapman decision, the Court says purged Mr. Justice Black we prefer the approach of this Court deciding what was harmless error in our recent case of Fahy versus Connecticut."
1968.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.831,3326.915,"Any he also says -- he also says and apparently without meaning to make any difference between the two perhaps that absent the constitutionally forbidden comments whether honest, fair-minded jurors might very well have brought in not guilty verdicts, that's the suit."
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3330.136,3340.388,"Well, I think it's indulging in the type of analysis that Mr. Justice Harlan commented on a little bit ago attempting to second guess lay jury."
1968.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3387.813,3389.837,"I must say Mr. Hanson, I'm puzzled."
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3407.991,3410.856,"Well, perhaps there is no great difference."
1968.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3423.981,3427.141,"Well, you call Mr. Justice Harlan dissented in Chapman."
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3429.077,3429.496,"Well, --"
1968.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3429.496,3431.912,What you'd suggest would be the proper form of (Voice Overlap)?
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3431.912,3442.219,"Well, there's a little doubt in my mind that jurors can't tell the difference in this error because our Supreme Court in California has exceeded that even further than that."
1968.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3445.497,3458.779,"Yes, but how do you test, what I'm trying to get from you is, how do you test whether or not beyond the reasonable doubt a judge may say that the error did not contribute to the verdict?"
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3458.779,3465.133,"Well, I agree that's the problem I think that if the Court will not apply harmless error we don't have the problem."
1968.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3465.133,3468.883,"I'm assuming, Mr. Hanson, that we are going to apply the harmless error rule."
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3477.942,3484.567,"Well, I just can't believe that an error of this magnitude can ever be said noncontributory."
1968.750,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3489.35,3494.341,"What do you mean an error of this magnitude, you mean any alleged Bruton violation or --"
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3494.341,3494.793,Yes.
1968.750,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3494.793,3511.586,"-- or a violation, a Bruton violation as serious to this one was because the -- this is so lacking in the clear violative equality of Bruton that your brother counsel says this is no even a Bruton case?"
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3511.586,3513.407,"Well, I don't agree with that (Voice Overlap) --"
1968.750,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3513.407,3519.84,The fact is that the one person who identified your client by name took the stand that was subject to cross examination.
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3527.482,3529.656,"Well, they certainly did by describing very well --"
1968.750,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3529.656,3534.641,"(Voice Overlap) they said talk about a white man, well, there are good many millions of white men in the world."
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3534.641,3551.608,"Well, I'm aware of that but if that argument holds any water then they must have convicted him on something else beside those statements because if the statements were to be believed that they were exculpatory as Mr. Harrington why approves them why he went been convicted."
1968.750,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3551.608,3578.776,"Mr. Hanson, wouldn't you agree that a great deal of difference between these two considerations on the one hand what is the -- what -- does the Court conceive of as the impact of this particular error namely the admission of the confessions of a codefendants?"
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3612.977,3613.345,"Well, I think --"
1968.750,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3613.345,3643.899,"I'm asking you whether you would -- whether you agree that those two things are different that is to say one, did the admission of the confessions of the codefendants contribute to the result or two, eliminating the confessions of the codefendants does they remain in the record evidence beyond the reasonable doubt of a -- to shorten up that this -- that the defendant was guilty?"
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3643.899,3663.66,"Well, I, in point number one, I certainly agree there is a marked difference between those two statements, a very marked difference because I think the second statement is more analogous to the federal harmless error rule namely if there is an error, this magnitude in the case did that contribute and I think in most all cases you have to say, did contribute but that's --"
1968.750,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3663.66,3664.788,"Well, that's the first one."
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3671.564,3672.869,Yes I did.
1968.750,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3672.869,3698.261,"And there what we're talking about a standard that used by the California Court to the effect that looking at the evidence as a whole and discounting the comment, the improper comment the Court felt that that beyond the reasonable doubt, this fellow is guilty."
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3698.261,3701.471,"I'm aware of that, that's so-called state harmless error rule."
1968.750,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3701.471,3702.263,Yes.
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3722.381,3723.052,I quite agree.
1968.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3749.928,3763.252,"Mr. Hanson, the Court appreciates very much your having accepted this assignment to represent this indigent defendant, we consider that a real public service."
1968.750,2,39544,roger_s_hanson,,3763.252,3764.001,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1968.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3764.001,3769.691,We're always comforted by the fact that lawyers are willing to do that.
1968.750,3,31252,james_h_kline,,3778.801,3781.667,"Thank you, Your Honor."
