1985.84-6807,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.374,We will hear arguments first this morning in Lee against Illinois.
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,11.868,20.673,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, may it please the Court, this is the case of Millie R. Lee versus Illinois."
1985.84-6807,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,81.154,87.539,Was the confession admitted in evidence earlier in the trial?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,87.539,104.949,"Your Honor, the confession of Edwin Thomas was admitted by the trial court judge earlier, and it was found to be admissible against Edwin Thomas by the trial court judge at that time, yes."
1985.84-6807,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,104.949,108.502,And Thomas was being tried at the same time as she was?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,108.502,109.283,And it was a joint trial.
1985.84-6807,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,144.357,149.619,"Well, was there any objection to the admission of the co-defendant's statement?"
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,149.619,162.616,--There was no objection made to the admission of the statement into evidence except with the understanding that the evidence was to be considered separately.
1985.84-6807,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,191.998,201.685,Did he say what was in the co-defendant's confession as it relates to this petitioner would not be considered as to this petitioner?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,201.685,227.073,"--At the very beginning of trial, when they walk about the judge considering the evidence separately, Judge Hobin, who was the trial court judge, does state that he would do that, and so this trial began on the basis that the judge would separate the evidence and consider the admissible evidence only against each co-defendant."
1985.84-6807,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,227.073,231.795,And did he say later that nevertheless he was now going to consider it against this petitioner?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,231.795,279.337,"When he finds my client, Millie Lee, guilty at the end of the presentation of the evidence and at the end of arguments by counsel, the trial court judge states in his finding of guilt that the petitioner is guilty as charged, and he states, I reject... basically he says, I reject her defense because her argument is that she was not guilty of the murder of Odessa Harris because she had no intent to kill, did not plan to kill, and did not know that Edwin Thomas was going to kill Odessa Harris, and that her second defense was that the killing of Mattie Darden would be voluntary manslaughter."
1985.84-6807,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,312.018,313.019,Asked her meaning asked the petitioner?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,313.019,314.399,Asked the petitioner.
1985.84-6807,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,411.833,414.655,What did... Did you try the case?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,414.655,416.127,"No, sir."
1985.84-6807,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,416.127,423.48,What was said by trial counsel when the judge revealed that he was relying on the co-defendant's confession?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,423.48,443.162,"The trial counsel does not make any objection on the record, and I do not know whether that is because trial counsel did not hear the statement, was not listening and inattentive at that time, and just went on assuming the trial court judge was keeping the evidence separate for--"
1985.84-6807,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,443.162,445.866,"Well, how could he assume that when he said he wasn't?"
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,445.866,450.348,"--I am not sure how that could happen, Your Honor."
1985.84-6807,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,455.101,467.919,Do you suppose that the failure to object was on the grounds that there was no point in calling more attention to it and that it didn't make any difference in the long run given the totality of the evidence?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,467.919,474.284,I do not believe that that would be a good assumption in this case.
1985.84-6807,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,474.284,480.348,"Do you suggest that the evidence was not strong, the evidence of guilt was not strong independent of this evidence?"
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,480.348,493.337,"I believe that the evidence of guilt is closely balanced, and is not clearly showing that she had... that the state proved her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the murder of Odessa Harris."
1985.84-6807,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,526.71,533.355,Wouldn't you expect trial counsel to be listening when the judge is sentencing his client?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,533.355,546.151,"I would expect that to occur, and I could only speculate as to why trial counsel was not listening at that time."
1985.84-6807,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,546.151,554.496,Maybe he didn't know that confession was not admissible against Lee.
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,554.496,561.312,I really don't see how that would be possible under Illinois law since--
1985.84-6807,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.312,564.124,It' sounds like it is more possible than that he didn't hear what the judge said.
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,564.124,589.629,"--I really don't think that's possible, Justice White, since she, counsel had filed a motion to sever when the jury trial was still a possibility, and in that motion to sever she alleges that prejudice would occur if trial would be conducted with the co-defendant, and the major reason why prejudice would occur is because of co-defendant's confession."
1985.84-6807,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,589.629,594.794,How in the world can I assume that a lawyer didn't hear something that was said in open court?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,607.243,608.583,From the record--
1985.84-6807,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,608.583,613.906,How can you as counsel assume that which is against your client?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,613.906,627.035,"--From the record, I can only state that the attorney either did not hear it or was not paying attention for some reason at that point in time."
1985.84-6807,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,627.035,627.626,Or agreed.
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,627.626,630.408,Or just let it pass her by.
1985.84-6807,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,630.408,631.276,Or agreed.
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,632.017,638.833,I do not believe that it can be said that trial counsel at that time agreed to let it go--
1985.84-6807,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,638.833,639.464,Mr. Evers--
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,639.464,665.07,"--because she also filed a post-trial motion asking that a new trial be granted in which counsel again reiterates the defense of her client at trial, which was that there was no intent to kill based upon the statement, and that voluntary manslaughter was also a possibility as a verdict due to the petitioner's statement--"
1985.84-6807,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,665.07,666.171,--Mr. Evers--
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,666.171,679.409,"--and if she believed that the co-defendant's confession was admissible and usable against Millie Lee, then there would be no need to put that into the post-trial motion."
1985.84-6807,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,679.409,698.052,"--Mr. Evers, I didn't want to interrupt you, but I think I understood you to say at the outset that the trial court had agreed that it would not consider in response to the motion to sever the evidence introduced by one party against the other party."
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,700.683,711.64,The trial attorneys indicate that the motion is no longer needed to be heard because with a bench trial the judge would consider the evidence separately.
1985.84-6807,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,713.91,726.69,"So your position is, the judge did agree in advance that he would not consider the evidence with respect to Thomas in his consideration of whether Lee was guilty or not?"
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,726.69,728.342,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-6807,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.342,735.055,"He didn't mention the confession, so the confession wasn't specifically mentioned, because--"
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,735.055,735.676,At the beginning?
1985.84-6807,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,735.676,739.059,--because the confession of the co-defendant surely relates to Lee.
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,739.059,743.669,The confession of the co-defendant?
1985.84-6807,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,743.669,744.37,Yes.
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,744.37,748.375,Millie Lee is mentioned in the co-defendant's confession.
1985.84-6807,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.375,753.938,So what makes you think... the judge never said he wouldn't consider the co-defendant's confession against Lee.
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,764.034,775.543,Admittedly they do not say on the record exactly what the evidence is that they are going to be keeping separate.
1985.84-6807,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.942,831.889,"Mr. Evers, may I go back for a minute to your suggestion that maybe the lawyer didn't hear what the judge was saying?"
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,837.773,838.561,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-6807,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,838.561,844.476,Is it customary in Illinois for a lawyer to interrupt a judge who is ruling and tell him he object to the ruling as it is being delivered?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,844.476,847.138,It would be possible to--
1985.84-6807,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,847.138,848.78,"It would be possible, but is that customary?"
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,848.78,850.099,--It is not customary.
1985.84-6807,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,850.099,852.981,The practice has changed since I was there if it is.
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,852.981,866.58,"It may be possible to object at that time, but it is not customary, and as far as what was going on, I am not sure, as far as how the courtroom scene was set up."
1985.84-6807,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,866.58,869.993,Isn't the typical way to object to a judge's ruling by filing a post-trial motion?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,889.065,891.727,That would also be possible.
1985.84-6807,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.708,912.58,Did the motion for a new trial talk about Bruton?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,912.58,915.782,The motion for a new trial did not talk about Bruton.
1985.84-6807,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,915.782,925.599,Did it say specifically that the co-defendant's... did it call to the judge's attention that the co-defendant's confession was not admissible against Lee?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,925.599,936.867,"It does talk about the only evidence against Millie Lee is her statement, and that her statement does not indicate an intent to kill."
1985.84-6807,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,936.867,941.9,"Did it say to the judge, look, judge you made a mistake by considering the other confession against Lee?"
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,941.9,942.701,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-6807,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,942.701,943.883,"Well, for heaven's sake."
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,960.952,962.152,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-6807,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.33,1054.254,And in this case I guess the Illinois appellate court did review the merits.
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,1054.254,1057.476,The appellate court of Illinois did review the merits of this case.
1985.84-6807,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1174.503,1181.076,Do you ask also that it be referred to a different judge for trial?
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,1181.076,1185.68,"I believe that would be appropriate, Your Honor."
1985.84-6807,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1185.68,1186.56,"Well, do you ask for it?"
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,1186.56,1188.462,"Yes, I would ask for it."
1985.84-6807,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1188.462,1192.472,"In your pleadings, in your papers filed with this Court?"
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,1192.472,1201.279,"I did not put it into the pleadings, because as I understand it now the trial court judge is not doing criminal cases in St. Clair County."
1985.84-6807,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1207.603,1217.3,"Mr. Evers, do you know of any case coming from a state court system where this Court has ever said that the case should be tried before a different state trial judge?"
1985.84-6807,0,20819,dan_w_evers,,1217.3,1231.038,"No, Your Honor, I am not, but I had not really thought about that problem since I understand that the trial court judge was taken off the criminal bench."
1985.84-6807,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1231.038,1235.122,Very well.
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1239.873,1258.737,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, respondent's position, simply stated, is that there was no constitutional error in this case in the admission and use of the co-defendant's confession against the defendant, and secondly, that if there was any error, it was harmless."
1985.84-6807,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1343.192,1357.79,"May I just ask on that point, is it correct, as I understand your opponent's brief to say that the trial judge did rely on some facts that were in the co-defendant's confession that were not in the petitioner's confession?"
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1357.79,1369.909,"Only in rebutting the petitioner's defense or claimed defense of self-defense, the judge did make one brief reference to a fact in the co-defendant's confession."
1985.84-6807,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1388.943,1399.358,"But it is correct that at least in his explanation of his ruling, he did rely on evidence that was in the co-defendant's confession and not in the petitioner's confession."
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1399.358,1400.73,"--In the statement, absolutely, that is true."
1985.84-6807,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.73,1408.844,"And what you are saying is that we should assume that if he had been interrupted when he was making his ruling, he would have placed his ruling on a different ground."
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1408.844,1411.126,"That is our secondary argument, yes."
1985.84-6807,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1415.63,1420.833,"If we are to follow your reasoning on the harmless error point, what standard of harmless error should we announce?"
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1426.957,1434.38,"--I think that the test is, would the case against petitioner have been significantly reduced by the absence of the co-defendant's confession."
1985.84-6807,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1434.38,1436.453,And what case states that harmless error test?
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1436.453,1438.434,In Schnable I believe that is what the Court says.
1985.84-6807,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1463.071,1472.197,"Now, is our inquiry that we think she is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, or we are convinced the trial judge would have reached the same conclusion and we know that beyond a reasonable doubt?"
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1472.197,1497.192,"I believe that you are free to look at the record and make a determination of what the trial court judge, what a reasonable trier of fact would have concluded, and that you will conclude that indeed there is no... it would be a travesty to reverse this case where the evidence is so overwhelming, but it would also be wrong to reverse where under Roberts the evidence is so reliable that it was not error to use that evidence."
1985.84-6807,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1529.723,1537.799,"So that... and I suppose this would be the case if there were a jury there, and so Roberts, you think, puts a gloss on Bruton?"
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1537.799,1546.705,"Yes, Your Honor, and I think I would go even further and say not only would this apply at a jury trial as well as a non-jury trial, but it would apply at separate trials."
1985.84-6807,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1551.049,1556.831,"Exactly, so that Bruton is really sort of beside the point, you are saying."
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1556.831,1559.533,"Yes, Justice White, I do think so."
1985.84-6807,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.533,1560.715,You think Roberts overruled Bruton?
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1560.715,1564.355,I think that it establishes a different test.
1985.84-6807,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1591.013,1594.567,"Well, they weren't interlocking in the sense that the said the same things."
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1599.748,1610.878,"--That is correct, but although there has never been a clear definition of what interlocking means, and indeed if you read the cases it seems as if wherever there are two confessions the courts say they interlock."
1985.84-6807,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1639.886,1640.777,May I interrupt right there?
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1640.777,1641.376,--Yes.
1985.84-6807,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1641.376,1643.278,"If you use that test, you don't need the other confession."
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1643.278,1646.1,"Yes, Justice Stevens, that is correct."
1985.84-6807,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1648.321,1649.372,It is just cumulative evidence then.
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1649.372,1651.072,"Yes, I think it is."
1985.84-6807,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1652.194,1653.634,Then why should you bother admitting it?
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1653.634,1663.582,I think that a prosecutor should not have the constrictions of saying that they may not use evidence which may indeed be necessary.
1985.84-6807,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1663.582,1666.103,It doesn't hurt to prosecute her under your analysis.
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1666.103,1685.844,"That is true by hindsight, but in the press of trial, I know from having been both a trial lawyer and an appellate lawyer, you look at the trial record as an appellate lawyer and you say, my goodness, why did they do that, that is overkill, but in the press of the trial you do not know what will be persuasive, and that anything that is reliable, such as this, should be admissible."
1985.84-6807,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1689.979,1696.693,"It seems to me your argument also... your argument on reliability, you didn't need... you only needed one confession, and you could have used either one under your analysis."
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1700.535,1701.646,That is correct.
1985.84-6807,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1702.127,1703.157,And either one would have been sufficient.
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1703.157,1704.198,--That is correct.
1985.84-6807,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1719.388,1725.602,But how does the interlock enhance the reliability of the portion of the confession that does not duplicate the other confession?
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1725.602,1738.339,"I think that we would argue that because a confession, once it is deemed to be interlocking and reliable, the entire portion... the entire confession, including the surplusage and the cumulative, comes in."
1985.84-6807,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1755.142,1767.169,"Mrs. Wine-Banks, what again is your theory under the law of evidence limited by the Constitution as to how Thomas's confession comes in against Lee?"
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1767.169,1780.967,"Justice Rehnquist, we would argue that it comes in as a statement against penal interest, which is reliable enough to meet the test of Roberts, which determines, we believe, when any type of hearsay is admitted."
1985.84-6807,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1822.375,1830.973,"Supposing you had a five-page confession that went into great detail as to just how a crime had been committed, and perhaps implicated several other people."
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1840.828,1848.033,"Other than the limitations that we are proposing, which is that it interlocks... if that was a single confession, no."
1985.84-6807,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1858.79,1861.921,Did either of the defendants take the stand in this case?
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1861.921,1871.408,"Only as part of the motion to suppress, which was part of the trial, so that after the state rested, both defendants testified on their suppression hearing."
1985.84-6807,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1871.408,1874.131,"But they didn't testify as to the merits, so to speak?"
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1874.131,1880.715,"No, although there is some suggestion, I believe, that because Edwin Thomas went beyond the suppression hearing, he was asked,"
1985.84-6807,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1889.74,1891.721,In that case Bruton wouldn't apply.
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1891.721,1893.992,"--Yes, that is correct."
1985.84-6807,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.992,1895.575,If he were available for cross examination.
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1895.575,1899.215,"Yes, and we do argue in our brief that he was available for cross examination."
1985.84-6807,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1899.215,1919.05,"Mrs. Wine-Banks, what is the Illinois law regarding admission of evidence if there were a single confession by Thomas, no confession by Mrs. Lee, and the Thomas confession was inculpatory?"
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1926.092,1934.3,"It would be admissible only against the declarant in the single confession situation, but there... Illinois--"
1985.84-6807,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1934.3,1934.698,All right.
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1948.679,1951.672,"--Well, there are two halves to my answer to that."
1985.84-6807,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1972.545,1972.905,If they are interlocking.
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1972.905,1973.544,--If they interlock.
1985.84-6807,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1973.985,1982.45,And has Illinois defined for itself what interlocking means and what happens when they are only partially interlocking?
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1982.45,1989.485,"Justice O'Connor, I am afraid that Illinois has done no better than any other court in being specific in its definition of interlocking."
1985.84-6807,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1989.485,1994.819,So we don't know what the Illinois law of evidence is that applies here.
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,1994.819,2008.396,"Well, we know that they have adopted, for example, the Chambers standard for the use of an exculpatory statement against penal interest, and used the test of Chambers in admitting that kind of a statement against penal interest."
1985.84-6807,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2027.61,2033.925,"Under Illinois law, you say that any objection to the use of the confession was waived."
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,2033.925,2034.847,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-6807,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2042.361,2047.522,When was the earliest time that an objection could properly have been made in your view?
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,2047.522,2056.909,"I believe right at the trial, at the time of the statement by the judge that he was using that one sentence to rebut her defense."
1985.84-6807,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2056.909,2059.961,That was in reading his findings?
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,2059.961,2060.662,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-6807,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2060.662,2069.768,"That was after he had made them, but he was reading them in public, and at that time you say Illinois required an objection to be made."
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,2069.768,2073.76,"Well, I don't think that it would have necessarily been waived."
1985.84-6807,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2078.604,2079.434,But there was--
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,2079.434,2080.025,--I am sorry.
1985.84-6807,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2080.025,2082.986,--There was neither an objection nor a post-trial motion?
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,2082.986,2085.186,The post-trial motion did not raise that issue.
1985.84-6807,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2089.851,2093.273,And you take the position that is a waiver under Illinois law.
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,2093.273,2093.514,--Yes.
1985.84-6807,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2105.572,2112.806,Do you agree there was an agreement by the judge to limit the use of the confessions?
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,2112.806,2116.299,It is only a statement--
1985.84-6807,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2116.299,2119.16,And where would we find that in the material before us?
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,2119.16,2127.234,"--In the transcript, and I don't have the page reference, but I could provide it in a supplemental brief, in the very first few pages of the trial transcript."
1985.84-6807,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2255.298,2265.326,"The evidence as to Odessa is not as clear, is it, against Ms. Lee, based on her own confession alone?"
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,2265.326,2269.939,"Yes... no, Justice O'Connor, I would not agree with that."
1985.84-6807,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2335.633,2338.885,"Will you clarify some trial facts for me, please, ma'am?"
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,2338.885,2340.036,"If I may, Justice Powell."
1985.84-6807,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2340.036,2342.998,Did Thomas testify in his own defense?
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,2342.998,2344.639,Only as part of the suppression hearing.
1985.84-6807,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2358.059,2364.193,"So although Thomas was in the courtroom... well, he was in the courtroom."
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,2367.014,2369.847,"No effort at all, which makes the--"
1985.84-6807,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2369.847,2377.88,"If she had undertaken to use him as a witness, he could have invoked his privilege, could he not?"
1985.84-6807,1,29044,jill_wine_banks,,2377.88,2378.822,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-6807,2,20819,dan_w_evers,,3020.123,3021.632,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-6807,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3021.632,3039.494,"Previously you said you thought it was clear under Illinois law that if there had been separate trials, the co-defendant's confession would not have been admissible."
1985.84-6807,2,20819,dan_w_evers,,3039.494,3042.066,"Yes, Your Honor, and I think--"
1985.84-6807,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3042.066,3043.167,I take it your--
1985.84-6807,2,20819,dan_w_evers,,3043.167,3056.414,"--there are a number of Illinois Supreme Court cases which we cite in the reply brief, People versus Clark, People versus Buckminister, People versus Eddington, and other cases--"
1985.84-6807,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3056.414,3058.638,--And you think the same rule applies in a joint trial.
1985.84-6807,2,20819,dan_w_evers,,3058.638,3061.199,"--In a joint trial, Your Honor--"
1985.84-6807,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3061.199,3064.681,"Well, it is admissible against the one defendant, but not the other."
1985.84-6807,2,20819,dan_w_evers,,3064.681,3085.844,"--That would be governed by Illinois Pattern Jury Instruction Number 3.08, in which it instructs that one co-defendant's statement is not to be used against another, and that is the standard instruction which I believe is also used in federal trials."
1985.84-6807,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3085.844,3089.567,Is that backed up by state supreme court cases?
1985.84-6807,2,20819,dan_w_evers,,3089.567,3091.099,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-6807,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3123.931,3138.908,Do you have... is there an Illinois case in which there was a bench trial of two defendants and it held that the confession of one is not admissible against the other?
1985.84-6807,2,20819,dan_w_evers,,3138.908,3146.394,I am not aware of their saying that it is not admissible as far as an Illinois Supreme Court case.
1985.84-6807,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3350.398,3357.461,Do you suggest any significant or material differences in the utterances of the two defendants?
1985.84-6807,2,20819,dan_w_evers,,3357.461,3361.354,There are significant differences in that Millie Lee--
1985.84-6807,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3361.354,3362.295,Bearing on guilt?
1985.84-6807,2,20819,dan_w_evers,,3362.295,3363.916,--Bearing on guilt.
