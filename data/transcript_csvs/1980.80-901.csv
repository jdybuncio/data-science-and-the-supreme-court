1980.80-901,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.324,We'll hear arguments next in Donovan v. Dewey.
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,68.676,72.237,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,268.953,294.226,"Mr. Geller, you're doubtless familiar with the Steagald case that this Court decided a couple of weeks ago, where it said that law enforcement officers, even though they possess an arrest warrant, could not go into the house of a third person to seize the person for whom they had the warrant."
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,312.046,329.398,"I think if Steagald were applicable to this sort of case, the district court's opinion would have a lot to be said for it, but we don't read Steagald as wiping out the exception to the warrant requirement exemplified by cases such as Biswell, for pervasively regulated businesses."
1980.80-901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,329.398,334.381,What about a pervasively regulated business like organized crime?
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,334.381,341.191,"Well, Congress has not attempted to pass that sort of a statute."
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,366.273,374.973,Do you think for the Biswell doctrine to apply that pervasive regulation is sufficient?
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,382.83,396.152,"Well, I think... there are two key cases that... of course, we rely on Colonnade and Biswell, and there's a tendency which we have fallen into as much as the other party does, to lump the two exceptions together in sort of a Colonnade-Biswell exception."
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,410.069,411.724,That was of alcoholic beverages?
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,411.724,412.677,--Alcoholic beverages.
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,440.321,442.883,And that involved commercial traffic in firearms?
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,442.883,443.274,--Firearms.
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.349,452.707,"There was a history, and it was pervasive."
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,452.707,465.906,"--There was a history, there was current pervasive regulation, and the Court then went on to say that when you have that sort of a situation, the Court will determine reasonableness by looking at the enforcement needs and privacy guarantees of the statute."
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,465.906,467.78,"Well, what's that kind of a situation?"
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,469.311,471.153,"There was a history, as there is--"
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,471.153,485.944,"And, in other words, do you think Congress could enact legislation today, pervasively regulating a certain element of industry and providing for inspections and searches and seizures without a warrant?"
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,493.191,506.17,"--No, I don't think, I think that I have to know more about the situation, Justice Stewart, but I think if Congress can, consistent with its other constitutional powers, move into an area for the purposes of regulation, and if--"
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,506.17,513.496,"And if the regulation is pervasive enough, it can provide for warrantless searches and seizures without violating the Constitution, is that it?"
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,513.496,531.691,"--If the enforcement needs of the statute require warrantless searches and if there are privacy guarantees in the statute that take the place of a warrant, as there was in Biswell and as we contend that there is in this case... although in this case we also are dealing with an industry which--"
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,531.691,539.564,"Of course, my brother Rehnquist would suggest that the police would always say that their enforcement needs require them to violate the Fourth Amendment."
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,539.564,544.702,"--Well, we're not talking here, first of all, about any criminal enforcement."
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,605.052,626.715,"So, in other words, your answer to my hypothetical case of Congress enacting a statute pervasively regulating an industry and providing for the warrantless searches and seizures of elements in that industry without securing a warrant, if there was a showing that there was a need to do so--"
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,626.715,627.903,If there was an urgent federal interest.
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,627.903,628.84,--There would be no constitutional violation.
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,631.759,632.04,"Yes, yes."
1980.80-901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,637.023,642.99,"Well, then, Kahriger was rightly decided and Coin and Currency was wrongly decided?"
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,665.684,675.508,"I'm not familiar with that line of cases, Justice Rehnquist, or its relevance to--"
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,675.508,679.474,"They involve compulsory self-incrimination, those cases."
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,687.065,687.581,--Well--
1980.80-901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,687.581,698.296,Does that make any sort of warrantless inspection of a nightclub that might be thought to be carrying on gambling?
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,698.296,710.228,"--No, I think... let me say, first of all, we think that the length of regulation and the pervasiveness of regulation are relevant to what are the reasonable expectations of privacy that a person in that industry may have."
1980.80-901,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,725.237,727.143,Let me try another hypothetical on you.
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,760.442,763.034,There would be nothing unconstitutional on the face of such a scheme.
1980.80-901,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,775.327,787.697,"There is such a statute with respect to constructing bridges, I think, across any navigable stream, that federal inspectors may come on the site and inspect it at any time without a warrant."
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,796.881,803.924,I think in that sort of a situation there's a minimal expectation of privacy and it's certainly reasonable for those sorts of inspections to take place.
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,821.198,827.899,"Of course, your expectation of privacy, that's kind of a circular argument."
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,845.627,846.361,"That's right, for that."
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,846.361,849.546,But that doesn't mean you have no standing to attack it.
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,849.546,850.296,Not at all.
1980.80-901,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.527,866.009,"Mr. Geller, to what extent is the requirement of a license relevant in these cases?"
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,867.649,869.898,"Well, the appellees--"
1980.80-901,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,869.898,872.912,It was in the gun case.
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,872.912,876.755,"--Well, there was a licensed gun dealer in that case."
1980.80-901,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,878.645,883.612,You could either agree to a search in advance or you don't get a license?
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,883.612,887.375,"--Well, I think the same argument could be made in the mining industry, Justice White."
1980.80-901,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,898.105,902.603,"By the way, are we talking here about the stone quarry business or all mines?"
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,902.603,907.461,We're talking about the non-coal portion of the mining industry.
1980.80-901,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.461,910.194,"So all non-coal mines you're talking about, not just stones?"
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,910.194,911.46,This case involves stone.
1980.80-901,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,911.46,919.83,Not just the ones that perhaps would be where your enforcement needs to be very great because the danger to health is very great.
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,924.751,926.532,"Well, there may be some cases at the fringe."
1980.80-901,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,942.65,944.086,What about the coal?
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,947.148,949.162,"No, no."
1980.80-901,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,950.334,955.02,"We had a combination of cases four years ago on that subject, didn't we?"
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,955.02,973.465,"Yes, there are no warrants either under... this Act involves the coal portion of the mining industry as well, but neither these appellees nor any other plaintiff has chosen to attack that section of the statute, presumably on the theory that that portion of the industry has been subject to pervasive government regulation even though--"
1980.80-901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,973.465,977.855,"I suppose there's a greater privacy interest in a coal mine than there is in a big open pit, isn't there?"
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,979.493,991.833,"--Well, I think one of the things that I think is, I should say, is that the distinction between coal and non-coal portions of the industry is not coterminous with the distinction between underground and surface mines."
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1002.548,1010.545,But there has historically been pervasive regulation of the coal mining industry.
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1010.545,1011.56,--Yes.
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1011.56,1017.276,And at least in this case there's no attack upon warrantless searches provided by the statute of coal mines.
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1017.276,1017.495,There is not.
1980.80-901,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1031.224,1033.989,Particularly this state of this particular entity.
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1033.989,1040.471,"Wisconsin had been regulating this quarry since 1922, but other states had gone back even further than that."
1980.80-901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1070.786,1072.676,"The federal interest is precisely the same as in OSHA, isn't it?"
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1072.676,1073.91,--Excuse me?
1980.80-901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.91,1077.674,It's precisely the same federal interest as was present in the OSHA case?
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1077.674,1084.03,"Well, except that we're dealing here with an industry that Congress found to be among the most hazardous in the nation."
1980.80-901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1090.388,1095.776,In OSHA they found a history of all sorts of dangerous things that justified the same program.
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1095.776,1105.46,"--Well, as to certain portions of the industries that OSHA covered, but OSHA also covered a lot of industries that weren't all that dangerous--"
1980.80-901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1105.46,1110.239,"What you're saying is, there's a constitutional distinction between something that's very dangerous and something that's just pretty dangerous?"
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1110.239,1115.44,"--Well, I think one of the tests that Biswell sets up is whether there's an urgent federal interest for the warrantless searches."
1980.80-901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1115.44,1120.827,"Well, would you say that there's an urgent federal interest in the apprehension of felons?"
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1120.827,1122.186,Yes.
1980.80-901,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1216.758,1220.851,"Well, the Government didn't think so in Barlow."
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1220.851,1232.659,--I think that the Court found that there was not the factual basis that the Government thought there was for a need for warrantless inspections in the Barlow's situation.
1980.80-901,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1313.782,1316.656,"Well, if they sent a new guy maybe they'd let him in."
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1321.778,1323.278,"I think that's right, Justice Blackmun."
1980.80-901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1479.996,1503.143,What if Congress had endowed the Drug Enforcement Administration with the same sort of power saying that it's notoriously easy to flush drugs down the toilet and therefore you're entitled to perform a maximum of 12 warrantless searches of disco dancing places every year?
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1506.36,1508.469,"No, we don't want to get around the Fourth Amendment."
1980.80-901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1538.237,1544.736,I thought you were arguing now about the congressional finding of urgency and necessity to--
1980.80-901,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1544.736,1554.309,"I am, but I think that's just one portion of the Biswell test, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and we think that for a statute to meet the Biswell test it has to satisfy all of these criteria, not just one."
1980.80-901,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1649.082,1659.548,Mr. Croak--
1980.80-901,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1659.548,1661.515,Let me put to you at the outset a question I put to your friend.
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,1692.737,1693.799,"No, I don't think so."
1980.80-901,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1699.344,1703.03,"Well, there is a pervasive degree of regulation at the local level."
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,1703.03,1707.95,"--Yes, but I don't think that... at least so far--"
1980.80-901,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1707.95,1711.558,"And it is random, it is random inspection by building inspectors."
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,1726.771,1730.239,"--Well, I think Camara and See answered that question, though."
1980.80-901,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1754.057,1760.274,"But under your argument, it wouldn't be valid the day the legislation was enacted but it might be valid 25 years later."
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,1762.756,1772.128,"I see your point, and you only gave my friend here ten years to worry about, but I don't think the ten or the 25 is dispositive of the issue."
1980.80-901,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1844.537,1852.252,"Well, the history of local inspection of buildings is at least 100 years old, is it not?"
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,1852.252,1853.251,--Yes.
1980.80-901,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1853.251,1855.532,"Well, isn't that pervasive?"
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,1855.532,1857.468,I don't think so.
1980.80-901,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1872.212,1884.552,"Well but the history of this country is that a great deal of regulation that once was considered entirely local has, as you well know, in the last 40 years become pretty much federalized; maybe even more than 40."
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,1884.552,1889.955,--I don't dispute that and I don't imagine we're here today--
1980.80-901,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1889.955,1891.08,I'm not arguing in favor of it.
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,1891.08,1891.939,--No.
1980.80-901,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1891.939,1893.47,I'm just observing the history of the fact.
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,1893.47,1909.384,"I think we'd all agree it's a fact and we won't discuss our own particular views on the wisdom, but the fact is that if this approach is used, I suppose one could fashion an argument that every business in America today is pervasively regulated."
1980.80-901,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1909.384,1921.365,Your argument is that the history of pervasive regulation has to be regulation by the jurisdiction that is now asserting the right to search and seize without a warrant?
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,1921.365,1921.942,That's right.
1980.80-901,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1922.77,1923.707,In order to come under the Biswell--
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,1923.707,1927.471,"--Piggyback on the federal, and the federal on the state or the local; that's my argument."
1980.80-901,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2168.186,2180.914,"--I just took another look at Camara, which you seem to rely on, Mr. Croak, and that didn't involve the building inspection while a tall building was in the process of being constructed."
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2188.568,2194.44,"If you're asking me, do I see the distinction between a completed and an uncompleted building, no, I don't."
1980.80-901,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2196.362,2207.967,"Suppose Congress, after holding some hearings, recited the great incidence of the fires out in the gambling town out west somewhere... I forget the name of the town."
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2207.967,2208.185,Las Vegas?
1980.80-901,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2208.185,2210.559,Las Vegas.
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2253.699,2255.339,Maybe I'm not making myself clear.
1980.80-901,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2258.119,2275.877,"Random inspection of the building while it's under construction to see that they're using the proper amount of cement, the proper sealed structure, in compliance with prescribed standards, and fire safety provisions, and so forth?"
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2275.877,2281.952,"If you're asking me, may government legislate to provide for that inspection?"
1980.80-901,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2287.295,2288.31,"Yes, random."
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2288.31,2289.184,My answer is no.
1980.80-901,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2289.184,2290.215,Random inspection.
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2290.215,2314.221,"I don't have any problem... I think, probably somewhere in OSHA there is a provision which today is permitting government inspectors to look at the tall building that you talk about, but as this Court said in Barlow's, such an inspection requires a warrant."
1980.80-901,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2314.221,2321.031,"Well, is your view of the matter that that is a federalism proposition, or view, that that's a matter of local and state government--"
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2321.031,2324.404,"No, I do not maintain that."
1980.80-901,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2340.882,2345.647,"--Well, how about, once again, the nuclear."
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2347.489,2353.487,I think it's all right because I can't conceive that anybody could reasonably argue that that's not pervasively regulated.
1980.80-901,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2359.423,2363.406,"Well, is it because it's always been, or that it is now?"
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2363.406,2365.717,That it always has.
1980.80-901,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2365.717,2368.636,I for one am not too worried about lives 20 years ago.
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2371.027,2377.056,I feel it's always been... it was pervasively developed by Government and it is pervasively--
1980.80-901,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2377.056,2379.226,"The first year, was it okay?"
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2383.63,2389.816,"--I think so, Mr. Justice Marshall, because in my view the regulation came with the development of the industry."
1980.80-901,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2389.816,2395.376,"Well, if that's the point, it has to go along with it, we can never learn?"
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2399.047,2409.51,"I think my position is... although I see your point, what you're suggesting, my position remains that the nuclear industry is pervasively regulated, however, but I appreciate your point."
1980.80-901,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2409.51,2410.854,"Yes, you've got a problem; you've got a problem."
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2422.381,2422.756,That's correct.
1980.80-901,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2429.847,2439.843,"At one time there was a statutory prohibition against any private individuals even engaging in the nuclear power industry, wasn't there, before 1954?"
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2439.843,2443.279,"I'm not familiar with that but it wouldn't surprise me at all, and it doesn't offend me."
1980.80-901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2560.045,2561.434,That's exactly what the Government is arguing.
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2561.434,2562.809,--I know they are.
1980.80-901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2562.809,2564.215,The statute is a permanent search warrant.
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2564.215,2572.259,But they're telling us that the equivalent of the search warrant hearing is the hearing on injunctive relief.
1980.80-901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2574.336,2584.035,"They really don't even need that, if they're right under the statute; that the statute itself is a permanent authorization to go in without notice or without--"
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2584.035,2584.488,--Yes.
1980.80-901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2613.695,2620.912,"--Mr. Croak, just as a matter of information, is there anything in this statute... and perhaps I should know from the papers, that talks about inspecting records."
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2625.83,2635.14,There is a record provision of the records that are required to be kept and to be made available to the Secretary.
1980.80-901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2636.561,2651.15,"Well, can they make... if they win this case, will they be able to not only come in and look around and test the amount of dust in the air and that sort of thing but also can they say, we want to see your records for the last three weeks of how much dust your own tests showed and that sort of thing?"
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2651.15,2651.726,I believe so.
1980.80-901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2651.726,2652.445,They could do that.
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2652.445,2653.476,"Yes, I believe so."
1980.80-901,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2653.476,2657.225,"On your permanent search warrant, there are some."
1980.80-901,1,23732,francis_r_croak,,2660.457,2661.864,I'm sorry?
1980.80-901,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3316.37,3318.995,"Just one or two things, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-901,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3510.356,3511.824,"Thank you, gentlemen."
