1971.70-86,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,24.174,"We will hear arguments next in number 86, United States against Tucker."
1971.70-86,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,28.55,31.206,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-86,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,398.69,406.688,"Are the prior convictions which are at issue here, were they pleaded guilty or not?"
1971.70-86,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,406.688,412.228,The 1938 auto theft conviction was a plea of guilty.
1971.70-86,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,441.865,443.736,Was that a plea of guilty?
1971.70-86,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,443.736,451.939,"I believe it was, but I simply do not know because I had thought that that conviction was not being challenged before this Court."
1971.70-86,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,485.348,490.009,What did the Court of Appeals in this case say just referring to the two?
1971.70-86,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,490.009,512.696,"The court -- the District Court simply held that the use of priors, un-counseled priors without making specific findings, but acknowledging the United States' admission with respect to the 36, 38 and 46 priors that they were un-counseled, said that the use of un-counseled priors in cross examination would be bad."
1971.70-86,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,512.696,523.719,But do you not think it makes a real difference in this case where your argument is to whether the prior convictions at issue were pleads of guilty or not?
1971.70-86,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,523.719,528.473,I do not think that that is a dispositive consideration Mr. Justice White.
1971.70-86,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,540.043,546.72,Did he deny the -- did he deny the previous convictions or the crimes at the Trial?
1971.70-86,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,546.72,564.684,"At the Trial, and I think this is quite significant, he neither denied the convictions nor as I want to say with respect to the 1938 and 1946 convictions, he not only did not deny those convictions, he admitted those convictions, but he want further, he admitted the underlying conduct."
1971.70-86,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.684,568.265,"So, he not only did not deny the underlying conduct, but he admitted (Voice Overlap)"
1971.70-86,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,568.265,583.12,"He affirmatively admitted the underlying conduct and I think that insofar as there might be a question about the reliability of un-counseled convictions, this cannot be considered in this -- in the facts of this case."
1971.70-86,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,743.181,744.716,Just hearsay information to --
1971.70-86,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,744.716,758.626,"Just hearsay information, Your Honor and this Court and the judge relied upon it, said he relied upon it, acknowledged that there had been no convictions resulting from those report of the other burglaries and as you recall sentenced William to death."
1971.70-86,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,971.235,977.066,"Or, by the suppression of evidence of some heroin seized from this person?"
1971.70-86,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,977.066,981.35,"That it -- I think that is an important distinction, Your Honor."
1971.70-86,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1031.579,1033.34,Whoever was said that?
1971.70-86,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1033.34,1033.867,I am sorry?
1971.70-86,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1033.867,1034.941,Who said that?
1971.70-86,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1034.941,1038.236,That is -- there is a circuit course -- circuit court case.
1971.70-86,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1038.236,1040.989,What Circuit?
1971.70-86,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1040.989,1043.95,"Your Honor, if the case is a (Voice Overlap) Vertigo."
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,1519.214,1522.934,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-86,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1581.403,1599.885,"Are these three prior convictions, the ones that appear on 24 and 25 that is in 1938 breaking in and stealing a car, 1946, a jewelry store and 19 -- later period, not identified, breaking in to another store in New Orleans?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,1600.849,1602.979,Those are not the same three Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-86,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1603.613,1621.91,"What difference does it make, will you tell me what difference that makes, what the circumstances the conviction were when at the time of this hearing he affirmatively described his conduct to the judge?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,1621.91,1633.278,"Well, let me say -- state it at the outset that Mr. Tucker as you will note in his in propria persona written opposition to writ of certiorari, admits guilt of one of those three priors.(Voice Overlap)"
1971.70-86,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1633.278,1636.685,"But now, is this incorrect?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,1638.396,1639.599,"No sir, it is not."
1971.70-86,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1672.594,1675.985,Do you think his language really is ambiguous?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,1743.509,1744.232,Not at all.
1971.70-86,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1772.614,1785.966,"Well, if the invalid conviction is supported now by what amounts now to a judicial confession in an open Court at the time he is represented by counsel, would you still maintain that?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,1785.966,1788.22,"Yes, but for two reasons."
1971.70-86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1860.104,1879.157,"As to the third of these convictions, the one from which he fled when he was in the hospital, fled from California, he said that right at the time of sentencing as I read it that he was innocent of that, looking at page 35 of the defendant’s colloquy with the sentencing judge."
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,1879.157,1879.539,Mister --
1971.70-86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1879.539,1880.664,Do I read that inaccurately?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,1880.664,1882.829,"I do believe you do, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1889.896,1890.349,Yeah.
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,1890.349,1904.875,"“And the five year sentence that was given me,” that is 1950, “I was convicted by a judge, the same judge that gave me the five, gave me the 10 to start with,” that is 1938 in Florida “and I was innocent of” and he stops."
1971.70-86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1904.875,1906.088,"And he says, that is neither here and there?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,1906.088,1908.634,"That is neither here and there, and --"
1971.70-86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1908.634,1912.266,But I mean he found me guilty and subsequently I escaped and came out here?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,1912.266,1926.939,"I think it susceptible of the interpretation consistent with his in propria persona opposition to the writ, that he considers both of his Florida convictions improper in that, I was innocent both was what he is going to say."
1971.70-86,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2033.848,2042.242,But he could not judge that I was guilty then I have to go into such detail as to say it was in 1936 Ford?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2042.242,2054.219,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I have corresponded extensively with Mr. Tucker and this material is off the record, I wish I could refer to it before you now."
1971.70-86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2120.898,2126.753,This colloquy on 24 was -- did occur during the course of the trial before the (Voice Overlap).
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2126.753,2128.06,"Yes, and before the Jury."
1971.70-86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2128.06,2134.941,"And then the what begins on page 27 is at the sentencing proceedings, is that right or the (Voice Overlap)"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2134.941,2138.421,Yes! What I say is that the agent is present in Court.
1971.70-86,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2148.229,2159.839,"Mr. Reppy, if, I realize the time is going by, but I suppose that the court had given him something less than the maximum sentence, would you be here?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2164.314,2168.652,"I do not --Mr. Tucker would be out of prison, sir, to begin with, but assuming that the time difference --"
1971.70-86,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2168.652,2171.793,(Voice overlap)
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2171.793,2172.974,I would be here.
1971.70-86,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2200.938,2207.009,"Well, first of all of course, if it were not too much less than the maximum, he might still be incarcerated?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2207.009,2207.485,That is correct.
1971.70-86,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2207.485,2216.112,For 23 years and but -- it is your position that North Carolina versus Pearce has application in this kind of situation?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2216.112,2234.304,"Well, it is certainly not necessary to decided, but I would assume so that what the Court wrote there permits a very limited consideration of prison incident so long is there actual proof of them and they are not hearsay."
1971.70-86,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2236.115,2245.905,"Mr. Reppy, you really want us to hold responsibility of state judges to make findings before they sentence?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2245.905,2246.862,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-86,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2246.862,2250.37,"Well, I thought that is what you said?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2250.37,2267.929,"No, Your Honor, the findings I feel should be made upon a Section 2255 motion if it is a federal prisoner or upon the state court habeas motion when a state prisoner goes before the judge and answers, Your Honor, you considered information that was wrong."
1971.70-86,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2323.261,2330.195,What I do not understand how we can require this binding every time a judge sentences somebody?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2330.195,2332.278,"It would be useful if he made it then, but it is not necessary."
1971.70-86,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2332.278,2336.912,"I did not say that but how can we compel it, just because it is useful?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2336.912,2339.156,I would not compel it Mr. Justice Marshall.
1971.70-86,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2339.156,2344.726,But you do not think we should compel it in the Federal Court before we go into state courts compelling it?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2344.726,2358.324,"Well, it is not necessary that this federal case here be extended to the states because this is a federal conviction and it is arises under 2255 which allows for a non constitutional collateral attack on the sentence."
1971.70-86,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2358.324,2359.148,That is right!
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2359.148,2372.706,"And if your feeling is that you wish to limit this principle to the Federal Judicial System, I think it is quite proper to do so and if there is precedent would be (Inaudible) case in the Court of Appeals which I have cited cited in respondent’s brief."
1971.70-86,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2372.706,2386.085,Do you realize that I would assume that every federal district has federal procedure as to handle pre-sentence reports?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2386.085,2388.494,"I am certainly sure that is so, but I am not certain --"
1971.70-86,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2388.494,2395.957,But you realize that in most districts today the prosecution does not have anything to do with it?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2395.957,2414.088,"Well, I was not aware of that, but I think that the -- regardless of what procedure was originally used at sentencing, the procedure mentioned in the Fifth Circuit decision of Pat versus United States in 1966 is the desirable procedure to handle a collateral attack."
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2588.979,2594.561,What would you suggest if coming out the same judge to try to give the sentence there?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2594.561,2597.527,I would suggest that if that judge were available perhaps in retirement.
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.527,2598.645,What if he is not?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2601.346,2615.828,"If he is deceased, the -- a sentencing judge or District Court judge hearing a 2255 motion can only put himself in the position of a sentencing judge and said would not have affected me and I do believe Mister --"
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2615.828,2624.777,"Why would not you just set aside the sentence and send it back to a Sentencing Court for re-sentencing before whatever -- whoever, whatever Judge is available?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2624.777,2627.624,If the opinion is why should not this Court?
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2627.624,2628.173,No.
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2648.906,2654.609,"That would be proper and it would seem that he is at the sentencing court, he can do the re-sentencing himself."
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2661.669,2665.024,"Well, you would not re-sentencing just in the 2255 proceedings, would you?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2665.024,2668.153,He would put on a new role by what I understand.
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.947,2677.982,Or to get up the -- I suppose you have to have sentencing hearing --
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2677.982,2684.362,Counsel would -- at sentencing counsel would be available.
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2713.75,2722.041,"What if he had not been on that opinion, how could he have denied the motion?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2722.041,2726.014,He could have misunderstood what Mr. Tucker was seeking.
1971.70-86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2735.479,2737.79,Did you say petition for re-hearing?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2737.79,2739.895,Petition for re-hearing.
1971.70-86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2739.895,2747.385,I suggest that judge Harris may have thought indeed it was and trusted the use of these on the issue of guilt rather than on the issue of sentencing (Voice Overlap)
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2747.385,2751.496,If he had read it -- if he had read it casually.
1971.70-86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2751.496,2753.425,Is that what you are suggesting (Voice Overlap)
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2753.425,2759.491,"In all candor though Mr. Justice Brennan, it is a well written petition for rehearing and judge Harris should not have mistaken it for it was."
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2759.491,2765.769,"Well, on that -- let us assume that he just said petition for rehearing denied."
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2770.88,2784.929,I think that has procedural error in that we simply do not have a record or appeal and it is simply a matter of the desirable procedure to cut down on the appeals that go on in the 22 -- collateral attack proceedings.
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2794.284,2798.962,We do not require on Judges passing on the voluntariness of the confession.
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2826.177,2835.405,"That maybe so, when it simply says denied, but here we have raises no new issue and yet on the face of it there is the potential for prejudice."
1971.70-86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2855.295,2857.649,This sentencing was back in 1953?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2857.649,2858.71,That is correct.
1971.70-86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2858.71,2860.659,"Judge Harris, that is the George Harris?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2860.659,2860.98,Yes.
1971.70-86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2860.98,2862.092,Who still living in (Voice Overlap)
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2862.092,2863.005,He is still there.
1971.70-86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2863.979,2868.092,Ah! And the -- it was 25 year sentence?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2868.092,2870.226,"Yes it was, the maximum."
1971.70-86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2870.226,2872.051,Where is Mr. Tucker now?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2874.297,2892.298,"He remains in the Federal Prison in Washington and although, he states that he is entitled to release in 1972, Mr. Tuttle advices that he has to check with the Bureau of Prisons and that the mandatory release date appears to be 1973."
1971.70-86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2896.076,2900.845,He has been release in the light of Judgment of the Court of Appeals?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2900.845,2904.391,"No, he has not, Your Honor as I understand it."
1971.70-86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2908.195,2911.458,He is in prison on this same charge (Voice Overlap) conviction?
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2911.458,2913.281,That is correct.
1971.70-86,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2913.281,2919.564,(Voice Overlap) I have the appendix in my hand and I am looking at pages 24 and 25.

1971.70-86,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2937.547,2952.032,"The way I understand your argument to be, that he could not take into account the cumulative admissions and statements made as reflected in those three pages?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2952.032,2953.454,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1971.70-86,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2983.256,2985.844,I do not read this.
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,2999.455,3005.649,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, a man does not contest his guilt of the jewelry store robbery."
1971.70-86,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3005.649,3008.211,"Well, two, two jewelry store robberies?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,3008.211,3029.257,"The 1946 jewelry store robbery; he does and he never did admit at any point in the proceedings guilt of the 1950 Florida conviction and as Mr. Tuttle has noted, judge Harris has never rule on its validity, although, the validity of question was before judge Harris and for that reason."
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3029.257,3033.997,"It seems to have subject to Fresno, California?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,3033.997,3034.237,No.
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3056.304,3066.444,These were the California proceedings relating to conduct after the conduct for which he is not --
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,3066.444,3071.736,I am not certain -- I do not think the record indicates which bank robbery occurred at what point in time.
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3071.736,3072.284,In any event --
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,3072.284,3073.907,"One of the most federal, excuse me?"
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3073.907,3079.055,In any event they are the ones that judge Harris said he would consider when he was --
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,3079.055,3079.388,"Yes, --"
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3079.388,3080.536,During the Trail at sentence --
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,3080.536,3084.915,"It is extremely ambiguous Mr. Justice White, what judge Harris said he would not consider."
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3091.922,3094.299,But he was convicted after sentencing here.
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,3096.496,3097.242,"Yes, he was."
1971.70-86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3097.242,3101.154,"And that he is on probation -- he never served any time there, I take it?"
1971.70-86,1,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,3101.154,3110.929,"I am not certain whether he was serving, whether was moved down to a California prison to serve the two Federal and State Sentences consecutively."
1971.70-86,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3321.439,3322.283,Go ahead (Inaudible).

1971.70-86,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3387.12,3387.955,"Thank you, Mr. Reppy."
1971.70-86,2,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,3392.59,3394.248,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-86,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3543.577,3550.854,Was this back in 1953 when the procedures may have been in the county were a little different.
1971.70-86,2,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,3555.732,3557.042,That is correct.
1971.70-86,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3565.381,3565.859,(Inaudible).
1971.70-86,2,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,3565.859,3569.987,-- of whether conclusiveness would create any bar.
1971.70-86,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3617.526,3620.733,He does not have a California detainer on him(Voice Overlap).
1971.70-86,2,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,3620.733,3626.325,"No, because he was successful in first attacking his habitual criminal finding."
1971.70-86,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3634.818,3637.756,"All I wanted to know is he under the detainer, is he not?"
1971.70-86,2,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,3637.756,3638.231,I am sorry.
1971.70-86,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3642.781,3651.608,"But he -- did I understand that he -- if he were released in Federal prison today, he would be still on probation from California?(Inaudible)"
1971.70-86,2,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,3651.608,3655.403,I -- I do not know the answer to that.
1971.70-86,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3655.403,3658.392,"Mr. Tuttle, Mr. Reppy is representing that."
1971.70-86,3,46036,william_a_reppy_jr,,3658.392,3680.761,"Finally, I would simply repeat that it is quite clear to the Government in this case that any problem about the reliance on these sentences, the questions has been answered by the judge himself when he said -- when he denied the motion to reconsider sentence on the basis of the use of those priors and I think, no useful purpose could conceivably served by asking him to say it all over again."
1971.70-86,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3681.437,3682.196,Thank you.
