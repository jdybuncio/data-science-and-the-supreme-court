1992.92-166,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.857,"We'll hear argument now in 92-166, Keene Corporation v. The United States."
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,8.578,12.191,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.92-166,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,48.885,59.623,"When you say, repudiating long-standing precedent, Mr. Taranto, you mean Federal circuit or Court of Claims precedent, right?"
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,59.623,59.813,Yes.
1992.92-166,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,147.131,151.121,"On what general principle of law do you base this argument, Mr. Taranto?"
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,156.357,157.048,No.
1992.92-166,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,171.189,180.755,"We wouldn't take a case here, I don't think, to hear it argued that the Ninth Circuit had failed to follow stare decisis in connection with a Ninth Circuit precedent."
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,180.755,184.799,"--No, I think that's right, but this, I think, presents two unique circumstances."
1992.92-166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,215.349,227.146,"But I... you would still say that even if there hadn't been a precedent until this one, that the court of appeals just had it wrong."
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,227.146,228.378,"Yes, I think that's right."
1992.92-166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,229.96,240.406,"And since it would be the only court to construe that statute, you couldn't wait for a conflict."
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,240.406,241.818,--That's right.
1992.92-166,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,252.885,258.23,Are you in any position to make an argument that Congress might be deemed to have accepted that interpretation?
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,270.17,273.27,"Yes, we do have a version of that argument."
1992.92-166,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,320.303,335.012,"Well, did Congress overhaul the statutes governing the Court of Claims and the Federal circuit in 1982 other than just do what was necessary to create the new court?"
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,335.012,342.997,It did make a number of substantive amendments in looking through the entire range of statutes.
1992.92-166,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,371.968,375.938,Amendments you say that weren't occasioned by the creation of the new court.
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,375.938,377.01,"--Yes, that's right."
1992.92-166,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,420.317,427.293,"But you wouldn't need a special statute, would you, if all Congress wanted was the application of claim preclusion law?"
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,434.631,439.452,What 1500 does is apply before any judgment is reached.
1992.92-166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,461.83,470.686,But would that interpretation that you've just explained have satisfied the congressional concern with the cotton litigation that prompted this statute?
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,470.686,471.704,--I think it would.
1992.92-166,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,553.359,554.16,But the--
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,593.627,597.45,I think it was when you take time into account.
1992.92-166,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,623.837,627.31,But Los Angeles Shipbuilding was decided after Casman.
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,627.31,628.962,I think within a year of that.
1992.92-166,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,628.962,629.112,Yes.
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,629.112,655.072,"But shortly after that, it became the established rule, repeated over and over again in the Court of Claims, that if a litigant was forced into two separate suits, they were not to be treated as the same, and I certainly don't know of a single instance... and I don't think the Government has cited one... where any litigant was thrown out under 1500 after Los Angeles Shipyard, which may simply have not fully appreciated Casman."
1992.92-166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,672.922,679.267,"Well, has the CA Fed up to now recognized that rule they're talking about?"
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,679.267,687.495,"It first moved away from that rule in a predecessor of this case, the Johns-Manville case, and then clarified that it really meant--"
1992.92-166,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,687.495,688.914,"Well, did it ever accept it?"
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,688.914,695.189,"--The CA Fed... it did, in I think the Boston Five Cents Savings Bank case, if I recall it right."
1992.92-166,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,695.189,698.061,When was that decided?
1992.92-166,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,698.061,701.042,That was... I don't remember exactly.
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1646.016,1652.649,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-166,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1825.884,1830.375,"Well, Mr. Wallace, you say related... brought in two different courts."
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1850.38,1866.7,"--Well, that certainly was the practical reason why most of those cases were brought outside of Washington, but if they had been brought in Washington, it could not have been in the Court of Claims, which would not have had jurisdiction over suits against the officers."
1992.92-166,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1880.117,1885.901,"So you say, even if there hadn't been the venue problem, there would have been a jurisdictional problem."
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1885.901,1886.232,Exactly so.
1992.92-166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1904.835,1905.877,Let me be sure I understand--
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1905.877,1907.32,--Two different claims... related claims.
1992.92-166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1907.32,1911.243,--I just want to be sure I understand why they had to be brought in different suits.
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1923.612,1925.755,"That is correct, Mr. Justice."
1992.92-166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1925.755,1930.056,So it's just a question of really a formal procedural difference between the two suits.
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1933.038,1939.293,"Well, it was... they were being sued on the same basic set of facts, but the judgment--"
1992.92-166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1939.293,1941.416,"And would have gotten precisely the same relief in terms of dollars, at least."
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1945.998,1946.729,--That's correct.
1992.92-166,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1948.902,1963.903,"Wouldn't it have depended... you could have gotten a judgment, I suppose, against an insolvent official, and you wouldn't have gotten any money as a result of it, whereas you get a judgment against the Government, and hopefully it's not insolvent."
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1965.836,1972.279,"At least for purposes of paying judgments, that's quite correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-166,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.559,2244.313,"Well, of course, the theory that it would tie up Government resources in two suits doesn't hold water particularly."
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2261.325,2264.676,That could happen if both courts are aware of it.
1992.92-166,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2264.676,2266.579,--So that one suit will be quiescent and the other one won't.
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2266.579,2270.211,Once there was an awareness--
1992.92-166,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2270.211,2273.712,I would assume the Government would want to stay one of them.
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2273.712,2329.739,"--Well, the Government is not always aware of the overlap of these claims promptly, and this... you know, even though there may be other remedies that the Government could turn to now, and there certainly are arguments that have been put to Congress and that will continue to be put to Congress about whether section 1500 should be repealed or revised, the fact is Congress proposed a remedy of barring initially, it said, the plaintiff from filing or prosecuting in the Court of Claims, and now it says that the Court of Claims shall not have jurisdiction if there is a suit pending on a related claim in any other court."
1992.92-166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2329.739,2337.665,"If your view prevails, may the Government collaterally attack final judgments in the Court of Claims?"
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2337.665,2341.245,Well--
1992.92-166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2341.245,2343.298,Based on this new theory.
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2343.298,2348.642,--That possibility has been raised in some briefs amicus curiae.
1992.92-166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2368.915,2381.864,"Well, I take it that a judgment that lacks subject matter jurisdiction is void, and if that issue has at least not been litigated or raised by the parties, it's open to you to attack it."
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2381.864,2394.632,"But there are rules of repose, and under the Federal circuit's rules, that kind of challenge has to be raised within 2 years of the judgment, it's my understanding."
1992.92-166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2402.719,2405.331,"You certainly do not negate the possibility, I take it."
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2405.331,2408.924,"--I could not do that, Mr. Justice."
1992.92-166,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.705,2416.648,Have you got to the second reason you gave the Federal circuit?
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2416.648,2466.443,"Well, the second point in the rehearing petition was that the rule adopted by the panel in focusing on the time that the motion was ruled on was logically inconsistent with one of the exceptions that the old Court of Claims had developed to section 1500, the so-called Tecon exception, which focused exclusively on the time of filing complaints and said that so long as the complaint is filed first in the... what was then the claims court, and then is filed in the district court, it's all right for both cases to go ahead simultaneously."
1992.92-166,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2521.6,2530.927,"Section 1500, Mr. Wallace, doesn't affect claims pending in any court other than the Court of Claims, does it?"
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2530.927,2532.196,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-166,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2532.196,2540.324,"In other words, one could have pending several actions in different district courts throughout the country, and they would be in no way affected by section 1500."
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2540.324,2547.61,"It is an exclusion of jurisdiction only in the Court of Federal Claims, that is what it in terms does."
1992.92-166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2556.607,2573.789,"Mr. Wallace, at the time that Keene 1 was filed, the only suit then pending was the single action, which you said... the counterclaim that you said could be... or the cross-claim that you said could be used as a stalking horse, right?"
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2573.789,2574.669,Well--
1992.92-166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2574.669,2575.63,That involved one--
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2575.63,2576.16,--Possibly.
1992.92-166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2576.16,2577.813,--That involved one single action--
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2577.813,2578.582,That is correct.
1992.92-166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.582,2578.782,--Right.
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2593.544,2606.763,"That is both our position and the ruling of the Court of Federal Claims in this case, which held that Keene's suit was barred and did not come within any of the established exceptions."
1992.92-166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.763,2611.586,"Well, it doesn't involve the same cause of action, even remotely."
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2613.829,2621.574,"It arises from a common nucleus of operative effect, even though it's only a particle of that nucleus."
1992.92-166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2621.574,2622.315,Common nucleus?
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2633.324,2643.061,That particular one was among the hundreds that were brought before the Court of Federal Claims.
1992.92-166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.061,2649.817,"--Well, it seems to me... it's a common legal issue, but I don't see how it's the same within the language of the statute."
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2649.817,2671.011,"It's a common legal issue between the same parties, and it also is a common issue with respect to the same facts, and if you can break away individual ones into other courts, you're in a situation where the Government could be subjected to collateral estoppel effect."
1992.92-166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.264,2725.477,Collateral estoppel goes issue by issue.
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2739.228,2742.119,--Because it's a claim in respect to.
1992.92-166,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.519,2768.086,"You say if it involves any issue that's involved in that... if the other suit involves any issue that is involved in that claim, that would be collateral estoppel as to that claim it is in--"
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2768.086,2782.475,"It is in respect to, because we have to worry about defending against it, because it could be used against us in the claim in the Court of Federal Claims were it not for the bar, the jurisdictional bar."
1992.92-166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2810.815,2821.021,"--Mr. Wallace, I'm a little puzzled by the collateral estoppel argument, because it seems to me that would cut both ways, that if a... you might prevail in the other suit and get the benefit of it, also."
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2835.524,2838.325,"Well, that is true."
1992.92-166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2854.516,2855.818,Is that--
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2855.818,2856.717,--In an omnibus suit.
1992.92-166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2856.717,2863.563,"--I understand what you're... was that... is that theory of what the words, ""in respect to"" mean been expressed in any cases?"
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2868.835,2872.849,"Well, it has not been expressed in any case that I'm aware of."
1992.92-166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2875.179,2875.56,I see.
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2875.56,2927.465,"--Because the two claims are not just an individual's particular claim against the Government brought in two courts, but in the one case it was an individual claim and in the other it's an omnibus bringing together of hundreds of claims, including that one, so the facts as they happen to arise in this case were peculiar, but I do think it significant that while petitioner is... concern and complains that the court of appeals has reexamined some precedents that existed, and they were not precedents of this Court, as the Chief Justice rightly has pointed out, they were only precedents of the old Court of Claims, that both the claims court--"
1992.92-166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2927.465,2928.466,"No, but they were precedents, I suppose."
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2935.903,2945.059,"--That is correct, but we do not believe that any of them properly applied to Keene's case to begin with."
1992.92-166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2992.553,3002.439,"What you're arguing now is that they may not prevail even under the rule they advocate, but that also suggests that maybe the Federal circuit didn't have to go so far to defeat this particular claim."
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3002.439,3004.76,"Well, I think it did not."
1992.92-166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3095.249,3099.702,"This has greater authority than the Court of Claims decisions, I guess."
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3100.663,3120.996,"--No, but I think that it shows that the problems with these exceptions were well-known both to the judges and to practitioners and had caused considerable disuse of the statute, but if I may just quote the editor's summary,"
1992.92-166,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3208.177,3209.779,Did it ever get out of committee?
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3209.779,3213.953,Not the repeal provision.
1992.92-166,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3337.983,3351.023,"Well, you say with notice of the statute, and you also say with notice of the interpretation that the Court of Claims had given to the statute which you say would not have brought this within any of the exceptions."
1992.92-166,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3351.023,3351.744,"Well, that's right."
1992.92-166,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3384.074,3384.435,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1992.92-166,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3387.238,3389.538,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-166,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3458.237,3473.426,"Mr. Taranto, would you comment on what I understand Mr. Wallace's argument to be, that you really don't come within the exception, the particular exception that makes the strongest case for saying Congress said you have to sue in two different forums because you are not seeking purely equitable relief in another forum and damages in this forum?"
1992.92-166,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,3473.426,3475.106,--Let me make two points.
1992.92-166,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3521.318,3522.688,"Thank you, Mr. Taranto."
