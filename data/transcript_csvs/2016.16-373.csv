2016.16-373,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.155,"We'll hear argument this afternoon in Case 16-373, the California Public Employees' Retirement System v. ANZ Securities. Mr. Goldstein."
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,10.155,77.345,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: We ask you to hold that American Pipe tolling applies to both of the time limits set forth in Section 13 of the Securities Act, which is reproduced in a number of places, including the blue brief at the top of page 3. The other side has a tendency to invoke the phrase ""statute of repose,"" which isn't really self-defining in the phrase, in no event, when there's more going on in the statute than that, so I thought I would just start with the text, and it begins, ""no action"" -- and action is going to be the important noun here. ""No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under Section 11 unless brought"" -- and that's going to be the operative thing that has to happen -- ""within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence."" The three-year period will follow in the next sentence, but we can pause here for just a second because it teaches a lot. We know that American Pipe tolling applies to this sentence, and therefore, we know a few things, and it's conceded and everyone agrees. The action is brought on --"
2016.16-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,77.345,78.95,You're -- you're just a little fast for me.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,78.95,79.07,Sorry.
2016.16-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,79.66,80.71,I don't want to interrupt you.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,83.795,106.51,"To this sentence, that is, if you do not -- if you file your action within one year and class certification is denied, say, at year two, so we haven't gotten to three years yet, if class certification is denied two years afterwards, then American Pipe tolling applies, and a class member can opt out. I apologize for moving through that so quickly."
2016.16-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,106.51,107.29,I understand.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,107.29,160.28,"And so what we know from that, I think, is, as American Pipe tells us, that the class action complaint commences the action on behalf of each unnamed class member, and in the wording of Section 13, it brings the action on behalf of every unnamed class member. So the class complaint in our case, which was filed within a year, brought the action on our behalf. Now, the second sentence says, and it's the one at issue in the case before you, ""in no event shall any such action,"" referring to the one in the previous sentence, ""be brought to enforce a liability created under Section 11 more than three years after the security was bona fide offered to the public."" And so what happens, we believe, is that just as the action was brought by the class action complaint within one year, it was also brought within necessarily three years."
2016.16-373,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,187.1,196.62,"But the argument that you're making is the one that you describe, I think -- or am I correct, it's the one you say on page 38 of your brief is the easiest way to decide this case?"
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,196.62,197.165,"No, sir."
2016.16-373,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,199.16,200.38,Statute of repose argument?
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,200.38,203.04,"This is -- well, I -- I don't mean to confuse --"
2016.16-373,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,203.04,205.445,The -- the argument relating to the statute of repose.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,205.445,212.385,"It has nothing to do with whether the class action was still pending at the time, which is the debate over what the scope of the second question presented is."
2016.16-373,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,266.94,269.82,Has it happened in the Second Circuit?
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,269.82,271.91,It has happened in the Second Circuit.
2016.16-373,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,345.45,352.33,Is -- is it -- you said you only can bring -- bring a suit if the -- if the price -- price goes down?
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,352.33,353.04,You can only --
2016.16-373,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,353.04,362.245,"What if everybody else's stock in -- in your sector is going up 50 percent, and your stock goes up 5 percent, and you think it's because of a non-disclosure, you can't bring an action?"
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,362.245,362.69,"No, sir."
2016.16-373,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,382.2,384.37,As a practical matter or as a formal matter?
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,384.37,385.87,I believe as a formal matter.
2016.16-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,390.66,394.82,But -- but under your -- this is an attack on statutes of repose generally.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,401.86,412.395,"Sir, it is the case that the purpose of the statute of repose, we quite agree, is so that the -- all of the possible asserted liability is filed within the period in question."
2016.16-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,450.05,488.14,"That's clearly an argument in your favor, practically, but I think the other side has said that that second sentence is what's called a statute of repose, whatever historically was the case. In CTS, we made a big distinction, and said in such statutes, you cannot toll them, et cetera. And here we're not talking about the action -- you may be right that -- that -- that when you file a class action, if it's certified, that is the action brought within the time, but here there's a second action. Your client leaves the first action."
2016.16-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,508.6,509.0,All right.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,538.82,538.91,Sure.
2016.16-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,538.91,540.6,-- I would like you to deal with those actions --
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,540.6,540.78,Of course.
2016.16-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,541.01,541.64,-- those arguments.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,541.64,545.96,"Right, so the question is, is this a separate and distinct action within the meaning of Section 13."
2016.16-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,579.47,599.355,"He just asks to amend the complaint, which has now been filed 10 years later after he left, opted out a month before, and in that amendment, he says -- this was 1,000 pages, the offering, and on page 463, there are five new sentences which have false facts, we want to put them in too."
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,599.355,601.81,You're not allowed to do that under our rule or theirs.
2016.16-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,603.41,603.93,Precisely.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,603.93,621.875,"Just to return to the -- how they understand the world will operate, and that is, according to my friend, what will happen is on Day 1, as they understand the statute, a party like CalPERS will move to intervene in the class action, will file a piece of paper saying we are seeking either intervention as a matter of right or permissive intervention."
2016.16-373,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,639.88,648.195,"But, Mr. Goldstein, when I see the word ""action,"" I think of lawsuit, traditionally, and ""claim"" as the claims within the lawsuit."
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,652.755,653.83,Right.
2016.16-373,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,653.83,665.265,"Here, why -- why shouldn't we follow the plain language and the traditional understanding of the term ""action""? Congress could have use ""claims,"" which is what you're saying, it's the same claims, as Justice Breyer points out, but it's a different action."
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,665.265,677.79,"Well, I'll -- can I just say first, I think we would win even if it was lawsuit, because the lawsuit that matters, what American Pipe teaches us in terms of putting the other side on notice of the lawsuit, is the class complaint."
2016.16-373,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,730.11,730.665,Why not?
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,730.665,733.01,"Well, because it would -- because the ordinary --"
2016.16-373,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,733.01,736.495,"I mean, I don't like the policy consequences, but as a matter of plain language, why wouldn't we?"
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,736.495,737.95,"Well, because it can be either one."
2016.16-373,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,744.12,745.41,"I just don't read Jones that way, though."
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,752.33,768.28,"Well, the way I read it -- and I understand that Jones v. Bock does use the word in a couple of different ways. I think the bottom line is what you would say, is that we try and be pragmatic about what it is that Congress is attempting to accomplish when it's talk -- using a phrase like ""action"" in a limitations period."
2016.16-373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,875.18,884.73,"Mr. Goldstein, as I understand your adversary, and he'll speak for himself when he gets up, but a motion to intervene doesn't save you."
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,896.2,901.94,I -- I haven't been able -- I've been unable to determine exactly what they believe is necessary.
2016.16-373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,901.94,910.705,"That's why I said -- I'm -- I'm just wondering what happens to American Pipe, in terms of not opting out --"
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,910.705,911.03,No.
2016.16-373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,911.03,915.2,-- meaning that the Court just denies the class certification.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,925.75,927.36,They would continue.
2016.16-373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,927.36,927.82,In that one case --
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,927.82,928.98,In that one case.
2016.16-373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,928.98,932.15,-- or would they be spun off into their own jurisdictions?
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,932.15,935.24,"If we had -- well, it depends on exactly how it came to be."
2016.16-373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,955.93,956.97,If -- if class certification --
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,956.97,957.63,I apologize.
2016.16-373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,959.52,961.16,"Yes, class certification is denied."
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,961.16,961.6,Right.
2016.16-373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,961.6,972.13,"What I'm asking, would it be the same action or would they be spun off into different cases? Because often, maybe common questions are certified --"
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,972.13,972.785,Yes.
2016.16-373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,972.785,977.685,-- and the original courts maintain jurisdiction.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,977.685,986.35,"You can -- this particularly will happen in the MDL context, in which a district judge to administer the case in front of her, will direct the filing of the consolidated complaint."
2016.16-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1004.73,1012.385,"Your -- your idea -- the why is that -- is that your theory stems from Rule 23, correct?"
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1012.385,1015.28,"That American Pipe is an interpretation of Rule 23, yes, sir."
2016.16-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1015.28,1020.755,"And your -- and your rule, which is somewhat different from American Pipe, also comes from Rule 23."
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1020.755,1021.66,I believe --
2016.16-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1021.66,1022.53,Your principle.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1022.53,1023.25,Yes.
2016.16-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1027.91,1028.0,Right.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1028.0,1032.96,"This was the question of Justice Alito, but American -- they are both applications of Rule 23, yes, sir."
2016.16-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1032.96,1042.825,"My concern is that you're using Rule 23 to create, in effect, a legal right, or override a legal right, and it's very clear that Rules of Civil Procedure do not do that."
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1042.825,1043.9,That is correct.
2016.16-373,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1099.905,1102.725,Where -- where is the ambiguity in -- in no event?
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1102.725,1104.17,"Well, it's in no event, what?"
2016.16-373,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1104.17,1104.9,In no event.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1104.9,1112.64,"But, sir, if I could jut take you to the text, sir, because it's very rare that Congress just writes ""in no event."" And so what it says is, in no event something."
2016.16-373,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1130.2,1132.54,"Well, what does the term ""such action"" mean?"
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1132.54,1133.145,Okay.
2016.16-373,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1133.37,1135.93,"""In no event, shall any such action."""
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1135.93,1136.09,Yeah.
2016.16-373,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1136.09,1138.97,What do you think the action -- what is the definition of action --
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1138.97,1139.365,Well --
2016.16-373,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1139.365,1140.43,-- in that statute?
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1140.43,1141.16,Okay.
2016.16-373,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1201.53,1203.575,So it's enough that it's the same claim --
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1203.575,1204.05,Well --
2016.16-373,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1204.05,1205.365,-- as in the class action?
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1205.365,1207.58,"That is, it has to be the entirety of the claim."
2016.16-373,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1214.94,1215.09,Right.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1215.33,1221.86,-- with respect to them. What I have done when I have opted out is I have taken control over an existing --
2016.16-373,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1221.86,1230.42,"So if -- if a plaintiff in every single judicial district in the country had brought exactly the same claim, those would all be the same action, in your opinion?"
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1230.42,1230.74,No.
2016.16-373,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1263.69,1271.845,"And you think Congress had all of this in mind when it wrote, ""In no event shall any such action,"" but it thought it was also clear it didn't need to spell it out."
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1271.845,1272.73,"Oh, no, sir."
2016.16-373,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1286.59,1286.77,Yeah.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1288.865,1289.17,Yes.
2016.16-373,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1368.16,1378.47,"Mr. Goldstein, could I ask you to speak to this question of your alternative theories, because in your briefing, the non-tolling theory, if I can call it that, took pride of place."
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1383.3,1383.67,Nothing.
2016.16-373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1463.5,1466.33,It's not necessarily a question of violating Rule 23.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1470.79,1473.77,"Well, if we were to do that, I quite agree, Justice Kennedy."
2016.16-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1501.06,1502.55,But you need tolling.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1505.75,1506.155,Yes.
2016.16-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1506.155,1530.89,"If we take your second theory, we have to read the words ""be brought"" to mean something like deemed to have been brought when, but -- something like that -- but that won't solve the practical problem you raised, because there will still be cases in which class certification is denied after three years, and all these practical problems will then exist, won't they?"
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1530.89,1532.03,"They will, because --"
2016.16-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1532.03,1534.18,And we need tolling in order to stop that.
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1534.18,1535.69,I don't believe so.
2016.16-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1535.69,1535.78,Why?
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1535.78,1536.83,And let me just say that the -- the --
2016.16-373,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1536.83,1537.57,Why? Why?
2016.16-373,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1537.57,1539.33,"Because the phrase ""tolling"" here is misleading."
2016.16-373,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1582.48,1587.4,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement."
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1587.4,1597.34,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 13 of the Securities Act, in its three-year time limit, plainly provides a statute of repose."
2016.16-373,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1604.52,1620.47,"How about the Clayton Act that was at issue in American Pipe? That doesn't say ""in no event,"" but it did say -- what was the language -- ""forever barred."" Forever barred commence within 4 years."
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1620.47,1628.57,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg, but there's three reasons why the three-year time limit in Section 13 is a statute of repose."
2016.16-373,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1694.29,1706.34,"How does one know? When one uses the language ""forever barred,"" the other uses ""in no event,"" how do we know whether it's a statute of repose?"
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1706.34,1711.12,"Well, I think you have to perhaps read beyond those particular words."
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1737.11,1737.45,But did you --
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1737.45,1747.555,"And then if you were -- please, just to finish the point. If you were inclined to go further and look at legislative history, then you would look at American Pipe where this Court said the -- legislative history was silent."
2016.16-373,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1767.77,1772.935,The two-tiered structure can be where the second tier just cuts off the discovery rule.
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1789.575,1811.28,"I don't think that's right, even if you were writing this opinion on a clean slate. But, of course, you're not writing on a clean slate. This Court looked at this specific provision, along with some other provisions in the Exchange Act, in deciding the Lampf case. And it said that the three-year period was a statute of repose, not that it just cut off the discovery rule, a statute of repose."
2016.16-373,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1844.34,1852.24,"I suppose one question is, what exactly do -- have we meant when we say a statute of repose? And we've certainly meant something different from a statute of limitations."
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1881.79,1883.89,"Well, Justice Kagan, if I could beg to differ."
2016.16-373,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1926.39,1926.62,This is --
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1926.62,1927.59,-- would have none of it.
2016.16-373,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1927.59,1940.89,"This is -- American Pipe, at least as many interpret it, is not an equitable tolling provision."
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1940.89,1945.04,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, on at least two occasions --"
2016.16-373,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1945.04,1953.15,"Doesn't -- it doesn't differ -- we don't ask about good faith, and -- and it's not tailored to the individual case."
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1963.495,1976.04,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me give you two responses to that. First, on at least two occasions, when this Court had a reason to label it one way or another, it -- this Court labeled the rule of American Pipe as the rule of equitable tolling."
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2039.03,2043.78,"Mr. Clement, I'd like to go through the practical consequences."
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2044.215,2044.965,Sure.
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2044.965,2048.14,So let me start with the simplest one.
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2078.505,2080.95,"I don't think so, Justice Sotomayor, for the --"
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2080.95,2084.71,"There is a rule that says if you're in the wrong venue, there's an automatic tolling."
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2088.09,2093.89,"No, but as I understand the federal procedure -- and, you know, this is based on sort of background understanding, so I could have it wrong."
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2098.18,2098.58,But so could the judge.
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2098.58,2099.69,You don't have to file a new one.
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2099.69,2107.515,"You could -- you can ask for it, but it's still within the judge's discretion whether to transfer or dismiss and let you file anew."
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2107.515,2112.37,"Yeah, well, and so I would think that certainly if there were adverse consequences for part of the class in that situation --"
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2112.37,2113.33,So answer my question.
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2113.33,2114.29,-- you would -- you would transfer --
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2114.29,2121.1,"Under your theory -- under your theory, action means new complaint, new complaint number?"
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2121.1,2121.89,Sure.
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2124.685,2127.88,Even though it's asking for the same relief?
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2127.88,2129.28,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2129.28,2130.53,By the same party?
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2130.53,2131.75,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2132.39,2132.61,All right.
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2135.935,2136.67,Well --
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2136.67,2138.495,-- if the class is ultimately denied.
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2138.495,2140.84,"I -- I don't take that position, Your Honor."
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2148.04,2150.925,So what happens when the complaint is denied?
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2150.925,2151.85,Those individual --
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2151.85,2155.55,All of those individual complaints -- most of them are not transferred.
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2162.8,2181.73,"Well, again, as long as -- I think there is really a simple way to look at this that, I think, answers all these questions. You ask at the end, is the party seeking to recover based on an action that was timely filed? That's why this is a simple case, and it's why my friend does need a rule of tolling or some kind of super strong rule of relation --"
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2181.73,2183.23,So what's an opt-out? Why couldn't --
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2183.23,2183.57,What's that?
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2183.57,2198.88,"-- could the judge have -- or can a judge, who has a class action and tells people, if you opt out, just file a motion to intervene? Under your theory, why can't they do that?"
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2198.88,2202.9,"Because the motion to intervene, if I'm following -- it -- they can file the motion to intervene."
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2261.89,2262.815,So even --
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2262.815,2263.41,-- if somehow metaphysically --
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2263.41,2279.005,"Even if that's what American tolling did, now that we're looking at the language of the statute, and looking at Rule 23, and what the substance of the statute is, why is his reading irrational?"
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2279.005,2279.67,His -- his --
2016.16-373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2279.67,2281.77,If you're not relying on American tolling.
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2287.46,2293.34,"And -- and here's why his argument doesn't work on the text of Section 13, and it's very straightforward."
2016.16-373,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2326.66,2332.31,"Well, you're suggesting we -- there's only one view of the word ""action,"" and -- and the case stops there."
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2387.955,2396.08,"Well -- so, Justice Kagan, I mean, you know, let me just put a pin in the idea that I don't think there's any way to get to the textual result that action just --"
2016.16-373,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2396.08,2397.0,I know you think that --
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2397.0,2397.34,No.
2016.16-373,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2461.38,2468.145,"What will happen, what you -- what you have to do to get to his -- I agree -- to get to his result, I agree with you this far."
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2542.11,2544.09,I -- I think that's the way it goes.
2016.16-373,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2573.31,2614.945,"And we do have -- we do have two briefs, one by retired federal judges, one by law professors, tell us that inevitably you are going to have people filing to intervene. And in -- in that respect, assuming that you're right, so that the people who don't intervene within the 3-year period are out, does lead counsel have an obligation to inform everyone in the class, if you don't file a separate action of your own or intervene in this one, you are going to be out?"
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2614.945,2616.84,"So, two things, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.16-373,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2679.58,2683.22,You mean they're not worried about timeliness because they're relying on the class action?
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2683.22,2683.72,Exactly.
2016.16-373,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2687.34,2687.61,But just to --
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2687.61,2693.79,"And so all -- all our rule does is make somebody who wants to go it alone, they have to make that decision within 3 years."
2016.16-373,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2693.96,2719.44,"It puts tremendous pressure on the opt-out right, right? We're used to thinking that the opt-out right is a very important part of class actions; it's what saves them from a due process problem, that people actually do get to say, I don't want any part of this. And you're saying they only get to say that within 3 years, which may be not within 3 years of the time the suit was brought; it may be 6 months of the time the suit was brought, or 1 month or something like that."
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2731.475,2735.57,"Well, it -- I -- I guess I -- sort of there's a couple of points I'd want to say about that."
2016.16-373,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2746.88,2752.05,"All power to you, but, you know, a lot of those settlement hearings are awfully tough."
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2752.05,2755.855,"Well, they're tough, I suppose, because everybody is all in the same team."
2016.16-373,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2766.655,2768.83,But Rule 23 did not want that to happen.
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2780.58,2782.21,"Well, two points, Justice Kagan."
2016.16-373,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2819.14,2820.67,It's not much of an opt-out right.
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2824.215,2827.37,But -- but look at what happened with the Petitioners in this case.
2016.16-373,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2918.87,2928.91,"I -- I would like you to go back to the question I asked, because one of the purposes of the Federal rules is that so litigants should know what they're facing."
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2955.615,2959.33,"I -- I don't think there is that obligation, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.16-373,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3085.54,3085.69,No.
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3121.17,3128.81,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that both Waldburger and the text of Section 13 tell you what repose defendant gets."
2016.16-373,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3152.99,3159.06,"Yeah, but they're put -- I'm not -- it seems uncertain whether you're being subjected to new liability."
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3172.1,3176.56,"Well, I'm absolutely sure that it increases my liability, and so are my clients, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.16-373,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3187.22,3199.58,"But at least in -- I mean, it -- it requires, perhaps, more management and scrutiny by the district judges that is possible, but, you know, theoretically, if a big chunk of the class is out, you're not going to pay twice for that, right?"
2016.16-373,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,3199.58,3199.92,No.
2016.16-373,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3339.925,3342.875,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Goldstein."
2016.16-373,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3342.875,3343.55,Thank you.
2016.16-373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3504.22,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
