1961.75,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,12.213,"Number 75, Carlin Constantine Venus, Petitioner, versus United States."
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,13.06,16.687,May it please the Court.
1961.75,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,115.267,116.675,But where does that appear in your --
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,116.675,123.809,"That appears at page 4 of the reply brief, Your Honor and I must apologize to the Court for not setting it out."
1961.75,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,126.873,127.221,"Oh, I see."
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,127.221,133.122,-- third and fourth line on page 4 of the green-back reply brief.
1961.75,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,133.122,134.314,(Inaudible)
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,134.314,160.812,"This is the excerpt, the pertinent part which uses the term home address which shows that the President had -- did not have a meaning in mind of temporary addresses such as seaman and traveling salesman would use, but their permanent home address, and that becomes important in this case because we have involved here, this home address, is one temporary address, that I'll try to reveal to you gentlemen as I proceed with the argument."
1961.75,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,160.812,164.295,"May I ask you please sir, just for a moment?"
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,173.918,196.763,"Well, as I understand the regulation, if we construe the two together, the home address is the one that is required, but if a man gave an address where he would actually be reached, that would not be, I don't think, a violation of the Act because it must be given a reasonable interpretation and not one that would work a forfeiture."
1961.75,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,198.883,199.963,We'll that's what my question is.
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,199.963,200.288,Yes.
1961.75,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,211.007,220.112,All I want to do is to make it clear that you are not saying that the failure to give home address is a violation even if he gave an address where he can be --
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,220.112,221.726,"No, that's not my contention."
1961.75,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,468.555,471.443,But Judge Carter trial although was on a new indictment.
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,471.443,479.843,On a new indictment containing two counts and the -- the old indictment -- the initial indictment charging failure to report.
1961.75,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,549.04,551.617,Was that broadening process objected to its trial?
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,551.617,580.344,"Well, I objected to it in the evidence there when -- on page -- I forget what it is, when he made his ruling but, then -- we had a conference on the instructions, we didn't know precisely what is the position he was going to take until finally the charge was given, and we had our request in there asking it to be limited at -- or -- in number 75, asked it to be limited to the February the 1st, because there was no continuing duty alleged in the indictment."
1961.75,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,858.405,859.617,How far away is Modesto to San Diego?
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,859.617,867.432,"Well, Modesto from Los Angeles is 215 and yet another 90 or 100 to San Diego, it makes about 350 miles, Your Honor."
1961.75,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1062.845,1063.726,Mr. Covington.
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,1063.726,1064.356,"Yes, sir."
1961.75,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1064.356,1065.888,"May I ask you please, sir."
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,1076.097,1077.511,Never.
1961.75,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1086.148,1087.669,"Are you answering, are you saying no?"
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,1087.669,1088.08,No.
1961.75,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1088.08,1092.16,"Now, then the next question is why is there then any dispute?"
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,1099.549,1100.43,There's no dispute.
1961.75,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1113.788,1122.127,"Well now you say, is there's no dispute about the fact that he was at the Modesto address when billed February 8, 1957?"
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,1122.127,1124.933,There is absolute in no contradiction of that.
1961.75,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1128.836,1133.878,"Well, then what's the relevance about the card and things that happened on February 19th, and thereafter?"
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,1133.878,1138.57,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think there is any relevance but the Court of Appeals made it relevant by their decision."
1961.75,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1143.666,1145.719,"But that was only on the theory, wasn't it?"
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,1145.719,1146.255,Sir?
1961.75,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1146.255,1147.754,That involved -- that involved another theory.
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,1161.966,1168.329,"Well, the only thing is, we prove what the facts were, that he actually deposited the letter. We didn't want to -- we had to develop that."
1961.75,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1198.55,1218.432,"One more question, and I'm through, was there any evidence at all that a letter addressed to this petitioner at the Modesto address or the San Diego address given in his letter of June 7th, 1954 would not have reached him on February 1?"
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,1218.432,1222.63,Absolutely not one iota of evidence to that effect.
1961.75,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1231.0,1232.709,I have to ask you one more question.
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,1235.125,1248.46,"Well, he was convicted under the court's charge of failing to notify the local board at anytime from February the 1st to February the 28th and not keeping the -- the draft board advice of an address where he could be reached."
1961.75,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1248.46,1249.845,What the indictment charged in here?
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,1249.845,1258.956,"The indictment charge was on or about February the 1st, Your Honor and our contention was it should've been limited to that because there was no allegation of continuing duty."
1961.75,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1374.265,1384.552,"Mr. Covington, may I ask you when after the 1st of February 1955, did the board first tried to contact --"
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,1384.552,1391.936,"They didn't do anything, Your Honor, until way in 1956 or 1957."
1961.75,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1515.339,1522.8,Was there ever any contention on the part of the Government that they've tried to reach him through his -- through his parents at his home in San Diego --
1961.75,0,26711,hayden_c_covington,,1522.8,1527.674,"They never tried to reach him through his parents at all, Mr. Justice -- Chief Justice Warren."
1961.75,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1571.219,1576.054,I think that's it.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1580.122,1583.628,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1663.069,1671.819,Is the Government thwarted in its effectuating the Act by reason of what he did?
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1671.819,1685.863,"Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that the general purpose of the Selective Service Act, the notification requirement being the -- one of the most important element as we have set forth on pages 22 --"
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1685.863,1687.468,I can -- I can agree with you.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1694.124,1715.503,"Look, let me say this Mr. Chief Justice, in a broad sense, the Selective Service Act insofar as it requires registrants to keep the board advised intimately where they're at is the only central list of manpower, which is available to the federal government."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1801.033,1826.784,"I'm just wondering if -- if he -- he had failed, as you say, on February 1st to give this notice and then some time, let's say in June or July, he had walked into the -- into the office and had given his correct address and in the meantime, the Government hadn't needed him, would he still have committed the crime in your judgment?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1826.784,1829.696,"Well, before I answer the question, may I clear something up."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1839.812,1840.622,"Well, if --"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1840.622,1861.203,"-- that in this connection that petitioner's counsel on page 194 of the record, this was the judge who had charged the jury that -- that the question for them in the case was whether petitioner during February 1955 had notified -- had sent this address notification to the local board."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1927.095,1931.117,"You don't say that it in February 1955, that he --"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1931.117,1931.626,The -- the --
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1931.626,1933.272,I thought it was April or --
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1933.272,1933.898,No.
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1960.556,1961.028,I see.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1961.028,1963.197,When he returned to Los Angeles on 22nd of February --
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1963.197,1963.719,I see.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1963.719,1970.837,-- when he mailed the postcard.
1961.75,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2003.538,2020.689,"May I ask you, Mr. Feit what is it that if you were to here admit or admitting the trial of the court that petitioner actually was in the address given by his mother of June -- December 1954."
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2046.069,2058.047,"No, Your Honor, because we admit that he left -- the testimony is that he left Modesto on February 7, and arrived in Los Angeles on February 8."
1961.75,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2073.704,2078.103,Let's just forget for the minute what the trial court said.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2101.151,2112.144,"But -- if on -- under your assumption that the charge is simply whether he was there on February 1, I -- I will have to answer yes, but as I said the charge was even on the indictment on or about February 1 --"
1961.75,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2112.144,2112.237,Right.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2112.237,2121.7,"The trial court broadened the charge to the entire month and I might point out that his own testimony, he recognized that he had this obligation by testifying that he had mailed the postcard."
1961.75,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2134.416,2138.667,And he -- that presents the only question here on certiorari.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2181.674,2212.859,"But -- I might point out to the -- to Your Honor that -- the record page 253 and 254, the Court of Appeals' opinion, the court recognized and upheld the instructions of the trial court that, “It is necessary for us to pass upon the correction -- the -- the correctness of such rulings and instructions when we find no error in them,” that is, as the trial court have charged the jury that the proof of the offense at any time during the month of February 1955 would support the charge in the indictment."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2234.652,2236.495,"Mr. Feit, may I ask you this question."
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2294.079,2298.363,May I -- may I say this in -- in direct answer to you -- to Your Honor's question?
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2304.587,2305.669,"No, I didn't ask you that."
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2316.56,2322.142,"I think in this case -- I think in this case, Your Honor, and if I may state some of the factors upon which are reliable to that --"
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2322.142,2322.438,No.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2323.306,2340.963,"Yes, I would say in this case, in these circumstances, we think that in the background, the whole circumstances in this case by a petitioner's own testimony, and in line of the June 1954, this was the permanent mailing address, that he had given his board, was in Modesto, California."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2371.185,2373.56,"Did they -- well, did they put that incorporated in his letter?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2373.56,2377.018,"Well, I think that what he told the local board was and the letters --"
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2377.018,2378.218,What does the letter say?
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2378.385,2379.96,"That is 67 of the record, Your Honor."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2379.96,2386.767,67?
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2419.145,2419.403,I think --
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2419.403,2433.274,"Now if he went back to that -- if he went from Modesto went back to that -- that San Diego address and failed to give notice within 10 days, has he committed a felony?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2433.274,2444.314,"If he went back to that San Diego address, I would say no, but the fact to the matter is that in this case, his parents moved in February 1955 and were no longer at that San Diego address."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2444.314,2446.182,They moved ten blocks.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2446.182,2468.514,"Well, but petitioner never notified this -- never notified the Post Office Department, never notified, never left forwarding directions, and that the stand that this Court said in the Bartchy case at 319 U.S., is we recognize that -- that a draft registrant is not required to notify his local board of every move, of every change of address no matter how transitory or permanent the move may be."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2493.941,2495.837,I'll tell you why I ask the question.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2545.436,2545.959,"Of course not, Your Honor."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2545.959,2546.78,-- for doing that.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2546.78,2548.122,Of course not.
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2548.478,2568.478,"You -- you seem to think that because he had given -- he had changed his address several times before this that that was something against him, but there are great many traveling people and people -- people in -- in transitory business that way, that pretty hard to -- to designate where they'd be except at a home address?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2568.478,2593.992,"I'm saying this case, and certainly in respect to the question you posed, where you have a situation when individual travels around whether he'd be seaman or migratory worker, certainly, his -- his obligation is -- is met if he provides his draft board with permanent address and like a chain a forwarding address so that mail could reach him, reasonably expect that mail could reach him at the address that was given his local board."
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2653.617,2654.37,"If you believe, what?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2654.37,2671.558,"If the jury was told by the trial judge that if you believe this testimony, if you believe that the petitioner, as he said, mailed in an address notification change in February 1955, you've got to acquit him, regardless of whether or not the local board received it -- received that change."
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2671.558,2673.642,"Do you mean, a letter about his parent's -- addressed on (Inaudible)?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2673.642,2678.724,"The postcard that he -- has alleged -- that he alleges he sent in February, yes, yes, Mr. Justice."
1961.75,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2700.311,2701.274,Mr. Feit.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2701.274,2701.69,"Yes, Mr. Justice?"
1961.75,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2701.69,2723.34,"May I ask you exactly, is it quite fair to say that the petitioner did not raise in the trial court the sufficiency (Inaudible) of his letter of June 7th, 1954?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2723.34,2724.616,I don't believe I said that.
1961.75,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2766.964,2769.167,This whole paragraph on page 199?
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2769.167,2769.534,Yes.
1961.75,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2814.406,2835.468,"Is it -- have they had the facts (Inaudible) admittedly agree with you that the evidence, un-contradicted evidence establish that on the first day of February 1955 and thereafter until it (Inaudible), petitioner was at the address mentioned in Modesto."
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2835.468,2836.156,That's right.
1961.75,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2836.156,2840.734,"And now if that's so, then how could there been an issue of fact about it?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2840.734,2862.969,"Well, but -- as I -- perhaps, and as well as I would like to indicate to the Court that the charge which was on or about February 1st of his failing to notify with knowledge the local board of an address where mail would reach him, was enlarged during the trial, but to --- to include, it encompassed the whole month of February 1955."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2876.157,2882.21,Why during the trial was it arbitrarily changed to February instead of February 1st?
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2892.823,2929.78,"Well, I think it -- it's well settled proposition that on or about a particular date, can include a reasonable time certainly at to the date mentioned, in the Court of Appeals' opinion at page 256 -- at 254, at footnote 5, the court sets forth a number of opinions in which that very thing was held that a variance between what is charged in the indictment and what is proved is not material or -- or prejudicial unless it involves elements of surprise that would hamper defendant's efforts to prepare a defense."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2961.811,2971.735,"Well, I -- I understood you to say that if he had left Modesto and had gone back to San Diego to the 10th Street address where his parents --"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2971.735,2972.713,11th Street.
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2972.713,2973.165,Yes.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2980.023,2985.063,"Well, we think in that situation, the essential element of the crime would not have been proved, that is his intent."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2985.063,2985.497,Alright.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,2997.227,2998.284,And left Los Angeles (Inaudible)
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2998.284,3001.53,"And -- and then helped them move from there, didn't he?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3001.53,3002.493,His testimony was that on the 8th --
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3002.493,3003.335,So what --
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3003.335,3009.937,-- he went to Los Angeles and on the 19th he re -- and where he dangle -- became employed with tree cutting business.
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3009.937,3010.016,Yes.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3010.016,3024.658,"That he only returned to San Diego for two days, the 19th and 20th of February to help his family move, then return to San -- to -- to Los Angeles where he remained for the remainder of 1955."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3024.658,3025.331,Yes.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3025.331,3028.857,"And -- when he returned to Los Angeles, at that time he sent the postcard."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3028.857,3042.292,"But at least up to -- at least up to the time that his parents moved, he, having been back there at the time -- in San Diego at the time that they did move, he was not violating the law, was he?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3070.171,3078.393,"For as we understand his obligation under the charge of the Court was he had during the month of February 1955, to keep his board advised."
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3132.889,3134.474,You confused me a little.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3134.474,3135.554,"I'm sorry, Mister."
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3135.554,3142.733,I understand you to say that he did leave notice for the board that he could be reached at his parents' address?
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3142.733,3144.603,Well --
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3144.603,3147.306,I thought you have said that -- you didn't admit.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3147.306,3147.569,"No, on the --"
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3147.569,3149.714,I thought the other was received -- that notice was received?
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3149.714,3150.054,That's right.
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3156.658,3157.652,But then --
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3157.652,3173.084,"He had said that he is moving to the Modesto, California from San Diego, gave his Modesto address to the local board said that he could be reached within one or two days in his old -- at his parents' San Diego address which at that time was 650 11th Street in San Diego."
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3193.788,3194.871,That's different from there?
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3194.871,3196.451,The right.
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3212.046,3227.153,"Do I understand then that it is admitted that these was in the record a letter stating that he was moving from place to place and that he could be reached at anytime by sending a letter to his parents' address, is that admitted?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3227.153,3228.001,No.
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3233.505,3234.664,What page is that on?
1961.75,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3234.664,3237.526,The June 1954 letter is at record page 67.
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3237.526,3239.814,67.
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3239.814,3243.84,Or did it -- was the letter at that time in the file?
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3243.84,3249.536,"We think what the letter of June 1954 was this, “I -- I am moving to the Modesto, this is my principal mailing address."
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3251.336,3253.601,"No, read -- read what he said."
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3253.601,3257.69,"Well, this is the -- I think that the -- that the jury could fairly interpret that letter to --"
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3257.69,3258.014,No --
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3258.014,3272.793,"What I am simply trying to find out what is, as I understand it now, you say that the letter was there in which he told them he was moving and moving around, and that he -- he could be reached usually at this address of his parents."
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3284.13,3287.497,"Well, we say is that in February 1955 he had a duty --"
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3287.497,3290.493,I'm -- I'm not talking that about February of 1955.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3296.086,3296.192,Yes.
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3296.192,3313.142,"-- December 1954, November 1954, September 1954 and on that was there a letter on file which told him that he was moving around from place to place, and if notices, if they didn't get him in Modesto, they could get him at the address of his parents?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3313.142,3316.389,"This letter of June -- June 7th, 1954 printed on the record, yes, was in the file."
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3316.389,3317.182,That was in the file?
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3317.182,3317.826,"That was in the file, Mr. Justice."
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3317.826,3328.465,And it was there at the time that they indicted him for sake -- at -- on the ground that he had not given them sufficient notice as to where he could be reached?
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3328.465,3328.884,That's right.
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3347.414,3353.593,"Why didn't she send one in February or whenever this was, to the place where he said, “You could reach me if you don't reach me at the other place?”"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3353.593,3358.055,"Because -- because the board thought, in light of his past conduct, in light of the --"
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3358.055,3359.07,In the light of his past conduct?
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3359.07,3380.749,"The light of the fact that he had notified the local board of his current mailing address on some six prior or some five prior occasions during the period 1950 to 1954, that the letter of June 7, 1954 indicated or told the local board that his current mailing address was in Modesto, California and the board --"
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3380.749,3394.78,"But I had assumed that when the board goes to look at the issue of final notice to base a conviction of a man in which he could be sent to the penitentiary, look at his entire file and (Inaudible) before they indicted him."
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3409.369,3413.658,"Yes, this letter of June 7 of 1954 was in file, as I had indicated."
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3455.897,3474.554,"He made it because, he had mailed in some letters as she told him that he is moving from place to place and he happened to be at place where he probably was receiving those letters at that time, the board just assumed that they couldn't get him at the address he has said they could reach him at if they didn't get him at his regular address."
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3494.915,3506.153,We think the board could assume that because of the -- the other proposition would be that the local board would have the obligation because it had an address on the file.
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3558.45,3570.834,"Can they -- can they violate a regulation, provide that if they fail to -- to do -- to try to get them at, at the place that he has told them if they try to get him, and they by regulations say that that --"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3570.834,3570.995,Well --
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3570.995,3572.217,-- they neglect to do that?
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3572.217,3574.288,"Well, I -- I think that -- that --"
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3574.288,3576.222,"Enables them to prosecute him, is that what you're talking about?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3576.222,3585.597,"If, we think, our position is that -- it was his duty in February 1955 to keep the board advised of an address where mail could reach him."
1961.75,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3596.608,3606.167,"Mr. Fiet, could you please tell me what was the San Diego address on June 7, 1954?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3607.378,3607.456,I'm sorry --
1961.75,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3607.456,3610.531,I mean -- it means the geographic location.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3610.649,3614.012,It's 650 11th Street in San Diego.
1961.75,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3614.012,3619.354,And when did they try -- tried to reach him?
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3621.151,3624.276,They tried to reach him in September and October of 1955.
1961.75,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3624.276,3629.62,"Now, in September and October 1955, was 650 11th Street his San Diego address?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3629.62,3630.922,No.
1961.75,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3633.046,3643.713,"So then, the San Diego address that he advised that he could be reached at within a day or two was not the San Diego address at which he was if they tried to get him in September of 1955?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3643.713,3646.466,That -- that's true.
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3646.466,3649.345,"But it was a matter of blocks away, wasn't it?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3649.345,3652.993,I -- I don't -- I don't know the -- the San Diego area.
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3653.146,3654.672,So we can count anyway.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3654.672,3654.888,Yes.
1961.75,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3655.765,3658.43,It wasn't -- it wasn't his address.
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3658.43,3659.091,It's precisely our proposition.
1961.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3659.091,3666.829,"Suppose he had move from 6 -- 11th or 16th, that wouldn't have been his address either, would it?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3666.829,3668.219,It's true.
1961.75,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3668.219,3675.388,"Well, let me ask you, on -- on February 1, the date named in -- in the indictment, has there been any change of address?"
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3675.388,3676.034,No.
1961.75,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3676.034,3677.835,(Inaudible)
1961.75,1,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3677.835,3678.017,No.
1961.75,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3684.686,3686.693,Yes.
1961.75,2,26711,hayden_c_covington,,3687.313,3690.419,(Inaudible) finish in a minute.
1961.75,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3690.991,3697.345,"Yes, yes, yes -- no -- no, you -- you finish -- you finish your argument."
1961.75,2,26711,hayden_c_covington,,3697.345,3716.685,"On this ruling by Judge Carter limiting it to February 1st, or rather on page 92, you will notice that when he had made the remark time to extend it, rather he was trying to limit as on our proof."
1961.75,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3845.62,3847.207,On what date?
1961.75,2,26711,hayden_c_covington,,3847.207,3848.785,21st of February.
1961.75,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3848.785,3849.509,1955?
1961.75,2,26711,hayden_c_covington,,3849.509,3865.956,"Yes, sir and then the filling of the forwarding card by the father with the post office would have ensured or at least gave reasonable basis for the belief under the Bartchy decision by Venus that the mail would have reached him if it had been sent to that old address, it would have been logically forwarded."
1961.75,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3921.68,3935.012,"I would like to ask you just one question, is there anything in the record to show that the mail of the -- of the parents was forwarded from their 10th Street address to their 30th Street address?"
1961.75,2,26711,hayden_c_covington,,3935.012,3936.251,"Your Honor, no."
1961.75,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3936.251,3936.807,Is it not --
1961.75,2,26711,hayden_c_covington,,3936.807,3940.39,It -- there was no cross-examination upon it and I -- they have no --
1961.75,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3940.39,3941.445,But they -- they continue to live there and --
1961.75,2,26711,hayden_c_covington,,3941.445,3946.831,-- to go into that any further than the filing of the forwarding card by the father for the family which have included --
1961.75,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3946.831,3948.818,"Oh -- oh, he did file a forwarding card?"
1961.75,2,26711,hayden_c_covington,,3948.818,3954.858,"Well, he filed a forwarding card with the San Diego Post Office the very next day after this 21st of February."
1961.75,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3957.61,3958.462,For -- for the family?
1961.75,2,26711,hayden_c_covington,,3958.462,3959.34,For the family.
1961.75,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3959.34,3960.314,Yes.
1961.75,2,26711,hayden_c_covington,,3960.314,3964.071,And the -- the mail would have reached Venus there but --
1961.75,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3964.071,3966.357,Yes.
