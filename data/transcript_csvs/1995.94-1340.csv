1995.94-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,7.997,"We'll hear argument in Case Number 94-1340, Citizens Bank of Maryland v. Strumpf."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,11.179,20.506,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,63.372,69.436,"Mr. Walker, would you mind telling me what your definition is of a setoff?"
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,69.436,71.399,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,98.493,105.469,Is this a matter of Federal law or State law for purposes of this case?
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,105.469,109.301,"Your Honor, I believe it is a matter of Fed... excuse me."
1995.94-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,120.701,121.499,We look to State law.
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,121.499,124.102,"--Yes, Your Honor, and there is--"
1995.94-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,124.102,130.168,There's no overall Federal meaning of that term for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,130.168,132.009,"--I do not believe there is, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.879,151.184,"And as a matter of State law in this instance, you think that it depends on the bank's intention?"
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,151.184,153.423,"More than that, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,195.704,197.044,"Well, the status quo was changed here."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,209.114,210.564,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,230.128,230.359,"Well, wait."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,244.19,246.801,"That is certainly a factor, yes."
1995.94-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,246.801,246.992,Okay.
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,246.992,247.873,Where you would--
1995.94-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.873,249.633,"All I'm saying is that that factor existed here, didn't it?"
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,249.633,256.956,"--No, Your Honor, because the way I would measure the change is looking at the debtor's rights prior to bankruptcy to withdraw funds."
1995.94-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,265.842,272.196,"Yes, but the bank has still gone one step beyond that, because the bank has exercised the right."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,349.063,351.424,"Justice Souter, I agree with your view of it."
1995.94-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,357.21,359.241,"Well, I didn't mean to be getting into your shoes, but--"
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,360.412,360.962,--I welcome it.
1995.94-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,362.054,377.455,"Mr. Walker, would it be fair to say in comparing what this freeze is to what a setoff is that a freeze, a temporary hold, is to a setoff what a TRO is to a permanent injunction?"
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,377.455,378.603,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,393.395,407.486,"But if there is such a thing as an administrative hold or freeze, as you say that there is under the statute, wouldn't one expect to find some auxiliary rules governing it?"
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,450.757,457.051,"Your Honor, I believe there's very clear language in the Bankruptcy Code itself which tells the Court what governs."
1995.94-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,488.452,488.993,"Well, tell me--"
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,495.047,497.659,"I would disagree with that, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,506.066,515.462,"Yes, but Justice Ginsburg's point was you're asking us to establish a mechanism that does not have specific grounding in the statute."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,553.068,558.501,"Justice Kennedy, let me address that, and I'll try to give a more complete answer to Justice Ginsburg."
1995.94-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,594.327,606.365,"Well, can we go back to these... tell me when the bank has a hold, or a freeze, must it immediately notify the debtor and the bankruptcy court?"
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,606.365,609.667,"I believe it should Your Honor, and I recognize--"
1995.94-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,609.667,609.827,"Well, should."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,616.895,619.747,"--I believe there are requirements, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,621.82,630.566,Suppose there are none because this animal of a freeze or a hold is not part of State law?
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,630.566,636.631,Then a bank who fails to act reasonably will be vulnerable to the bankruptcy court determining that it violated--
1995.94-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,636.631,641.144,"Well, so you can't answer my question, other than to say yes, it should notify the debtor."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,644.806,656.384,"--I would say promptly, and I recognize, Your Honor, your point that the code doesn't spell out these details, but this is consistent with many, many aspects of bankruptcy practice in the code and the rules."
1995.94-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,656.384,658.676,How about how much could be frozen?
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,662.078,666.58,The amount permitted to be held is to the extent of the right of setoff.
1995.94-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,673.565,676.336,"It did in this case, then, it violated the stay in this case?"
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,676.336,676.947,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,676.947,682.463,"It held... withheld... it put a hold on more than the amount of the offset, didn't it?"
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,682.463,688.965,"Your Honor, at the time of the hold the amount owed was approximately $3,250."
1995.94-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,688.965,690.488,"And the hold was $3,500."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,690.488,703.869,"Yes, Your Honor, but given the history of this case, I would submit that the bank didn't hold enough, given its right to attorney's fees as well, and the bank held not enough to cover the attorney's fees and accruing interest."
1995.94-1340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,703.869,705.398,Was the attorney's fees part of the setoff?
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,707.04,708.021,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,721.53,740.063,"But I take it the ultimate point is, if the bank purports to... if the bank freezes too much, if... in aid of its claimed setoff, it's simply going to be found in violation to that extent of the stay, and it takes its chances."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,740.063,740.774,"Yes, Justice Souter."
1995.94-1340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,740.774,742.176,"If it asks for too much, it's going to get in trouble."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,749.089,751.932,"Yes, Justice Souter, that's absolutely correct."
1995.94-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,751.932,752.312,--Let me--
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,760.269,760.607,Absent--
1995.94-1340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.607,770.134,"What if the burden were all... you know, if you think the debt is owing, you demand it, and at that point you find out whether there's a claimed setoff or not."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,770.134,778.739,"--Absent notice, Justice Scalia, there could be an issue as to what exactly the bank did, what was it's intention, what was the act."
1995.94-1340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,791.799,834.669,"But Mr. Walker, there's nothing in the code that requires notification, and I assume that under the scheme as you envision it, the bankruptcy code creates a sort of temporary stalemate in order to enable a creditor having a right of setoff, a potential right of setoff, to take the action to effectuate it, and maybe the burden is on the debtor to file for a turnover order with the bank to get the bank to turn over any moneys being held, and maybe that's how the issue comes up."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,834.669,836.158,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1995.94-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,842.124,845.294,"So in other words the debtor just writes a check, and when it bounces he should come in."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,848.396,849.908,"--That were possible, but I--"
1995.94-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,849.908,853.241,"Wouldn't that be normally what would happen, if you didn't tell him there was a hold on the account?"
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,853.241,854.833,"--Yes, and that's why I think--"
1995.94-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,854.833,857.074,That's why you think a bank ought to give him notice.
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,857.074,858.135,--That's why I think the bank--
1995.94-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,858.135,870.572,"I understood you in effect to say that although the hold itself is not a contempt of court or a violation, if he just... if the bank puts a hold on and then keeps its mouth closed for 30 days or more, it might well ripen into a contempt."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,870.572,871.414,--That's... that's--
1995.94-1340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,871.414,872.565,That's what I thought was your position.
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,872.565,873.547,"--That's possible, Justice Stevens."
1995.94-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,936.082,941.457,"Mr. Walker, there's something in the background of this case I don't understand, and maybe you can explain it to me."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,966.516,973.741,"I think, Your Honor, it would be an exaggeration to say what usually occurs because bankruptcy sees it many ways."
1995.94-1340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,992.647,998.059,So it didn't matter that the bank was listed as an unsecured creditor.
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,1003.775,1004.386,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1015.545,1018.247,"I have one question that, it's... probably you can answer it easily."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,1031.444,1032.626,--No.
1995.94-1340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1032.626,1036.479,"Well then, why does this... I don't see how this section enters in."
1995.94-1340,0,28730,irving_e_walker,,1036.479,1044.333,"In Chapter 13, Your Honor, there's a section which provides that the debtor is substituted for the trustee in certain rights, and this would be one of them."
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1061.935,1067.078,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1159.652,1169.165,"Mr. Estrada, what would your view be if Maryland passed a statue that said, an administrative hold shall be a ""setoff"" as a matter of Maryland law?"
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1169.165,1175.079,"Our view in this case would be entirely identical, Justice Stevens, because in our view for purposes--"
1995.94-1340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1175.079,1176.521,You think setoff is defined as a matter of Federal law.
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1176.521,1176.891,--Yes.
1995.94-1340,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1305.015,1309.157,"But from the point of view of the debtor, the effect is the same."
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1323.446,1331.253,"That may well be, but we don't think that that controls the interpretation of section 362, Justice Ginsburg, because--"
1995.94-1340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1331.253,1334.913,"With reference to 362, what does 362 conceivably achieve, then?"
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1335.644,1347.943,"--Oh, what it does is to try to keep creditors from taking affirmative acts to improve their status vis-a-vis the other creditors, and--"
1995.94-1340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.943,1351.335,--It seems to me the only affirmative act that they care about is not paying the money.
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1358.321,1374.472,"--Well, no, because what 362 does not do, Justice Scalia, is that it is not a section for the turnover or payover of... for the turnover of property or the payover of debts."
1995.94-1340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1392.184,1410.957,"Under your theory, before you get to that section, why wouldn't the bank be violating the automatic stay provisions of (4), which is any act to create or perfect or enforce a lien, or (6), any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim?"
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1420.513,1430.331,"Well, as to (4), it is not really an act in the chain of enforcement of a lien as such."
1995.94-1340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1437.798,1442.469,It's not creating... it's not creating the lien by the freeze?
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1442.469,1449.936,"No, because the lien was created as a matter of law by section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which gives--"
1995.94-1340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1449.936,1451.916,"And now that's (6), any act to collect or assess--"
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1451.916,1485.059,"--Under section (a)(6), our answer would be that as a matter of the structure of the code, Justice Kennedy, it cannot be that where the act simply is one of refusal to capitulate to a debtor's assertion of rights and property that that's covered by the State, because it would be entirely alien to our system for Congress to have intended that anyone who's faced with a demand by a debtor to property that is disputed most fold his tents and go home, and that--"
1995.94-1340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1485.059,1489.092,"--No, but in a literal sense, it is any act, isn't it?"
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1489.092,1489.84,--It is any act.
1995.94-1340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1489.84,1489.991,Sure.
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1503.711,1507.234,"I agree with the first part of your statement, Justice Souter, but not the second."
1995.94-1340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1516.74,1517.652,"Oh, I grant you."
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1522.407,1542.389,"--It can literally fall within a clause of the automatic stay, but that does not resolve the question whether the rest of that section, read in light of the other applicable sections of the code, indicate that that isolated act was meant to be covered by the language."
1995.94-1340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1542.389,1552.486,"Mr. Estrada, I think it's even... your argument is even stronger with respect to subparagraph (3), to exercise control over property of the estate, because the debt is property of the estate, isn't it?"
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1552.486,1562.412,"As the case comes to the Court, it is conceded by the parties that the debt is property of the estate."
1995.94-1340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1562.412,1568.056,And would you not agree that the freeze is an exercise of control over that property?
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1568.056,1572.139,"Not within the intended meaning of that section, Justice Stevens."
1995.94-1340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1572.139,1572.299,Saying--
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1572.299,1574.35,And the answer--
1995.94-1340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1574.35,1577.352,"--We have to depart somewhat from the plain language, I guess."
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1577.352,1594.094,"--No, you do not, because as the Court pointed out in Timbers of Inward Forest, the question is not whether one of the lines or subsections in the Bankruptcy Code, read in isolation, might lend credence to a claim under the code, but whether that is a reading that makes sense in light of the code as a whole."
1995.94-1340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1625.045,1629.948,"Can I ask you a side issue, the side issue being the State or Federal law."
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1654.975,1659.339,"As I said, because in the context of 362, that would make sense."
1995.94-1340,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1659.339,1675.5,"Yes, but you'd be parsing one thing out of 362, where all of the other property definitions are State, suddenly call this one Federal, and the word setoff appears throughout the rest of the code, and you'd say, oh, those are... I mean, those are State, too, and we don't need to do it."
1995.94-1340,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1675.5,1687.929,"Except that as used in section 362, the word setoff is not used to describe property but to describe conduct, and in that context it makes sense to deal with a uniform Federal definition, Justice Breyer."
1995.94-1340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1688.53,1692.643,Mr. Schlossberg.
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,1692.643,1696.107,"Justice Stevens, may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1734.76,1753.573,"This claim is basically that banks and other people like landlords have to be able to keep the property temporarily, not pay the debt temporarily, until they can run in and get the automatic stay lifted, otherwise, as happened here, the person will run to the bank and he'll withdraw all the money, and that's the last they'll ever see of it."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,1761.412,1763.111,"Your Honor, two answers to that."
1995.94-1340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1778.605,1780.436,"But that takes more than an hour, doesn't it?"
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,1780.436,1781.756,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1781.756,1784.747,"I mean, and so during that hour, the guy runs in and takes all the money out."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,1784.747,1787.789,"Your Honor, perhaps that's a possibility."
1995.94-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1800.062,1803.812,"Well, what do you do with section 542(b)?"
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,1815.432,1816.334,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.334,1821.586,That ability is totally eliminated if you don't allow this temporary freeze.
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,1821.586,1822.598,"By no means, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.548,1865.337,"You give me an explanation that, I mean, it makes sense, what should I say, physically, but you might as well not have 542(b) if you're going to follow that track."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,1869.3,1880.54,"With all due respect, Your Honor, I believe, Justice Scalia, that it does still give protection to the bank, because it tells the bank there's a way to protect your right of setoff but you have to be vigilant."
1995.94-1340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1898.283,1899.455,"Well, it's not doing so."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,1911.256,1921.892,"But in the meantime, Your Honor, the bank in this case, the bank has denied to the debtor the right to the use of his deposits, and that--"
1995.94-1340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1921.892,1926.456,"That's right, yes, but it is not a final determination of validity."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,1932.201,1938.366,"--No, Your Honor, it's not the final effectuation of the right of the setoff, but it's certainly an interference with the debtor's right to use his property--"
1995.94-1340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1938.366,1938.576,Absolutely.
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,1938.576,1939.227,--during the bankruptcy.
1995.94-1340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1939.227,1940.088,Absolutely.
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,1940.088,1948.043,"And in fact, that's what section 362 says that the court cannot... excuse me, that the creditor cannot do."
1995.94-1340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1968.389,1974.284,"It's curious, isn't it, that the setoff under (7) doesn't have the any act provision, does it?"
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,1974.284,1981.147,"I was looking at that last night, Your Honor, trying to reconcile it for myself, and I think it's just in the drafting, because it says, the setoff of any debt--"
1995.94-1340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1981.147,1999.04,"Well, it is in the drafting, but the drafting occurs in a series in which it presents a definite contrast, and it would suggest that perhaps any act to effectuate the setoff is not meant to be prohibited in the same sense that any act in these other contexts are meant to be prohibited."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2001.383,2014.092,"--That certainly is a reading of the text, Your Honor, but it can't ignore the reading of section (3), subsection (3), which says that also proscribed is any act to exercise control over property of the estate."
1995.94-1340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2014.092,2014.922,Absolutely.
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2031.595,2033.255,I understand Your Honor's argument.
1995.94-1340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2064.86,2066.089,"Well, not if you can get into court."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2069.241,2071.373,"Well, until someone comes into court."
1995.94-1340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2071.373,2071.612,Yes.
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2071.612,2072.384,Should the debtor have to come--
1995.94-1340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2072.384,2072.543,Yes.
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2076.358,2082.462,"--I want the dough because they have taken the dough from me beforehand and said, I can't use my property."
1995.94-1340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2082.462,2092.48,"Absolutely, but I'm simply responding to your statement that in fact the bank's autonomous act could endure, in effect, indefinitely."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2098.394,2099.124,My apologies.
1995.94-1340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2108.744,2115.867,"Right, and that is the serious question to me, anyway, in this case, is it's not just banks, or even just landlords."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2155.984,2156.765,Your Honor--
1995.94-1340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.765,2158.196,Or... yes.
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2158.196,2161.648,--I would like to explain why these can be reconciled in the following context.
1995.94-1340,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2220.532,2229.927,"Well, do you think the rule that you're advocating is somehow different if the creditor asserting some potential setoff is not a bank?"
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2229.927,2231.617,Your--
1995.94-1340,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2231.617,2232.378,Is there a different rule?
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2232.378,2235.6,--If the creditor has a special obliga--
1995.94-1340,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2235.6,2237.513,I would think it would have to be the same rule.
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2237.513,2257.446,"--What I believe, Your Honor, is that if there is a special obligation, an obligation by contract, an obligation implied by court, or provided by statute, as in the case of the Federal Government, then in that event you can't, you the creditor can't unilaterally deny the performance of that obligation."
1995.94-1340,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2257.446,2271.864,But why isn't the goal of the Bankruptcy Code here best achieved by creating a stalemate until this issue of right to setoff is properly before the bankruptcy court?
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2281.131,2286.735,"Your Honor, it is a very difficult situation that is presented, and it's presented in all the cases."
1995.94-1340,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2295.05,2296.002,"Well, they made a decision."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2300.426,2308.593,"They in fact did, but they said that you have to get relief from the stay before you can set off, and to the extent that you need it in a particular case, you can get ex parte relief."
1995.94-1340,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2308.593,2309.701,"Well, there wasn't a setoff, as yet."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2315.118,2316.126,"I believe it's a matter of State law, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2317.007,2344.727,"Getting back to Justice Breyer's question, and it's the same thing Justice O'Connor's touching on, suppose you have this wholesaler and retailer, and they present... they have accounts going back and forth all the time for returned goods and so forth, I take it from your earlier answer that if the wholesaler owes, that has an offset and the retailer goes bankrupt, the wholesaler can... need not need to pay the retailer's bill for returned merchandise."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2344.727,2345.808,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2348.881,2349.061,All right.
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2353.564,2354.636,This Court's words.
1995.94-1340,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2354.636,2364.902,"--to pay, but does... that superadded obligation is also defined by reference to the bank's right to assert its secured claim, is it not?"
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2364.902,2386.196,"Yes, Your Honor, but for the fact that the bank's right to assert its secured claim by way of setoff is conditioned by section 362(a)(7), and their right to administratively freeze beforehand is similarly conditioned by section 362(a)(3), certainly, and section 362(a)(6)."
1995.94-1340,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2386.196,2388.929,"Well, I guess we're right back where we're started."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2406.112,2420.611,"Well, no, the bank's not on a par with any other creditor, because the bank, remembering also that any setting off creditor... any setting off creditor has got a stepped up, a jumped up status over any other unsecured creditor."
1995.94-1340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2454.512,2457.174,But the other side is telling us Congress didn't decide that.
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2705.877,2710.589,"With... without that clause involved, Your Honor--"
1995.94-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2710.589,2714.122,"What is the function, in other words, that you assert that clause has?"
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2714.122,2722.62,"--That clause has a function when brought before the court in the context of, let's take the ex parte motion as suggested in Patterson."
1995.94-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2734.57,2738.243,"553 would achieve that purpose, wouldn't it?"
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2738.243,2746.208,That they have the right of setoff?
1995.94-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2746.208,2746.408,Yes.
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2746.408,2748.509,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that it would--"
1995.94-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2748.509,2749.12,"I think it would, too."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2749.12,2749.58,--provide that to them as well.
1995.94-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2749.58,2756.906,"And therefore, I don't see anything that this except clause does unless it does what the petitioner here says."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2756.906,2766.913,"Well, I think what it does, Your Honor... what section 542 says is, you've got to give a debtor the property he needs to operate his estate from day one."
1995.94-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2790.823,2793.495,But this is a turnover provision.
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2812.181,2813.04,Justice--
1995.94-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.04,2816.032,"But to achieve that, all you need is section 553."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2821.186,2827.501,"--Well, section 553 does not set out any affirmative obligation on the bank to turn over property."
1995.94-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2831.992,2833.093,Yes.
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2833.093,2840.119,"Section 542 without the clause would say, you must turn over property... all property must be turned over to the debtor."
1995.94-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2873.701,2889.353,"There would be no need for reconciliation, because once you've gone in and had the automatic stay to the extent that it operates against the setoff eliminated, there's nothing more to be done."
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2922.166,2929.891,"Section 553 alone, with the inclusion of the introductory clause--"
1995.94-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2929.891,2930.101,Yes.
1995.94-1340,2,40515,roger_schlossberg,,2930.101,2938.566,"--does, in fact, provide that protection, but the question then becomes, what was the obligation of the bank to turn over property?"
1995.94-1340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2984.178,2985.236,Thank you.
1995.94-1340,3,28730,irving_e_walker,,2991.781,2992.682,"Thank you, Justice Stevens."
1995.94-1340,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3088.255,3096.212,"Mr. Walker, do you distinguish the position of the bank in any way from the position that Mr. Estrada was representing?"
1995.94-1340,3,28730,irving_e_walker,,3105.2,3106.83,"No, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3116.648,3123.971,"Under your theory of the case and the interpretation, what happens if the bank is wrong about its setoff?"
1995.94-1340,3,28730,irving_e_walker,,3123.971,3128.956,They will be held liable under section 362(h) in an appropriate case.
1995.94-1340,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3128.956,3131.488,Would they be in contempt?
1995.94-1340,3,28730,irving_e_walker,,3131.488,3132.697,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1340,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3149.739,3153.2,"Would they be in contempt if they acted in good faith, I mean, they just happened to be wrong?"
1995.94-1340,3,28730,irving_e_walker,,3153.2,3156.192,That is an interesting question.
1995.94-1340,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3193.698,3193.858,"Thank you, Mr. Walker."
