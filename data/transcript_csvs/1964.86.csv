1964.86,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,27.045,"Louis Zemel versus Dean Rusk, Secretary of State, et al."
1964.86,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,29.136,32.567,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3023.867,3027.215,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.86,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3289.013,3304.268,General supposed the statute had said the President or the Secretary of State himself may issue area restrictions in the areas that the Secretary finds with problem in the area -- in the world.
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3314.552,3316.89,I would think not.
1964.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3370.357,3380.77,"Well, Mr. Solicitor General, what if the -- if the general attack that you mentioned is on the whole scheme is, say an invalid delegation --"
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3380.77,3380.887,"Well, I --"
1964.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.887,3381.939,-- no standards?
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3381.939,3395.11,"I was just going to say that it would seem to me that insofar, as the appellant is attacking the whole statutes as an invalid delegation."
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3784.648,3787.152,Would that be necessary in order -- for time reasons?
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3787.152,3791.485,That has been -- I think it would and that has been the regular course in cases of this kind.
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3805.04,3805.881,"Well, I was wondering about that."
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3805.881,3807.408,"No, no."
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3812.312,3820.267,But the judgment then would properly be considered the judgment of a (Voice Overlap) --
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3820.267,3823.506,The judgment I think is then simply the judgment of a District Court.
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3823.506,3824.565,A single-judge district court.
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3824.565,3825.29,"Yes, yes."
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3825.29,3826.53,"Well, how about -- well, which one --"
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3826.53,3826.767,Or even if --
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3826.767,3831.2,-- if there were a couple of this and there were dissenters here on each one of these issues.
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3831.2,3838.812,"Well, I presume Your Honor as some -- it happens in a few districts, the three of them could be considered a city gone bad and could --"
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3838.812,3839.053,Could one (Voice Overlap) --
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3839.053,3842.422,"-- still make -- but even a circuit, there may be a technical --"
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3842.422,3842.767,"Well, he was (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3842.767,3844.512,(Voice Overlap) of being acted whether he was assigned.
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3844.512,3857.115,"Well, he was designated I suppose to sit as a District Judge but they might depend upon if you are just considering a single member of the District Court which single member you took here."
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3857.115,3857.922,It could.
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3866.795,3867.527,En banc?
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3867.527,3868.351,Yes.
1964.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3873.15,3878.842,"Well, how many districts are -- is Connecticut divided into sub (Inaudible) or just single district?"
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3878.842,3881.402,Connecticut I think is a single district.
1964.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3892.591,3899.22,But how many judge -- at least one or two of these judges were judges of that District Court?
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3899.22,3900.436,Judge --
1964.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3900.436,3901.076,"Clarie, (Inaudible)"
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3901.076,3903.309,I think they're both Connecticut judges.
1964.86,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3910.353,3915.954,"Well, if it was Judge Blumenfeld (Inaudible) the judgment, it might be different to Judge Clarie's?"
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3915.954,3917.118,"It -- I'm sorry, I didn't get --"
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3917.118,3921.265,I think Judge Blumenfeld on the basis of his opinion would enter a judgment from that of Judge Clarie.
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3921.265,3932.045,"Yes, yes, but if there were three there and three voted, they could all sit in the District Court without 2282 being applicable."
1964.86,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4573.663,4577.6,Of course the United States would pass the law.
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4577.6,4579.874,"Oh yes, yes."
1964.86,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4582.922,4597.321,"(Inaudible) Mr. Solicitor General, your argument in this (Inaudible)."
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4597.321,4610.128,"Well, my argument at this point is directed to emphasizing that this is through â€“ an important part, terribly important part of the foreign policy of United States."
1964.86,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4704.701,4713.838,(Inaudible)
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4713.838,4727.837,"I believe that a number of them have and I have asked for example, for a list which has just been handed to me of the countries that do impose area restrictions that are western nations contrary to Mr. Boudin's information."
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4762.023,4764.881,How about the other American nations.
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4766.909,4768.902,I'll add to Your Honor in just a moment.
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4769.457,4769.508,Alright.
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4769.508,4770.849,-- I expect to know in a very few second.
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4770.849,4775.462,Because it's the -- it's to that (Voice Overlap) --
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4775.462,4775.958,I was under the --
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4775.958,4776.197,-- cooperation was built with those (Voice Overlap) --
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4776.197,4781.198,-- impression that they had acted on the basis of the recommendations.
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4781.198,4784.338,What you're now emphasizing is cooperation with those nations as I understand it (Voice Overlap) --
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4784.338,4788.5,"Yes, I understand that they have such measures."
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4797.605,4798.103,Right.
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4798.103,4799.385,-- would certainly implies (Voice Overlap) --
1964.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4799.385,4802.25,So that was implicit in your whole argument as I understood it.
1964.86,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4802.25,4802.853,Yes.
1964.86,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,6830.652,6836.062,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.86,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7404.849,7408.871,There's no objection to the 1926 Statute --
1964.86,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,7408.871,7410.534,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
1964.86,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7410.534,7416.842,Why do you say that the 1926 Statute does not authorize what has been done?
1964.86,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,7416.842,7427.144,Because in 1926 Statute merely says that the Secretary of State may issue passports subject to rules and regulations of the President and no other person may do so.
1964.86,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7438.012,7439.662,What do you say about the latter part?
1964.86,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,7441.191,7442.03,And no other person --
1964.86,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7442.03,7446.431,Under such rules that the President shall designate him to start.
1964.86,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,7446.431,7463.345,"And I think that has a relationship only in this sense that if you can construe that statute all to relate to travel bans, which I do not, then it would mean that the President should determine when a travel ban is appropriate and not the Secretary of State."
1964.86,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7463.345,7467.473,You're not objecting to that on the ground that we put -- puts out from the standard.
1964.86,2,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,7467.473,7468.006,"Oh, I have."
