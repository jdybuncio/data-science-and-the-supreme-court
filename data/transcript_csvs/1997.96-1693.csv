1997.96-1693,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.498,"We'll hear argument next in No. 96-1693, Frank Hopkins v. Randolph Reeves."
1997.96-1693,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,28.614,31.144,Thank you.
1997.96-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,109.394,117.782,"Was... was the manslaughter that he asked for the instruction on involuntary manslaughter, in other words killing in the course of committing an unlawful act?"
1997.96-1693,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,117.782,126.277,"I don't recall, Your Honor, if the requested instruction was... was specific as to which of the types that it was."
1997.96-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,126.277,129.901,"Well, would he have been correct if... if he had asked for that?"
1997.96-1693,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,134.696,136.961,"No, Your Honor, it is not, for a couple of reasons."
1997.96-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,141.6,141.788,I know.
1997.96-1693,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,143.553,146.364,"Well, the... there's two... there's really two answers."
1997.96-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,189.58,197.406,"--What... what about the... what about the lesser sexual... isn't there is... what is it... I guess second degree sexual assault, which... which does not involve penetration?"
1997.96-1693,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,197.406,198.342,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,242.465,244.574,"But he could... he... I mean, if he wanted to, he could charge it, couldn't he?"
1997.96-1693,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,244.574,245.183,"--We certainly could, Your Honor."
1997.96-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,246.745,254.46,"But if we assume that such a charge is possible under Nebraska law, then why isn't it a lesser included of the charge here?"
1997.96-1693,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,254.46,257.584,"--Well, of course, the prosecutor could have charged any number of crimes."
1997.96-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,262.208,286.51,"No, but why isn't this... if... if... if he had... and I'm not sure that he clearly asked for this... but if he had said, I want an... an instruction on the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter and the unlawful act that I have in mind is, if I've got this right second... second degree sexual assault, why would that not have been a request for a lesser included... an instruction on a lesser included offense within the meaning of that?"
1997.96-1693,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,286.51,287.213,Right.
1997.96-1693,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,290.29,290.915,"No, but just... just as an analytical matter."
1997.96-1693,0,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,290.915,291.603,"--Right, exactly."
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1124.445,1134.207,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1693,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1210.379,1212.207,What do you mean by lesser unincluded offenses?
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1212.207,1217.049,"--I mean, for example, to take the clearer of the two, second degree murder under Nebraska law."
1997.96-1693,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1233.791,1241.945,"Well, what about the... the manslaughter charge that... the questions being asked... addressed here this morning?"
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1241.945,1250.754,"--Involuntary manslaughter, under Nebraska law... the Nebraska courts have said for 100 years that it... it and manslaughter generally are not lesser included offenses."
1997.96-1693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1261.14,1262.608,But could I interrupt with just onequestion.
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1275.792,1285.958,--I... I think that that poses the question of whether Beck brings with it the federally constitutionally required imposition of an elements test as the Federal courts apply it.
1997.96-1693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1285.958,1297.438,"My question is, in your view, could the State court say, well, we agree that... that the capital offense has three elements in it and we also agree that the... some other offense has only two of those elements in it, and otherwise they're exactly the same."
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1301.906,1308.371,"I think it would be an extension of Beck and, therefore, a new rule for this Court to constitutionalize the elements test."
1997.96-1693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1315.15,1315.931,But that still isn't my question.
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1318.961,1323.802,--Such a rule would not have a... a substantial impact on Federal prosecutions.
1997.96-1693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1325.239,1326.395,You'd rather not answer the question is what you're saying?
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1326.395,1327.035,--No.
1997.96-1693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.815,1330.69,"It's different from Beck, I agree."
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1336.86,1345.028,--I think it would be unwise for the Court to take the step of reading Beck as imposing an elements test as a matter of Federal constitutional law.
1997.96-1693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1355.789,1361.554,"Mr. McLeese, you say that the Supreme Court of Nebraska has never had to confront the question raised here."
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1365.567,1371.643,"Had... had... had Respondent framed this issue for the Nebraska courts, they ought to have."
1997.96-1693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1373.08,1376.296,So Respondent never raised this issue in the Supreme Court of Nebraska?
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1376.296,1392.275,"--Respondent, so far as I'm aware, has never suggested, until this Court... in fact, it's never been suggested by anyone until this Court... that if you apply an elements test, involuntary manslaughter, unlawful act manslaughter, is not a lesser... is a lesser included offense."
1997.96-1693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1428.245,1430.072,Not even in the Eighth Circuit?
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1430.072,1430.478,No.
1997.96-1693,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1502.026,1503.603,But... but the intent here is... is a little difficult.
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1518.41,1523.378,Second degree murder was not a lesser included offense because it requires an intent to kill.
1997.96-1693,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1543.901,1548.273,"So that if you're the actual killer under Edmund, the intent to kill need not be shown?"
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1548.273,1551.928,--The lower courts have taken that view of Enmund.
1997.96-1693,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1575.527,1577.62,"Well, it still seems to me, then, the State is having it both ways."
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1577.62,1580.261,"--Again, I don't believe so."
1997.96-1693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1665.492,1666.491,May I go back to Justice Kennedy's question for just a moment.
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1679.455,1680.954,Yes.
1997.96-1693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1680.954,1682.642,That's the missing element of all this?
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1682.642,1682.954,Yes.
1997.96-1693,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1682.954,1696.261,"And if constitutionally there must be such... some sort of intent in order to justify the death penalty, why is it such a stretch to say that we'll treat it as a lesser included offense in regard to what the total proof that the State must offer is?"
1997.96-1693,1,39939,roy_w_mcleese,,1696.261,1706.679,"This Court, in Cabana, made clear that that principle, that at least with people who are not the actual killers, there may be a requirement of culpable mental state, is not one that affects the power of the State to define the elements of the offense."
1997.96-1693,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1709.302,1711.192,"Thank you, Mr. McLeese."
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,1714.018,1724.421,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1693,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.507,1745.585,"Of course, a State can do that."
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,1761.671,1762.843,"No, Your Honor--"
1997.96-1693,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.843,1770.746,A State... a State cannot set up its crimes in such a way that you have one capital crime which has no lesser included offense?
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,1770.746,1774.73,"--We would submit that's... that's exactly the case, Your Honor."
1997.96-1693,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1778.601,1794.393,"What... what if the State were to say that intentional murder, committed by way of poisoning is a capital offense, and do... do you say you would... and they would have to give some lesser included offense in... in connection with that?"
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,1794.393,1800.578,"Well, only if the facts would support the giving of some lesser that's otherwise allowed under the law."
1997.96-1693,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1800.984,1813.401,"Well, supposing there was an offense called adulterating one's drink, and... would you have to charge that if the evidence showed the person put strychnine in... in the thing and the person... the victim took it and was dead?"
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,1813.401,1817.602,--If the evidence would support the giving of something less than a capital crime--
1997.96-1693,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.602,1822.552,"Well, okay, but let's... let's talk for a minute about what sort of evidence would support the ev... the giving of something."
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,1840.311,1847.746,"--If all those elements could be proven from the facts and there is no rational theory to support something lesser, then it wouldn't be necessary to give a lesser."
1997.96-1693,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.146,1864.067,"Well, in this--"
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,1864.067,1865.114,But if there's no evidence to support that--
1997.96-1693,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1865.114,1867.769,--in... supposing we take the facts of this case.
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,1877.75,1882.437,"--The State would not have been required to charge on simple assault, Your Honor."
1997.96-1693,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1900.991,1903.178,Why does it have to be a violent offense?
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,1903.178,1904.723,"Because Beck says it's so, Your Honor."
1997.96-1693,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1904.723,1906.645,And why do you think Beck said that?
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,1906.645,1912.487,"Because if it's something less than a violent offense, then that wouldn't address the issue that's at the heart of Beck."
1997.96-1693,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1929.605,1931.182,"This... no, I thought you were done."
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,1933.385,1949.846,"--Oh, no, Your Honor... and if... if, as happened in the State of Nebraska, the State erects some artificial barrier to the giving of a lesser offense that would be supported by the facts, then Beck says that due process doesn't allow that."
1997.96-1693,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1949.846,1954.11,"Let me ask you a different kind of, sort of, rationality question."
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,2004.184,2013.119,"Your Honor, before I answer that, I really have to correct a few of the misperceptions created by the United States about Nebraska law."
1997.96-1693,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2036.406,2036.827,Okay.
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,2051.134,2052.82,"Yes, Your Honor, killing without--"
1997.96-1693,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2052.82,2053.101,All right.
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,2053.742,2062.737,"--killing without regard to intent in the course of committing an unlawful act, which Nebraska statutes say don't need to be specified... second degree sexual assault would be one."
1997.96-1693,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2063.362,2063.768,"Well, now--"
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,2073.108,2078.527,--He didn't ask for an instruction on sexual assault as a lesser included offense.
1997.96-1693,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2095.897,2096.241,Okay.
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,2114.154,2116.903,"They most certainly could have, Your Honor, and for several reasons."
1997.96-1693,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2141.254,2145.783,"So you're saying he didn't just rest on... on the capacity/insanity defense, then?"
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,2145.783,2147.203,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1693,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2147.203,2147.546,Okay.
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,2171.757,2174.537,"It most certainly would have, Your Honor."
1997.96-1693,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2176.052,2189.983,"I guess what I'm getting at is the... is the... is the possible inconsistency between saying there was no intent to commit the assault involving penetration, but there was an intent to commit second degree assault."
1997.96-1693,2,37976,paula_hutchinson,,2203.415,2204.493,"--Certainly it can, Your Honor."
1997.96-1693,3,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,3408.352,3409.069,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1997.96-1693,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3445.055,3445.905,"Thank... thank you, General Stenberg."
1997.96-1693,3,21505,donald_b_stenberg,,3445.905,3446.088,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1997.96-1693,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3446.088,3446.921,The case is submitted.
