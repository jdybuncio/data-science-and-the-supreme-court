1966.32,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,34.862,65.806,"Yes you may Mr. Fanelli, take your time."
1966.32,0,30233,joseph_a_fanelli,,67.227,70.875,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.32,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,175.083,179.635,They were all tried together.
1966.32,0,30233,joseph_a_fanelli,,179.635,185.476,The question refers to two criminal trials.
1966.32,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,9774.85,9777.938,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1966.32,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9873.054,9884.866,"Well, what if the defendant in a criminal trial had probable cause to believe that the prosecution was going to try to bribe members of the jury?"
1966.32,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,9884.866,9891.029,The difference Mr. Justice Stewart I think is that he would then be required to bring the evidence so some law enforcement authority.
1966.32,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9891.029,9893.697,He can (Voice Overlap) he doesn't have that evidence for that.
1966.32,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,9893.697,9894.331,Well --
1966.32,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,9894.331,9900.265,But he has probable cause to believe it and he wants to get evidence of it.
1966.32,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,9900.265,9904.643,So long as he is not attempting to get Government strategy.
1966.32,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9941.359,9955.352,"But what if the Government placed in there a (Inaudible) it seems to me like the Government's willing to admit they gladly took advantage of his services, whatever the motive he had in giving them."
1966.32,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,9955.352,9955.679,Definitely Mr.--
1966.32,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9955.679,9959.777,And that they then compensated him by paying his wife.
1966.32,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,9959.777,9971.315,"Well, the compensation question Mr. Justice Black is involved in the record and the fact is that the Government has never conceded and we do not concede now that that was payment for his conduct during the Nashville trial."
1966.32,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,9971.315,9973.652,"They didn't give it to him, didn't they?"
1966.32,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,9973.652,9984.145,"Because subsequent to the Nashville trial Mr. Justice Black, he traveled around the country -- at different places of the country to meet with Government prosecutors in preparation for the forthcoming trial."
1966.32,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10014.914,10016.158,What difference does all this make?
1966.32,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,10016.158,10016.598,"Well, that --"
1966.32,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10016.598,10018.979,"He was a government agent, wasn't he?"
1966.32,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,10018.979,10019.712,We think he was a government agent.
1966.32,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10019.712,10020.327,Yes.
1966.32,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,10020.327,10021.689,If he -- even if he wasn't before October 22nd --
1966.32,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10021.689,10022.759,(Voice Overlap) whether he was paid or --
1966.32,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,10022.759,10023.854,-- he was on October 23rd
1966.32,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,10023.854,10032.289,"Whether he was paid by going easy on these indictments against him or whether he was paid $1200 or $12,000 or 12 cents, doesn't make much very difference --"
