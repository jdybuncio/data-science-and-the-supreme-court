2010.09-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.572,"We will hear argument next in Case 09-571, Connick v. Thompson."
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,11.228,14.492,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,76.873,79.669,Isn't there something in between?
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,134.438,138.001,"I understand your question, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,167.19,182.245,"Counsel, this is a single incident, and Canton said if you know that a tort is likely to happen without training then one incident is enough."
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,195.179,197.129,"That's true, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,197.254,197.394,All right.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,232.626,233.738,Correct.
2010.09-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,233.738,241.592,We can talk later about whether or not there was sufficient evidence for the jury to disbelieve that you had that policy or not.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,267.989,273.579,"The question is under the Brady scenario, which side of the Canton line does it fall on?"
2010.09-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,278.89,288.152,"But life doesn't always come in just two categories, and my suggestion to you is this doesn't fit into this single rookie."
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,343.974,346.052,"Well, I think the Court has in Canton, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,373.274,376.222,Can you tell me -- I think I have a copy.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,376.222,376.737,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,443.083,445.738,"These are people who haven't gone to law school, right?"
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,445.738,446.387,--That's correct.
2010.09-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.387,450.337,And do not know that you cannot apply deadly force in most circumstances?
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,450.337,454.225,They've got no background equipment to know what the constitutional standard is.
2010.09-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.32,458.741,"If you were giving guns to lawyers, it might have been different."
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,460.239,462.91,"--It could be, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.189,466.564,Depending on the law school they went to or what?
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,467.565,468.625,--It could be.
2010.09-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,480.136,492.989,Now what you are suggesting is that for certainty you know that a lawyer's judgment is going to go astray because a particular area of law is that complicated.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,529.161,530.487,--Well--
2010.09-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,530.487,532.191,That that is not the Canton example.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,532.191,534.672,"--That is not the Canton example, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,534.984,535.904,That's what you are saying.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,535.904,536.981,"--No, that's not what we are saying."
2010.09-571,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,545.118,547.146,Can we just -- can we clear something up?
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,547.146,547.474,"Yes, sir."
2010.09-571,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,547.474,554.114,Are you accepting the proposition that Brady always requires that lab reports be turned over?
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,554.114,556.532,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,558.393,573.869,"I know you concede that there was a Brady violation here, but in answer to some of the questions it seems to me that you were possibly -- or at least you did not express an opinion on the suggestion that it is always a violation of Brady to fail to turn over a lab report."
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,573.869,576.677,--I'm not aware that it would always be a violation of Brady.
2010.09-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,585.128,588.641,"Mr. Duncan, could I give you a hypothetical--"
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,588.641,588.953,--Sure.
2010.09-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,588.953,591.593,--just to test how strong your position is here.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,643.788,644.194,I'm sorry?
2010.09-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,646.659,648.69,--If you turn over anything that you didn't have to.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,649.548,650.097,I understand.
2010.09-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,650.097,654.844,If you give any material that you are not required to do by law.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,675.052,676.866,If there is a pattern of demonstrated--
2010.09-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,676.866,684.875,"There is not a pattern, because he just came to town and he just, you know, instituted all these policies, and this is the first Brady violation."
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,684.875,687.451,"--Not for the first Brady violation, Justice Kagan."
2010.09-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,708.038,721.004,"But the failure to train or supervise in any way and setting up a structural system that's pretty much guaranteed to produce Brady violations, that would not be enough?"
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,733.918,735.618,"No -- exactly, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,742.026,743.04,How is that so?
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,794.677,795.894,--We are not asking you to.
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,795.894,796.331,All right.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,799.72,804.575,"Yes, the instructions reflect that the single incident theory--"
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,804.575,805.577,Sorry.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,821.287,822.492,"--Yes, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,829.317,830.612,I'm sorry.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,831.392,831.845,828.
2010.09-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,831.845,832.515,828.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,832.515,833.623,Joint Appendix 828.
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,869.892,878.51,"To the words -- I mean, it looked to me like the words on page 828 are pretty similar to my copy of what he actually said."
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,883.354,890.319,"""The situation involved a difficult choice or one that prosecutor s had a history of mishandling. """
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,890.319,891.442,What he says here is
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,908.888,910.513,That is the -- I'm sorry.
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,912.182,922.786,I'm saying what is it that you asked the judge to do that he didn't do or that you asked him not to do that he did do?
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,925.987,926.568,"I understand, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,926.568,926.755,Okay.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,927.754,928.378,I misunderstood.
2010.09-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,932.44,934.592,I thought he asked that.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,936.967,943.776,The Petitioner specifically asked that an instruction be given that required a pattern of similar--
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,943.776,948.292,I want you to point out in the record the words that were said to the district court saying
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,953.229,955.273,--It is instruction number 14.
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,955.273,955.991,Which is where?
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,955.991,957.098,The proposed instruction.
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,962.628,967.284,Then I think we take it as you saying that you not objecting to the instruction.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,967.284,968.407,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,968.407,973.048,"I mean, your whole brief is objecting to the instruction and you didn't include the objection?"
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,973.048,974.109,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,979.902,980.074,"Wait, wait."
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1004.715,1021.038,"--What our main complaint is, is about the failure of the district court to grant a motion for summary judgment and a judgment as a matter of law on the basis that a failure-to-train theory under these circumstances does not permit the single -- the single--"
2010.09-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1021.038,1042.419,I understood -- and maybe I'm confused -- that you were arguing that there was no set of circumstances in which a prosecutor could be handled -- could be liable on a theory of failure to train for one incident.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1042.419,1042.934,--That's correct.
2010.09-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1042.934,1044.104,That that was the petition.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1044.104,1044.81,Correct.
2010.09-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1044.81,1046.432,So it doesn't matter what the facts are.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1056.411,1064.249,"That's -- under the Canton hypothetical, yes, it would have to fall on the pattern side because the general Brady situation is unlike the single-incident--"
2010.09-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1064.249,1064.467,So what you--
2010.09-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1064.467,1066.281,"Could I add to my hypothetical, then?"
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1066.281,1067.154,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1067.154,1084.867,"Suppose that this new district attorney said -- every day he came into the office and he said: I think Brady is just crazy, and I think it's just the worst decision that the Supreme Court has ever issued; and as long as you don't get caught, anything you do is okay by me."
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1084.867,1090.096,"That sounds like a policy to me, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1093.185,1094.127,It's not a policy.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1096.767,1104.937,"Well, this Court has defined ""policy"" as a deliberate choice to embark on a course of action in Pembaur, which this Court accepted."
2010.09-571,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1107.511,1117.993,"Then the policy is just that you have to turn over what you have to turn over, nothing else, and if you turn over anything else you will get penalized for doing so?"
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1118.57,1121.74,"--Well, then the policy is constitutional."
2010.09-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1147.071,1148.273,Is that so?
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1225.104,1227.023,"Well, of course there should be vigilance."
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1349.35,1350.848,All right.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1399.579,1402.297,"Your Honor, there weren't four instances."
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1407.388,1407.637,Okay.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1413.759,1414.461,--No.
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1415.054,1420.755,"All involved -- in other words, there has never in this office been an instance of a Brady violation outside of this case."
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1420.755,1422.241,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.85,1423.832,Not -- not before this case.
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1424.706,1425.237,"After, that's what it was."
2010.09-571,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1425.237,1426.298,"--later, as far as we know."
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1426.298,1434.826,"There were some -- there were four reported Brady violations before this case, in the decade leading, up, involving this office, that had nothing to do with the circumstances involved here."
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1434.826,1435.465,Ah.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1440.995,1443.803,"Correct, out of tens of thousands of prosecutions."
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1443.803,1444.586,All right.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1447.097,1447.632,We're -- but we're--
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1447.632,1450.268,"--over many years, with tens of thousands of violations, correct?"
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1450.268,1457.533,--What was -- the Fifth Circuit panel in this case affirmatively said Thompson did not even try to prove a pattern and did not prove a pattern of violations.
2010.09-571,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1459.124,1459.483,This is helpful.
2010.09-571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1459.889,1463.246,On your instruction in--
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1463.246,1464.416,"Yes, sir."
2010.09-571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1464.416,1472.083,"--at JA 28 second, would the instruction in your view have been proper, if the ""or"" had been replaced by an ""and"", so"
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1476.127,1481.294,"That's closer to what it should be, Justice Kennedy, yes, because that begins to capture the pattern requirement."
2010.09-571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1487.806,1491.742,Has there been any argument that you have waived your objection to the instructions?
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1491.742,1496.164,Not by Petitioners -- not by the Respondent in this case.
2010.09-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1497.302,1498.379,Did you object to it?
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1500.126,1501.046,--The -- the charge?
2010.09-571,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1501.046,1508.358,"With the ""or"", difficult choice, ""or"" one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling?"
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1508.358,1511.965,"No, the Petitioners did not object to the -- the specific formulation of that charge."
2010.09-571,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1519.086,1522.353,In other words the pattern instruction was -- it was -- was rejected?
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1522.353,1523.133,--It was rejected.
2010.09-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1527.286,1530.16,--But that wasn't the question presented to us.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1535.159,1537.175,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1537.175,1537.799,--was wrong or not.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1537.799,1545.31,"What we present is the legal theory on which this case was submitted, what got to the jury in the first place, should never have got to that legal theory at all."
2010.09-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1545.31,1560.117,"You see, what I'm trying to figure out is whether your position is that under no circumstance, even the hypothetical that Justice Kagan set forth, could you be charged with a single incident Canton violation."
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1561.695,1562.881,With respect to the Brady situation.
2010.09-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1562.881,1564.129,The Brady situation.
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1564.129,1564.94,Let me answer it this way.
2010.09-571,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1594.819,1599.096,"Well, how do you exercise legal judgment if you don't even know what you are supposed to turn over?"
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1600.75,1601.811,That's exactly -- that's my point.
2010.09-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1621.395,1622.253,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-571,0,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,1622.253,1623.207,"If there are no further questions, thank you."
2010.09-571,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1623.207,1634.859,Mr. Cooney.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1634.859,1638.061,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1672.704,1674.545,For -- for Brady violations.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1677.106,1678.967,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1680.277,1682.293,"Well, that's a significant limitation, don't you think?"
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1682.293,1692.771,"--But I would submit, Your Honor, that this Court's -- that their requirement for proving deliberate indifference is, first, contrary to the teaching of this Court in Canton and subsequent cases."
2010.09-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1698.036,1713.984,"But at the -- but at the outset it seemed to me, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you misstate the theory on which you seek to -- to have a reversal and that this is a failure-to-train case."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1714.748,1715.434,--Your Honor--
2010.09-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1715.434,1717.341,"This is a failure-to-train case, is it not?"
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1717.341,1722.946,--It is absolutely a deliberate indifference to the need to train and provide other protections--
2010.09-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1722.946,1724.79,"Well, I think that's very important."
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1724.79,1746.533,"Yes, if you could -- could you just say as succinctly as possible what you would tell assistant district attorneys if you were the district attorney for this jurisdiction, and you with the benefit of hindsight, having seen this case, what kind of -- what would you tell them they should do with respect to Brady?"
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1746.533,1747.61,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1757.901,1762.651,"No, but you are training them, so: Now I want to tell you what you have to do under Brady."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1762.651,1763.68,"Well, first--"
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1763.68,1764.289,What do you tell them?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1764.289,1781.781,"--In this office, Your Honor, I think the first thing one has to confront is Mr. Connick's testimony, and in fact the concession that the Petitioners made on pages 6 and 7 of their merits brief that the office started with what the brief described as:"
2010.09-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1789.888,1794.247,"Well, Justice Alito's question was what you would tell the assistant D.A.'s."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1794.637,1799.493,"--And Mr. Chief Justice, with -- if -- first of all, I wouldn't start with that rule."
2010.09-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1803.116,1804.648,Why wouldn't you start with that rule?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1806.878,1809.02,"--Your Honor, I'm not saying it's an unlawful rule."
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1814.347,1817.002,I really would appreciate it if you'd get to my question.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1823.92,1827.683,"--Your Honor, I don't know that."
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1836.395,1836.726,Okay.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1844.174,1846.643,"I think at a minimum it has two pieces, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1879.036,1879.613,Okay.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1892.045,1892.513,Well--
2010.09-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1892.513,1895.964,You are the -- you're the new D.A. and you are putting up -- I need to instruct my people.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1900.913,1912.83,"--I think the second thing that the -- that the office really should do is to -- to talk about the importance of safeguarding the innocent here, that our job is not just to secure convictions."
2010.09-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1912.83,1917.171,"Well, we are -- we are looking at specifics where they are going to violate the Constitution."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1929.04,1935.24,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I do think that there are other constitutional requirements involved."
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1943.25,1964.791,"I mean, with respect, I really don't, as a young district -- assistant district attorney, that you have told me anything that's going to be really helpful to me other than, you know, follow the law, which you certainly should do, in dealing with my obligation to turn over physical evidence, which is what's involved here."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1964.791,1965.399,Your Honor--
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1965.399,1967.567,Or a lab report regarding physical evidence.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1981.219,1986.998,"--In this case, there has been a stipulation by the district attorney's office that you do."
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1988.765,1991.308,I have to turn over all physical evidence that's in my possession?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1991.308,1991.885,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1991.885,1992.353,Okay.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1992.353,1993.464,"But here, the specific--"
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1993.464,1997.339,"Now, what's the instruction that you are going to give me to tell me where I'm going to draw that line?"
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,1997.339,2004.975,"--If you have physical evidence that, if tested, can establish the innocence of the person who is charged, you have to turn it over."
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2004.975,2007.174,"Well, how do I know that before--"
2010.09-571,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2007.174,2007.658,"Well, don't they make it available?"
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2007.658,2010.594,--How do I know that before the physical evidence is tested?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2025.825,2027.026,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2048.625,2051.265,"Now, you see what I'm getting at is that you are dealing with a very specific situation."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2083.269,2087.313,"--Your Honor, what I'm saying is that I think there are at least three layers to the training that were missing here."
2010.09-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2112.394,2112.862,Wait a minute.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2124.187,2125.279,"--Yes, Your Honor--"
2010.09-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2125.279,2127.014,Or asking for it to be tested?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2129.057,2146.598,"--The -- the only information -- there was a discovery response that was filed very shortly before trial, long after Mr. Thompson was charged with the crime, where in response to one of the questions, the response was: ""Inspection to be permitted""."
2010.09-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2149.221,2155.531,"And where is the Brady violation for telling a defense attorney, there was a blood sample there, you can test it?"
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2155.531,2157.625,"--Your Honor, there was no information provided."
2010.09-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2198.734,2201.842,So that you are claiming there was suppression of that evidence?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2201.842,2202.747,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2202.747,2212.975,So if it is -- prosecutors can violate a defendant's constitutional rights by making improper statements in their closing arguments.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2223.799,2231.575,"Your Honor, I think, first of all, the issue has to rise to a constitutional level in order to be talking about this for section 1983 purposes."
2010.09-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2231.575,2234.652,My understanding is -- I'm not an expert in criminal law.
2010.09-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2252.977,2263.487,"And Miranda, and proper supervision of affidavits in support of search warrants, and proper instructions that tell the police not to exceed the scope of the warrant."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2265.065,2266.765,Justice Kennedy--
2010.09-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2266.765,2274.342,"The point of concern here is that we're going to have to go through a list, case by case, of everything there has to be training on."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2274.342,2276.888,--I think -- I think there are some important distinctions here.
2010.09-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2292.287,2296.284,"When you are talking about improper comments in closing argument, it is the prosecuting attorney."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2296.284,2300.11,"--But the second important distinction, Your Honor -- and I do believe training should be given there."
2010.09-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2331.629,2335.923,So you don't have to train with respect to closing arguments?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2335.923,2336.894,"Your Honor, I think they do."
2010.09-571,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2372.301,2381.781,"And it's something like I was trying to get at before when I said Miranda was out there, you know what was said, you know what was seized."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2406.005,2407.568,"Your Honor, I--"
2010.09-571,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2407.568,2417.063,The concern was that you don't want to have to give the prosecutors a clinical law school course before you let them do their job.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2417.063,2419.875,"--I agree with that concern, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2430.302,2431.585,So what would have been enough?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2435.708,2442.676,"I think that would have been dependent on what its content was, Your Honor, and the other circumstances of the office."
2010.09-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2451.984,2452.577,Wait.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2468.21,2476.988,"--Your Honor, what happened is the physical evidence very conveniently was being sent to the crime lab when it was removed."
2010.09-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2486.187,2487.934,"Well, then, you shouldn't have mentioned it."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2493.92,2495.37,"--What we assert, Your Honor--"
2010.09-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2495.37,2496.104,You don't know that.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2496.104,2511.036,"--It was certainly not -- it was intentionally not placed back in into evidence after it came back from the crime lab, and there was actual testimony from the grand jury that was handling this and looking into this situation for some period of time of just that."
2010.09-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2511.036,2514.159,There is a causation problem here.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2530.59,2531.854,"Your Honor, I think there are--"
2010.09-571,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2531.854,2534.51,And I'm very concerned about that causation aspect.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2534.51,2536.635,--First of all -- let me address that directly.
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2553.473,2567.2,"But the judge actually, though, instructed the jury -- this is back on JA 828 -- in order to find that the district attorney's failure to adequately train, monitor or supervise amounted to -- deliberate indifference, etcetera."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2587.894,2595.436,"--Your Honor, the concept of monitoring or supervision was actually the concept that defendants injected into the case."
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2608.994,2611.599,Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't that be error?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2637.325,2642.008,"Your Honor, again, the clear thrust of this case was a failure to train case."
2010.09-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2649.897,2661.455,"Could you please state in simple terms to me what exactly they failed to train these prosecutors to do, that the prosecutors didn't do?"
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2674.761,2677.806,"--Number one, there was absolutely no Brady training at all."
2010.09-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2677.806,2679.023,Forget about no Brady training.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2692.706,2699.265,"First of all, I think a broad statement in training about the importance of safeguarding the rights of the accused--"
2010.09-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2699.265,2712.789,"Now that seems to suggest that you are claiming that if there was an intentional violation by prosecutors, that that statement would have avoided the prosecutor from doing something he or she knew was illegal."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2713.744,2715.507,"--No, it isn't, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2715.507,2716.006,Okay.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2716.209,2731.936,"The -- the second aspect of -- of it, though, is what I said to Justice Alito, and that is that if you have physical evidence which if tested would establish either the guilt or the innocence of the -- of the defendant, it needs to be produced."
2010.09-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2733.952,2736.026,That goes to the sufficiency--
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2736.026,2736.245,Right.
2010.09-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2736.245,2743.382,"--of whether they had a policy to turn over or -- because it was tested, so there was no Brady violation from the failure to test here."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2743.382,2746.428,"The Brady violation was for failure to produce, you are right."
2010.09-571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2746.428,2749.083,Isn't -- am I right -- am I right on this?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2781.631,2789.723,"Your Honor, certainly what the crime lab report said was that the blood that was tested of the perpetrator was type B."
2010.09-571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2789.723,2794.984,And the -- and the prosecutor knew that the person on trial had type O?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2794.984,2796.656,"We don't know that, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2796.656,2797.343,"Ah, that's something--"
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2797.343,2798.684,That's the unresolved factual question.
2010.09-571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2798.684,2798.871,--I see.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2798.871,2804.339,"And I think that's where causation comes in, Your Honor, because I think there are two possibilities."
2010.09-571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2804.339,2808.617,Did it turn out at the trial that eventually the prosecutor knew it was type O?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2808.617,2808.898,Yes.
2010.09-571,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2812.442,2813.429,When the did they learn that?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2813.429,2821.314,--The evidence is unclear as to whether or not the assistants knew at the time that John Thompson had type O blood.
2010.09-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2821.314,2828.438,"Could I ask you what -- most law offices with which I am familiar, the training is mentoring."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2852.491,2858.551,"If in fact the senior prosecutors, Your Honor, have a good familiarity with the constitutional requirements--"
2010.09-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2858.551,2858.926,Yes.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2858.926,2859.316,--absolutely.
2010.09-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2859.316,2867.811,"Even -- even if the violation that becomes of the basis for the claim later on is one that, you know, didn't come up in that year?"
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2885.211,2888.081,"I think -- I think the failure here, and I think we have to come back to the deliberate indifference piece."
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2906.998,2919.601,"Mr. Cooney, when you -- when you gave the specific instruction which you think should be provided to assistant district attorneys, what you stated was a questionable understanding of Brady, I think."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2933.503,2938.718,"Your Honor, that certainly has been the position taken by the district attorney's office in this case."
2010.09-571,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2938.718,2941.42,Isn't that to do with Arizona v Youngblood.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,2941.42,2965.455,"Your Honor, I believe it -- it is consistent with Brady that if -- if one has a piece of evidence that can conclusively establish that the defendant is innocent, that it can't be the law that the prosecutor can just put it in his hip pocket, not get it tested, and not turn it over to the defense, and not worry about whether they're prosecuting an innocent man."
2010.09-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2965.455,2967.409,"But you see, it was tested."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3003.519,3004.751,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3019.885,3020.712,Now what did I just say?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3023.823,3025.118,"--But -- but -- yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3035.132,3038.127,Never knew it existed?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3038.127,3039.161,"Never knew it existed, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3039.161,3039.582,That's--
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3039.582,3043.158,There is testimony clear -- testimony to that effect.
2010.09-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.9,3064.586,But it isn't -- it isn't clear from what -- according to what you said earlier it isn't clear that it was intentionally withheld from the defense.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3070.084,3070.489,But--
2010.09-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3070.489,3074.58,So would training have -- have gone into that detail?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3081.314,3090.888,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, but here there is a stipulation that the crime lab report with the conclusive evidence about the perpetrator's blood type was never--"
2010.09-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3090.888,3091.808,"Okay, but -- but that -- that's the lab report."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3093.384,3096.133,"--And the physical evidence was never seen, Your Honor, by defense counsel."
2010.09-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.133,3100.586,"--For all we know, by accident, right?"
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3105.581,3116.188,"Your Honor, four prosecutors, it is clear that four prosecutors knew about the existence of blood evidence for months, and it was never produced to the defense."
2010.09-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3120.563,3124.561,The defense was told to come over and look for it -- to look at it.
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3130.214,3134.134,"But -- but Your Honor, the ""it"" was not come over and see the blood evidence."
2010.09-571,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3136.459,3137.051,"Yes, I understand, but -- yes."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3137.476,3141.91,"--Physical evidence at the crime scene, including things that have nothing to do with blood."
2010.09-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3148.75,3150.903,But isn't that -- isn't that best practice?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3168.412,3184.501,"But the point here, Your Honor, and I think this goes to the causation point, that -- that it would appear -- it would appear from looking at Mr. Williams' testimony that there was a deliberate effort to stay away from blood evidence in the carjacking case."
2010.09-571,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3196.337,3207.86,"--But that dooms your case-- if it wasn't an innocent error, if it was an intentional violation of Brady, there is no training that was going to stop him from doing that."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3207.86,3218.639,"--Your Honor, I think there is a difference between a tactical choice to do something -- Sharpe -- on the one hand, and a knowing Brady violation on the other hand."
2010.09-571,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3254.062,3263.307,"Mr. Cooney, I'm still confused as to sort of how much is enough by way of training and how you would ask a court or a jury to decide that."
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3281.066,3286.123,"Your Honor, I think that Canton articulates a very flexible test."
2010.09-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3344.116,3357.421,"Would this have been a no-training case if the rule was you have to be in the office for 3 years as a second chair prosecutor before we let you have a case, and in fact, you have to be here 10 years before we let you have a capital case?"
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3360.155,3364.794,"--I think, again, you would have to look at the circumstances of the office."
2010.09-571,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3394.096,3398.015,But what do you do with the Dubelier testimony?
2010.09-571,1,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3405.214,3408.54,"Your Honor, I think there are two very quick answers to that."
2010.09-571,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3450.62,3451.93,"Thank you, Counsel."
2010.09-571,2,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3453.946,3472.265,"Justice Alito and Justice Kagan, you asked repeatedly questions designed to elicit the response from my colleague: What would you tell ADA with respect to training -- and I believe Justice Sotomayor as well -- that would have prevented such a thing?"
2010.09-571,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3526.618,3528.54,How do you train your new hires?
2010.09-571,3,29741,j_gordon_cooney_jr,,3535.146,3542.425,"I think the first thing you do is you have a hiring process that emphasizes the important of -- the importance of Brady, as this office did."
2010.09-571,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3551.2,3555.388,"Mr. Duncan, that I think you can't say, because that's just overturning what the jury found."
2010.09-571,4,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3555.388,3559.135,"I -- I don't think -- the jury couldn't have found that that didn't occur, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3560.539,3563.651,The jury found that there was inadequate training.
2010.09-571,4,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3563.651,3564.244,"Correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3564.244,3572.145,"In fact, the jury found -- I think, if you look at the record -- the jury could have found, a reasonable jury could have found, that there was no training here."
2010.09-571,4,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3572.145,3577.488,"A reasonable jury could have found -- well, Your Honor, we don't contest the finding of inadequate training."
2010.09-571,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3616.876,3618.514,Do we have to overturn what the jury found?
2010.09-571,4,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3618.514,3619.044,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3620.121,3620.355,We don't?
2010.09-571,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3651.625,3653.231,You can answer.
2010.09-571,4,41250,s_kyle_duncan,,3653.231,3654.105,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2010.09-571,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3671.598,3672.71,"Thank you, Counsel."
