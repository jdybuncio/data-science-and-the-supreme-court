2005.04-10566,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.803,"We'll hear argument first this morning in two cases, Sanchez Llamas v. Oregon and Bustillo v. Johnson."
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,8.147,12.929,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-10566,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,108.262,144.728,"I thought that the argument on the other side is that those references in the secondary sources and in the document itself are meant to make clear that if the individual detainee does not want contact with his consular officials, for example, in a case where he might be seeking asylum or something like that, that it was, as you said earlier, his decision and not necessarily that there was to be a departure from the norm in international... the international context where treaties are between the sovereigns and don't confer enforceable rights on individuals."
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,144.728,159.335,"Well, Your Honor, actually the article 36 is... is unique and different in that the revolutionary part of this is that the detainee did, for the first time, have the authority to have the consulate notified."
2005.04-10566,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,173.87,174.214,Right.
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,187.904,192.353,"Well, it... it could work on the international level as well."
2005.04-10566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,231.413,237.806,And at least you have the authority of the International Court of Justice that says this is a right.
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,239.65,240.66,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,250.401,252.495,"That court is not a common law court, is it?"
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,252.495,253.389,"--No, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,253.389,258.798,"And not being a common law court, it's not bound by its own prior decisions, is it?"
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,258.798,261.654,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,261.654,270.229,I think its statute says that it... it decides the particular case and does not set forth propositions of law that are binding in future cases.
2005.04-10566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,274.0,283.508,How many times now has the ICJ said that this convention confers rights on the individual?
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,283.508,289.212,"At least two, Your Honor, LaGrand and Avena, and both involved criminal cases."
2005.04-10566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,289.212,292.15,And what is the view of our treaty partners on that issue?
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,292.15,303.996,"Many of the treaty partners view it as conferring a right, at least 11 tell an arrestee of his rights under... under the treaty and--"
2005.04-10566,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,303.996,307.862,But do any of our treaty partners apply the exclusionary rule to violations of this?
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,307.862,311.977,"--That's beginning to happen, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,317.436,319.697,Not at the time this treaty came into force.
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,319.697,320.792,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2005.04-10566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,320.792,323.991,Not at the time the Vienna Convention came into force.
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,323.991,324.574,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,324.574,329.106,We were almost alone in having suppression as the remedy.
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,329.106,329.367,"Yes, Your Honor, and--"
2005.04-10566,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,329.367,331.461,"We didn't even have it then, did we?"
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,331.461,333.321,--In 1969?
2005.04-10566,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,334.032,339.108,That's when the convention came into effect?
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,339.108,340.619,That... that... excuse me.
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.568,349.017,What... what remedies have other countries provided for... for these rights?
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,356.07,358.008,Typically I think the--
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.008,363.718,"I mean, advising them of them is... is really not vindicating them, it doesn't seem to me."
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,363.718,369.844,--Typically it is a matter of state to state complaints or apologies and--
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.844,388.494,"Well, that's... but, you know, that's what the other side said the whole thing should consist of, that it's a matter to be enforced by... by state to state protests, not... not by the judicial system or the legal system taking it upon itself to provide a remedy."
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,395.881,396.491,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.491,397.485,When... when was that?
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,397.485,401.351,Offhand... I believe it's within the last couple years.
2005.04-10566,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,401.351,405.966,Was there a showing of prejudice in that case or just automatic exclusion?
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,405.966,406.566,"No, it's not automatic."
2005.04-10566,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,433.774,453.091,"Well, is that... that... my question was going to be are... are you suggesting or arguing that the remedy ought to be exclusion as a matter of domestic law or as a necessary implication of... of the treaty?"
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,453.091,458.984,"It's a necessary implication or it's an implication of the treaty, of section 2 of article 36."
2005.04-10566,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,458.984,485.187,"Well, what would you do in a country that does not apply an exclusion remedy in... in domestic cases given the provision, which I can't quote correctly, but you'll know what it is, the... the provision that the treaty will... will be administered in accordance with or consistently with, I guess it is, domestic law so long as full effect is given to its substantive provisions?"
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,530.456,531.539,--It could be appropriate.
2005.04-10566,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,552.533,552.883,"Well, if it doesn't--"
2005.04-10566,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,552.883,553.544,So if the treaty--
2005.04-10566,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,553.544,554.638,--Why don't you go ahead?
2005.04-10566,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,554.638,561.108,--The... the treaty provision then governs only in the sense that for remedy it refers you to domestic law.
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,562.868,563.962,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,563.962,564.396,Okay.
2005.04-10566,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,564.396,573.01,"So... so if the treaty doesn't say suppress, what authority does a Federal court have to direct a State court to exclude evidence?"
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,573.01,575.048,"Through the Supremacy Clause, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,575.048,577.569,The Supremacy Clause gives effect to the treaty.
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,580.424,591.843,"Well, the treaty doesn't in... in its text doesn't say, thou shalt suppress, but is... it is a source of authority because the treaty says thou shalt give full effect to the law."
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,591.843,594.959,"Well, it's just a source of authority but not a source of authority for suppression."
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,623.1,626.788,"In... in many cases, yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,653.003,657.868,"Well, of course, that's assuming a causal link, which is an altogether different problem."
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,687.854,688.948,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,706.337,720.127,"You don't think that the... that the remedy that the ICJ imposed in the case where the United States was before it as a party, that that would be the appropriate remedy?"
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,735.073,739.855,"Yes, Your Honor, and then supply whatever remedy would be appropriate."
2005.04-10566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,746.242,758.588,"But there wasn't any word in either of the ICJ judgments, if I recall them correctly, that said, United States, you have a suppression remedy, so you should suppress."
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,758.588,766.335,"--No, Your Honor, because again, remedies are a question of domestic law, so it's up to the domestic courts to decide what would be the appropriate remedy."
2005.04-10566,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,766.335,769.857,"Well, did you ask for any remedy in this case other than suppression?"
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,772.212,772.623,"Correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,775.561,780.853,One of the things... and I... I really have this question for all counsel.
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,811.089,818.57,"Yes, Your Honor, and many courts have held that... well, the Miranda rights pretty much encompasses these rights, but they're different."
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,889.804,901.651,"That may give you a warmer feeling inside, but do you think that the foreign consulate is... is more likely to give you good advice about what you should do under American law than an American lawyer that you've been provided?"
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,901.651,905.005,"Well, you know, Your Honor, it's not really the content of the advice."
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.733,923.488,"Yes, but I'm just saying whether it makes any difference."
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,947.681,950.952,"Well, but really he hasn't been given an attorney yet, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,956.756,968.853,"Well, but you... you want us to write an opinion to say that we're holding our attorneys to the same standard of evaluation as the attorneys in Syria--"
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,968.853,970.53,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,970.53,978.511,--and... and our bar is... is not to be trusted to have the expertise that's at least equivalent to that of the foreign counsel?
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,978.511,978.877,No.
2005.04-10566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,990.69,991.157,The question--
2005.04-10566,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,991.157,995.14,"But the question is who tells you about that choice, and your attorney can tell you about that choice."
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,995.14,1004.131,--But this contemplates that the detaining authorities informed the person of... of what their rights are to contact the consulate.
2005.04-10566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1004.131,1005.475,--Suppose they don't do it.
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,1008.002,1008.679,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1008.679,1009.379,We assume that.
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,1012.361,1013.228,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1013.228,1022.854,"And I'll assume with you, for the moment, that... that the treaty has to be read as saying you have to have some kind of appropriate remedy, but it doesn't say what kind."
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,1055.027,1063.769,"Your Honor, I'd... I'd like to... to move back the discussion to there's no attorney yet, and the question is what can that person do."
2005.04-10566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1064.879,1066.723,"Oh, he's stuck without an attorney."
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,1083.845,1085.873,"--Your Honor, it needn't--"
2005.04-10566,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1085.873,1087.401,I think sometimes it could be something else.
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,1087.401,1087.662,--Yes.
2005.04-10566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1129.36,1147.532,"But we do know, don't we, Mr. Gartlan, that if the treaty had been followed, it still would have been permissible for the police, having given Miranda warnings, to commence interrogation?"
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,1160.623,1168.259,"--Well, actually the language of the article says without delay, Your Honor, so that suggests that there's some kind of promptness that's... that's involved."
2005.04-10566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1168.259,1169.187,Promptness.
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,1198.256,1213.457,"And our reading of the article is that once the... the police know or have grounds to believe that the... that the person is probably a foreign national, then that duty arises on the police to give him his rights."
2005.04-10566,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1213.457,1213.757,Yes.
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.757,1214.091,"That's fine, but--"
2005.04-10566,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1214.091,1214.385,It's a--
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1214.385,1214.818,--Go ahead.
2005.04-10566,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1214.818,1216.579,--We keep doing this.
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1216.579,1216.895,"Yes, we do."
2005.04-10566,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1216.895,1225.32,It's... it's a duty to advise him of... of his right to have them notify the... the consulate.
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,1253.978,1261.114,"Yes, Your Honor, but in... in this case, the... the statements that we're seeking to suppress, the harmful ones, occurred about 8 hours after the initial arrest."
2005.04-10566,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1261.781,1273.878,"Well, do you... do you say, going back to... to the point Justice Ginsburg made, if the United States follows a 48 to 72-hour rule, is... is that a violation of the treaty?"
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,1273.878,1283.713,"--Yes, Your Honor, because our position is that once somebody says, yes, I... I want to speak with the consulate, it's like saying I want to speak with my attorney or I want to invoke my right to silence."
2005.04-10566,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1300.191,1303.029,"Well, we... we might have to make it in this case."
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1303.029,1308.24,We'd have to make an 8-hour ruling in this case anyway if... if we agree with you.
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,1308.24,1315.56,"--Well, our... our position is that if there's an indication of a right to have the consulate contacted, that's like a cry for help."
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1323.057,1333.115,"Gee, what about... what about countries that don't have an extensive telephone system, you know, where you... you have to send a runner to notify the consul?"
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,1333.115,1338.059,--That would be a problem for that country and people in that country.
2005.04-10566,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.653,1344.779,"Well, it... it just makes me think that... that instant contact is not what was envisioned by the treaty."
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,1344.779,1350.832,"--The treaty is supposed to be applied in every country, and there are going to be different results."
2005.04-10566,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1368.305,1369.566,"Thank you, Mr. Gartlan."
2005.04-10566,0,37919,peter_gartlan,,1369.566,1370.216,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1370.216,1392.93,Mr. Stancil.
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1392.93,1395.452,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-10566,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1458.438,1464.581,Has the Honduran Government offered to arrest and extradite that witness from Honduras to bring him back to the United States?
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1464.581,1471.285,"Not on this record, Your Honor, but the Honduran consulate has offered... has said it would have attempted to locate Sirena and interview him."
2005.04-10566,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1499.01,1513.378,"Well, that, Mr.... could your client's attorney have argued in the Virginia habeas proceeding that his procedural default should have been excused because of ineffective assistance of trial counsel at the time of the default?"
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1513.378,1514.888,Yes.
2005.04-10566,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1548.323,1560.419,"Well, Miranda gives you the same, you know, right to... to reach a counsel, a right to remain silent, and yet, if your lawyer doesn't raise a Miranda violation in trial, it can be waived."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1560.419,1561.102,Correct.
2005.04-10566,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1561.102,1564.04,Why should this be elevated to a special status beyond that?
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1564.04,1565.367,"It's not elevated, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1581.263,1595.186,"No, but isn't... isn't the problem with your analogy that counsel do not advise their clients about Brady rights because, by definition or in the normal case by definition, counsel doesn't know whether there's a Brady violation."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1614.447,1627.443,"A Brady violation is a closer match than a... for example, a Miranda violation, for the central reason that the consular officer and the foreign national, working together, know best whether to exercise those rights."
2005.04-10566,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1627.443,1645.094,"But in this case, wasn't it true that the trial counsel knew about the Vienna Convention right and, for whatever reason, thought his client would not be aided by talking to the Honduran counsel... consul."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1645.094,1648.282,"As an initial matter, it's... it's not perfectly clear in the record."
2005.04-10566,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1688.935,1691.706,That may or may not have been ineffective assistance of counsel.
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1710.94,1720.098,"--Because that cuts out an entire category of treaty violations where it may have been a strategic decision by counsel not to raise it, but where that decision is ultimately mistaken."
2005.04-10566,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1721.458,1741.603,"Well, it's true about the right to remain silent or any other rights that are very much the rights of the defendant, not the rights of the counsel, but they're exercised in consultation with the counsel, and if they make a determination not to contact the consul, then that's a decision that counsel made, and if it's ineffective, there are remedies for that."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1745.041,1757.481,"--Well, I should back up and... and point to the first reason why a lawyer isn't effective in making this decision and... and first, state that the lawyer here never told Mario Bustillo about the Vienna Convention."
2005.04-10566,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1800.146,1800.656,"But once, at least--"
2005.04-10566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1800.656,1806.617,Why... the ultimate question I think is the one Justice Alito asked.
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1861.222,1863.66,I'd... I'd like to correct that very clearly.
2005.04-10566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1866.681,1867.031,Yes.
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1867.031,1872.307,"--he submitted a motion to remand to... back to the trial court, saying there's a Vienna Convention violation--"
2005.04-10566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1872.307,1876.089,"He said... when I read that motion, which I'll do... so it's in the record?"
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1876.089,1876.406,"--Yes, sir."
2005.04-10566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1876.406,1876.856,Where?
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1876.856,1880.204,It's... the Virginia courts don't paginate the record--
2005.04-10566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.204,1881.383,Do I have it in front of me somewhere?
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1881.383,1882.183,"--It's in the record, yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1882.183,1882.91,"Fine, okay."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1889.88,1890.746,We would have--
2005.04-10566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1890.746,1895.522,"But is... my general question is, is that approach sufficient under the law?"
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1895.522,1898.543,--Getting back... is ineffective assistance sufficient?
2005.04-10566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1898.71,1926.007,"Say, in an appropriate case, I can't find a rule for every case... but that our obligation, as interpreted by the ICJ, is that we have, as the law of the land, a treaty that says you tell the person about his Vienna Convention right, and if you don't, now says the ICJ, there has to be some kind of... of effective remedy."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1932.894,1943.729,"Because relying on the lawyer to do the duty of the State does not effectuate the fundamental interest the treaty serves, which is establishing direct contact between the consular officer and the lawyer."
2005.04-10566,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1943.729,1956.326,"--But the... the only thing in... in the second part of Justice Breyer's question, the only thing that the lawyer has to be relied upon is to get the issue raised at the appropriate point in the trial process."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,1988.927,1994.553,Leaving aside the conflict of interest that the lawyer would suffer on two additional reasons why the... why the lawyer is not--
2005.04-10566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.553,1997.408,Can I come back to the conflict of interest?
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2001.357,2001.923,--He was retained.
2005.04-10566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2001.923,2002.951,He was retained.
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2002.951,2003.545,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.545,2004.028,By whom?
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2004.028,2005.555,By the defendant's family.
2005.04-10566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2005.555,2009.671,"There... there are rules on conflicts of interest too, you know."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2028.738,2030.098,I'm not sure I--
2005.04-10566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2030.098,2031.009,"And if so, what is it?"
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2031.009,2032.519,--Is there international authority required--
2005.04-10566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2032.519,2033.78,Anywhere.
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2035.041,2035.141,--Well--
2005.04-10566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2035.141,2040.917,"--think for our most severe violations, we provide an approach that you tell the lawyer."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2053.514,2054.69,--It does not.
2005.04-10566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2056.368,2059.817,"Well, I'm not interested in, now at the moment, whether it does or does not work."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2068.641,2075.362,"--Well, the... well, the ICJ has held that you can't rely... that these procedural default rules are not adequate to vindicate the treaty interests."
2005.04-10566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2075.362,2077.371,I'm not talking about a procedural default rule.
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2079.05,2080.822,In... in terms of ineffective assistance?
2005.04-10566,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2080.822,2093.601,"Yes, the procedural default rule would mean you get procedurally defaulted if you fail to bring it up, but I think you might say if you failed to bring it up the first time that the lawyer knew about it."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2102.243,2114.673,"I believe that actually would not be the practice in civil law countries, for example, where a judge as the inquisitor has much more flexibility than he does in an adversarial system when and whether to consider evidence that may or may not have come in at a certain time."
2005.04-10566,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2125.592,2125.742,No.
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2186.074,2197.836,"And again, ineffective... an ineffective assistance claim doesn't give full effect because under this Court's cases, if it's... if it's in the rubric of ineffective assistance, you leave strategic decisions to the lawyer, and so if--"
2005.04-10566,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2197.836,2206.9,"Well, the problem at the trial level, I think, is you would be... you couldn't make it at that stage because it's the very lawyer who's ineffective."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2234.292,2252.776,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and in that sense, it's very much like the rule this Court laid down in Federal cases in Massaro where it... it explained just the practical difficulties associated with requiring claims that need, for example, a prejudice record, and everybody believes that a prejudice showing would need to be made before you could establish a violation."
2005.04-10566,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2278.152,2289.981,"Well, it's the same point we've been covering, but all seem to concede that the particular characteristics of a national system have to be taken into account."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2298.556,2299.023,--I--
2005.04-10566,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2299.023,2304.85,"--an exception to the usual rules that prevail in that system, and that's not consistent with what the treaty requires."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2304.85,2318.884,"--Your Honor, it's no more of an exception than Brady, which is exactly the same situation where you have a right that you don't know either the violation has occurred, because they didn't tell him and his lawyer didn't tell him, and you don't know the evidence that could have been developed."
2005.04-10566,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2329.636,2337.534,"Well, but that's because in Brady, as Justice Souter has already pointed out, there's a factual piece of evidence that the State has withheld."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2340.972,2346.859,"We believe it is, in part, because this is an affirmative obligation on the State."
2005.04-10566,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2396.327,2403.13,"Well, maybe after the first ineffective assistance claim is decided in the client's favor, people are going to wake up."
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2459.285,2462.174,It doesn't seem to be the case.
2005.04-10566,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2479.579,2481.157,May I ask you one factual question?
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2499.14,2503.089,We did file an ineffective assistance claim in the State habeas petition.
2005.04-10566,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2503.089,2504.683,But that... wasn't... I'm... I'm sorry?
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2504.683,2514.341,The... the circuit court... we then tried to amend... habeas counsel tried to amend the petition to specify an additional... that to include within that ineffective assistance claim the failure to notify.
2005.04-10566,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2514.341,2519.134,But you did that on collateral review as opposed to trying to supplement the direct appeal?
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2519.134,2519.55,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2519.55,2519.967,Okay.
2005.04-10566,1,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,2519.967,2521.561,"If I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time."
2005.04-10566,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2521.561,2522.738,"Thank you, Mr. Stancil."
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,2531.896,2535.001,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-10566,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2581.626,2585.064,Have there been any courts that have held the contrary?
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,2600.015,2602.525,There have been only a handful of courts that have dealt with the issue.
2005.04-10566,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2602.525,2611.267,"Which are... which is the best authority abroad for you that... where they say, no, we're sorry, we give you no remedy, even though we violated the treaty?"
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,2611.267,2612.527,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2624.707,2625.507,That's a holding?
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,2626.635,2626.985,--It is a holding.
2005.04-10566,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2628.812,2633.771,"So we have a lower court opinion in Canada, and you... and they have a lower court opinion in Australia."
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,2637.886,2639.746,"--I think that's absolutely fair, and what's--"
2005.04-10566,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2639.746,2639.912,All right.
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,2650.254,2652.681,"--I think, though, it is--"
2005.04-10566,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2652.681,2653.358,Is that fair?
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,2653.358,2654.786,"--Yes, that is fair, but I think it--"
2005.04-10566,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2654.786,2654.902,Okay.
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,2661.672,2661.872,--Yes.
2005.04-10566,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2661.872,2663.433,"It didn't say this, but suppose it had."
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,2689.997,2691.263,If it had said that--
2005.04-10566,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2691.263,2691.391,Okay.
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,2691.391,2691.557,--I would agree with you.
2005.04-10566,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2691.557,2698.361,"And once we're there, it seems to me what we're arguing about is not this metaphysical thing about rights."
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,2730.154,2750.817,"I think the starting point is with the text and context of the treaty, and beginning with the preamble that makes it very clear that this treaty, like other international treaties, is an international agreement concerned with the obligations of the signatories, not with any particular granting of rights for the individuals who may benefit from those obligations."
2005.04-10566,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2781.653,2800.848,"Well, the... the thing I found stronger the other way, which you can answer, is that ordinarily, I guess, since they quote in one these amicus briefs, since at least 1927 we consider... our State Department... the treaties that have obligations are... also require appropriate enforcement remedies, et cetera."
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,2829.484,2839.14,"--Your Honor, even following the ICJ opinion in Avena does not get petitioner the relief that he seeks in this Court or that he sought below."
2005.04-10566,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2885.703,2888.522,Is there any other relief sought by the petitioner?
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,2915.49,2916.59,"--There... there was not, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2959.167,2963.137,There's a question I would like to ask you about the State.
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3017.688,3022.592,I think that would be one way to ensure better compliance with our obligations under the treaty.
2005.04-10566,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3034.03,3044.386,So State... you don't have any problem with State judges being enlisted as officers to execute Federal treaty obligations on behalf of the State Department or someone?
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3044.386,3053.575,"--I... I was hearing the question, I guess, of whether that would be something that judges could do, and I... and I was responding to... to that part of it."
2005.04-10566,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3062.597,3065.383,Can you tell us what the State of Oregon has done in this regard--
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3065.383,3065.766,This--
2005.04-10566,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3065.766,3066.182,--or other States?
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3066.182,3068.884,--We have done a number of things.
2005.04-10566,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3087.012,3093.832,"Well, how do you think it should... you think the police officer should give it as part of the Miranda warnings, or what's... what's your conclusion as to how it should be implemented?"
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3093.832,3102.605,"The State Department has recommended that as soon as it is known that the individual is a foreign national, that the information be given."
2005.04-10566,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3104.288,3108.592,Does this mean that the... the desk sergeant in the police station or who?
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3108.592,3115.829,--We've actually worked with our jail managers to develop a form that could be used as part of the booking process to provide the information.
2005.04-10566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3135.91,3141.73,"Well, it does obligate immediate notification to the defendant, doesn't it?"
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3141.73,3151.519,"It says without delay that the information should be provided, but that phrase, without delay, when you look at the prefatory materials and how the ICJ has construed it, doesn't mean immediately."
2005.04-10566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3151.519,3161.292,"Well, but there are two different without delay points, one, when you tell the... the defendant; and secondly, whether or not he wants the consulate notified, and there's the second delay."
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3161.292,3170.231,"And the way the ICJ has construed that, after reviewing the materials, is that the phrase, without delay, means the same thing in the three places that it's used in the treaty."
2005.04-10566,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3177.302,3181.92,So you think it's... it's not... it's not required for police interrogators in the station to include this?
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3184.506,3189.86,It is not required under the treaty that the advice be given prior to interrogation.
2005.04-10566,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3190.326,3192.042,"Well, how about during the interrogation?"
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3192.042,3198.112,"At some point in a prolonged interrogation, that right is... that obligation will arise."
2005.04-10566,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3198.112,3199.512,"I mean, it seems to me it's not like rocket science."
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3204.883,3216.941,"Well, and part of the difficulty is it's not so easy to give simply a simple advice because it's not always clear that someone is a foreign national, and even if there's a suggestion that someone might be--"
2005.04-10566,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3216.941,3217.441,"Well, that's easy."
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3222.595,3229.999,"--The other difficulty is that for some foreign nationals, this is not... this is not the case where the detainee controls the contact with consular officials."
2005.04-10566,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3240.723,3243.341,"I mean, all you've got to do is--"
2005.04-10566,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3243.341,3243.991,That's their problem.
2005.04-10566,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3243.991,3247.609,--You ask him what his name is.
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3254.147,3260.884,And certainly we're hoping to move toward better compliance by moving toward that goal.
2005.04-10566,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3261.667,3264.186,"But, I mean, why does it have to be a distant goal?"
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3266.388,3273.025,--And I think it gets easier as more cases like this one certainly get the message out.
2005.04-10566,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3273.025,3273.191,"Of course, he doesn't have to answer that."
2005.04-10566,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3273.191,3277.143,Your answer... your answer doesn't give me confidence that you're implementing the treaty.
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3277.143,3295.855,"But the question is when there is a violation and... and if it's from lack of education or lack of effort on the State's part to ensure that people understand the obligation, then does the treaty give the individual the right in a criminal proceeding to have that lawfully obtained evidence kept out of the proceeding."
2005.04-10566,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3310.447,3319.553,A little while ago you were asked about the judge asking whether or not to ask the defendant if the advice was given him.
2005.04-10566,2,36859,mary_h_williams,,3333.896,3351.774,"I think the question would come down to whether the judge falls in the category of competent authorities under the treaty, and I'm not sure how that would be construed, whether it would be construed to include the judge or if it's primarily focused on the... the State government officials who would be involved in the... the criminal proceeding."
2005.04-10566,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3354.476,3355.742,"Thank you, Ms. Williams."
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3358.344,3361.98,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-10566,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3398.718,3417.596,Does... does... would Virginia allow the... a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel to be raised on collateral review for failure of counsel to... to advise the client or take action on the client's behalf under the Virginia Convention... the Vienna Convention during... during the... the direct proceedings?
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3417.596,3419.381,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3456.771,3457.771,I have a couple--
2005.04-10566,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3457.771,3459.806,There was a State collateral review?
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3459.806,3460.056,Yes.
2005.04-10566,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3463.008,3469.912,"--thinking of the wrong thing, but it seemed to me I have a couple of opinions here on habeas, State habeas, where they did raise it."
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3472.364,3475.982,"It... it was raised in the... in the State trial court, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3475.982,3478.351,And... and not on--
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3478.351,3490.825,"But... but what was... and the State trial court chose to deny the ineffective assistance of counsel claim on a variety of reasons, and it was chosen... he chose not to appeal that to the Supreme Court of Virginia."
2005.04-10566,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3490.825,3498.431,I thought the first time it was raised was on direct appeal by appellate counsel.
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3498.431,3502.216,Appellate counsel on direct appeal attempted to raise it.
2005.04-10566,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3539.988,3542.857,And the reason for the denial?
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3542.857,3555.098,"There were several reasons for the denial, one of which was statute of limitations, but the court also noted that even if it had been made within the statute of limitations, there was no merit to it."
2005.04-10566,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3593.455,3599.359,I think that counsel said that the... the people at the consulate... they tend to talk a lot?
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3599.359,3608.465,"Yes, he... yes, he did, Your Honor, and having grown up as the son of diplomats, he was obviously familiar with diplomats and their behavior in social settings."
2005.04-10566,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3660.913,3667.733,"--So then the... then the only question really is this thing that I find metaphysical, and maybe you can explain it."
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3731.889,3732.439,No.
2005.04-10566,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3733.122,3734.289,You explain to me where I... where I--
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3734.289,3737.657,"--Well, I will certainly attempt to do so."
2005.04-10566,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3813.969,3821.706,Is... is a defense counsel a competent authority under the treaty for the purposes of notifying the accused?
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3821.706,3825.991,"I... I don't think that... that he is, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3849.772,3867.568,"You know, one thing I find difficulty understanding in this case is I just can't understand how a lawyer thought it would be to his client's advantage not to consul... not to tell the consul because the facts are quite persuasive that he really was severely prejudiced by the fact he didn't get all the help he could have gotten."
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3867.568,3874.972,"Your... Your Honor, I would refer... I... the only thing in the record is the affidavits of... of the retained counsel."
2005.04-10566,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3878.274,3879.757,How... how could he make such a judgment?
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3882.709,3883.075,--I--
2005.04-10566,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3883.075,3886.827,--Because the prejudice is just stark in... in this case.
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3890.945,3896.932,"--Well, with all due respect, Your Honor, we would disagree as to whether... as to the extent of the prejudice."
2005.04-10566,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3929.586,3933.688,"You know, that's kind of a tough position to put the lawyer in."
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3957.887,3978.966,"That's perhaps so, Your Honor, and that's one thing... thing that, whatever rule you craft, you need to be very careful of and that is preventing gamesmanship on... on the part of attorneys and criminal defendants so that these Vienna Convention claims are not raised after the fact, which is another reason to... to--"
2005.04-10566,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3978.966,3994.008,It's kind of like a speedy trial claim.
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,3995.51,3996.943,"--Yes, Your Honor, he would."
2005.04-10566,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3996.943,4003.697,"Of course, that might be likely if there had been a history of these claims being successful, but none has ever prevailed."
2005.04-10566,3,46377,william_e_thro,,4011.367,4017.505,"Yes, Your Honor, and that would obviously... if this Court announced a new rule, then that would perhaps change the thing."
2005.04-10566,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4019.355,4021.021,"Thank you, Mr. Thro."
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4029.127,4032.163,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4049.506,4050.422,I wonder what that means.
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4061.63,4063.266,"--It does, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4063.266,4069.419,"Well, suppose a sheriff somewhere grabs the letter, keeps it, and the counsel sues him under State property law."
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4096.502,4103.055,I think in that situation you would have... you wouldn't be asserting an individual right under the treaty.
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4103.689,4103.872,No.
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4105.341,4108.626,--There could be situations--
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4108.626,4109.076,No.
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4119.082,4128.52,--The straight... I think the answer would be is you would have a treaty violation if you had a State law which prevented our Nation from giving effect to our obligations under the Vienna Convention--
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4128.52,4129.337,But I'm not saying a treaty.
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4140.795,4145.497,"--If they were asserting a cause of action under State property law and that were the result, then yes."
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4145.497,4146.698,That's correct.
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4146.698,4146.698,"That would be the case, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4146.698,4146.765,"Okay, fine."
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4146.765,4147.165,But... but--
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4147.165,4151.95,And now what they're doing here is they're saying we have a cause of action.
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4176.249,4191.009,"--In these... in these two cases... one you have on Federal habeas, one you had on direct appeal... individuals are seeking to affirmatively invoke rights that they claim that they can enforce under the Vienna Convention, and we don't think that the Vienna Convention confers those individual rights."
2005.04-10566,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4200.865,4209.721,But is there a difference between the rights that could be asserted by the consul or a consulate official and the rights that could be asserted by a criminal defendant?
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4209.721,4211.021,"I don't think so, Justice Alito."
2005.04-10566,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4222.711,4235.769,"And if a consulate official knew that a national of that country was being detained and wanted access to that person and that was being denied by... by the State officials, there would be no remedy in Federal court?"
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4244.708,4245.608,"That's right, Justice Alito."
2005.04-10566,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4264.62,4273.608,Are there any countries that recognize individually enforceable rights under this convention overseas on behalf of American citizens?
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4273.608,4283.464,"--No, Your Honor, and what... the petitioners and their amici here are asking this Court to be the first court to recognize an individually enforceable right under this treaty."
2005.04-10566,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4283.464,4287.332,"What about that Australian case that was mentioned, I believe one case where at least--"
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4287.332,4289.784,"Well, Your Honor--"
2005.04-10566,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4289.784,4291.051,--evidence was excluded?
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4292.986,4296.354,--There... there is Australian authority going directly to the contrary.
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4330.491,4334.895,I imagine there's not... there's some little authority both ways.
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4397.013,4400.699,"--Because, to be blunt, the ICJ decision is wrong."
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4432.968,4436.336,"Well, then you're going back to putting weight on the absence of authority."
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4448.144,4448.427,What you don't--
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4448.427,4451.346,--are there authorities in these other states to the contrary?
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4452.762,4465.486,"--There are authorities that we've cited where courts have rejected the notion that article 36 creates individually enforceable rights, in Canada and Australia, and there's a case in Germany where they refused to provide for a suppression remedy."
2005.04-10566,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4485.745,4492.232,"In your view, just as a practical matter, what we have here, how... how should the States enforce this obligation?"
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4492.232,4502.754,"Well, the States should enforce it generally by giving information to the detainee at the point in time when they realize... determine that he's a foreign national."
2005.04-10566,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4504.17,4507.539,Do they have any obligation to inquire whether he is?
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4510.608,4511.86,--Generally--
2005.04-10566,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4511.86,4515.412,"--when you first give him the Miranda warnings, or tell me how you think it should work?"
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4515.412,4518.53,--Generally it happens during the arrest process.
2005.04-10566,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4528.702,4532.57,Do you think they have the affirmative obligation to ask him if he is a foreign national?
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4532.57,4541.593,--The State Department advises law enforcement officers at the Federal and State and local level that ordinarily they should make that determination.
2005.04-10566,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4541.593,4555.417,"If they don't... if they can't ask him... I mean, I assume many foreign nationals are detained fairly close to the border, and if you start saying, well, my first question is, are you a citizen or not, you've got to give Miranda warnings first saying you don't have to answer any question that might incriminate you."
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4555.417,4555.833,That's right.
2005.04-10566,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4555.833,4556.733,It's kind of a catch 22.
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4556.733,4558.649,"That's right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-10566,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4594.834,4604.106,"Well, I thought you indicated that you advise the States that they do have to advise him of this right during the booking process or the interrogation."
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4604.106,4607.741,"--Well, when they... when they learn that the person is a foreign national."
2005.04-10566,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4675.078,4692.956,"Has it worked the other way around when a young American citizen is detained in... in a jail someplace abroad, and has the United States ever then... what efforts have been made?"
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4692.956,4696.241,"--Your Honor, the efforts that we undertake are diplomatic efforts."
2005.04-10566,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4708.049,4708.965,Has it worked anyplace?
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4712.083,4730.978,"Yes, Your Honor. In fact, during the 1980's the United States complained to Mexico about the fact that American citizens had not received consular notification, and through the result of those diplomatic discourses, they negotiated an... a agreement whereby American citizens were brought back to the United States for custody."
2005.04-10566,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4777.571,4781.189,"When you say they... they contemplate it, how do they express that contemplation?"
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4785.057,4790.961,"--Your Honor, they refer to rights that individuals can assert or should be able to assert in judicial courts, in the domestic courts."
2005.04-10566,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4790.961,4797.115,But they... they provide expressly that these are rights that may be asserted individually in national courts?
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4797.115,4803.352,"There... Your Honor, there are varying degrees of specificity, but yes, they... in some cases they do provide for that explicitly."
2005.04-10566,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4803.352,4806.387,But they... they go beyond the reference to rights as... as in article 36.
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4806.387,4806.604,Yes.
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4809.922,4819.694,"Do they, in all those property cases, you know, from like the early part of this republic where property law was determined in accordance with... you know all those cases that are cited."
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4819.694,4820.094,Right.
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4820.094,4826.914,"In those treaties where the courts then looked to the treaty to help decide who owned what property, they used it as a rule of decision."
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4831.866,4847.892,"They didn't, Your Honor, but those treaties, as we explain in our brief, are dealing with commercial relations, property rights, and... and are almost entirely dealing with individuals and how they should be treated in foreign states, are much more amenable to a construction that they create individually enforceable rights."
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4860.55,4864.085,Where does this term come from as applied to a rule of decision?
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4873.374,4873.874,Your Honor--
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4873.874,4874.691,You say the way to think about that--
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4874.691,4874.907,--read--
2005.04-10566,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4874.907,4879.511,"--is the, quote, individually enforceable rights."
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4879.511,4881.88,--We would suggest read the treaty.
2005.04-10566,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4913.582,4918.467,"Well, I... I would agree there, but we're not... this... this isn't a case about subjecting them to suit."
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4918.467,4926.89,"What you... what you... what they're asking you to do, Your Honor, is to say that this treaty is individually enforceable in our courts."
2005.04-10566,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4926.89,4933.544,"Well, yes, but... but that is... that's not equivalent to saying that it's... it is subjecting the United States to suit."
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4933.544,4934.06,May I answer the question?
2005.04-10566,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4934.06,4934.527,Yes.
2005.04-10566,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4934.527,4938.979,"It is, Your Honor, insofar as if you think it in waiver of sovereign immunity terms."
2005.04-10566,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4948.316,4949.918,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-10566,5,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,4953.12,4954.97,Thank you.
2005.04-10566,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5018.588,5028.96,"But it refers to his rights, to make it clear that the consular office does not have the right to contact him in the situations where he would prefer not to be contacted by his consul."
2005.04-10566,5,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,5028.96,5030.793,"I disagree, Your Honor."
2005.04-10566,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5052.07,5055.438,I... I thought you said the third condition was creation of a cause of action.
2005.04-10566,5,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,5055.438,5056.805,--Availability of a cause of action.
2005.04-10566,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5057.974,5059.574,Where... where is that in this statute?
2005.04-10566,5,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,5059.574,5068.43,"--The Virginia habeas statute provides a cause of action if you are held in violation of Federal law, and in Sanchez Llamas, the cause of action is the criminal prosecution."
2005.04-10566,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5070.196,5072.882,You meant the statute has to create a cause of action.
2005.04-10566,5,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,5072.882,5076.084,"--The cause of action, just like 1983, allows--"
2005.04-10566,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5076.084,5079.036,"I mean, the... the treaty has to create a cause of action."
2005.04-10566,5,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,5079.036,5079.586,--That's not correct.
2005.04-10566,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5083.454,5085.204,"Well, 1983 is a good example."
2005.04-10566,5,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,5100.63,5109.986,"--Not automatically, but if you have a statute that said his rights and refers rights and makes it his obligation and his decision whether to invoke them, it would be classic rights creating."
2005.04-10566,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5109.986,5122.21,"It said his rights in Gonzaga v. Doe, which dealt with the student privacy rights act, and we held... and the... we... the Court held that that was... did not give rise to individually enforceable rights."
2005.04-10566,5,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,5122.21,5126.845,--I would... I would compare the language of article 36(2) to any of the rights cases this Court has decided.
2005.04-10566,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5179.209,5180.392,"Thank you, Mr. Stancil."
2005.04-10566,5,36616,mark_thomas_stancil,,5180.392,5180.392,Thank you.
