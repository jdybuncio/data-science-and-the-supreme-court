1967.335,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,38.358,"Number 699 -- no. Number 335, Hanover Shoe Company Incorporated, petitioner versus United Shoe Machinery Corporation, and number 463, United Shoe Machinery Corporation, petitioner versus Hanover Shoe Incorporated."
1967.335,0,31040,james_v_hayes,,42.662,50.344,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,691.118,698.203,"I do not know that I quite understand that rule that in assessing damages, courts do not go beyond the first step."
1967.335,0,31040,james_v_hayes,,698.203,698.666,That is right.
1967.335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,698.666,699.261,What does that mean?
1967.335,0,31040,james_v_hayes,,699.261,704.083,It was first enunciated if I recall rightly by Justice Holmes.
1967.335,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,704.083,705.141,What does it mean?
1967.335,0,31040,james_v_hayes,,705.141,711.7,It means that the damage is measured at the time of the impact of the wrong.
1967.335,1,38985,ralph_m_carson,,2723.996,2725.537,Hanover's favor.
1967.335,2,31040,james_v_hayes,,2725.537,2726.182,I'm sorry.
1967.335,3,38985,ralph_m_carson,,2726.182,2727.349,You mean Hanover's favor?
1967.335,4,31040,james_v_hayes,,2727.349,2728.744,Oh thank you Ralph.
1967.335,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3005.019,3016.833,"Mr. Hayes, do you see any essential inconsistency between the Court of Appeals during what it did with respect to taxes and yet rejecting to pass on to penalty?"
1967.335,4,31040,james_v_hayes,,3016.833,3017.686,I haven't thought of that.
1967.335,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3053.503,3067.928,"It seems to me that you could well argue that if they are going to get down to the actual out of pocket cost in the taxing, they could well get the same thing on the passing on."
1967.335,4,31040,james_v_hayes,,3071.18,3073.201,"Right, the order of Oil Jobber cases did."
1967.335,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3073.201,3077.33,Say you actually passed on this remedies to your customer --
1967.335,4,31040,james_v_hayes,,3077.33,3078.961,Yes.
1967.335,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3078.961,3090.739,And perhaps you are not losing any money at all and yet the Court permitted you to -- permits you to recover in spite of you having you passed it on?
1967.335,4,31040,james_v_hayes,,3090.739,3124.727,"Now if we have in fact passed on, if the fact situation were like for example the Oil Jobber cases, if for example incidentally these machine cost prepare shoes run similar item in a sense of pair but let us assume that every time United changed its rates and increased it $0.1 a share, we -- because of that, increased our sales price $0.1 a share."
1967.335,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3150.68,3156.306,"Well, you have."
1967.335,4,31040,james_v_hayes,,3156.306,3165.798,United further would deny recovery here because it says there was no formal demand to sell.
1967.335,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3524.643,3525.828,Can I ask you?
1967.335,4,31040,james_v_hayes,,3525.828,3525.956,Yes.
1967.335,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3525.956,3529.372,Are Hanover's recovery possible?
1967.335,4,31040,james_v_hayes,,3529.372,3531.132,"Oh yes, completely."
1967.335,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3531.132,3531.883,All --
1967.335,4,31040,james_v_hayes,,3531.883,3541.044,"In full, the full trebled amount and United gets a deduction on its tax return for whatever recovery it pays."
1967.335,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3547.517,3548.774,Mr. Carson.
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3548.774,3553.4,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.335,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3764.033,3767.867,Is there any precedence supporting your position here?
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3767.867,3768.799,Yes.
1967.335,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3768.799,3772.923,Could you tell me what it is?
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3772.923,3777.621,"Well, they're cited in our brief Your Honor, I will just have to recur to it."
1967.335,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3847.137,3849.147,I want treble-damage cases.
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3849.147,3852.852,"In treble-damage cases, I do not know of any."
1967.335,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3860.246,3860.931,I have read your brief.
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3860.931,3863.252,You have seen that.
1967.335,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3863.252,3877.697,"As I understand it and since the Clayton Act in all of the treble-damage cases that have been litigated, this theory appears in none of them?"
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3877.697,3889.218,It appears on none of them because the theory of the damage is not adapted to the consideration of taxes.
1967.335,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3889.218,3890.206,Why?
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3890.206,3895.058,Perhaps I should go into the later part of my argument and call to Your Honors attention. –-
1967.335,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3895.058,3912.251,"I think practically every -- well in the great many treble-damage cases if you do not have a sister or a brother to this particular one, you have got cousins in which the tax theory might have been applied and worked out?"
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3912.251,3914.735,My experience does not include those Your Honor.
1967.335,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3924.469,3928.432,Would you stop your tax?
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3959.764,3961.792,I do not see that it would Your Honor.
1967.335,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3970.576,3974.047,Unhappily as you know Mr. Carson you always have to look for it --
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,3974.047,4030.977,"I know what the Court is concerned with, but I will submit that this is a unique situation. I know no situation, I can conceive of none where a lessee who has leased without protest for here 16 years in fact 55 years and has benefited from the use of the machines very, very handsomely and is never has to buy them has yet recovered an award on the basis that it would have bought them and if that is to be done, I think that any court and I assume Your Honors would if that comes in that comfortable form, any court would have to say what the Court of Appeals said here as to taxes, “calculations must include those elements which a business corporation would necessarily consider in choosing between the two alternatives”."
1967.335,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4107.443,4117.755,"Suppose in every one of the years in question when Hanover was leasing this machinery, Hanover had paid no tax?"
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4120.412,4124.031,"Yes, we would not have that calculation."
1967.335,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4198.103,4199.037,"Mr. Carson, I understood that --"
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4199.037,4200.952,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1967.335,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4200.952,4213.673,"Mr. Hayes to say that this issue was neither raised or argued in the District Court or on the briefs or an argument before the Court of Appeals, I wonder why?"
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4213.673,4214.948,He later corrected himself.
1967.335,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4232.597,4233.63,No need of going into it.
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4235.764,4251.896,I think Mr. Hayes will agree with me that there was a slip of the tongue which he corrected and the income tax point was argued and taken up and accepted by Court of Appeals on reasoning which I will not reiterate because it seems to us unexceptional.
1967.335,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4816.959,4819.871,"Mr. Carson, I confess I am having some difficulty."
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4819.871,4821.196,Thank you sir.
1967.335,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4821.196,4827.397,Because I do not understand the theory to which this argument is addressed.
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4837.917,4839.308,You do have before you that.
1967.335,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4839.308,4841.577,"Well now, will you explain that to me?"
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4841.577,4843.916,Why you have the merits of the judgment before you?
1967.335,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4843.916,4845.42,Yes.
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4845.42,4847.725,We have Your Honor a number of points.
1967.335,5,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4847.725,4855.518,"As distinguished from the various points that have been made here about the measure of damages, the retroactivity and so on."
1967.335,5,38985,ralph_m_carson,,4855.518,4856.581,Yes.
1967.335,6,29010,justice_bernnan,,7097.489,7105.124,"Mr. Carson, I suppose the Court's affirmance to Judge Wyzanski decree, this Court's affirmance."
1967.335,7,38985,ralph_m_carson,,7105.124,7107.003,Yes.
1967.335,8,29010,justice_bernnan,,7107.003,7110.556,-- in some position to say what it was we thought we affirmed?
1967.335,9,38985,ralph_m_carson,,7110.556,7112.407,Your affirmance was a per curiam.
1967.335,10,29010,justice_bernnan,,7112.407,7113.718,Even so.
1967.335,11,38985,ralph_m_carson,,7113.718,7116.877,And it affirmed what he found and what he --
1967.335,12,29010,justice_bernnan,,7116.877,7118.753,It affirmed his decree is not?
1967.335,13,38985,ralph_m_carson,,7118.753,7119.411,Sir?
1967.335,14,29010,justice_bernnan,,7119.411,7120.249,It affirmed his decree?
1967.335,15,38985,ralph_m_carson,,7120.249,7123.176,It is indeed.
1967.335,16,29010,justice_bernnan,,7123.176,7125.658,May we not say what we thought we have heard?
1967.335,17,38985,ralph_m_carson,,7125.658,7137.712,"Of course you may and I think you should take into account in doing so, but I refer to my brief where counsel for the government said lease only was not attacked on the appeal."
1967.335,17,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7140.019,7142.3,"Mr. Hayes, you have few moments."
1967.335,18,31040,james_v_hayes,,7142.3,7147.997,Just a few moment and I hope will not consume them all Mr. Chief Justice.
1967.335,18,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7279.048,7280.514,Finish your statement.
1967.335,18,31040,james_v_hayes,,7280.514,7307.058,"-- by taken cared of by the service charges amounted to $239,000 when Hanover bought the machines, and five years later incurred actual cost of service despite the great raise in rates paid, the service cost amounted to a $118,000."
