1967.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,38.692,"Number 39, Hank Avery, Petitioner, versus Midland County, Texas et al."
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,40.535,45.853,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,92.693,94.073,900 acres?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,94.073,99.199,"900 square miles, I'm sorry, Your Honor, 900 square miles."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,509.282,529.1,"I didn't understand the -- or maybe I misunderstood but I -- it is not been my misunderstanding that the Supreme Court of Texas had held that that provision of the Federal Constitution is not applicable to Midland County, Texas but that provision of Constitution required was not what you said it required."
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,529.1,530.325,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,532.465,533.395,I thought you understand?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,533.395,535.341,-- an effort to cover background.
1967.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,578.638,587.047,"Well, could the Supreme Court of Texas specifically improve that a particular apportionment that was in effect?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,587.047,587.523,"No, sir"
1967.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,587.523,591.035,Did it say the existing apportionment was alright?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,591.035,607.467,"They held, Your Honor, specifically in regard to this matter of population that we disagree with the judgment of the trial court and its requirement that Midland County be redistricted in the commissioners precinct solely upon the basis of population."
1967.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,649.19,672.332,"Mr. Olson, what part do you think in the Supreme Court's conclusion was played by what it says speaking of the commissioner and the body, its legislative functions are negligible and county government is not otherwise comparable with the legislature of the State or the Federal Congress."
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,700.563,711.358,"Well, if it please the Court, I do not agree with the statement of the Supreme Court of Texas and I'll point out that to the Court --"
1967.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,711.358,720.094,You mean you don't agree with the statement its legislative functions are negligible?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,720.094,725.938,The course is hard to define what constitute legislative functions are hard for me to define.
1967.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,730.098,731.811,"Well, this raises a nice question."
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,731.811,731.992,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,731.992,746.571,"If the Supreme Court of Texas says that the -- a unit of Texas government function has only negligible legislative function, how much may we go behind that?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,746.571,767.607,"Well, I think that this Court when it looks at the statutory and the constitutional duties and responsibilities, they're vested in the Commissioners Court of Midland County, can for itself make this decision that the Supreme Court has passed overheard me."
1967.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,767.607,778.806,Do you have home rules down in Texas in the sense that the City of Midland is an independent district?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,778.806,779.47,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.162,789.257,And that the county board has no jurisdiction over the areas in Midland?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,789.257,789.599,"No, sir."
1967.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,796.191,797.731,Right.
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,797.731,808.107,One being they have -- they establish a tax rate that applies to all of the taxable values of property both inside and outside the City of Midland.
1967.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,812.388,821.754,"But don't they just have to take the -- don't they just have to take the amount of money -- what the city says about that, about the tax rates?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,821.754,822.397,"No, sir."
1967.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,824.17,827.583,"Let say the city says, we need X dollars for the property tax."
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,836.319,842.853,"No, the Constitution provides certain rights to the city to levy an ad valorem tax and also to county."
1967.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.853,843.164,Alright.
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,845.095,845.92,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,850.296,861.787,"And the -- but the tax, the county levies his -- applies to the city?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,861.787,862.116,"No, sir."
1967.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,865.426,868.309,But the city -- city property is taxed?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,868.309,877.113,All of the property -- not owned by the city itself but owned by all the residents of the city and were also residents of Midland County Texas.
1967.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,877.113,879.795,How does the county fix the rate?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,881.241,886.06,The County fixes the rate by a majority of vote at the Commissioners Court.
1967.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,886.06,887.014,So commissioners what?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,890.759,891.408,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,891.408,892.433,-- property value?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,892.433,893.388,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,900.026,901.758,That applies in the City of Midland?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,901.758,903.085,"No, of the County of Midland."
1967.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,903.085,903.566,Yes.
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,903.566,911.47,And the value of the property is established by the governing body of Midland County sitting as a Board of Equalization.
1967.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,929.086,931.102,And you mean by fixing the rate?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,931.102,933.908,"No, sir, fixing the value of the property."
1967.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,963.011,964.453,When you say fix the rate?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,976.771,978.755,"Yes, and personal property."
1967.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,978.755,982.054,They can repeal the tax law?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,982.054,985.413,"Well, the maximum rate of course is set by Constitution."
1967.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,993.939,995.468,It's required to do that.
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,995.468,995.904,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,997.97,1002.075,So that the basic rate is fixed by the State Constitution?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1002.075,1005.54,"Well, the maximum is fixed by the State Constitution."
1967.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1009.691,1011.842,What does the Constitution say about that?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1011.842,1019.452,The Constitution says that it shall be established by the governing body of the county but that it shall not be in excess.
1967.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1035.953,1041.989,"Well, that would be a different courts that fixing the rate to the administration."

1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1108.461,1109.728,"No, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1143.973,1146.56,What are the constabulary boundaries?

1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1375.567,1376.712,It's a county function.
1967.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1402.262,1405.274,"Oh, does it?"

1967.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1709.768,1713.627,Is there any need for law enforcement jurisdiction inside the city?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1713.627,1728.625,"No, there's no overlapping of jurisdiction between the various law enforcement officers.Of course as a practical manner, large portion of the sheriff's responsibilities are serving papers along with the constable."

1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1827.174,1833.226,The county has authority under the statute to operate a welfare program.
1967.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1842.487,1843.691,That's all over the county?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1843.691,1846.331,All over the county including the City of Midland.
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1858.781,1861.914,"What does that mean, a city county cooperative?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1861.914,1882.245,A city -- they cooperate together on this -- on matters such as Mr. Justice White pointed out on a library that you could have a library on the west side and the east side or the city can cooperate with the county and establish one library which they've done in numerous counties.
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1899.037,1899.946,What funds?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1906.802,1907.372,"Yes, sir."

1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1913.761,1919.482,-- is the taxing authority for the entire county including the city?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1919.482,1925.251,"It is but city also is a taxing authority, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1925.251,1926.46,The city has its own court?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1926.46,1926.744,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1926.744,1928.603,And the city has its own power to tax?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1928.603,1929.716,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1931.352,1937.172,Do all of the funds go to state capital and then get returned to the city and county?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1937.172,1938.254,"No, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1947.419,1948.486,City sales tax.
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1948.486,1949.837,-- but that's not in this case.
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1949.837,1950.515,"Yes, right."
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1950.515,1953.634,But none of it goes to the state in its return.
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1961.981,1966.186,That is -- and a resident of Midland pays both city and county tax?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1966.186,1966.457,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1966.457,1969.092,And both city and the county therefore have funds.
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1969.092,1972.266,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1972.266,1975.531,So that's okay.
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,1975.531,1988.728,"Now, it is the position of the petitioner herein that the one man, one vote principle as set forth in Reynolds versus Sims applies to the governing body of Midland County, Texas."
1967.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1995.267,2001.532,"I told you before hand that only be permitted to tax, would you still take that position?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2001.532,2002.684,"I would, Your Honor."
1967.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2013.102,2018.386,That involve exclusively legislative by the relief?

1967.39,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2021.41,2022.236,You think not?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2022.236,2027.632,-- recollection was it involves some high state officials other than just --
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2027.632,2031.609,"Actually, Gray involved a Supreme Court judge of the state."
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2031.609,2031.849,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2031.849,2033.537,That case involved a judicial officer.
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2033.537,2033.794,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2033.794,2034.678,"Among others, isn't it?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2034.678,2036.036,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2036.036,2038.092,"So, they don't have any legislative power at all?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2038.092,2038.63,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2038.63,2040.787,"Although, some critics say otherwise."
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2040.787,2043.03,That was my understanding of it --
1967.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2043.03,2056.123,But isn't it critical to your position that there -- that the members of the county court are elected?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2056.123,2056.54,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.983,2079.672,"Do you think the state that provide for the appointment by the governor, the members of this Court?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2079.672,2097.052,"They could by constitutional amendment but it would take the constitutional amendment and of course -- well we never have constitutional amendment in Texas is by two-thirds vote of both houses submitted the vote of people but I think that they could, yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2137.062,2139.594,You mean on my part or on the part of your Texas Constitution.
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2139.594,2140.016,"No, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2141.736,2143.256,If that is what is called exactly.
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2143.256,2143.575,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2155.866,2158.356,"Chairman is also called the county judge, isn't it?"

1967.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2177.67,2180.152,If the judge would believe it must be a lawyer?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2180.152,2180.698,"No, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2222.755,2225.567,"Does it have anything to do with the schools, public schools?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2225.567,2226.131,"No, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2231.106,2233.646,Which will not connect within the city or the county government?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2233.646,2234.408,That's correct.
1967.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2258.506,2259.368,Was that judged?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2259.368,2259.932,Sir?
1967.39,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2259.932,2261.204,"Were they judged, all of those?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2261.204,2261.543,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2304.027,2312.41,How much in fact -- how much a function do these county officers have inside the city limits?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2320.382,2322.815,They have the same authority --
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2322.815,2325.819,Will they in fact exercise it?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2325.819,2327.923,"On occasion they do, yes sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2327.923,2332.205,Or do they spend most of their time to perform most of their duties that are outside the city limits.
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2332.205,2335.157,"Yes sir, they perform most of the duties outside the city."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2335.157,2340.084,"Because that -- the only place for is outside the city, outside of the Texas rangers and the --"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2340.084,2341.038,And highway patrol.

1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2342.036,2343.242,Yes.
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2343.242,2347.466,But they're the only local police outside the city?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2347.466,2356.015,"Well, except for the constable, and of course, they do have the designated function of serving all judicial papers."

1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2409.797,2411.758,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2411.758,2422.856,"-- and I suppose a tax -- how much would have been raised by taxes, county taxes in respect to that budget?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2424.479,2426.134,I would say it would be about the same.
1967.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2435.469,2448.209,"Now, can you give you us some idea as to the division of the receipts from county taxes as between the city and the western county?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2448.209,2448.391,The --
1967.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2448.391,2450.114,You would get it at that way.
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2450.114,2452.049,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2468.325,2474.216,Is there any way of getting rough approximation of the budget?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2483.347,2486.111,"Well, it would be hard to do, Your Honor."
1967.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2510.337,2510.898,Thank you.
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2510.898,2513.386,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2513.664,2529.144,"In most of the metropolitan area of the city, in the boundaries of the city or is there a suburban area of the Constitution?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2529.144,2529.439,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2540.641,2548.817,Do you happen to know in 1960 what the actual population of Midland was?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2548.817,2552.475,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2559.728,2564.089,What I was going to ask was how much was in the city and how much was suburban?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2566.724,2567.16,"No, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2580.5,2588.846,"That part which is outside, that is the suburbia of the metropolitan area, is that all in one other precinct?"

1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2592.681,2593.486,It's all --
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2593.486,2593.894,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2593.894,2594.833,All at number one?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2594.833,2597.37,95% of the population –-
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2597.37,2597.645,Yes.
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2597.645,2599.844,-- of Midland County is in Commissioners Precinct Number 1.
1967.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2599.844,2610.789,"So, in Precincts 2, 3, and 4, there is none of the -- even the outside the city limits metropolitan area of Midland, is that right?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2610.789,2611.283,"No, sir."
1967.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2637.952,2639.392,Alright.
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2639.392,2640.979,You have townships also?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2640.979,2642.502,Sir?
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2642.502,2646.719,You got -- what are called east townships in this county?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2646.719,2652.369,"No, we do not have a township, this is an incorporated city --"
1967.39,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2652.369,2653.875,"But in elsewhere in the county, you have?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2653.875,2654.259,"No, sir."
1967.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2734.514,2736.51,Control the subdivision of land?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2736.51,2736.861,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2736.861,2747.834,Would you explain that just a little because as I thought -- I understood you say that they didn't have the power to zone but now you say they have the power to control subdivision --
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2747.834,2748.024,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2748.024,2749.126,"-- in what way, Mr. Olson?"
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2749.126,2757.87,"That's a -- it may be construed as zoning in the sense, Your Honor."
1967.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2788.16,2791.189,You said it's located inside the city?
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2791.189,2791.587,"No, sir."
1967.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2900.919,2906.618,"But Mr. Olson, if you turn this around and apply what you have just said."
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,2916.007,2916.306,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2918.024,2920.219,97%.
1967.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3028.127,3036.134,I suppose you answer that after we have the recess.
1967.39,0,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,3036.134,3038.55,May it please the Court.
1967.39,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3183.812,3192.692,Mr. Beytagh?
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3192.692,3196.48,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3326.437,3328.086,Mr. Beytagh --
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3328.086,3328.886,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3328.886,3336.011,-- accepting the premise that you're entirely right as to the technical question of jurisdiction.
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3361.447,3361.612,I think that's --
1967.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3361.612,3389.505,"All -- all of the Texas I have in mind this that all of the Texas Supreme Court said was that in its opinion, the Equal Protection Clause does not require in all cases, it does not -- do not require a commissioners precinct division of Texas county on this basis in all cases dependent of course, in each case upon the existence and effect of other relevant factors such as those that we have mentioned."
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3409.823,3410.98,"I don't think it is, Your Honor."
1967.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3410.98,3411.51,Why?
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3411.51,3421.042,"First, they spend an awful lot of time in their brief upon the merits arguing that that was not the kind of plan that was suitable in Midland County."
1967.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3432.265,3445.801,Not that -- I thought that what it held was that because the Federal Constitution does not require in every single case of each of the 254 Texas counties that Reynolds against Sims be slavishly followed.
1967.39,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3474.916,3490.883,"Well, if they came up with just a pure population then, how would they satisfy the standard laid down with the Supreme Court, lined areas, geographies, miles of county road, taxable values, and so on?"
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3490.883,3493.649,I don't think they could satisfy that --
1967.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3493.649,3499.974,I do not understand that the Texas Supreme Court said that the Constitution required the commissioners to consider that.
1967.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3507.009,3507.647,"Well, Mr. Beytagh --"
1967.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3507.647,3509.345,Do I misread its opinion?
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3509.345,3509.51,No.
1967.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3524.459,3526.949,And flexibly at each one of the 254 counties.
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3526.949,3532.719,"But it was writing that opinion in the context of the case involving Midland County, this county."
1967.39,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3539.076,3540.38,"It could be taken into account, couldn't it?"
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3540.38,3541.478,It could be taken into account.
1967.39,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3541.478,3544.011,Could it be constitutionally taken into account?
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3545.517,3546.223,Yes.
1967.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3570.205,3572.917,I don't think that we understand saying.
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3701.238,3705.66,I think it rejected it as applied to Midland County Texas.
1967.39,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3707.316,3713.202,I think -- I have to frankly say to you that I can read it that way.
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3737.341,3745.874,But -- but this is against the background of a trial court decision in order requiring that the district can be on a population basis.
1967.39,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3763.561,3781.919,"But you see, the second full paragraph on page 150 in the record is a court statement that they disagreed with the judgment of the trial court in its requirement that the county be redistricting the commissioners precinct solely on the basis of population."
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,3789.705,3792.027,I think it's pretty clear that they would be reversed again.
1967.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4882.936,4907.584,"Mr. Beytagh, what do you do with the Supreme Court of Texas finding although theoretically the Board of County has general jurisdiction at the matter of actual experience down to the areas of the county board really is governing body for the rural area rather than the urban area, if the urban runs itself?"
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,4909.714,4911.895,"I think it is of some significance, Your Honor."
1967.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4933.629,4967.777,"If that statement we refer that the other gentlemen was justly passing remark they have minimal authorities that on -- if later in the opinion, the Court had some at considerably more at length says that the -- that the Commissioners Court has limited its major responsibilities to the non-urban areas in the county, that's a practical matter experience."
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,4993.74,5003.229,I suggest that it should have no impact if it's clear that the body still has important powers and functions over the people that live in the city.
1967.39,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5008.765,5031.03,Do you say that it's enough that as long as the county board actually taxes city people that that in itself is enough to say that the equal population principle applies to the local even if 99% of its functions are concerned with the rural areas alone?
1967.39,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,5031.03,5032.341,Well that's pushing it.
1967.39,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5061.642,5063.918,Mr. Browder.
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5063.918,5068.151,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please."
1967.39,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5204.388,5230.961,I gather that the -- I gather that you think that if the -- that part of that the Supreme Court remanded to let the County Commissioners Court redistrict and that the -- they came back with a population-based plan with the -- is it possible the Supreme Court will approve it?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5230.961,5232.402,Certainly.
1967.39,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5286.823,5293.944,"Well, if the court below did say that there were other factors which you would testify deviation from the population principle."
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5295.63,5296.509,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5297.481,5306.195,"And -- but it did -- but I gather it said or incurred that if these other factors were present, the population-based plan would be plan would be fully satisfactory."
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5306.195,5306.689,I think that's rather --
1967.39,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5306.689,5310.218,"But otherwise, the non-population base plan would be arbitrary?"
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5310.218,5311.525,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5316.524,5324.092,Do you read out formal cases that require population that these are predominant considerations?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5324.092,5325.156,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5325.861,5336.644,Can you give me a court opinion as telling the lower courts to redistrict with basis -- with the -- on the basis that population is a predominant consideration?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5336.644,5341.61,"I do, if you apply the rule to the substate governments."
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5343.512,5346.178,I don't see what difference it would leave.
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5362.706,5369.472,"I think the Texas Supreme Court has said to the lower courts, “You must have population in mind.”"
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5371.862,5374.767,Did it have this meaning that it must be the predominant consideration?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5374.767,5375.972,I believe it does.
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5384.171,5395.586,So you say -- do you construe this meaning if they can consider other factors even though that prevents population being a predominant consideration?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5395.586,5396.733,I doubt it.
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5398.404,5406.196,(Voice Overlap) that's really the difference between you and you're your Court has found and what the trial opinions have said?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5406.196,5412.503,I don't believe there's any difference between what this Court's opinion has said and what the Supreme Court says.
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5423.414,5428.559,You don't think that the predominant thing that we directed must be considered?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5428.559,5430.288,I think it must be considered.
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5430.288,5431.302,Predominantly?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5431.302,5432.926,I believe so.
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5494.652,5507.183,"That's substituting -- is that not substituting the idea of reasonable basis, a non-arbitrary basis for the test that we put in our cases that the first consideration must be population?"
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5507.183,5509.154,"I do not believe so, Your Honor."
1967.39,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5527.941,5530.38,"Well, many of the last --"
1967.39,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5530.38,5542.9,"I think that as far as these arguments, and I understand this that the Supreme Court not entirely clear."
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5568.205,5569.127,I believe so as I understand your --
1967.39,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5569.127,5576.502,"Well, that's not the way I read it because that's the last sentence in the opinion on page 150 of the record."
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5679.692,5687.625,"I am speaking only for Midland County as it gets three or three county commissioners, if you please, and Midland County, not for the other Texas counties."
1967.39,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5687.625,5706.398,"But as I read this it meant that the basic standard was population, one man, one vote variations are possible in the particular circumstances of the county and that the Constitution is justifiable."
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5722.8,5725.429,"I think that's exactly what it means, Your Honor."
1967.39,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5771.517,5797.744,What you're saying then and what goes by that order that is with this testimony procedure would made this and he gave him undue credit for and perhaps what the issue before us is whether the Supreme Court's ruling that there may be a variation from a strict population of standard --
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5797.744,5798.526,That is the issue.
1967.39,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5798.526,5800.927,"-- you tell me permissible, I think that is the issue here."
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5800.927,5807.039,"Your Honor, let me first say as I've tried to say before as I understood Mr. Justice Stewart."
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5928.284,5938.715,"On the other hand, might you not have the situation where one of your billion-acre ranches down there controls the entire county?"
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,5938.715,5942.458,"If you permitted precincts to some extent, yes."
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6014.107,6019.594,Can the District Court supervise the fixing of the budget?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6019.594,6020.345,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6023.876,6028.571,They can say that they have appropriated too much money or having appropriated enough?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6028.571,6037.801,"Or that they have penalized some and favored others, anything where discrimination is shown."
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6059.339,6063.031,"They didn't have elective system then the Court held, did it not?"
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6063.031,6065.984,"I believe they did in part, yes sir."
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6132.177,6134.991,"He can't even vote unless there's a tie, can he?"
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6134.991,6136.168,The county judge?
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6136.168,6136.543,Yes.
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6136.543,6138.352,He cannot if this it's two and two.
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6198.001,6204.092,"May I ask you, if the state at this injunction if you will, easier, it would be easier."
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6205.789,6206.696,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6206.696,6207.922,Four districts?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6207.922,6208.748,"Four -- yes, sir."
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6208.748,6213.267,"Now, would you mind telling me how many voters there are in each one?"
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6213.267,6223.782,"At the present time, about 95% of the voters in the City of Midland Precinct 1, about 5% or 6% in the other three precincts, about 2% --"
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6223.782,6236.849,So what you have is a system in which three of the four of the majority of the controlling body of the county elected by 5% of the voters.
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6236.849,6241.73,"Your Honor please, we've already allot -- Your Honor, I do not think so."
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6241.73,6244.383,But why -- I thought you said war?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6244.383,6246.486,We have lost that war.
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6252.828,6254.982,Is that the way it's divided now?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6254.982,6260.024,It is since 1963 and this matter went to the Court.
1967.39,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6272.405,6281.278,"Well, if it's not decided of that recording with the predominant consideration being given population, why would it be that way again?"
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6281.278,6285.835,Because the Texas court will not permit under its present decision.
1967.39,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6285.835,6295.618,"As I understand the present situation, it is that you use to have the situation that you just described with Mr. Justice Black."
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6322.125,6322.988,That is right.
1967.39,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6322.988,6324.326,We couldn't be back to this --
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6324.326,6325.023,"We can't do anything else, Your Honor."
1967.39,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6325.023,6329.198,We couldn't be back to this unless we reverse the Supreme Court of Texas instead of --
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6329.198,6336.23,"Under the Supreme Court of Texas opinion, we thought we knew what we had to do or rather what the Commissioners Court had to do."
1967.39,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6344.833,6353.109,"Well, if you know what you're supposed to do under the Texas Supreme Court, would you mind telling us?"
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6357.884,6364.771,I think that we are supposed to go back to the District Court and then to the Commissioners Court.
1967.39,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6376.832,6378.092,Yes I think I'm with you.
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6379.916,6387.311,"Now, when you get to the Commissioners Court, those four gentlemen are going to have to follow the law as made by this opinion."
1967.39,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6393.188,6394.238,I'm still with you.
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6395.694,6408.452,"Now, then these Commissioners whether they divide solely on a population basis or take into consideration roads, the amounts of roads and things like that, of course, is up to them."
1967.39,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6409.619,6411.496,"Well, I thought that was up -- what you mean up to them."
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6414.817,6423.086,It is up to them what division they make based on population and in consideration to other factors.
1967.39,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6423.086,6428.257,"You mean, you certainly can't mean that the Supreme Court of Texas said, “Gentlemen, it's up to you."
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6429.466,6430.279,"No, they did not."
1967.39,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6430.279,6434.822,"Then what do you understand that they are required to do, whether you order the Supreme Court of Texas?"
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6434.822,6439.968,You must consider population and equality of population.
1967.39,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6497.318,6502.353,"Well, they can't do that and pay much attention to the population basis, can they?"
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6503.115,6504.784,"Yes, sir, they could."
1967.39,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6505.518,6508.508,But that is if they took two precincts in the city --
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6508.508,6511.8,They would have to bring the two country in their apartment.
1967.39,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6511.8,6512.467,"Well, that's it?"
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6512.467,6513.153,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6513.153,6514.577,They can't have separate ones.
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6514.577,6515.73,Not very good.
1967.39,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6528.496,6532.138,But they have seven in the city and one in the country?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6532.138,6532.497,Four --
1967.39,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6532.497,6533.28,It has to be on --
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6533.28,6539.927,-- three -- four constitutionally under the Texas Constitution.
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6554.939,6556.372,May I ask you this question?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6556.372,6557.269,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6557.269,6563.291,Do you accept the principle of Reynolds versus Sims in this case?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6563.291,6564.621,I do not want to.
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6564.621,6565.929,"No, but do you?"
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6565.929,6568.776,Mr. Pannill wishes to argue that it does not apply.
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6571.827,6577.312,"But I want to know what your position is, you're trying to tell us what Reynolds versus Sims means."
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6591.681,6601.089,"Your Honor, we believe that we can argue that Reynolds versus Sims and Baker versus Carr should not be applied to substate governments."
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6601.089,6602.046,You do argue that.
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6602.046,6603.381,We do want to argue that.
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6605.319,6613.428,Now let me ask you what you conceive the basis of the Supreme Court decision.
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6620.29,6631.168,"The Texas Supreme Court says that under the Constitution of the State of Texas and the Constitution of the United States, there has been discrimination here."
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6648.785,6659.263,You say that that is a departure from Reynolds versus Sims or as you said a little while ago as I understood you that that was in conformity with Reynolds versus Sims.
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6659.263,6661.682,I think it is not inconsistent.
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6662.179,6663.8,It is not inconsistent with it?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6663.8,6665.97,It is not inconsistent with it.
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6669.099,6677.204,Do you feel that the Supreme Court of Texas intended to conform to the principle of Reynolds versus Sims?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6677.204,6683.988,"Insofar as it would apply one man, one vote, I would have to say, no."
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6692.813,6696.305,"Well, I'm not accusing you."
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6712.876,6715.336,I think the Texas Supreme Court has said that.
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6715.336,6715.883,Yeah.
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6719.508,6726.184,I think that the Texas Supreme Court has said that and that that would be a big factor in determining whether it had been in indiscrimination.
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6732.74,6733.373,Yes.
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6733.373,6739.046,And we also have a clause in our Constitution about republican form of government.
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6744.625,6750.829,With not you're -- not with no consideration but it should that be predominant?
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6750.829,6752.662,I personally think it must.
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6752.662,6756.595,"Yes, and what do you think your Court demands?"
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6756.595,6757.827,I don't know.
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6776.017,6782.609,You wouldn't go so far as to say it could subordinate population to these other things.
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6782.609,6783.518,"No, sir."
1967.39,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6785.01,6790.412,"That was done here of course but as you say, that has been described by your court."
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6790.412,6790.825,Right.
1967.39,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6831.074,6839.145,"I just confer it before you and you say, the petitioners failed to show discrimination and now failed to show discrimination in what?"
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6842.18,6842.947,That's right.
1967.39,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6842.947,6845.374,"So, what did you mean when you said he's --"
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6845.374,6846.749,I mean that was a large part of --
1967.39,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6846.749,6848.8,He succeeded in showing discrimination.
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6854.835,6855.222,That's right.
1967.39,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6855.222,6857.651,And that's the present status of the case.
1967.39,2,43957,w_b_browder_jr,,6862.421,6871.067,I meant that he has failed to show discrimination and that this case is ordered back to the trial court to divide without discrimination.
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,6950.684,6957.307,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, and may it please the Court."
1967.39,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7225.428,7247.004,"Is it your points insofar as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment goes in this area that so long as you have a legislature, apportioned in accord with the rule of Reynolds against Sims, then is the constitutional matter that legislature can be entrusted."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7285.444,7286.038,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7300.533,7307.679,And is there a constitutional danger there so long as you have a constitutionally apportioned basic statewide legislature?
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7307.679,7308.249,I wouldn't --
1967.39,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7308.249,7308.255,Is that your point?
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7308.255,7312.189,"-- say no sir, that there's no constitutional danger."
1967.39,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7317.54,7317.888,I'm talking about the an equal (Voice Overlap) --
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7317.888,7326.556,-- run counter to the Fifteenth Amendment but the decisions which have been cited here and which have been decided by this Court.
1967.39,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7340.824,7341.217,Mr. Pannill --
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7341.217,7342.936,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7342.936,7350.158,-- the difficulties with that is that the Texas Constitution seems to intervene in this argument --
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7350.158,7351.515,It does sir.
1967.39,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7351.515,7362.693,-- and there isn't very much of Texas legislature whether it's malapportioned or not can do about what the powers of the county court are or of cities either.
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7369.395,7369.603,Well --
1967.39,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7369.603,7373.231,I mean there are four people and they have certain power.
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7373.231,7379.928,"Their powers, sir, are knocked out conferred entirely by the Constitution of the State."
1967.39,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7395.967,7398.429,Powers of taxation?
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7398.429,7400.179,Powers of taxation?
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7411.586,7413.677,To do what?
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7413.677,7423.43,To -- it certainly has a power to limit and circumscribe and regulate the exercise by the county of its taxing functions.
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7425.768,7432.11,"But you're arguing something like this, against the states create the county."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7450.468,7451.414,That is -- that is --
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7451.414,7454.567,-- that's the basic principle on which you are arguing here.
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7454.567,7455.232,It sounds --
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7455.232,7456.566,Let's assume that's true.
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7456.566,7457.938,"Alright, sir."
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7457.938,7479.285,"Suppose the state does not chose to operate in that fashion but chooses to operate by creating governments where the people are subjected to the government of those elected by them, would your argument apply then?"
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7479.285,7481.188,"Well, yes, sir."
1967.39,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7555.41,7570.171,"Well, the problem -- well, the problem is about this argument as I see it is that this Commissioners Courts are not to create creature of the legislature but that the creature of the Constitution."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7623.821,7624.252,"No, sir."
1967.39,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7632.33,7635.635,That's exactly what we're concerned with here.
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7651.664,7661.989,"Sir, when I answered that question, I thought I was talking about the powers which are delegated to and exercised by the Commissioners Court and not the existence of the Court."
1967.39,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7670.014,7682.209,So you started -- you're precisely about -- you started off that way and then we asked you some question for defense and wait you along and fought for it until I hit you with the Constitution?
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7682.209,7693.743,"Well, it is not disputed by me of all people that the legislature of Texas has no power to abolish the Commissioners Court."
1967.39,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7705.48,7709.249,"Well, does the statute required four separate precincts?"
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7709.249,7709.398,It says four precincts --
1967.39,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7709.398,7713.304,"How many do the Constitution requires, four precincts?"
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7713.304,7721.466,That's what it says in the four precincts for convenience of the people and it has been -- I have heard it argued as to whether they could overlapped or over --
1967.39,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7721.466,7737.018,"I take it that within the present constitutional provisions for example, the county court could follow the Sailors or the Dusch scheme."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7755.906,7759.491,"Sir, there is no judicial authority."
1967.39,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7781.903,7809.937,"Sometime in your argument, I hope you will suggest why the Dusch's formula for inserting rural voice by means of elect of large with the resident's requirement wouldn't satisfy, wouldn't satisfy the needs for rural representation in Midland County, Texas?"
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7809.937,7811.839,I think it would.
1967.39,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7814.599,7830.501,"Well, of course the Texas is certainly -- if Texas -- if the Supreme Court is right that the County Board has more to do with the country than with the city, as a matter of actual operation and wholly aside in what the statute say."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7854.707,7857.334,The State of Texas is free to adopt it.
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7886.807,7892.252,I'm interested in your equal protection argument.
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7916.412,7916.885,"Oh, yes."
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7918.113,7929.157,"But if that is true and you do have a system setting up an election, whether it might or it might not value the Equal Protection Clause."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7946.798,7956.463,"Well, it was an advantage, Your Honor, that the Equal Protection Clause requires equal population and there isn't any doubt about it."
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7957.535,7969.111,"In other words, you do not proceed with your argument that the Equal Protection Clause is not applicable to a law in effect particularly to its Constitution."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7969.111,7969.612,No.
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7970.58,7974.653,"So that Equal Protection Clause must be considered, must it not?"
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7974.653,7974.933,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7974.933,7980.883,In determining whether or not in setting up this system of coding.
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,7983.694,8008.328,"Well, in the terms of this case, it would -- the charge or complaint would have to be that the Supreme Court of Texas in its opinion failed to require equal population amongst the commissioners precincts and such failure constitutes a denial of equal protection."
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8008.328,8013.784,"So you get back to that question after all, do you?"
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8013.784,8023.834,"Mr. Justice Black, it seems to me that that there must be distilled out of this Court's reapportionment cases."
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8047.605,8055.043,What you held as I understood it more that in absolute equality is impossible.
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8055.043,8056.685,That's right.
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8056.685,8060.11,But that you should approximate that equality.
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8080.496,8083.241,The decisions so held.
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8083.801,8088.634,"Now, what you are arguing here is that that held it with reference to certain state elections."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8088.634,8089.418,That is correct.
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8089.418,8095.026,But that it should not be carried down to local elections?
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8095.026,8095.913,That is correct.
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8096.857,8103.976,Which is an appealing argument but I have not yet heard you tell us why we could do that.
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8103.976,8105.745,"Well, may I ask -- may I suggest sir?"
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8105.745,8126.443,Well it could by considering the fact that the state has power to govern its county as it sees fit but does it -- if it does have power to govern its county as it sees fit have a right to conduct election in a way which deprives part of the people of therefore privileged voters.
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8126.443,8128.871,"Well, sir, may I answer the question in this way."
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8145.07,8146.813,The remote nothing?
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8146.813,8147.605,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8178.28,8181.719,"Local county school board went one step further, didn't it?"
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8192.052,8193.313,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8196.443,8198.945,One kind of a county --
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8198.945,8201.433,-- unequally populated districts.
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8257.186,8267.833,"How could we say that the logic or reasoning, maybe we could but how could we that you must apply that rule with the election of the governor."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8282.205,8300.416,"You could apply, Your Honor, logically and rationally in this way, that we have at the basis of our entire governmental system, the doctrine that the ultimate sovereign power is reposed in the people."
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8432.098,8436.982,Have we ever applied the rule yet?
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8449.686,8453.291,Have you ever applied this rule of the so-called rule of Reynolds versus Sims?
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8453.291,8456.073,"Yes, one vote, one person in --"
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8456.073,8471.272,"I know of no case in which this one man, one vote so-called has been applied at anything below the state level."
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8472.596,8480.355,"Another way, -- in a way, it's an absolute subject in a difficult case."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8483.007,8483.722,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8483.722,8500.674,"-- I would assume that if there is in the government, it can be viewed to the fact of the basic principle of this country that there's a difference between the state and Federal Government, and that he had to forward if it's true."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8514.186,8544.057,"Well, it might go to the point beyond that, Mr. Justice Black because as I understand this argument on the part of the petitioners and on the part of the Government, they admit that there are some governmental subdivisions and agencies which are not subject to this so-called one man one vote rule."
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8593.21,8596.722,Does not extend in connection with elections or?
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8596.722,8597.135,"Yes, sir."
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8600.307,8608.101,What elections do they indicate where the alignment be drawn?
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8608.101,8611.677,The Government draws a line as to special purpose districts?
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8611.677,8612.303,As to what?
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8612.303,8640.014,"Special purpose districts such as water conservation districts or something like that and draws the line to the effect that where you have a group of citizens which has a special interest or is particularly affected by the action of that government, then considerations other than population would be predominant."
1967.39,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8640.014,8642.72,That would be somewhat like a water conservancy district or something like that?
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8642.72,8643.616,Well I –-
1967.39,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8643.616,8644.542,Something of that nature?
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8644.542,8649.32,"Something of that nature, I think they probably included school districts in there."
1967.39,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8667.827,8702.889,"What would you do about the city council of a -- say New York City and suppose it has a counsel or Los Angeles with budget in billions in dollars ordinance making power, police force, how to determine where the people or instead liberty or to go to jail within certain restrictions and in effect, perhaps, it would be unfair to say the powers of state legislature on the small scale in a restricted area."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8721.342,8733.093,I would say that the argument which I have made couldn't be made to sustain and unequally apportion council in that type of government.
1967.39,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8781.365,8794.926,"Well, I'd rather understand that but do you -- would -- the thrust of your theory carve out from the so-called one man, one vote rule."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8804.745,8805.716,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.39,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8813.232,8813.99,I understand that.
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8813.99,8815.288,-- or decision of this particular kind.
1967.39,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8815.288,8821.736,"It will be applicable to constables, election of the constables?"
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8821.736,8823.115,Election of the constables?
1967.39,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,8823.115,8825.16,"Constable, yes."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8825.16,8825.813,Well –-
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8825.813,8832.144,People who said justice of the peacemakers.
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8832.144,8837.916,"The constables in with which I'm familiar are elected from a precinct, a single --"
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8837.916,8838.311,"Yes, little precinct."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8838.311,8843.371,-- precinct and heard any division within the precinct.
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8843.371,8850.756,"That's the state -- your argument would take them out, would it not?"
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8850.756,8854.581,I don't understand sir that that they could ever be brought in.
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8855.673,8865.437,"Well, you have an election -- if you have an election and picture them in some way where everybody doesn't have an equal vote, would apply isn't it?"
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8865.437,8874.453,"Within a precinct, the constable with which I'm familiar are elected by all of the voters in a certain precinct --"
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8874.453,8876.453,Suppose they were not?
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8876.453,8882.68,"Well, you would just have the parallel of this county commissioner state who would in my mind, he would have --"
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8882.68,8888.879,You would still -- you would argue that the state has the right to do that?
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8888.879,8892.829,The argument which I have made would support that from the --
1967.39,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,8892.829,8920.413,"In other words, you are trying to draw a line and you are seeking to draw a line, isn't it especially if you're on the statewide level, those who recognize by the Constitution which of great importance to the state and nation and those who are peculiar live within the range of the state's activities perform the -- practically state duties for the state."
1967.39,3,24491,f_h_pannill,,8920.413,8942.93,"Yes sir, I submit that the cases as decided have been divided along that line and that they may rationally be divided along that line for the reasons which I here suggest and present to the Court."
1967.39,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9045.066,9046.742,"Mr. Olson, do you have any --"
1967.39,4,34919,lyndon_l_olson,,9046.742,9049.787,"We have nothing further, Your Honor."
1967.39,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9049.787,9050.977,Very well.
