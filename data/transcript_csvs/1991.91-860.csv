1991.91-860,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.627,"We'll hear argument now in No. 91-860, the United States Department of Commerce v. Montana."
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,11.42,15.321,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-860,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,111.955,118.528,"Strangely enough, we haven't been consistent over the century, have we?"
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,118.528,151.199,"The Congress has not been consistent in terms of the specific method that has been employed, but what Congress has done, Justice Blackmun, is to examine what it believes to be the most appropriate method, including, as the Court is aware, at the founding that Congress in 1792 in response to the debate in those early years determined in the wake of President Washington's veto to disregard fractional remainders entirely."
1991.91-860,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,171.155,181.012,"Well, there's another factor that enters in, isn't there, the fact that the House of Representatives has a limited number of members?"
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,181.012,182.314,That's exactly right.
1991.91-860,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,182.314,184.127,"And that is not in the Constitution, is it?"
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,184.127,184.978,That is not.
1991.91-860,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,230.743,238.5,"Well, this problem in Massachusetts and Montana certainly could be cured by increasing the size."
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,238.5,239.071,"--Yes, it could."
1991.91-860,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,290.778,296.801,Has any calculation been done to show how large the House would have to be in order to have precise apportionment?
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,296.801,303.096,"In order to have precise apportionment, I am not sure that that calculation has been done."
1991.91-860,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,305.89,309.673,"Mr. Starr, what is the status of the Massachusetts case?"
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,309.673,320.141,"The status is that a final judgment has been rendered, and the United States is presently considering precisely what to do."
1991.91-860,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,345.197,355.565,I'm not sure that you would ever solve the fractional remainder problem by any reasonable increase in the size of the House of Representatives.
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,372.656,373.907,I think the point is well taken.
1991.91-860,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,439.071,444.006,"Of course there's no express delegation to the Congress in the Constitution to do this, is there?"
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,444.006,456.793,"There is none, but it has been viewed, as Justice Story stated in the 1830's in Prigg against Pennsylvania, as flowing ineluctably from the very nature of the plan of power."
1991.91-860,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,456.793,465.29,"Did the present method of apportionment, did that, that was an act of Congress, was it?"
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,465.29,465.68,Yes.
1991.91-860,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,465.68,467.022,Did it have to be signed by the President?
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,467.022,467.433,Yes.
1991.91-860,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,470.144,473.396,"Well, it's not just delegated to the Congress alone then."
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,473.396,475.838,"--Oh, I am sorry, in terms of the presentation."
1991.91-860,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,489.268,490.828,"Well, but not to the Congress."
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,490.828,496.935,"--Not to the Congress entirely, but to the political branches, but Congress' discretion is quite broad."
1991.91-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.209,543.056,"General Starr, what if Congress decided to apportion it roughly, for the most part according to population, but put an upper limit?"
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,554.235,555.807,I think not.
1991.91-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,555.807,556.836,We could not review it?
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,556.836,560.499,I think that would be a matter entrusted to the political process--
1991.91-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,560.499,560.839,Really?
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,561.83,567.404,"--as long as it is according to their respective numbers, and it seems to me that as long as the--"
1991.91-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.404,568.926,--I'm saying it's not according to their numbers.
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,576.441,580.996,--But as long as it is tying it to respective... and I think it is.
1991.91-860,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.134,614.131,"I think you've given, you've given Wyoming the solution, or Montana."
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,627.36,637.875,"Well, that is a matter that Congress could consider, but the fact that it has not done so, Justice Scalia, suggests the wisdom and the efficacy of the political process."
1991.91-860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,637.875,642.42,Or it may suggest that the representatives from California can outvote the representative from Montana.
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,644.631,649.654,And perhaps are not so eleemosynary-minded as might be suggested.
1991.91-860,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,649.654,666.446,"If you were a member of the Congress and that somewhat startling proposal were made, would you think you were violating your duties under the Constitution as a congressman if you voted for that bizarre solution?"
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,666.446,672.991,"In my own view, as opposed to what is appropriate for judicial review, I would be informed by history."
1991.91-860,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,688.162,690.355,"Well, but suppose you were met with that proposal."
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,699.411,708.885,"In terms of my own perception I would be more guided by history, frankly, and I would view it as difficult to depart from history."
1991.91-860,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,755.242,756.993,There has to be some rational relation?
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,756.993,757.403,Correct.
1991.91-860,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,784.234,793.951,"Well, General Starr, you're using the political question idea then not as meaning barring adjudication, but as a very heightened form of deference."
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,793.951,796.522,"Well, that's one way of formulating it."
1991.91-860,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,825.512,850.158,"Well, sir, I'm not sure if that qualifies as the traditional political question which, you know, at one time was said a thicket that courts should just stay out of, or simply saying that given the constitutional standard of according to their respective numbers, it leaves all sorts of reasonable alternatives open to Congress that would be reviewed only if the alternative weren't reasonable."
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,850.158,866.629,"I think the Court could come at it from that method of analysis as well by virtue of the broad powers that Congress enjoys under the necessary and proper clause, and that was the method that the Massachusetts three judge court engaged in or used in rejecting the constitutional claim."
1991.91-860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.011,942.445,"Mr. Starr, can I ask you a question about the methods as a group?"
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,951.66,951.831,Yes.
1991.91-860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,951.831,955.945,--then all of those would require that California get either 52 or 53?
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,955.945,958.616,"Three of the methods would, two would not."
1991.91-860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,982.504,984.236,"I thought that always took the next higher number, didn't it?"
1991.91-860,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,984.386,999.247,"--Well, it did, and yet for mathematical reasons that I don't pretend to understand, the Jefferson method had a particular methodology to it that resulted in a quota violation in the 1830 census in reapportionment."
1991.91-860,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1102.222,1103.934,"Very well, General Starr."
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1106.095,1109.378,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-860,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1249.042,1262.372,"General Racicot, would you indicate whether you think that in your view Congress has ever apportioned the fractions in a way that meets the Constitution?"
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1272.379,1279.145,"Justice O'Connor, in view of the decisions of this Court, that is precisely what we mean to indicate."
1991.91-860,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1282.918,1300.281,I think that's sort of an extreme position to take when we're trying to interpret what the Constitution requires and when the practice has gone back so far in the Nation's history of permitting Congress to make this sort of a determination.
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1300.281,1309.675,"--Justice O'Connor, I think a close examination of the apportionment history of this country would find that there has been more accommodation than there has been any process sustained in principle."
1991.91-860,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.316,1384.717,But don't you agree that the situation of the intrastate redistricting even for Congress is quite dramatically different than the situation of assigning representatives to 50 different states?
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1384.717,1394.124,"Mr. Chief Justice, that is true because of the obvious constitutional requirements that there be no more than 1 for every 30,000, and also that state boundaries be respected."
1991.91-860,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1406.633,1409.774,"Well, why, why would we apply those same rules?"
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1409.774,1414.709,Because that's how population equality or district equality is achieved.
1991.91-860,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1414.709,1420.723,But the directive to Congress doesn't say achieve population equality.
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1423.497,1423.808,Yes.
1991.91-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.262,1446.073,"The directive to the states says even less than that, doesn't it?"
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1446.073,1447.215,"It does, Justice Scalia."
1991.91-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1447.215,1450.908,"In fact it says nothing at all, except republican form of government."
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1450.908,1451.218,That's right.
1991.91-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1456.414,1470.771,"We didn't discover that until 1964, which is, I suppose, your answer for why for almost 200 years we have never had the right solution, because this Court didn't give the answer until 1964."
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1472.531,1473.463,--That's precisely correct.
1991.91-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.509,1534.105,"May I ask just at this point, is it part of your submission that the Hill method is always distorted against a smaller state?"
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1534.105,1543.107,"--I believe, Your Honor, that you can always determine bias from a number of different perspectives, and that there's no consistent way to measure bias."
1991.91-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1543.107,1548.663,"But the bias under that method will not necessarily be against a smaller state, or do you contend it is?"
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1548.663,1549.181,"No, sir, we do not."
1991.91-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1549.181,1553.175,It could have been against Massachusetts or New York or any one of the other states?
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1553.175,1553.345,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1553.345,1564.733,"The larger the state... you cannot have the proportion of swing with a state that is very numerous in population, has a lot of districts."
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1574.871,1577.03,"It may well be, Justice Scalia, but the--"
1991.91-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1577.03,1577.531,I think it has to be.
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1577.531,1584.606,--historical perspective indicates that bias is not necessarily something that can be established under those circumstances over the long course.
1991.91-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1584.606,1592.601,"The bias, there may be bias just as likely with respect to big states as small states, but the degree of it will always be much less."
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1592.601,1592.982,Yes.
1991.91-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1592.982,1593.563,Okay.
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1593.563,1607.675,"Under the method presently used by Congress there is a total range, from the largest district of Montana, at 803,000 to the smallest district, Wyoming, at 455,000 people."
1991.91-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1632.382,1634.382,May I ask you one other question when you're talking about these big percentages?
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1653.749,1668.598,"Your Honor, because there is a requirement that each state be provided at least one, there is some built in inequity, but in our judgment that doesn't justify allowing the process to become more unequal by the application of a formula that simply doesn't produce the most equitable results."
1991.91-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.249,1872.152,How can you possibly ascribe that overriding objective?
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1900.174,1903.597,"I think, Justice Scalia, that that is precisely the question before the Court."
1991.91-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.597,1917.977,"No, but I'm asking you how do you explain, how you reconcile with your position the fact that the Constitution itself provides for one representative even if you're not entitled to one on the basis of one person, one vote?"
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1917.977,1931.135,"There certainly is, Justice Scalia, inequity built into the system because of those provisions that require at least one to be provided every state, and one, and not having the possibility of crossing state boundaries."
1991.91-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.546,1967.704,"But it makes it harder for you to argue that the only consideration to be taken into account is numerical parity, because that was not the only thing that Congress took into account when it set up this system."
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,1975.671,1979.183,"I think, Justice Scalia, that is the question in this case."
1991.91-860,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1990.903,2003.943,"Well, I don't think you're, that there's any question here but what the Constitution does require that every state have one representative and by implication requires that districts not cross state boundaries."
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,2036.195,2038.509,"I think your point is well taken, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2078.969,2083.952,I presume that under this Constitution the House could provide for only 50 members.
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,2093.329,2094.187,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-860,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2094.187,2096.15,And that would comport with the Constitution.
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,2096.15,2096.721,It would.
1991.91-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2156.905,2158.985,May I be sure I understand your submission?
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,2162.528,2169.871,"--Your Honor, I believe what I'm suggesting is that the Dean method complies with the Constitution."
1991.91-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2173.965,2179.777,"That was going to be my next question, because the Dean method was I guess the last one to be developed of the five that are before us."
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,2187.334,2189.735,"I believe so, yes, sir, even if it disenfranchises--"
1991.91-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2189.735,2189.865,Okay.
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,2195.9,2199.441,"--I don't think there's any question but that the most easily understood... yes, there is, sir."
1991.91-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2206.175,2206.315,Is it really?
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,2212.442,2222.108,"--Perhaps it would be best if I phrased it that the result is most easily understood, because what it seeks to do is measure absolute equality, not relative equality."
1991.91-860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2229.744,2232.408,Let me ask you to comment on one other thing that runs through my mind.
1991.91-860,1,36535,marc_racicot,,2240.946,2257.687,"No, sir, I don't believe so, because the system was set up that that was obviously the product of a great compromise, and the system was set up so that states, the corporate entities, would be represented, and then in the House where people would be represented."
1991.91-860,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2357.36,2359.814,"Thank you, General Racicot."
1991.91-860,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2362.838,2365.379,"Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-860,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2365.379,2369.673,"Well, you have a lot of time, maybe you could explain the five, the five different mathematical systems to us."
1991.91-860,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2370.514,2372.295,I would like to submit that point on the briefs.
1991.91-860,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2557.056,2559.367,"Thank you, General Starr."
