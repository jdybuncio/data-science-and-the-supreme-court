1983.82-958,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.087,We will hear arguments first this morning in McDonough Power Equipment Company against Greenwood.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,14.77,19.004,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-958,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,210.809,218.914,"You are saying then, Mr. Patterson, that the Tenth Circuit went beyond requiring the juror to in good faith answer the question as he understood it?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,218.914,220.506,"Yes, sir, that is precisely the point."
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,222.998,231.231,Does that theory in any way allow the counsel not to be diligent in his questions?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,231.231,235.826,"--Does not prohibit counsel from asking any question, Your Honor, on a voir dire examination."
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,235.826,238.408,Does it also allow him not to ask questions?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,238.408,241.82,"As it was implemented in this case, no, sir."
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,254.216,259.861,Does the duty of counsel recognize the duty to probe properly?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,259.861,263.523,Our contention is that that is the responsibility of counsel.
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,263.523,265.295,And not of the court.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,265.295,266.404,"I am sorry, sir?"
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,266.404,272.639,I mean that is the duty of the counsel.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,272.639,274.569,"We suggest that it is, sir."
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,274.569,286.417,"And, now at any time... Is it your position that counsel in this case could have asked a question which would have brought out this information?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,286.417,289.369,I think it could have been done.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,318.74,325.393,"Well, it says that it was entitled to the kind of an answer that the average juror would have given."
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,325.393,326.354,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,326.354,331.668,And an average juror would have understood that he should have revealed the information that the didn't reveal.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,331.668,334.9,That is the standard that we seek to challenge.
1983.82-958,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,334.9,341.855,"Mr. Patterson, just for a minute, may we return to the conversation, the post-trial conversation between counsel?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,341.855,342.655,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-958,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,342.655,345.565,"The judge did not participate in that, did he?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,345.565,346.406,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-958,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,347.198,351.76,The judge heard the telephone conversation between counsel?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,351.76,354.033,"It happened in this sequence, Your Honor."
1983.82-958,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,423.137,427.732,I was interested in the conversation between the two counsel after the trial.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,427.732,434.884,"Thereafter, the court sustained counsel's motion, granted permission to have the telephone interview occur."
1983.82-958,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,438.287,440.428,The judge was not a party to that conversation?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,440.428,441.49,"--No, sir, he was not."
1983.82-958,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,441.49,447.023,"But, is there any difference of opinion as to what transpired in that conference?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,447.023,450.856,"Well, I would say we agreed on about 70 percent of it."
1983.82-958,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,459.271,464.655,Can we accept what the Tenth Circuit said about the substance of the conversation?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,464.655,467.807,--The Tenth Circuit said that they gave full credence to both versions.
1983.82-958,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,467.807,468.518,Can we accept it?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,468.518,469.566,I believe so.
1983.82-958,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,476.132,479.083,May I ask right there--
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,479.083,479.654,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-958,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,479.654,484.927,--I was puzzled about the extent to which that conversation was reported to the District Judge.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,484.927,487.649,"It was never reported to the District Judge, that is the point."
1983.82-958,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,487.649,490.13,Not even on the subsequent motion for a new trial?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,490.13,490.991,"No, sir."
1983.82-958,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,490.991,501.74,"So there was information about that conversation that was made known to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals thought dispositive, which had not been made known to the District Court."
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,501.74,505.711,That is the reason for my initial comment that this was a trial without error.
1983.82-958,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,510.723,519.669,"In the Court of Appeals, did you object to the fact that you were then arguing about the significance of a conversation that had not been disclosed to the District Court?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,519.669,521.612,It was both orally and in the briefs.
1983.82-958,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,553.822,558.265,Let me ask this because I have missed something here.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,567.201,568.342,"Well, yes."
1983.82-958,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,599.531,602.283,Nothing said about recording the call?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,602.283,606.457,"No, sir, nothing was said in the order and unfortunately it was not done."
1983.82-958,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,607.188,610.491,"Well, I understand what you said earlier."
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,615.593,618.345,"--Well, I think it does turn, Your Honor."
1983.82-958,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,618.345,618.936,Something does?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,618.936,620.686,"Yes, I think something does turn."
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,620.686,626.36,Because there is no dispute between you about what was said in the sense that--
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,626.36,627.872,That is right.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,627.872,630.804,--we can rely on what the Court of Appeals said was said.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,630.804,632.103,That is right.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.505,646.134,"Mr. Patterson, didn't the District Court decide that the trial had been fair and wasn't that decision made after this discussion as to whether or not the juror should have disqualified himself?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,646.134,647.905,"In the sequence of events, that is what occurred."
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,682.877,684.199,You lost me there.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,693.884,694.735,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,694.735,699.379,And the motion for new trial made no mention of the telephone conversation.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,699.379,700.128,That is true.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.862,716.89,"Can I ask you, suppose the juror had answered the question in a way that revealed the information that was later brought out about the accident to his son."
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,716.89,717.969,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,717.969,723.903,Would there have been any basis for challenging the juror for cause?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,723.903,726.675,I doubt it.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.848,735.06,I suppose counsel would have asked the judge to excuse... might have asked the judge to excuse him for cause.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,735.06,738.483,--It might have occurred but that is a judgment call of the trial court.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,752.594,768.313,"Was there any evidence one way or another as to whether... if the answer had been the full answer and included the information that was later brought out, was there any evidence one way or another as to whether or not counsel would have exercised the peremptory challenge?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,768.313,775.188,"We believe there was, Your Honor, because two other jurors revealed similar type information."
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,775.188,776.289,And he did not challenge?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,776.289,777.309,They were not challenged.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.57,781.563,But that is all there is.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,791.738,792.9,"No, sir, there was none."
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,792.9,802.497,"--But, the Court of Appeals assumed that he should have had the information so as to make up his mind about using his peremptory challenge?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,802.497,810.044,The Court of Appeals in one sentence held that bias as well as prejudice were conclusively presumed.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.255,836.2,"I can understand what they are saying about the prejudice, but how would they conclusively presume bias?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,836.2,839.502,--How they did it and why I cannot answer.
1983.82-958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,841.784,862.947,"Mr. Patterson, if the situation were such that the information the juror failed to disclose was information that clearly, under anyone's view, would have constituted grounds for a challenge for cause of that juror, would you feel that a new trial would have to be granted?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,862.947,870.521,It depends upon whether or not the information... I would suppose whether or not the information was called for in the voir dire question that was asked.
1983.82-958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,871.282,873.063,"Well, let's assume it was."
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,873.063,875.794,"--If it was, then it would be a case of misconduct."
1983.82-958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,878.759,878.946,All right.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,887.973,898.2,"Well, that again, I think, would fall into the category of information that might have been obtainable had a question been asked but was not otherwise obtained for the failure to ask the question."
1983.82-958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,898.2,900.241,So you would say that would be waived?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,900.241,901.453,That would be waived.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.046,929.64,"Well, it seems to me that the information might have... Let's assume the information would have been clearly grounds for challenge for cause, but the juror didn't answer and give that information."
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,944.509,947.151,That is the rule that the Tenth Circuit announced.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,949.572,951.115,"Well, all right."
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,976.153,977.391,"No, sir, I would not."
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1084.782,1091.896,--Would you have challenged if the Court of Appeals had sent the case back for a hearing in the District Court?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1091.896,1092.757,Very--
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1092.757,1097.91,With respect to prejudice or bias?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1097.91,1098.952,--Very likely not.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1101.382,1118.724,So you wouldn't say the fact that the juror was honest necessarily precluded the hearing with respect to whether a peremptory challenge would have been exercised or not or whether there was actual bias by the juror?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1118.724,1128.661,"Well, I would have been concerned about it, Your Honor, but I would have doubted in my own mind whether the case in that posture would have been the proper vehicle to present the question here that we are presenting now."
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1128.661,1134.315,What would have been the scope of the hearing if there had been such a remand with respect to bias?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1137.217,1142.689,"Hopefully not, because that is absolutely prohibited by Rule 606."
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.689,1143.34,Yes.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1143.34,1144.252,No.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.838,1159.462,"Well, you would have to just decide... Could you have called him to the stand?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1159.462,1161.343,More than likely.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1161.343,1163.033,"So, you would--"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1163.033,1168.216,"But, avoid anything that went on in the jury room or the impact of any bit of information might have had on--"
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1168.216,1170.109,"--So, it would have had to be sort of an inferential conclusion?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1170.109,1170.97,--It would have to be.
1983.82-958,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1172.59,1179.642,"You mean the inquiry would be confined to the inquiry that could have been made at the trial, at the selection of the jury?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1179.642,1189.109,"--Well, the inquiry would be limited to whether or not he had a state of mind that might have come close to prejudging the issues prior to the time he heard any evidence on it."
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1197.835,1203.03,"In your research, have you come across any case close to this one?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1203.03,1210.414,"We have attempted to... The problem has come up, Your Honor, and it has come up in most of the Circuits."
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1212.585,1215.519,I am talking about extending the rule.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1215.519,1230.446,--Circuits have held that this is not a ground for a new trial unless there is either juror misconduct or a finding of actual bias and a finding of actual prejudice.
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1230.446,1230.907,That is what I said.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1232.359,1247.878,"We have found none, Your Honor, that does this, nor have we found any that sets up a standard which required a standard of the ""average"" juror which requires a minimum standard--"
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1247.878,1254.603,We would just be putting out a rule based on a case that is unique in its own facts.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1254.603,1257.324,"--Well, I wouldn't say that the facts are unique."
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1262.416,1263.988,That is what I am talking about.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1263.988,1264.739,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1264.739,1271.372,"But, you seem to agree or wouldn't have objected to a remand rather than an order for a new trial."
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1296.48,1298.962,That is a finding of prejudice and we would be bound by it.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.962,1305.115,Then it would be a new trial?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1305.115,1306.317,Certainly.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.317,1311.5,Because of an interference with peremptory challenge?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1311.5,1312.609,No.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1312.609,1313.391,What?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1313.391,1318.804,"Well, I think... Let me identify the steps of our analysis first."
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1331.974,1332.425,I know.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1333.414,1334.485,We object to that.
1983.82-958,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1334.485,1335.547,--I know.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1348.272,1358.18,I probably would have gone that route rather than raising the question with a case in that posture as being the vehicle to raise this question.
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1364.855,1371.11,"The Appellee used up all of his challenges, peremptories?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1371.11,1374.141,All parties used all three challenges.
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1374.141,1376.072,"Well, what good would that do here?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1382.487,1383.008,No.
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1383.008,1383.565,He didn't have any.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1383.565,1386.267,All three challenges were used.
1983.82-958,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1395.944,1397.266,That is really going.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1397.266,1411.085,"Our question is or our contention is that he is entitled to that information that is provided by honest, good faith answers of voir direment, but nothing more and nothing more should be required."
1983.82-958,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1412.397,1421.711,To what extent is there a questionnaire available to counsel throughout the numbers of the array of prospective jurors?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1421.711,1428.235,"Well, the court... If I recall the events properly, the court asked some very general questions initially."
1983.82-958,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1428.235,1428.576,No.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1435.791,1436.8,"Yes, it is."
1983.82-958,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1442.025,1448.248,Was there a question in there about accidents of people in your own family?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1448.248,1449.51,--I believe not.
1983.82-958,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1458.145,1462.72,There are questionnaires which reach all of those points though.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1462.72,1468.272,I haven't looked at it for three and a half years and honestly don't recall.
1983.82-958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1468.272,1486.713,"Mr. Patterson, is it your... Do I understand your position to be that if a juror intentionally refuses to disclose information that is directly asked on voir dire that there should be a new trial granted?"
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1486.713,1489.916,That really involves a question of misconduct.
1983.82-958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1489.916,1490.476,Yes.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1499.092,1500.074,"Not automatically, no, ma'am."
1983.82-958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1501.493,1502.755,What would determine it then?
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1502.755,1507.477,--The additional question of whether or not there is actual bias and actual prejudice.
1983.82-958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1508.408,1508.949,Okay.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1512.241,1512.962,--Not per se.
1983.82-958,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1512.962,1517.855,The thing that you would have us focus on is the probable bias.
1983.82-958,0,21369,donald_patterson,,1517.855,1531.943,"Probable bias and also prejudice in order to get away and satisfy the Harmless Error Rule which is announced in 28 U.S.C. 2111 and also in Rule 61, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
1983.82-958,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1561.523,1567.266,Mr. Schroer?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1567.266,1570.038,May it please the Court:
1983.82-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1626.005,1628.355,What is the ultimate number of the jury you end--
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1628.355,1628.836,Six.
1983.82-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1628.836,1629.236,--Six.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1629.236,1630.678,At that time.
1983.82-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.188,1689.097,"When you say Mr. Schroer, do you mean non-false information from the point of view of the person answering or kind of objectively truthful?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1689.097,1695.221,--Perhaps I should have said full and complete rather than suggesting truthful versus untruthful.
1983.82-958,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1723.768,1728.771,Do you think that general question has any bearing on the point you are making now?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1728.771,1731.926,"I think it has a bearing only in the way of background, Your Honor."
1983.82-958,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1731.926,1747.555,"If the man gave an affirmative response that he could be fair or was silent, would not everyone in the courtroom have a right to assume that he was stating he could be fair?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1747.555,1748.997,That is the only reason I raise that point.
1983.82-958,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1788.122,1789.293,"Well, how far does that go?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1803.68,1805.992,"In that case, the Tenth Circuit said that is de minimus."
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1813.438,1817.83,"Counsel, before you proceed, there were other Defendants, weren't there, in addition to the--"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1817.83,1818.29,--No.
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1818.29,1819.462,--None whatever?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1819.462,1821.232,No other Defendants.
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1821.232,1827.687,"The $350,000 in damages was assessed against whom?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1827.687,1830.249,"Well, the mother of the little boy who lost both of his feet."
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1830.249,1831.34,Was she a Defendant?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1831.34,1832.559,No.
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1841.555,1842.446,Wasn't it the neighbor--
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1842.446,1843.508,I beg your pardon?
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1843.508,1845.328,--Wasn't the neighbor a phantom Defendant?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1845.328,1855.076,The neighbor's father and the boy driving the mower as well as the little boy's mother were all found to be at fault by the jury in some percentage.
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1855.076,1857.747,"The jury brought in what, $350,000 damages and--"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1857.747,1866.225,"Three seventy-five, I believe, but that was after the jury first went out and found zero and the court sent them back and said you must find damages and they came back--"
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1866.225,1877.502,--My question is how could there have been bias if the jury found no negligence on the part of the manufacturer of the bicycle and then found negligence on the part of other people and assessed damages?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1877.502,1880.934,--Because in Kansas there is no joint and several liability.
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1880.934,1882.193,None whatever?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1882.193,1883.135,None whatever.
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1884.226,1885.716,Suppose it had been two manufacturers?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1885.716,1886.638,"--I beg your pardon, sir?"
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1886.638,1888.298,Suppose there had been two manufacturers?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1891.801,1900.89,"In Kansas, the Defendant only pays his percentage share that is found against him or it and nothing else."
1983.82-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1937.295,1940.226,Your question was serious injury not just injury.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,1942.028,1947.001,--Serious injury causing disability or prolonged pain or suffering.
1983.82-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2007.199,2012.004,"Of course, you really don't know, do you, unless you investigate all the jurors after their answers?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2016.716,2031.726,"See, this case is kind of a freak because we first... We first filed our first motion to ask to waive the rule under just cause and say we have got just cause to talk to these jurors under the weighting of the Kansas rule."
1983.82-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2108.236,2113.171,"Mr. Schroer, how long did this trial last, do you remember?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2113.171,2115.501,I believe it was eight trial days.
1983.82-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2117.482,2134.713,"Supposing it was, instead of eight trial days, it would have been eight trial months, eight trial months the trial had gone on, would you still say that an error like this described by the Court of Appeals would require a new trial and the reassembling of all the judicial machinery to take another eight months?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2134.713,2177.753,"I would, Your Honor, because I think that as Justice White said in the Swain case, this is a very important right, the peremptory right, to be exercised with knowledge and with truth and arbitrarily by the... that may not be the exact words in your opinion... but the right of the lawyers and this Court has even held where courts have restricted that right of information or not allowed questions to be asked on peremptory or not asked questions which lawyers requested; that that affected the right of peremptory... the use of the peremptory statute."
1983.82-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2177.753,2179.773,Surely no right is absolute.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2183.506,2201.409,"That is right and I agree, Your Honor, and that is why the Tenth Circuit said if it is de minimus, like the lady with the $100 case or the case where the lawyer didn't ask the question, it was so vague that the jury didn't understand the question, it can't be reversed on those grounds."
1983.82-958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2233.509,2240.725,Isn't an order for a new trial though a rather severe remedy for whatever happened here?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2253.801,2255.632,We asked for two hearings.
1983.82-958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2264.558,2271.033,I understand that the contents of this telephone conversation with the juror never came to the attention of the trial judge.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2271.033,2279.208,"Well, if Your Honor... In the Appendix, the motion for new trial was filed... Was mailed before."
1983.82-958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2280.66,2281.021,Right.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2281.021,2285.513,The same day as his order came out allowing us to make a brief and polite phone call.
1983.82-958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.513,2286.434,Yes.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2286.434,2318.674,"Can Your Honor understand, as an officer of that court with the attitude of a strict trial judge saying brief and polite, we had about a two-minute conversation which he said those things that are agreed to in the record which affects... Which doesn't show basic... I shouldn't say basic misconduct or prejudice, but it shows information that I would have liked to have considered in making my three selections."
1983.82-958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2318.674,2321.065,"Yes, but I am talking about the Court of Appeals."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2327.46,2329.129,The dissent did.
1983.82-958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2329.129,2331.871,"Well, the dissent but how about the majority?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2337.948,2339.257,"I am here defending that, sir."
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2339.257,2349.015,When did you tell the District Judge about this telephone conversation in relation to the motion for a new trial?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2349.015,2358.529,"The motion for new trial, on page 60, only informs the court, and the affidavits, the two affidavits--"
1983.82-958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2358.529,2361.153,That contained the information that you had found--
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2362.703,2379.352,"--The specific information was not communicated to the trial court because we believe that we were prevented from making a record by the trial court and we believe that the trial court should have let us, on motion for new trial, bring the juror in and we believe--"
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2379.352,2381.185,Did you ask the trial judge for that?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2381.185,2382.264,"--Yes, yes."
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2390.441,2394.014,That does not say about the telephone conversation.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2394.014,2394.934,"--You are correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2395.805,2398.456,"Well, why didn't you tell him about the telephone conversation?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2401.318,2401.989,"--All right, sir."
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2410.203,2419.65,Weren't you just a guilty of withholding information from the judge as you allege the juror was withholding information from you?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2419.65,2420.89,"I hope not, sir."
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2424.603,2426.155,Counsel--
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2426.155,2437.953,"The Kansas rule is kind of unique because when we had filed our first motion for just cause, as the rule provides, the court responded there was no concrete evidence."
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2467.99,2493.879,"--Counsel, before you proceed, let's assume that when you had this conversation with the juror who had remained silent he said, yes, I did have a son who had an accident that hurt his leg rather badly and we did bring suit and we won a $500,000 judgment, but I thought this was just information that might prejudice one side or the other so I kept quiet."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2495.599,2497.459,That is an excellent question.
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2500.972,2501.633,Well--
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2501.633,2504.395,"See, that is the significance."
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2504.395,2505.957,"--Yes, but I am assuming you lost the case."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2507.147,2517.695,"My answer is, an officer of the court with Defendant there, I would have to agree with his oral integrity... I mean, on the basis of integrity, have to agree--"
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2517.695,2519.486,You would still be here today?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2519.486,2521.296,--Would I still be here today?
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2521.296,2524.198,"Well, I am assuming you lost all the way around."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2524.198,2528.792,"The Tenth Circuit, under the previous cases, would have said, go back for a new trial and--"
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2528.792,2530.032,It would have?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2534.635,2551.556,"--Well, if I understand your assumption correctly, the Tenth Circuit in these three cases, two preceding this one, have all reversed cases, one for the Plaintiff, where the Defendant has appealed because somebody didn't mention about an injury case or a trial that they were involved in."
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2551.556,2559.55,"How could you have been prejudiced if the juror had withheld the information that his son had recovered $500,000?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2559.55,2562.294,"Well, I couldn't have been, that is right."
1983.82-958,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2563.144,2564.776,"That kind of prejudice is immaterial, is it?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2564.776,2567.037,--I could have been prejudiced.
1983.82-958,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2596.766,2607.545,"But, on the facts of this case, supposing you had gotten the judgment and precisely the same information was developed that has been developed here; namely, the Foreman didn't disclose the injury to his son."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2611.957,2613.639,--I think so because--
1983.82-958,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2613.639,2616.56,Either side could have set aside a verdict in this case--
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2616.56,2625.346,--Based upon our theory both lawyers have a right to know this information about a person's attitude toward bringing cases and filing suit.
1983.82-958,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2625.346,2627.828,--Let me ask one other mechanical question if I may.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2633.151,2633.511,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-958,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2633.511,2637.124,"And, six were excused on the peremptory, each using three peremptories."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2640.287,2640.878,"No, sir."
1983.82-958,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.878,2645.059,So those 12 were the only 12 that were ever asked this question.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2645.059,2645.38,Yes.
1983.82-958,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2682.072,2686.025,Let me ask one other question about the facts here.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2695.341,2697.852,--Now we get into memory again.
1983.82-958,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2697.852,2698.563,Does the record tell us.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2698.563,2702.357,Counsel's memory and notes are a little different from mine.
1983.82-958,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2702.357,2707.74,What is now in writing that we could look at other than asking your personal recollection of the--
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2707.74,2714.833,There are our recollections that are in the record on appeal to the Tenth Circuit where counsel agrees with them.
1983.82-958,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.833,2716.696,"--By saying in the record, do you mean in the briefs?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2716.696,2718.957,"In the Appendix, yes, and in the briefs it is referred to."
1983.82-958,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.404,2759.013,Let me ask one other question.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2765.077,2766.649,--He refused to allow oral argument.
1983.82-958,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2768.228,2771.911,And you never submitted in writing to him what you thought should have been enough?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2771.911,2777.574,"Well, we submitted... I didn't submit specifics of the word conversation."
1983.82-958,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2777.574,2781.137,"Well, you never told him anything about the telephone conversation."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2788.711,2789.262,That is correct.
1983.82-958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2802.542,2806.383,The Court of Appeals didn't think you had been remiss at all.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2806.383,2807.064,"--No, sir."
1983.82-958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2807.886,2809.135,And they gave you relief.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2809.135,2810.277,"That is right, sir."
1983.82-958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2810.277,2814.371,They didn't think you had passed up any opportunity you had in the trial court.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2814.371,2814.899,"No, sir."
1983.82-958,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2844.1,2858.449,"Well, Mr. Schroer, you are not indicating or contending, I guess, that the information disclosed here would have entitled that the juror be excused for cause, are you?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2858.449,2859.6,We didn't know.
1983.82-958,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2860.329,2862.609,"Well, whether you know it or not, we know now."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2868.143,2869.154,"--By itself, no."
1983.82-958,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2869.154,2869.965,Okay.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2869.965,2874.197,"But, the follow-up questions may have developed an attitude by him that the court would have excused for cause."
1983.82-958,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2885.735,2892.851,"I guess you could have asked questions like that of all the jurors as you went along and you probably typically do, don't you?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2892.851,2893.582,We ask--
1983.82-958,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2893.582,2895.212,About your attitudes.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2895.212,2916.105,"--What we do is we ask the general question and then if you get responses as counsel... as I did and as counsel did, then on follow-up questions... And, in fact, counsel asked two or three follow-up questions on accidents and injuries after I finished and that is when some jurors responded to some de minimus type of events that happened many years ago."
1983.82-958,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2930.245,2935.22,"Yes, but some of that is present in every jury selection in America."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2958.123,2959.074,I agree.
1983.82-958,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2984.911,2989.383,"Well, maybe what is important is whether it indicates a probable bias."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2989.383,2990.464,That is right.
1983.82-958,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2990.464,2995.667,"Is that the test, whether the responses would indicate a probable bias?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,2995.667,3016.341,"Whether a probable bias can be implied sufficient so that counsel, with the right to full information of the statute, could use a peremptory or not use a peremptory, but needs that information to exercise his right of peremptory."
1983.82-958,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3017.293,3017.763,Okay.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3025.036,3028.9,"--Subjectively, because of the rule Mr. Patterson points out."
1983.82-958,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3044.56,3048.124,"Mr. Schroer, how many peremptories do you have in Kansas?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3048.124,3049.653,Three.
1983.82-958,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3049.653,3055.958,"On page 64 of the Joint Appendix, there seems to be eight strikes."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3057.578,3059.4,"Okay, let me mention."
1983.82-958,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3079.573,3084.706,"But, it doesn't show who exercised--"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3084.706,3086.606,We each exercised one.
1983.82-958,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3086.606,3094.784,"--Yes, but it doesn't show who struck Max Frauenfelder or Albert Elser."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3096.244,3097.025,I don't remember.
1983.82-958,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3099.035,3101.686,Do you just have the sheet and pass it back and forth?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3101.686,3103.139,"--That is exactly right, sir."
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3119.287,3121.999,I thought you said this case was a freak.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3121.999,3123.0,"--I beg your pardon, sir."
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3123.0,3125.301,I thought you said this case was a freak.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3125.301,3126.243,I don't think I--
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3126.243,3128.644,Now Kansas is normal.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3128.644,3130.517,--I don't think I said this case was a freak.
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3136.28,3137.149,Now you are saying it is usual.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3137.149,3138.371,--Pardon?
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3138.371,3142.862,"Now you are saying it is a very good thing in Kansas, it works beautifully."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3142.862,3148.766,"I do think the jury system works beautifully, but there is no such thing that works beautifully every time."
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3158.544,3164.488,Was the record in this case opened in the Court of Appeals?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3164.488,3165.74,"--I beg your pardon, sir?"
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3165.74,3168.311,Was the record opened and this material put in it?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3171.063,3173.995,"How what got in the record, sir, the--"
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3173.995,3176.897,"The telephone conversation, etcetera."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3176.897,3184.891,--It was in the abstract agreed to by counsel and in both briefs to the Court of Appeals.
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3184.891,3187.432,I said where was it in the record?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3187.432,3189.853,It was not in the record.
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3189.853,3192.207,How in the world can we pass on it?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3192.207,3194.608,Because it has been stipulated to be correct.
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3194.608,3196.499,"You can't stipulate a record, can you?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3196.499,3197.24,No.
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3206.126,3209.027,"And, where... Do you want us to make the record?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3209.027,3218.534,"Your Honor, I don't know that I understand what you are asking me."
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3219.433,3221.556,"Well, there is no record here."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3221.556,3232.121,--There is a problem with the record and we believe that we were prohibited from making that record by the trial court's refusal to let us bring the jurors in and examine them on the record and under oath.
1983.82-958,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3233.844,3237.164,How do we do it other than to send it back to the District Court?
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3237.164,3238.776,I wanted to mention that in argument.
1983.82-958,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3346.465,3351.721,"Mr. Schroer, how did... Did you say how the $375,000 award was assessed?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3353.381,3357.565,It was assessed against the parties or the non-parties--
1983.82-958,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3357.565,3358.414,By name.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3358.414,3359.666,--who were not liable.
1983.82-958,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3386.483,3389.394,"And, what did the Court of Appeals do about that allocation?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3389.394,3391.645,The new trial... There is a new trial on all of the issues.
1983.82-958,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3395.399,3401.923,"And, again if there is an award, it may be allocated the same way if the jury wants to, is that it?"
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3401.923,3405.576,It is possible that it could be.
1983.82-958,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3405.576,3407.627,"I mean 35, 15, 45."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3407.627,3413.852,"What is interesting... I have never seen this before, and I want to say just quickly, the Tenth Circuit said,"
1983.82-958,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3436.456,3442.52,"Which means that McDonough may be, in the new trial, assessed that."
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3442.52,3446.611,"I think that very likely that would be the result of a new trial, Your Honor."
1983.82-958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3446.611,3448.604,Who is your client or is that--
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3448.604,3450.695,"--Billy Greenwood, a little boy who lost two feet--"
1983.82-958,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3450.695,3451.166,All right.
1983.82-958,1,26149,gene_e_schroer,,3451.166,3453.076,--because of a defective power mower.
1983.82-958,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3453.076,3457.871,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Patterson?"
1983.82-958,2,21369,donald_patterson,,3457.871,3459.14,"Very briefly, Your Honor."
1983.82-958,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3501.969,3506.944,"But, counsel, can we be entirely sure... Everybody assumed for the purpose of the decision it was a good faith, honest answer."
1983.82-958,2,21369,donald_patterson,,3519.832,3526.016,"Well, I suppose that would have to be a question that would be answered by the trial court, but the standard would be misconduct."
1983.82-958,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3528.387,3533.331,You think it is the same standard of misconduct before the jury is selected as it would be after the jury is selected?
1983.82-958,2,21369,donald_patterson,,3540.564,3544.878,"Well, I don't know as it would be prior to the time the case is tried, of course."
1983.82-958,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3552.532,3558.937,It interests me that Judge Barrett's position was that the case should have gone back and you should have had a hearing to find out a little bit more about the facts.
1983.82-958,2,21369,donald_patterson,,3562.56,3565.903,Judge Barrett's decision was to this effect as I comprehend it.
1983.82-958,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3588.266,3595.062,Would you take the same position if the juror's son had a permanent injury as a result of the tire explosion?
1983.82-958,2,21369,donald_patterson,,3595.062,3598.304,That would certainly make a harder case.
1983.82-958,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3605.988,3608.169,What if he was out for six months?
1983.82-958,2,21369,donald_patterson,,3610.152,3614.613,--That would certainly come closer to a case of juror misconduct.
1983.82-958,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3614.613,3616.446,The problem is we don't know exactly what the facts are.
1983.82-958,2,21369,donald_patterson,,3616.446,3617.615,That is right.
1983.82-958,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3632.975,3641.781,"I am just wondering... I am sorry to take so much of your rebuttal time, but what is your position with respect to the soundness of Judge Barrett's position?"
1983.82-958,2,21369,donald_patterson,,3643.812,3646.564,Part of each.
1983.82-958,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3691.107,3693.149,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
