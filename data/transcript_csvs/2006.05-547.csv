2006.05-547,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.917,We'll hear argument first this morning in Lopez versus Gonzales and Toledo-Flores versus United States.
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,8.986,12.659,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-547,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,77.033,92.402,"Well, do you agree that if there were a State conviction for an offense that would have been punishable under the Federal law, their both being felonies, that enhancement can apply, in that instance, and that that does meet the definition?"
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,92.402,93.724,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2006.05-547,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,157.744,158.155,Where--
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,158.155,162.699,"--the implication is that when Congress meant to include State offenses, it said so."
2006.05-547,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,162.699,164.57,--Where are those sections?
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,164.57,171.185,"The... you can find them; they're in the appendix to Lopez's blue brief, Justice Scalia--"
2006.05-547,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,171.185,171.926,Okay.
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,171.926,191.268,"--and the provisions on (e), (g), and (k)... 924 begins on page 3A of the appendix, and (e) begins on 5A, and you can pick up... (g) is on 6A, (k) is on 7A."
2006.05-547,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.268,192.998,What are the sections... (b)?
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,192.998,196.791,"They're subsections (e), (g), and (k)."
2006.05-547,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,196.791,197.422,All right.
2006.05-547,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,197.422,206.748,"Well, that doesn't carry too much weight, though, because the provision that... I'm looking at (g)(3),"
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,214.305,214.515,It--
2006.05-547,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,214.515,214.936,--Act.
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,214.936,227.696,"--It is a bit broader, Mr. Chief Justice, but if you look at all of these provisions, the implication is clearly that Congress was referring to State law when it meant to include State law."
2006.05-547,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,327.022,327.522,In--
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,327.522,335.197,--the Government's interpretation would significantly broaden Section 924(c) to include Federal misdemeanors.
2006.05-547,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,335.197,342.523,"--In 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(B), what, in your view, does the first phrase,"
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,349.456,350.488,Justice--
2006.05-547,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,350.488,352.13,--as defined by 924(c)?
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,352.13,364.015,"--Justice Alito, in our view, ""illicit trafficking"" means any offense that has a trafficking element... that is, distribution, possession with intent to distribute, manufacture--"
2006.05-547,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,364.015,370.76,"But are there any trafficking offenses that would not fall within 924(c) if you define a ""trafficking offense"" that way?"
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,370.76,371.552,--Yes.
2006.05-547,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,388.822,389.203,"Well, no, there--"
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,389.203,390.024,--844.
2006.05-547,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,390.024,417.761,"--are possessory... there are 924(c), but is it not the case that any... if you interpret ""trafficking"" to mean trafficking in the way the word would be used in ordinary speech... that any State trafficking offense you can think of would have a corresponding felony violation under the Controlled Substances Act, so that if you read the statute that way, the initial phrase is superfluous?"
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,417.761,432.23,I believe the Government has a footnote in their brief where they suggest there are some State trafficking offenses that actually do not have a parallel in Federal law.
2006.05-547,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,450.772,452.893,Let me ask the same question a different way.
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,478.282,502.648,"The... Justice Alito, there is an argument... it's developed in the brief of the American Bar Association... that, because illicit trafficking is the general category, that all the aggravated felonies in this category should have a trafficking component; and, therefore, the felonies punishable under the Controlled Substances Act that are ""simple possession"" offenses should not, in fact, be included."
2006.05-547,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,527.184,527.372,But that's ambiguous.
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,536.037,539.099,"Well, Justice Breyer, it is a misdemeanor under--"
2006.05-547,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,539.099,539.37,"No, that's--"
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,539.37,539.74,--the Controlled--
2006.05-547,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,539.74,540.031,--right.
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,556.734,557.12,--Well--
2006.05-547,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,557.12,558.362,It might mean anything that is a--
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,558.362,558.743,--But--
2006.05-547,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,558.743,559.354,"--felony, and--"
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,559.354,559.534,--But--
2006.05-547,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,559.534,562.316,"--it is also punishable; in which case, you lose."
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,563.265,563.886,"--But, you know--"
2006.05-547,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,563.886,566.267,"So, what am I supposed to look to, to decide which is--"
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,566.267,576.064,"--Well, you could look to the case of Jerome against United States, which is... which was a unanimous decision of this Court... in which the Court held that the... just the phrase ""any felony""--"
2006.05-547,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,576.064,576.475,--Uh-huh.
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,576.475,581.527,"--in the Federal bankruptcy statute should be interpreted to mean any Federal felony, so--"
2006.05-547,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,581.527,604.702,"Oh, but you don't mean that, because you're prepared to concede... at least I thought you were, until your last argument... you're prepared to concede that if a person engages in a crime that is punishable as a felony under South Dakota law, and it is also punishable as a felony under Federal law, under 801, et seq, well, that counts."
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,604.702,605.864,"--Well, but, I mean, the Government--"
2006.05-547,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,605.864,606.114,Do you--
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,606.114,606.484,--accuses us--
2006.05-547,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,606.484,606.935,--Do you concede that--
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,606.935,607.356,--The--
2006.05-547,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,607.356,607.904,--or not?
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,607.904,610.047,--The Government accuses us of making that concession--
2006.05-547,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,610.047,610.298,"No, no."
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,610.298,610.916,--but we--
2006.05-547,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,610.916,611.096,You--
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,611.096,611.507,--really don't.
2006.05-547,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,611.507,612.398,"--you say your answer is, you don't make the concession?"
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,612.398,613.32,We really don't.
2006.05-547,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,631.502,631.732,But I thought that--
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,631.732,632.063,--the Federal statute.
2006.05-547,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,632.063,633.743,--was the concession you made in response to my--
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,633.743,634.023,Well--
2006.05-547,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,634.023,634.414,--question.
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,634.414,634.995,--yes.
2006.05-547,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,637.796,638.566,But you--
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,638.566,639.207,--this concession--
2006.05-547,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,639.207,643.82,"--make the concession, as I understand it, because it's a Federal felony, not because it's a State felony--"
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,643.82,644.278,--Right.
2006.05-547,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,644.278,644.699,--isn't that right?
2006.05-547,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,645.129,645.6,Is it--
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,645.6,646.121,Precisely.
2006.05-547,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,646.121,654.276,"--Is it... if this is an ambiguous statute, do you... what mileage do you get from Barrett?"
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,672.138,672.649,Yes.
2006.05-547,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,701.247,701.918,What--
2006.05-547,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,701.918,702.238,You've--
2006.05-547,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,702.238,702.489,--about the--
2006.05-547,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,702.489,707.131,--answered Justice Breyer by citing the Jerome case.
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,736.961,739.304,I don't see any tension.
2006.05-547,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,747.111,747.932,But it does--
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,747.932,748.581,"--For example, in Taylor--"
2006.05-547,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.581,754.164,"--it does seem to limit the broad statement in Jerome, without mentioning Jerome."
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,754.164,759.34,"--Well, but... I mean, with respect, Justice Kennedy, I don't see how it limits it."
2006.05-547,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,775.248,786.785,"But has it ever been applied in a... to a statute that specifically says that the term ""aggravated felony"" applies to an offense described in this paragraph, whether in violation of Federal or State law?"
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,786.785,787.135,Well--
2006.05-547,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,787.135,792.891,That would seem to me to be a very express legislative repudiation of the Jerome--
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,792.891,793.27,--Well--
2006.05-547,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,793.27,793.67,--principle.
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,793.67,804.606,"--when we get to that language, Mr. Chief Justice... and I do think it helps the analysis to first decide, What is the definition of a 924(c), the criminal statute?"
2006.05-547,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,901.322,907.656,"But are you saying it would also include State trafficking offense, because it's described in the word ""trafficking""?"
2006.05-547,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,907.656,908.307,--Yes.
2006.05-547,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,928.42,929.662,"Thank you, Mr. Long."
2006.05-547,1,42514,timothy_crooks,,932.874,941.4,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,969.579,974.153,But there's no supervised release of people outside the United States.
2006.05-547,1,42514,timothy_crooks,,974.153,987.161,"There's no supervision of people outside the United States, Mr. Chief Justice, but he is still subject to the jurisdiction of the District Court, and still subject to the conditions of supervised release that are not dependent upon supervision."
2006.05-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,987.161,989.252,"Well, like what?"
2006.05-547,1,42514,timothy_crooks,,989.252,996.147,"Well, for example, he shall not excessively use alcohol, he shall not associate with persons who--"
2006.05-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,996.147,998.028,What's going to happen to him if he does that?
2006.05-547,1,42514,timothy_crooks,,998.028,1007.794,"--If the District Court learns about it he could be violated... he could be extradited back from Mexico, and he could face up to a year more in prison."
2006.05-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1007.794,1014.229,Has anything like that ever happened before with people subject to supervised release who are then deported?
2006.05-547,1,42514,timothy_crooks,,1017.251,1028.689,There have been instances in the case law where people on supervised release have been extradited back from foreign countries based on violations of their supervised release.
2006.05-547,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1055.435,1055.716,And that--
2006.05-547,1,42514,timothy_crooks,,1055.716,1055.966,--retains--
2006.05-547,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1055.966,1058.327,--that period has how many months to run?
2006.05-547,1,42514,timothy_crooks,,1058.327,1061.38,"--Until April 20th of next year, Your Honor."
2006.05-547,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1061.38,1067.794,Do you... you said you rely primarily on that argument... do you have another argument?
2006.05-547,1,42514,timothy_crooks,,1067.794,1069.475,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
2006.05-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1110.371,1123.21,"We have a case involving standing which says that... you know, the doctrine of standing is more than a... an exercise in the... in the conceivable."
2006.05-547,1,42514,timothy_crooks,,1153.16,1163.398,"Well, my answer to that, Justice Scalia, is that this Court has never said that an appeal of a sentence may become moot before that sentence is expired."
2006.05-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.612,1195.582,"That depends on whether you consider the sentence to be effectively expired once he leaves the country, if the sentence is one of supervised release, which is impossible once he leaves the country."
2006.05-547,1,42514,timothy_crooks,,1205.176,1217.695,"--But that argument could be made with respect to a person who is in the United States, who is subject to a term of probation where the only condition is that he not further violate the law."
2006.05-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1218.706,1219.337,"Well, no, because--"
2006.05-547,1,42514,timothy_crooks,,1219.337,1220.016,--instance--
2006.05-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1220.016,1227.612,"--in that... in that instance, action can be taken against him if he does further violate the law under the terms of probation."
2006.05-547,1,42514,timothy_crooks,,1233.866,1235.807,"--Well, that's true."
2006.05-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1245.274,1245.524,Well--
2006.05-547,1,42514,timothy_crooks,,1245.524,1245.755,--revoked.
2006.05-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1245.755,1249.828,--you don't want to say that your case is not moot because your client is going to violate the law again in the future.
2006.05-547,1,42514,timothy_crooks,,1249.828,1264.047,"No, not at all, Your Honor, but I'm saying that, in the respect that you just talked about for the U.S. citizen, it's not any different, that the court retains jurisdiction to violate the supervised release, and to revoke it, and then to send him back to prison."
2006.05-547,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1264.047,1269.881,"No, but it is different, in the respect that he would first have to violate the law by entering the United States."
2006.05-547,1,42514,timothy_crooks,,1269.881,1272.562,That is true.
2006.05-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1287.542,1288.774,Do you work in--
2006.05-547,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1288.774,1288.974,On--

2006.05-547,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2559.682,2560.353,--That's correct.

2006.05-547,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2757.879,2758.44,--Sure.
2006.05-547,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2758.44,2763.833,--It's one thing to turn to State law to get an answer where there is no other answer.
