1982.80-2146,2,42901,theodore_klein,,1897.117,1909.496,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Mr. Royer was walking in the airport, he was stopped by the police, told that they suspected him of carrying drugs."

1982.80-2146,3,18905,calvin_l_fox,,4123.543,4135.281,"The alias was discovered at the very moment of the initial contact with the defendant, Your Honor, and that alias, Elmore, and Partino, cited in our brief, Elmore said,"
1982.80-2146,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4183.393,4186.986,Didn't they say they were officers?
1982.80-2146,3,18905,calvin_l_fox,,4189.257,4191.086,"--That is not a show of authority, Your Honor."
1982.80-2146,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4191.086,4192.699,"Well, what is it a show of?"
1982.80-2146,3,18905,calvin_l_fox,,4192.699,4202.165,It's a show of the officers not wanting to have a nervous courier react to the fact that he was about to be taken out in the Everglades and left in the trunk of an automobile.
1982.80-2146,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4209.98,4213.923,"Then you must not object to the word ""authority""."
1982.80-2146,3,18905,calvin_l_fox,,4217.797,4220.727,You want to show them the authority to--
1982.80-2146,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4220.727,4222.299,You want to show them authority.
1982.80-2146,3,18905,calvin_l_fox,,4222.299,4227.03,--alleviate their fear that somebody who is not lawful and who--
1982.80-2146,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4227.03,4229.133,"Well, do you want to show them authority or not?"
1982.80-2146,3,18905,calvin_l_fox,,4229.133,4231.264,--It is not a show of authority.
1982.80-2146,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4234.736,4236.116,How does an officer make a show of authority?
1982.80-2146,3,18905,calvin_l_fox,,4236.116,4236.837,Pardon me?
1982.80-2146,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4236.837,4244.553,How does an officer make a show of authority if he doesn't by identifying himself and showing the authorization to act as an officer?
1982.80-2146,3,18905,calvin_l_fox,,4244.553,4253.297,"He does it by announcing to the defendant, you stay here, some sort of announcement, some sort of indication to the defendant."

1982.80-2146,3,18905,calvin_l_fox,,4256.94,4259.301,"Merely a request to open the bag is not a show of authority, Your Honor."
1982.80-2146,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4271.24,4276.993,Your friend has conceded that they could have told him to open the bags immediately on the spot.
1982.80-2146,3,18905,calvin_l_fox,,4276.993,4278.244,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.80-2146,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4284.459,4286.75,Is that a show of authority or an exercise of authority?
1982.80-2146,3,18905,calvin_l_fox,,4286.75,4289.662,"No, Your Honor, I think it was merely a request."
1982.80-2146,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4289.662,4302.572,"Well, there still could be a difference between asking a person, may we search your luggage, and saying to him, stay right here, now, open your luggage, we are officers."
1982.80-2146,3,18905,calvin_l_fox,,4302.572,4303.861,"Yes, Your Honor."
