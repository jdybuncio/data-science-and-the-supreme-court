1983.83-372,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,63.972,Mrs. Kitching.
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,63.972,68.908,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-372,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.779,196.309,"Ms. Kitching, is that the standard procedure in California whereby the state collects delinquent taxes?"
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,202.338,203.086,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-372,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,213.615,216.724,"It's not just true of government employees, but it's true of everybody."
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,216.724,217.644,This is true.
1983.83-372,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,236.794,244.444,"Mrs. Kitching, what do you mean when you say... or did you say that it's the same thing as judicial judgment, that it's treated likewise?"
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,244.444,245.634,--Absolutely.
1983.83-372,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,245.634,246.133,The administrative--
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,246.133,247.054,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1983.83-372,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,250.427,251.148,--What's this?
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,251.975,253.831,"--It... it's by both, Your Honor."
1983.83-372,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,280.464,283.241,"Is it recorded like a judgment and things like that, like a judicial--"
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,283.241,283.806,--Yes.
1983.83-372,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,291.223,294.362,"--Well, file a lien, file a lien on real estates, is that what you're talking about?"
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,294.362,294.783,"--Yes, yes."
1983.83-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,314.698,317.9,So what is the waiver of immunity that you're relying on?
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,317.9,326.725,"In this case, first of all, there's Section 401 of the Postal Reorganization Act which found that the Postal Service may sue and be sued."
1983.83-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,337.129,338.72,"Well, garnishment in connection with the judgment."
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,338.72,340.595,"--Yes, that's right, Your Honor."
1983.83-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,344.905,349.045,Do you think you're suing... you're suing... you're suing the Postal Service?
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,349.045,350.745,"Yes, we are."
1983.83-372,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,382.92,385.373,The statute gives the right to sue and be sued.
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,385.373,386.2,That's right.
1983.83-372,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,386.2,388.433,"So there's no question about that, is there?"
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,388.433,389.842,We don't believe there is.
1983.83-372,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,389.842,403.693,"I take it that when you refer to garnishment, it included also a prejudgment garnishment simply on the basis that a tax had been identified and ascertained."
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,403.693,407.6,There are only two ways that a tax could become final in California.
1983.83-372,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,420.376,433.29,"Well, I gather, Mrs. Kitching, your whole argument, or do I correctly understand it, is that you come within the sue and be sued waiver of sovereign immunity because the assessment is treated like a judicial judgment."
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,433.29,434.354,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-372,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,434.354,435.212,That's your whole argument.
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,435.212,436.803,"That is what we argue, Your Honor."
1983.83-372,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,459.0,467.778,"Mrs. Kitching, do you plan to address the jurisdictional question at all, whether this is a proper appeal?"
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,484.366,485.286,"Yes, we do."
1983.83-372,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,540.168,541.135,"Well, I guess one--"
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,541.135,541.557,--Pursuant--
1983.83-372,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,541.557,549.648,--Could read it the other way and say that the court of appeals just said the federal legislation didn't do what you said it did.
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,549.648,555.426,--Except that they didn't find any problem generally with the waiver of sovereign immunity.
1983.83-372,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,579.323,587.992,"Mrs. Kitching, why did California not use the other way of having the government collect the money for them?"
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,587.992,594.94,"California's remedies are cumulative, just as the remedies of the Internal Revenue Service are cumulative."
1983.83-372,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,730.395,731.927,Let me ask you a question right there.
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,731.927,732.488,--Yes.
1983.83-372,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,732.488,737.066,"The argument, I know, has proceeded entirely on the question whether there's waiver of sovereign immunity."
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,755.777,765.303,"We mentioned that in our brief because of that comment in the Burr case, and we thought it was an important issue."
1983.83-372,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,772.755,779.033,"Well, is there any law on the question whether an agency such as this automatically picks up the federal government's immunity or not?"
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,779.033,784.828,--I believe the Burr case is authority that it does not automatically pick up the immunity of the government.
1983.83-372,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,784.828,789.45,So that at least... do you argue or don't you that there's no immunity to start with?
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,791.605,792.775,We... we raise that issue.
1983.83-372,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,803.07,812.799,It seems to me it's something we ought to decide before we decide whether... you don't decide whether something's been waived unless you first decide that it would have been there to be waived.
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,812.799,814.971,"--I agree with you, Your Honor."
1983.83-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,832.995,845.913,"But even if... even if there was no immunity in the first place, the argument is that your... that the agreement between the Postal Service and the state forbids collecting delinquent taxes."
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,845.913,847.052,"That's what they argue, Your Honor."
1983.83-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,847.052,847.567,Yes.
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,847.567,848.394,We don't agree with that.
1983.83-372,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,848.394,858.174,Even the Burr opinion was... used the term waiver of sovereign immunity as well as the expression Justice Stevens referred to about conferring immunity.
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,858.174,858.579,Yes.
1983.83-372,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.579,861.126,"I mean it didn't speak just in one voice on the subject, did it?"
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,861.126,861.61,That's right.
1983.83-372,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,866.715,871.199,"It's kind of ambiguous, because it says no question is the power of Congress to waive the governmental immunity is present."
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,876.26,878.915,We... we believe that that was an issue.
1983.83-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1227.508,1235.003,"Well, it didn't... it certainly has got something to do in the sense that it didn't authorize the collection of delinquent taxes."
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1235.003,1245.078,"That's the... the Section 5517, and I'm... 5517 goes to the collection of state taxes, and 5520--"
1983.83-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1245.078,1245.577,Yes.
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1245.577,1247.169,--Went to the collection of local taxes.
1983.83-372,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1407.388,1415.226,"Didn't one of the legislative reports, either House or Senate, say affirmatively that this was to try to cooperate fully with the states in--"
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1415.226,1416.15,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1983.83-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1451.152,1460.726,"--Well, it's not inconceivable that Congress thought that they weren't permitted, that the state was not permitted to collect delinquent taxes by... by garnishment."
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1460.726,1464.285,"--Well, we don't... we... the agreement that--"
1983.83-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1464.285,1473.189,"Congress may well have, maybe perhaps mistakenly, thought that the sue and be sued clause didn't have the reach that you say it does."
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1473.189,1479.997,--We don't think that Congress had any of that in mind when it enacted 5517.
1983.83-372,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.997,1480.874,I'm sure you don't.
1983.83-372,0,38073,patti_s_kitching,,1480.874,1490.946,"And at that time it was meant to be a gift to the states as to all federal employees, and the Postal Reorganization Act came almost 20 years later."
1983.83-372,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1527.964,1529.135,Very well.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1533.662,1537.94,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.624,1662.135,"Well, what's... what may... why is it the plain meaning of the statute that the Postal Service may be garnished pursuant to a court judgment?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1662.135,1669.1,"--Well, in FHA against Burr this Court said that garnishment, post judgment garnishment is an incident of a suit."
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1669.1,1672.414,"Well, that may be, but the Postal Service isn't being sued."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1672.414,1680.004,"Well, that argument was made in FHA against Burr, too, and the Court's answer was that the garnishor--"
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1680.004,1682.847,So the clause really means more than being sued or sued.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1682.847,1683.299,--No.
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.58,1687.954,All right.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1699.934,1705.276,"As long as it is not part of a lawsuit, and there is no contention here that it is part of a suit."
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1705.276,1707.962,"Well, part of the state law says it's the equivalent of a lawsuit in the judgment."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1707.962,1710.942,"Well, state law can't alter the meaning of the federal law."
1983.83-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1720.097,1730.684,Is... is your basic reason for that that your concept of sue and be sued clause means a garnishment issuing out of a process of a court?
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1730.684,1731.698,--That's right.
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1732.716,1742.898,"So that if these... if the administrator here instead of garnishing on the assessment went to court and got a state court judgment, there could be a garnishment."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1742.898,1743.728,Yes.
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.647,1752.616,Even though the... even though the state law says don't do it because you already have a judgment.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1752.616,1755.412,--I don't know that the state law says don't do it.
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1757.299,1759.034,"Well, it doesn't say don't do it, but it says that you already have the judgment."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1760.298,1761.128,--No.
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1792.285,1797.518,What can happen after this assessment becomes what's called a judgment under state law?
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1798.548,1802.689,I... I don't know that there's any place in the state statutes where it is called a judgment.
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.329,1807.123,"Well, I know, but let's assume... anyway, there's a final assessment, is that it?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1814.73,1819.18,"--Well, my understanding is it's served on the employer, and it's the employer--"
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1819.18,1821.617,"Well, I know, but how about the taxpayer?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1821.617,1824.616,"--Well, the taxpayer, if the employer honors it, the taxpayer--"
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1824.616,1825.864,"Well, what about the taxpayer?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1827.506,1827.943,--Okay.
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.535,1829.038,There's a final assessment.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1831.799,1838.768,"--The taxpayer has to challenge it administratively, and if the administrative challenge does not succeed, the taxpayer has to institute a suit."
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1843.857,1849.215,So the tax assessment is not final in the sense that the taxpayer can never challenge it.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1849.215,1851.682,"Oh, certainly not, certainly not."
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1870.489,1885.012,"Of course, if the taxpayer... if the taxpayer-employee of the Postal Service gets garnished, like California wants to do, and they take the money out of his pay, and then he challenges the tax, he's going to get his money back."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1887.824,1889.028,"That's right, if he successfully challenges the tax."
1983.83-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1900.805,1901.865,"Well, now, what do you mean?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1915.611,1916.359,"--Oh, no."
1983.83-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1928.667,1936.211,"Well, but the sue and be sued clause certainly covers that if the garnishment issued out of court."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1938.243,1936.211,That's right.
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1938.914,1942.755,"But if this were a judgment, it would be collected from the Post Office?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1942.755,1944.615,Yes.
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1945.894,1949.502,California could do it?
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1949.502,1950.161,"Oh, yes."
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1951.362,1953.112,"So the only problem here is the word ""judgment""?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1953.112,1955.78,--The problem is that California hasn't sued us.
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1955.78,1957.843,"Is that the one thing, the word ""judgment""?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1957.843,1960.139,"The problem is the word ""judgment"" or the word ""sue""."
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1960.139,1961.122,That's all that's involved.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1971.792,1972.4,"Oh, no, no."
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1974.259,1975.101,"Well, I thought you said that."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1975.101,1978.038,"--California... the critical word is the word ""sue""."
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1980.772,1982.663,"Well, suppose California said this is a suit?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1982.663,1984.441,"Well, if California were to make it a suit--"
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.441,1986.91,"They'd have to do more, then."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1986.91,1988.563,"--They could, yes."
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1988.563,1989.565,They'd have to go to court.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1989.565,1990.813,"Yes, they would have to go to court."
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1991.94,1993.437,"Well, suppose they go to court?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1995.953,1999.825,If they were to set up a court--
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1999.825,2000.515,A tax court?
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2000.515,2002.901,"--If they were to set up a court, even a tax court--"
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2002.901,2006.403,And the tax court issued a judgment.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2006.403,2007.464,--And the tax court issued a judgment--
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2007.464,2008.603,You would honor it.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2008.603,2009.184,--We would honor it.
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2012.338,2013.882,But we're not... we're not engaged in semantics at all.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2013.882,2015.102,"--Well, it's not just semantics."
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.039,2053.642,"Mr. Strauss, are there any cases in which this Court has held that a federal agency is not immune from judicial process but is immune from some kind of administrative process?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2053.642,2056.519,I don't know that this issue has ever come up.
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2056.519,2060.642,Is there a doctrine... what is the scope of the doctrine of sovereign immunity?
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2061.999,2064.716,It's immunity from suit and state process.
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2064.716,2068.92,"Well, where do you... what case talks about immunity from anything other than suit?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2068.92,2076.275,"Well, I don't know that a state has ever attempted to enforce its administrative process against federal agencies, presumably because it was clear that it couldn't."
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2077.511,2080.038,"Well, there's no authority for the proposition that it couldn't, is there?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2080.038,2082.429,"--Well, there's no authority for the proposition that it couldn't or that it could."
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2084.913,2091.377,"Well, the Keifer... the Keifer case really says the first question is has Congress created an immunity when it created this agency."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2091.377,2092.598,"--Well, that's--"
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.598,2094.236,That's what Justice Frankfurter said is the issue.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2094.236,2098.704,"--Well, I think that's... that's right in the case of agencies like those involved in Keifer."
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2113.589,2120.554,"Well, he even went farther, as I read the opinion, and said that when there was a silence with respect to the Smithsonian Institute, that there was no implied immunity."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2120.554,2123.724,"--Well, that it was historically accepted that the Smithsonian Institute--"
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2123.724,2125.505,Without a sue and be sued clause.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2125.505,2128.676,"--That... that... that is true, because it, too, was structured like these agencies."
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2191.65,2193.292,"May I ask one other question, Mr. Strauss."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2216.529,2219.496,"I don't think that would make any difference, Justice Stevens."
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2219.496,2220.463,Okay.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2220.463,2221.431,That's our position.
1983.83-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2324.389,2326.838,"Well, is that quite that clear?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2334.695,2344.834,"Well, the California statutes provide that withholding taxes can be collected in precisely the same way; in fact, under the very same statutory provision."
1983.83-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2344.834,2353.425,But withholding... are you talking about withholding taxes that the employer owes or taxes that should have been withheld from an employee?
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2353.425,2357.375,"Well, withholding taxes that the employer should have withheld from the employee."
1983.83-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2357.375,2357.812,Yeah.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2358.342,2375.913,"Well, if... if... I mean this is not... I think this point, Justice Rehnquist, is not in dispute; that if the sue and be sued clause means what the Franchise Tax Board says it mean, that this legislation sought by the local tax collectors and subsequently passed, the Section 5520 of Title 5, is, in their words, superfluous?"
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.913,2376.931,Why?
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2397.233,2401.795,It would have the same authority that it has now to withhold delinquent taxes from the employees.
1983.83-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2401.795,2405.682,Which would be after an assessment levied--
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2412.335,2418.882,"No, but there's... no... nothing in the sue and be sued clause that suggests there's a difference between an assessment levy and a withholding tax levy."
1983.83-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2422.317,2425.238,"But ordinarily, withholding taxes simply aren't collected by levy."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2436.312,2437.779,"Well, I assume they're collected because--"
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2437.779,2442.233,The employee... you're just bootstrapping.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2451.696,2453.521,--There's not going to be any delinquent withholding taxes.
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.284,2455.674,Exactly.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2470.434,2475.042,"Well, I agree that it was essential, Justice White, but only because of our interpretation of the sue and be sued clause."
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2479.242,2486.631,I don't... I don't see how the sue and be sued clause could possibly authorize the employer from withholding wages.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2495.737,2498.377,"--He would say, presumably--"
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.377,2498.954,He would lose.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2500.234,2503.704,--He would say I have this order from the state taxing authority.
1983.83-372,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.704,2512.4,"The employer... state taxes, or he can't give you... can't... can't issue an order to them saying withhold taxes."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2512.4,2516.712,"I don't... I don't know why not, if state process allows it, as state process would."
1983.83-372,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2535.375,2545.311,"I don't know whether Virginia is a more favored state, but in Virginia, residents of Virginia who work for the federal government have their Virginia tax taken out of their federal salary."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2545.311,2546.107,"Oh, yes."
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2572.222,2575.861,"Well, I take it the position of California is that you are sued."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2575.861,2578.267,"--Well, you're sued now or--"
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2578.267,2579.468,In this case here.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2579.468,2586.951,"--Well, in this case that's... that's a complexity that... that I think, you know, is... needs to be understood, Justice Marshall."
1983.83-372,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2587.731,2590.445,--Will be defended.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2590.445,2593.775,"--Well, if they win this suit, Justice Marshall, then they won't have to sue us."
1983.83-372,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2604.035,2622.838,"Mr. Strauss, should our interpretation of the sue and be sued clause in Section 401 be affected in any way by our understanding of Congress' intent in trying to set up an independent agency with the Postal Service?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2659.638,2663.65,"Well, I don't think there's any reason to think that's true, Justice O'Connor."
1983.83-372,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2698.792,2703.605,"Well, I don't know that whole waves of litigation is an accurate description."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2715.132,2724.908,"--Well, it is... it is a qualitatively different form of process from that to which federal agencies are subject."
1983.83-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2774.606,2786.399,"Are there a fair number of agencies with sue and be sued clauses who are not protected, as you suggest, by the Federal Tort Claims Act?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2786.399,2789.85,"I don't know, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2791.27,2810.464,"May I ask if... if you win this case and the California legislature passed a statute and said that before serving any levies on or tax assessments on the U.S. Postal Service, you shall go over to the nearest judge and get it signed by a judge, and then you may serve it, would that cure the problem?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2810.464,2822.739,"That's... that begins to get into this... into this borderline area that comes up in these other instances in which the Court has to distinguish between state administrative agencies and state judicial bodies, like Lynch against Hasl."
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2822.739,2824.475,"Well, it wouldn't take much more than that, in any event, would it?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2824.475,2829.329,"Well, at some point the intervention of a judicial officer would make this a judicial proceeding, that's right."
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.329,2833.283,And how... how does it matter to the United States whether that intervention takes place or not?
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2833.283,2837.405,"Well, I think there are two answers to that, Justice Stevens."
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2881.949,2890.712,"Well, let me limit my question to cases in which an official authority, an official representative of the State of California is proceeding against the government agent."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2895.099,2898.412,"--I think it can, at least for purposes of removal."
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2898.412,2906.204,You mean if there... I don't know what you'd remove if they serve you with an assessment.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2911.983,2913.047,"Oh, no."
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2917.606,2918.152,"Oh, I see."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2919.061,2924.196,"In cases like this, the... the interest is different and in a way greater."
1983.83-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2939.158,2944.33,"Well, but under Burr a sue and be sued clause allows garnishment prior to judgment."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2944.33,2951.859,"--Well, under Pretty the sue and be sued clause allows attachment of a federal agency when you have a dispute with the federal agency."
1983.83-372,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2955.014,2958.371,"Well, but certainly Burr has dicta in it."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2967.882,2974.925,"--Well, if... if... if the case involves prejudgment wage garnishment, Justice Rehnquist, that's right that there's been no final adjudication, of course."
1983.83-372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2996.497,3002.9,"But in response to that, you earlier told me it didn't matter if he had to pay the judgment... pay the assessment in order to challenge it."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3004.414,3015.566,"Well, if the state law required that the employee would have to pay the assessment, yes, I think as far as the Postal Service was concerned, we would still say that like other federal agencies, we don't have to honor this assessment at all."
1983.83-372,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3019.235,3029.904,"Mr. Strauss, describe to me what California would have to do to make this law compatible with your views of a judicial decision."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3029.904,3031.109,It would have--
1983.83-372,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3031.109,3037.402,"You have the tax board, and the tax court finds a delinquency in the payment of state income taxes."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3037.402,3037.995,--That's right.
1983.83-372,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3037.995,3049.429,At that point would the statute have to provide that... that the state would have to go to court to enforce the delinquency?
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3049.429,3054.222,The statute wouldn't have to provide that in order to collect from the Postal Service.
1983.83-372,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3054.222,3060.675,"Well,... well, if... if... if the state went to court, would it sue the Postal Service?"
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3060.675,3064.001,It would sue... I don't know what the form of the suit would be.
1983.83-372,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3066.185,3067.495,The taxpayer.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3067.495,3067.87,But what the Court said in Burr--
1983.83-372,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3067.87,3079.522,"So that the tax... the tax board has already found that the taxpayer owes them money and had, as I understand it from the Attorney General, a due process hearing and lost."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3088.128,3097.576,"--My understanding, Justice Powell, is that they don't have to provide any adversary... I think they may as a matter of state law, but they don't have to provide any adversary hearing at all."
1983.83-372,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3097.576,3109.867,"They don't now under California law, but I'm trying to ascertain what California would have to do to comply with what you said it must do before it can garnishee the salary owed by the Postal Service."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3109.867,3111.962,"They would have to go to court, Justice Powell."
1983.83-372,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3118.802,3122.724,Even though the administrative agency provided all of the due process that a court would provide?
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3122.724,3128.799,"--Well, if an... if it were a court and not an administrative agency, and as I've said, there are borderline cases."
1983.83-372,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3129.938,3138.623,"Well, there are regulatory commissions in every state in the United States as well as in the government that have both judicial and administrative legislative powers."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3138.623,3139.2,--That's right.
1983.83-372,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3145.15,3145.587,They would.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3145.587,3146.152,Yes.
1983.83-372,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3146.651,3149.053,They wouldn't have to go to judgment to get to this point.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3176.155,3189.289,"--My impression, Mr. Chief Justice, is that prejudgment wage garnishments are not widely used any more because of Snydak and other decisions imposing strict procedural requirements on them, and that they're not a very popular remedy."
1983.83-372,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3189.289,3191.633,That doesn't comport with studies on the subject.
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3191.633,3192.866,"Well, as I said--"
1983.83-372,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3192.866,3198.629,"They were reduced after Snydak, but they're still overwhelmingly prejudgments."
1983.83-372,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,3198.629,3203.784,"--Well, that was my impression from... from the government's experience with garnishment orders."
1983.83-372,2,38073,patti_s_kitching,,3255.324,3264.117,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-372,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3264.117,3264.804,Ms. Kitching.
1983.83-372,2,38073,patti_s_kitching,,3264.804,3280.331,"--The Postal Service apparently does not feel confident of the preemption argue, since they devoted only about two pages in their brief to that argument, and has not addressed that argument today."
