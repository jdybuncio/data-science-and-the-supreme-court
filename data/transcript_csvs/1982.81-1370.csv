1982.81-1370,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.982,We will hear arguments next in Energy Reserves Group against Kansas Power and Light.
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,56.276,60.992,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court please:"
1982.81-1370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,307.437,321.73,"Mr. Davis, may I ask you whether the prices under the contract here had increased under that second clause before the Kansas legislature passed the act here?"
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,321.73,324.244,"Yes, Justice O'Connor it did."
1982.81-1370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,335.443,336.084,Mm-hmm.
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,337.426,339.597,In 1977.
1982.81-1370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,339.597,345.673,"Does the act retroactively apply, the Kansas act, to--"
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,345.673,351.404,"It definitely does retroactively apply, and the Supreme Court of Kansas so held."
1982.81-1370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,515.152,530.319,"--Mr. Davis, if you were correct and your client were allowed to terminate its contracts, what price could it now charge under the Natural Gas Act, under the NGPA?"
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,534.348,536.69,There would be two possibilities.
1982.81-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,563.71,568.615,Is it clear that Section 109 would not apply?
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,568.615,588.309,"Your Honor, under the Kansas act this is one of the things that they say that makes the statute reasonable is that in lieu of getting the 105 price or the price that we're entitled to under the contract, a market price, that we get the 109 price."
1982.81-1370,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,606.241,607.411,"By ""different"" you mean lower?"
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,607.411,608.255,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,609.269,620.937,"Well, if the contract... absent this contract what price could you charge?"
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,620.937,624.935,"You mean, Your Honor, if we didn't have a contract?"
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.935,625.263,Yes.
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,642.444,644.896,The price would be the same.
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.458,647.271,--The price would be controlled by the Federal act.
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,647.271,649.098,--Which would be the Section 105 price.
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,649.722,651.018,And not the 109 price.
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,651.018,652.143,Not the 109 price.
1982.81-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,652.143,655.798,"Well, but the Section 105 price applies to gas that's under contract, right?"
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,655.798,656.484,That's correct.
1982.81-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.484,659.328,But isn't it your position that the gas would not be under contract?
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,659.328,666.419,"Your Honor, it wouldn't make any difference because the market price was precisely the same price as the 105 price."
1982.81-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.419,675.04,"Well, but if it's not under contract and if 105 doesn't apply, clearly 102 would not apply, so wouldn't 109 apply, and if so, wouldn't you get an even lower price?"
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,675.04,679.711,"Your Honor, but these contracts were under contract--"
1982.81-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,679.711,686.551,"Well, but your position, as I understand, in this Court is that the contract doesn't cover this case."
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,701.044,709.4,--We're arguing that certainly the contracts do apply and that we're entitled to the relief that was afforded to us under the contracts.
1982.81-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,709.4,710.385,I see.
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,713.587,714.728,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,714.728,722.49,"And so if the utility said sorry, we won't pay the contract prices, your maximum release is to have no contract."
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,722.49,726.52,Then we could go out and sell our gas in the intra--
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.52,727.237,To anybody you wanted to.
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,727.237,728.237,--To anybody we wanted to.
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.237,731.58,But would it be subject at all to the Gas Policy Act?
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,731.58,731.954,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,736.826,738.483,"In Section 109, wouldn't it?"
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,740.404,748.822,Section 105 applies to gas that was under contract at the time of the Natural Gas Policy Act.
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.383,752.899,"You're saying ""was under contract""."
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,752.899,753.415,Right.
1982.81-1370,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,798.161,799.13,We'll resume there at 1:00.
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,799.13,799.99,"--Right, Your Honor."
1982.81-1370,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,799.99,818.622,"You may continue, Mr. Davis."
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,818.622,821.526,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court please:"
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,863.338,865.682,"Well, what about the time when there isn't any contract?"
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,865.682,870.289,"--Your Honor, I'm sure that there--"
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,870.289,871.039,It's irrelevant.
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,875.99,878.192,"--A... a success... right, Your Honor."
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.597,882.956,Yeah.
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,882.956,888.892,"--Was terminated, and it would not need to be between the same parties, for example."
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,888.892,890.375,I see.
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,890.375,899.433,I just... and also on this impairment question I want to point out that the Section 109 price is vastly different from the Section 102 price.
1982.81-1370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.675,1053.356,"Well, Mr. Davis, certainly the legislature has some right to target a particular area of perceived danger or problem, doesn't it, without making the rule that adopts for that area applicable right across the board."
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,1053.356,1064.303,"There can be no reasonable justification, Justice Rehnquist, for just picking out a few contracts having a few types of contract clauses."
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1135.026,1142.21,Did the Federal act set a ceiling on the price of this gas?
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,1142.21,1145.568,"Yes, Your Honor, it did, which is--"
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.568,1147.973,And despite any provision in the contract.
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,1147.973,1148.785,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.785,1152.222,And that wouldn't be unconstitutional?
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,1154.752,1155.345,"No, sir, Your Honor."
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.125,1167.076,But if there were some... you don't think the Federal act is vulnerable at all under provision of the Constitution.
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,1167.076,1168.715,"I personally do not, Your Honor."
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.118,1224.1,Did... did... is there a preemption issue here?
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,1224.1,1238.671,"Your Honor, the Section 602 of the Natural Gas Policy Act provides that the states may enact lower prices for gas produced in the state than that prescribed by the act."
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1271.8,1274.11,"But even if it did, it wouldn't reach the contract clause issue."
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,1274.11,1275.218,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1275.218,1277.562,It just would be a commerce issue.
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,1277.562,1290.587,"That's exactly right, but that's... that's what... if that's correct, that makes this statute even worse, because we're not talking... it's just that much smaller percentage of the gas that you're regulating."
1982.81-1370,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.988,1316.702,"Well, did the... did the Kansas court rely on the federal act as precluding the operation of these clauses?"
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,1316.702,1321.888,"No, Your Honor, it did not."
1982.81-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1331.384,1345.707,"With respect to your point about kind of chopping up the market and it's just a small part of the market, doesn't the federal scheme work in somewhat the same way by differentiating between new gas and old gas and putting a lower price on the old gas?"
1982.81-1370,0,25219,gary_w_davis,,1345.707,1351.126,"Your Honor, it also differentiates with regard to intrastate gas."
1982.81-1370,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1444.181,1449.165,Mr. Kelsey.
1982.81-1370,1,17769,basil_w_kelsey,,1449.165,1454.241,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1481.026,1483.541,"I hope you're clearing up the question, not the answer."
1982.81-1370,1,17769,basil_w_kelsey,,1487.322,1488.993,"Thank you for correcting me, Your Honor."
1982.81-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1489.867,1490.242,"Well, that's all right."
1982.81-1370,1,17769,basil_w_kelsey,,1490.242,1503.488,I think Your Honor inquired as to what this gas could receive if it were to be sold in the interstate market upon the expiration of this contract.
1982.81-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1528.507,1534.724,Would it be known that... would it be classified that way if it expired by cancellation?
1982.81-1370,1,17769,basil_w_kelsey,,1534.724,1535.599,"--No, it wouldn't, Your Honor."
1982.81-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.207,1547.377,"Well, suppose... suppose the... suppose the utility, your client... is that your client, the utility?"
1982.81-1370,1,17769,basil_w_kelsey,,1547.377,1547.845,--Yes.
1982.81-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1549.11,1550.188,Yes.
1982.81-1370,1,17769,basil_w_kelsey,,1564.65,1565.275,"No, it isn't."
1982.81-1370,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1571.835,1574.647,--And what would that... then what would the controlling section be?
1982.81-1370,1,17769,basil_w_kelsey,,1574.647,1595.701,"The controlling section would remain 105, and the price that the producer could obtain under the new successor contract would be two different answers: one, assuming the Price Protection Act remains in effect, it would get the maximum the Price Protection Act allowed."
1982.81-1370,2,25219,gary_w_davis,,3142.753,3145.97,"I just want to make a few points, Your Honor."
1982.81-1370,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3343.377,3344.501,"Thank you, gentlemen."
