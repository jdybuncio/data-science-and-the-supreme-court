1967.898,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,47.806,"Number 898, Johnny Sabbath, Petitioner, versus United States."
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,48.964,55.189,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,628.763,649.104,"Mr. Bring, Section 3109 by its terms applies only to what an officer may do to execute a search warrant and here this was an arrest without a warrant just for two reasons, 180 degrees different from what the statute seems to be addressed to."
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,655.839,661.466,Mr. Justice Stewart that is correct by its term the statue would not seem to contemplate an arrest without a warrant.
1967.898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,661.466,661.848,Right.
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,661.848,672.524,"On the other hand, that specific question was raised in United States against Miller where the government conceded that the statute does apply to any arrest without a warrant and the Court specifically held that it does apply to that kind of arrest."
1967.898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,672.524,674.238,"Yeah, right."
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,674.238,682.256,So that you might say that the statue has been extended beyond the specific language of the statute.
1967.898,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,778.322,784.639,I supposed they would -- as I understand their argument using a key is used for to open the door.
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,784.639,788.213,"Well, interesting a lot Mr. Justice Douglas that is the position of the government."
1967.898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,803.464,808.109,The force of you to turning the key is like the force in turning the door knob wasn't it?
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,808.109,810.187,I think that absolutely correct Mr. Justice.
1967.898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,822.225,825.442,But you said the door was standing open?
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,825.442,829.603,Well that presents a more difficult question Mr. Justice White.
1967.898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.824,831.798,"Well, in terms of purpose of what it was?"
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,831.798,832.984,"Not in terms of purpose, no."
1967.898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,832.984,835.017,Would you make the same argument?
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,835.017,848.878,I would make the same argument to this extent that the objectives of the statue are designed to ensure the privacy of the occupant of the home and to prevent violence which frequently accompanies unannounced intrusions into the home.
1967.898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,941.547,959.371,"Does the statute apply -- if you announce your purpose at the outside and you're not -- and there's no answer, you're not -- your purpose or -- and then you try the door and it opens and you go in there's three rooms in the apartment."
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,965.23,974.377,I think that a literal reading of the statute to would required you to do that because it applies both to outer and inner doors of the apartment.
1967.898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.797,1004.739,Are there any exceptions?
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1004.739,1007.784,"Yes, I think there are some exceptions."
1967.898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.867,1011.995,Do you have to talk about those here or no?
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1011.995,1022.537,"I don't -- well, the government makes the argument Mr. Justice White that there were so called exigent circumstances here which excuse the police from making the announcement."
1967.898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1073.314,1092.074,"Well the police knew that there was a kidnap victim being held in that apartment and reliably have been told by other residents in that building, do you think they - -those would be exigent circumstances?"
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1092.074,1096.425,I can conceive of the situation like that where there would be exigent circumstances.
1967.898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1103.727,1108.031,What if they heard some shooting in the apartment when Jones was in there?
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1108.031,1110.853,I think that would be sufficient to excuse the announcement.
1967.898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1117.9,1123.017,So what statute that the government rely on with which they based their theory for Jones for safety?
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1123.017,1124.149,There are no facts in the record Your Honor.
1967.898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1124.149,1125.697,Why don't you find it out from them?
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1125.697,1130.726,"Well, I wish that the effort would be made because I'm not familiar with any facts."
1967.898,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1139.233,1147.9,"But what would be basis, what would be the basis for the exception in the case Mr. Justice White talked about?"
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1147.9,1150.445,The exception of the kidnapper.
1967.898,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1150.445,1151.095,"Yes, right."
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1155.528,1157.392,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
1967.898,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1157.392,1163.563,"All right, but how can you read into it an exception for exigent circumstances?"
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1163.563,1172.859,"Well, I think your Honor that for the same reasons that the Court did so in Ker versus California while it's true they were not interpreting this specific statue."
1967.898,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1204.587,1206.628,"But that's a very different matter, isn't it."
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1206.628,1207.104,"Yes, it is Your Honor."
1967.898,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1207.104,1211.251,Ker versus California related to the constitutional requirement.
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1215.535,1229.256,There's no doubt Your Honor that this Court does not have to go as far in permitting exceptions to the statue as were permitted in the current case when the similar requirement was then under the Fourteenth Amendment
1967.898,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1229.256,1236.204,You can put that the other way that maybe this Court cannot go as far as we did in Ker.
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1236.204,1252.17,"Well, Mr. Justice Fortas, I would certainly have no objection to the Court coming out with a broad principle in this case which and I think in fact that I think it should come out with as broad as principle as possible which would require the police to make the announcement in every case."
1967.898,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1289.088,1297.293,"Is there any legislative issue Mr. Bring that this is the way on what break in means, start on that broad topic?"
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1297.293,1300.407,"Your Honor, the legislative history of this statute is very sparse."
1967.898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1389.555,1397.04,What if Jones had been a police agent?
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1397.04,1398.195,Pardon me?
1967.898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1398.195,1400.23,If Jones had been in police officer?
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1400.23,1401.853,You mean in disguise?
1967.898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1401.853,1404.945,"Well, yes, he wanted to buy some narcotics and came here to buy them --"
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1404.945,1406.509,"Well, no I think Mr. Justice --"
1967.898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1406.509,1409.301,"And well as soon as he had then sold some narcotics, he arrested him."
1967.898,0,35415,murray_h_bring,,1409.301,1410.817,Right.
1967.898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.297,1419.435,"Well, not too long ago."
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1724.305,1727.333,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1967.898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1758.395,1762.382,Mr. Martin the petitioner was decided in what Court?
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1762.382,1763.89,It was raised in the Court of Appeals.
1967.898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1763.89,1765.04,"No, my question was --"
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1765.04,1767.317,It was decided by the Court of Appeals.
1967.898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1767.813,1769.827,But isn't it before us?
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1769.827,1783.839,"I would think not, I think under the analogy to the (Inaudible) decision that the problem is that this argument depends on the particular facts of the case."
1967.898,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1834.792,1837.899,"But you don't really make this argument in a brief, do you?"
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1842.559,1847.896,"Yes, we do refer to it in the brief and we cite the (Inaudible) case which stands exactly this principle."
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1847.896,1855.535,"Do you refer to this in the Court of Appeal, did you ask the Court of Appeal to remand it so you can make the piece of the factual record?"
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1855.535,1858.683,I'm not sure whether that was done in the Court of Appeals Mr. Justice White.
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.683,1867.386,I don't notice the Court of Appeals say that the government objects for considering this that we don't think it should be technical or something like that.
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1867.386,1869.442,"Well, I think it is important Mr. Justice White --"
1967.898,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1869.442,1871.762,It has been raised at the opposition.
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1871.762,1873.134,"Yes, we did."
1967.898,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1873.134,1875.085,Okay.
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1875.085,1887.038,I think it's important particularly in light of the whole question that is raised in the last part of Mr. Bring's argument concerning the possible exigent circumstances that might have justified why the agents -- if we assume from it they didn't announce.
1967.898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1939.334,1940.53,And where is this?
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1940.53,1945.135,Page 28 to 29 of the appendix.
1967.898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1945.135,1948.336,"Oh, yes."
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,1948.336,1965.789,"Now, I think that we have here what was present in (Inaudible) where the government attempted the argument in this case that even though the arrest warrant was invalid, the Court should consider it whether or not the arrest was proper on the basis of probable cause which the aids may have had."
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.636,2004.826,But you've said Mr. Martin you do not know whether this question was argued in the Court of Appeal?
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2004.826,2006.962,That's right.
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.962,2010.439,"Now, the Court of Appeals have to reach out to cite a view."
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2010.439,2013.629,"Well, I think that the Court could --"
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2013.629,2018.217,"Well, if the petitioner is certain, I mean the appellant in the Court of Appeal --"
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2018.217,2020.284,"No, he said the appellant raised the question --"
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2020.284,2021.014,He raised it and --
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2021.014,2030.053,And the client Mr. Justice White that I was not sure whether or not the government and the Court of Appeals came out of the Court that the record was not adequate to reach the full merits.
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2030.053,2034.177,"You didn't come back and say that the Court of Appeals, it should not be considered here."
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2034.177,2035.47,That I'm not sure of.
1967.898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2035.47,2036.264,Mr. Justice White I --
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.264,2038.375,But what if you did --
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2038.375,2043.167,"Well, I don't think that that should determine the issue when you have problem here, as I said --"
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2043.167,2051.476,"If you met the appellant on the merits of that question, on the record whatever the record is, isn't that a difficult --"
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2051.476,2060.021,"Well, I suppose it is somewhat difficult but I do think when you have a situation such as this where so much depends upon the record."
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2083.647,2100.324,"If you reverse the case, they reversed the Court of Appeals on just on this record that doesn?t propose the possibilities that there are more fact that have been put in this record."
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2100.324,2102.739,That's correct.
1967.898,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2245.207,2256.613,"Mr. Martin, would you tell me the difference between the turning of the key, passkey and the turning of the knob that makes one to break it and the other not?"
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2256.613,2264.88,"Yes Mr. Justice Marshall, I think that the difference is in what is involved here."
1967.898,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2350.291,2357.106,What is the real difference that when he locks his door he doesn't expect somebody to either break it or use a passkey?
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2357.106,2357.636,Exactly.
1967.898,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2359.491,2361.045,He expressed it might open.
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2361.045,2361.396,That's right.
1967.898,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2433.485,2455.559,"Would you say that in a home where there are a number of children, and the doors were left open or left unlocked so that the children could run in and run out anytime of the day, that they wanted to come in the house for one reason or another, that that home was deprived of the benefit of this statute?"
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2455.559,2458.272,"Well, I wouldn't say deprived."
1967.898,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2472.298,2475.112,"Taking the risk against what, lawlessness?"
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2475.112,2475.935,Not lawlessness.
1967.898,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2487.4,2494.063,You mean to say that the failure to lock your door is an invitation to anyone to come in?
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2494.063,2502.051,"Well, I think that it may not be an invitation to anyone to come in but it has to reasonably expected that that may happen."
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.051,2505.421,This is like the party night?
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2505.421,2508.963,"Well, I think that it -- there is some question about the?"
1967.898,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2536.378,2538.979,Why don't you draw it according to the statute?
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2538.979,2545.167,"Well, I think if I'll turn to that Mr. Chief Justice, I think the statute contemplates more than just opening an unlocked door?"
1967.898,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2561.206,2563.613,Are there cases supporting that?
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2563.613,2564.256,"Yes, the --"
1967.898,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2564.256,2566.754,Your argument is supporting that?
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2566.754,2571.071,"Well, Miller doesn't deal with -- I'm sorry, I though you said if you said did our case didn't support that."
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2693.828,2696.271,"These were the customs agents, weren't they?"
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2696.271,2696.836,That's right.
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.836,2699.599,They work out of the treasury department?
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2699.599,2700.661,That's correct.
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2700.661,2706.283,Do you know whether they get the same instructions that the FBI gets?
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2706.283,2707.785,I would not think so.
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2707.785,2716.232,Do you know whether they get instructions as to what they're supposed to do when they want to enter somebody's dwelling place?
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2716.232,2722.899,"They do get -- I know that they do have courses for them, how detailed, you know, before they are assigned."
1967.898,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2732.022,2736.143,I understood Mr. Bring to say that the word break.
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2746.844,2756.485,"Well, I think that there had been -- there's been some -- I think Mr. Bring said not in this statute, but that there had been some of the commentators had suggested that it should be given that same construction."
1967.898,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2756.485,2758.652,"Suggested, or decided?"
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,2758.652,2766.573,"Well, I don't -- I think there have been cases in the District of Columbia Circuit which had held that it is the breaking to open an unlocked door."
1967.898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3021.466,3043.851,"You're saying that just like -- if the petitioner, if the police had announced their presence and the fellow had said -- petitioner had said, get away from here, or I'll kill Jones, they could have broken in."
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3043.851,3044.242,That's right.
1967.898,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3080.547,3099.857,"Would you have to say that in narcotic cases all the police have to do is to send in an undercover man into the -- into some quarters and wait a few minutes, and then break open, break down the door and go in and arrest him, on that same theory?"
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3099.857,3100.595,"Well, I --"
1967.898,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3100.595,3102.886,"If you don't, how do you distinguish between the ordinary case and this case."
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3102.886,3145.553,"I suppose Mr. Chief Justice that when you have an undercover agent inside, it does add an element of risk that the agents have a right to consider, with all the other circumstances they may know, as opposed of if we were writing on a totally clean slate there might be room for argument that anytime agents are going to arrest for a serious crime, where there is -- there might be some basis for saying that they shouldn't have to announce their purpose."
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3225.304,3228.178,Do you know how long he had been in that --
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3228.178,3233.646,I believe -- I'm not sure if it appears in the appendix.
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3247.551,3248.944,"I mean, had he been a seasoned officer?"
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3248.944,3249.401,"Oh yes, he was."
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.993,3380.363,Do you know whether there had been any proposals to amend the statute in the congress in the last several years?
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3380.363,3385.194,I do not know of any Mr. Justice White.
1967.898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3385.194,3393.141,"I gather Mr. Martin, first of all these is an exigent circumstance's exception."
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3397.069,3397.47,No.
1967.898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3419.244,3421.602,"But that's, as a matter of fact the conclusion of the congress."
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3421.602,3422.148,That's right.
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3422.711,3425.726,Probably that restricted the rule of congress.
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3425.726,3433.268,"Well, here again, I would point out that I think it's -- that the full statute need not necessarily apply here."
1967.898,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3439.973,3440.905,You're talking about an arrest warrant.
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3440.905,3441.339,That's right.
1967.898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3487.764,3492.49,(Inaudible)
1967.898,1,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,3492.49,3497.251,"Well, I think that these -- I think the statute is only is a guideline."
1967.898,2,35415,murray_h_bring,,3539.688,3541.112,Mr. Chief Justice may it appease the Court.
