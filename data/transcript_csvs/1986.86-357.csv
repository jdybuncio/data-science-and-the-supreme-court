1986.86-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.522,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 86-357, American Trucking Associations versus James I. Scheiner."
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,19.378,37.006,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this appeal brings before the Court two taxes, the axle tax and the marker fee which are imposed by the State of Pennsylvania on trucks that travel over its highways."
1986.86-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,135.67,140.924,"Mr. Shapiro, how do you know that per mile is the proper apportionment?"
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,152.364,152.814,That is correct.
1986.86-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,152.814,154.25,"--apportionments you could come to, aren't there?"
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,154.25,155.25,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,174.83,175.58,There is no single one.
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,176.914,178.199,--It could be hours on the road.
1986.86-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.099,188.387,Is that any different from the discrimination that exists with respect to the citizens of Pennsylvania themselves?
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,200.429,205.699,There are many flat taxes that do not discriminate against interstate commerce at all.
1986.86-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,207.885,209.753,But you call that discrimination anyway.
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,209.753,217.241,--But is isn't necessarily commerce clause discrimination unless the out-of-state taxpayer is burdened in a way that the in-state taxpayer is not.
1986.86-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,218.693,222.811,"One wouldn't normally apply the term discrimination to that, would one?"
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,222.811,226.696,"--Well, this Court did, of course, in Nippert, and I would like to make clear what the Nippert problem is."
1986.86-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,284.551,288.687,"Mr. Shaprio, Congress is taking a look at this problem, isn't it?"
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,288.687,294.657,Congress is taking a look only at the administrative facets of state taxation of highways.
1986.86-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,301.097,310.035,It just seems to me that this Court in rather a long line of cases has basically approved this flat tax method--
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,310.035,311.202,--There is no question that the Aero Mayflower--
1986.86-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.202,322.176,"--and there may be quite a reliance interest now of the states on that system, and maybe it isn't the best, but do you think we have to recognize the precedents?"
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,322.176,326.562,"--Well, I think the precedents are the heart of this, and I would like to address them in some detail."
1986.86-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,349.577,359.866,"Well, but the case of Massachusetts against the United States, I think, cited those precedents again with approval even after Complete Auto."
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,359.866,363.17,There is no question that the cases have continued to be cited.
1986.86-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,394.706,405.997,Isn't there quite an administrative burden for the states to try to collect a tax on some basis that actually reflects the weight of the vehicle and the miles traveled?
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,407.449,415.353,"That is a critical issue, and I think it is important to recognize that every state in the United States has mileage based taxes today."
1986.86-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,444.622,447.324,"Well, I am not sure that is right, Mr. Shapiro."
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,468.405,474.308,"Well, Your Honor, our submission is that the nondiscriminatory taxes such as the fuel taxes, they are already in place."
1986.86-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,483.08,489.484,"Well, but that doesn't rise to the level of a constitutional principle to just say it would be better if Pennsylvania did it the way we wanted it to."
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,489.484,500.626,In the Nippert case this Court pointed out if there are less discriminatory alternatives available to the state that is of critical importance in deciding whether the discrimination can be countenanced under the Constitution.
1986.86-357,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,562.199,568.87,"Mr. Shapiro, if we could back up a minute, you said how fair school taxes were."
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,578.276,583.53,"Well, there are many taxes such as head taxes or the--"
1986.86-357,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,583.53,588.117,"I am not saying it is crucial, but I mean you have to consider it."
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,588.117,589.2,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-357,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,598.055,599.055,"No, not at all."
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,599.055,600.657,--problem here that we are concerned with.
1986.86-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,624.857,632.212,"Is there some empirical support for the proposition you just state, or is that just pretty much speculation?"
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,632.212,635.164,It is virtually definitional by these taxes.
1986.86-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,635.164,637.616,"I mean, is there empirical support for it?"
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,637.616,638.566,"For the greater cost, yes."
1986.86-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,643.786,649.757,"No, I mean empirical support for the proposition that the sort of system Pennsylvania has discourages out-of-state trucks."
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,651.39,655.578,"--Well, this Court reached that very conclusion in the Nippert case."
1986.86-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.578,665.034,"Well, I am asking about whether there has been empirical evidence saying that there are fewer trucks coming into Pennsylvania because of the kind of tax system it has."
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,665.034,669.819,"To my knowledge, Your Honor, other than what we have submitted in the record, there is not a study of this problem."
1986.86-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,825.688,839.863,"Again, the same thing happens with regard to intrastate residents, and we don't... nobody considers that so discriminatory that it isn't the standard system in all the 50 states as far as I know."
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,839.863,843.382,"Those problems, of course, are not commerce clause problems."
1986.86-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,847.953,861.111,"I understand, but the argument you are making is not just that discrimination, which has an invidious overtone, against commerce is bad, but you are saying any absence of equality on the part of interstate commerce is bad."
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,861.111,867.498,"We do say if there is a practical economic effect of discriminating, that that is as bad as the bad purpose."
1986.86-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,993.43,996.298,"What are you talking about, gasoline, fuel taxes?"
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,996.298,1004.154,"Fuel purchase, fuel use taxes, the gross receipts tax, which is mileage-based in Pennsylvania, the apportioned registration fee."
1986.86-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1026.567,1032.238,What is the competitive disadvantage to your interstate truckers?
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1032.238,1036.541,They pay a very substantially higher cost per mile in any--
1986.86-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1036.541,1038.409,That is different.
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1039.493,1044.878,--They are competing with local business for local carriage of commerce.
1986.86-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1044.878,1048.433,So you are really talking about people from out-of-state who are making deliveries in Pennsylvania?
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1048.433,1050.617,"Well, there is that discriminatory effect."
1986.86-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1058.539,1065.978,"Well, I know, but what about a class of trucks, that all they do on Pennsylvania highways is go through the state?"
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1071.43,1077.184,"Well, there is competition from the out-of-staters for that local business of picking up and dropping off."
1986.86-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1077.184,1077.55,What local business?
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1093.312,1096.748,"Well, they are not competing for the local carriage."
1986.86-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1097.314,1099.033,"Well, they aren't being discriminated against, in short."
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1099.033,1108.805,"Well, they are being discriminated in the sense that the flat tax regime makes it prohibitively expensive to engage in this 50-state operation compared to the local operation."
1986.86-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1108.805,1112.673,"Well, that is... do you think that is a commerce clause question?"
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1112.673,1113.209,"Oh, we certainly do."
1986.86-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.209,1115.492,"Well, there is no discrimination."
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1115.492,1118.344,There is a penalty for engaging in interstate operations.
1986.86-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1126.5,1127.55,I don't understand that.
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1134.456,1140.46,The Court has to view this as a situation where states across the country have flat taxes.
1986.86-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1162.54,1175.764,"So you say in effect that there isn't going to be any interstate business of trucking stuff from New York to San Francisco, that it is all going to be transshipped at each state border if your view doesn't prevail?"
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1175.764,1177.499,That is the vulcanizing effect.
1986.86-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1188.607,1192.193,"Truckers would rather pay this axle tax than do that, I think."
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1192.193,1194.345,"Well, the axle tax is being replicated--"
1986.86-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.345,1198.313,"Questions like that are kind of out of our reach, aren't they?"
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1198.313,1203.45,"--Well, the Court has said that even small amounts of discrimination are not acceptable under the commerce clause."
1986.86-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1212.639,1220.745,"But, Mr. Shapiro, insofar as you attack the marker tax or marker fee, you attack the $25 fee, but I don't think you attack the $5 fee, do you?"
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1220.745,1222.945,We don't attack the $5 fee.
1986.86-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1396.159,1404.265,"Well, Mr. Shapiro, I assume that some states have collected millions of dollars of flat tax fees."
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1407.899,1415.239,"--Well, I don't speak generally to that issue, but in this case we have stipulations for a refund from the state that has dealt with that."
1986.86-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1426.278,1433.034,I would assume there is a pretty heavy reliance interest by states on this Aero Mayflower line.
1986.86-357,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1433.034,1439.121,"Well, this litigation, Justice O'Connor, was commenced immediately after the effective date of these taxes."
1986.86-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1561.55,1563.336,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,1589.669,1601.627,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are two reasons why Pennsylvania's axle tax is constitutional."
1986.86-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1706.278,1732.243,"I suppose you could at some cost set up weighing stations at the border of the state where you come in from, say, between Binghamton and Scranton coming down, what, 81, is it, and then if you are driving all the way through coming out south of Gettysburg, and just ask the driver for a declaration of how many miles in the state, or maybe check odometers."
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,1732.243,1757.711,"That is a possibility, Your Honor, but you must understand that that requires of the state a great administrative cost, and if you would do that there... you are requesting the state to rely on one factor in a system where the costs are generated by many factors."
1986.86-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1791.115,1796.769,--Are there more than seven states using the flat tax--
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,1796.769,1797.788,For highway systems?
1986.86-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1797.788,1799.071,--system on highways?
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,1799.071,1813.463,"I believe at this point there are only seven states that are imposing a flat fee, and you have to understand Pennsylvania's situation to also understand why we decided to enact the axle tax."
1986.86-357,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1828.723,1834.211,Why are your weather conditions any more difficult than a lot of other states?
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,1834.211,1843.917,"The weather conditions are very cold as compared to the southern part of the nation, which causes stress--"
1986.86-357,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1843.917,1847.269,"Well, but there are a lot of northern states that don't do what Pennsylvania does."
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,1847.269,1853.957,"--I am saying, Your Honor, that it is a combination of factors, that Pennsylvania has a unique situation."
1986.86-357,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1862.378,1864.663,Does New York do what Pennsylvania does?
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,1864.663,1871.067,I am not aware of the fact whether New York imposes a flat tax.
1986.86-357,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1871.067,1873.419,0 xxx.
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,1873.419,1875.988,"Yes, absolutely, and they also have a very--"
1986.86-357,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1875.988,1877.906,"And they have a slight bridge problem, too."
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,1877.906,1895.099,--They have a very... I believe the Wall Street Journal indicated that Pennsylvania and New York have the most severe situation so far as the condition and the damage of their bridges.
1986.86-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.099,1900.403,"Of course, I suspect the most important of those factors you mention is that Pennsylvania has a lot of truck traffic."
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,1900.403,1901.069,Absolutely.
1986.86-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.069,1904.307,Most of which is interstate and easily taxable.
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,1908.592,1909.775,We had the first turnpike.
1986.86-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1910.427,1911.161,The first turnpike.
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,1911.161,1911.594,Yes.
1986.86-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1911.594,1912.913,"Feels like it, anyway."
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,1917.615,1926.804,The appellants go on to suggest that the mileage-related fuel tax is the talisman to these flat taxes.
1986.86-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1958.958,1961.31,You say Pennsylvania has a self-reporting system.
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,1963.096,1965.112,"--No, for the mileage taxes."
1986.86-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1965.112,1966.548,Pennsylvania does?
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,1966.548,1967.631,Yes.
1986.86-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.704,2042.012,"Before you do that, I want to be sure I understand your argument about the difficulty of using an audit or whatever it is, but is it not correct that 43 states do have this kind of mileage tax and only seven have the flat tax?"
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2042.012,2049.802,"--I'm not... most states have a mileage-based tax, but I believe they have those taxes in combination with other taxes."
1986.86-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.402,2057.105,"Even if they have others as well, apparently they are able to administer a mileage tax."
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2057.105,2063.71,"--Well, they administer it... apparently they do, but I am saying Pennsylvania probably isn't comparable."
1986.86-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2087.243,2090.195,The Chief Justice asked you about weight.
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2095.813,2114.644,"NO, Pennsylvania has a maximum weight, and we have weigh stations along certain highways where on occasion they have to pull over, but there is nothing at the entrance of the state and when they leave the state to actually weigh a truck, and that goes to show you administrative inconvenience also."
1986.86-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2121.214,2122.916,--I have often wondered about those weigh stations.
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2127.635,2129.32,"I imagine they keep records, because--"
1986.86-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2129.32,2131.403,They do keep a record of every truck that is weighed?

1986.86-357,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2150.298,2153.732,"In fact, isn't it true that if they are overweight they are arrested?"
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2153.732,2154.299,"--Yes, they are."
1986.86-357,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2154.299,2155.101,On the spot?
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2155.101,2156.818,"Yes, they are."
1986.86-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2158.72,2162.438,"Most of those weigh stations that I have seen have always had a ""Closed"" sign on them."
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2164.624,2171.278,"And the truckers are very happy about that, too."
1986.86-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2249.813,2256.3,"But was the formula by which they reverted to the 1980 level the same, just the same as the increase had been?"
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2256.3,2257.9,--It is very similar.
1986.86-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2271.477,2274.679,But the form of the statute was not just a simple reduction to the pre-level.
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2278.397,2284.717,"You are absolutely correct, but basically they shifted the burden to the--"
1986.86-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2284.717,2288.105,It is just a coincidence that it offsets against the axle tax?
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2288.105,2290.555,"--It was a coincidence of timing, I would call it."
1986.86-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2290.555,2290.973,Just a coincidence.
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2290.973,2291.69,Yes.
1986.86-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.69,2294.359,"I guess Justice Nix wasn't really persuaded by that, was he?"
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2294.359,2296.109,"No, he was not persuaded by that."
1986.86-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2382.159,2402.906,"Ms. Wolfe, would you concede that if every state in the United States imposed a substantial flat fee tax for highway use, that the cumulative burden of those taxes could have... could pose a threat to the free flow of interstate commerce by trucks?"
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2402.906,2405.774,I don't believe that there is a threat.
1986.86-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2434.058,2444.816,"Well, it certainly seems to me that the potential for a severe burden is there, viewed cumulatively, and I am surprised that you can't recognize that."
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2444.816,2456.707,I recognize the fact that interstate commerce should pay its own way and that they are enjoying the privilege of engaging in business in many states.
1986.86-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2456.707,2464.061,You don't think it should bear any relation at all to the extent of the use of the highways--
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2464.061,2465.561,I am saying that--
1986.86-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2465.561,2467.977,--by the interstate user?
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2467.977,2471.296,--I am saying that I don't foresee a cumulative problem--
1986.86-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2471.296,2474.581,Wouldnt' that ultimately be the most fair way to do it?
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2475.931,2476.881,--I--
1986.86-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2476.881,2487.639,That a highway use tax should bear some reasonable relation to the miles traveled and perhaps the weight and configuration of the vehicle.
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2487.639,2496.744,"--If such a system would be possible to achieve, that would be the best way probably."
1986.86-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2500.981,2504.1,You say it is not possible to achieve taxes?
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2504.1,2504.933,Not at this point.
1986.86-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2550.796,2583.033,"Isn't it true that your other examples of weight and so forth, you say none of them are perfect, mileage isn't perfect and so forth, but none of these other variables such as mileage would suggest that there is any distinction drawn between local truckers and interstate truckers, whereas the system you have used has the unique feature, as I understand it, according to the evidence, at least, of placing a heavier burden on the interstate trucker than it does on the trucker who primarily drives in Pennsylvania, which would not be true of mileage tax, weight tax, or any of these other things."
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2583.033,2586.302,I don't know if I understand your question.
1986.86-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2591.673,2593.408,"Well, but the flat tax doesn't."
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2593.408,2594.191,The flat--
1986.86-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.191,2595.175,The axle tax doesn't.
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2595.175,2602.579,"--It does according to weight, yes, according to the axles, which are in proportion to the number of axles you have basically."
1986.86-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.579,2616.855,"Well, yes, but all trucks with five axles pay the same tax even if they do all their business in interstate commerce, and it does... is it not correct that the burden of the tax falls more heavily on interstate truckers than it does on local truckers?"
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2616.855,2626.277,Well I will say that we have no direct evidence that has been submitted concerning a cost per mile.
1986.86-357,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2645.322,2647.324,"Yes, but under your theory it doesn't really make any difference."
1986.86-357,1,42284,suellen_m_wolfe,,2652.262,2653.145,That is exactly right.
1986.86-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2666.021,2667.171,"Thank you, Ms. Wolfe."
1986.86-357,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2669.389,2673.591,"I just have a few additional comments, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-357,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2722.941,2737.118,"Mr. Shapiro, on that argument you really can't argue that easy single interstate trucker is being discriminated against in favor of every single intrastate trucker?"
1986.86-357,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2737.118,2739.902,"--Quite to the contrary, we don't contend that."
1986.86-357,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2749.425,2749.841,"Well, that may be so."
1986.86-357,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2749.841,2751.71,--but retaliatory taxes in eight more states.
1986.86-357,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2751.71,2760.483,But your argument is that just because the axle tax isn't mileage-related that it is unconstitutional on its face.
1986.86-357,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2760.483,2762.216,We take the position that it is--
1986.86-357,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.216,2773.207,"And that everybody, even though there are a lot of interstate truckers who won't be discriminated against as respects... as compared with some intrastate truckers, just aren't discriminated against."
1986.86-357,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2773.207,2774.474,--That was the holding in Nippert.
1986.86-357,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2775.243,2775.776,Yes.
1986.86-357,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2775.776,2777.943,"--was observed by the Court in Nippert, and we think it is correct."
1986.86-357,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2782.579,2787.383,"Of course, on the structural argument everybody, every interstate trucker is being discriminated against."
1986.86-357,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2787.383,2788.733,--That is correct.
1986.86-357,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2803.16,2804.845,Me.
1986.86-357,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2804.845,2822.889,"--And individual drivers, of course, but we suggest that even though these are legitimate state objectives that the constitutional rule which forbids discrimination in raising these funds is so vitally important here, we are talking about instrumentalities of interstate commerce, trucking."
1986.86-357,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2887.23,2888.747,"Your time has expired, Mr. Shapiro."
