1981.81-450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.934,"Thank you, Justice Powell."
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,15.12,18.025,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,239.686,242.509,Were any statements taken from them before they were released?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,242.509,242.893,"Yes, sir."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,244.502,245.693,What happened to the statement?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,245.693,250.741,"Well, unfortunately, the tape recorder had malfunctioned."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,262.007,265.646,So in fact there is no written or recorded statement from those released?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,265.646,282.107,"No, not a specific written or recorded statement; although I think typically there would be, moreover, we do of course have the statement from the remaining illegal alien, Romero-Morales, and the statements from the Border Patrol agents, and all the statements by all of the agents -- or excuse me, by all of the illegal aliens are essentially the same."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,282.107,285.435,And when did you get -- when did they get the statement from Morales?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,286.286,300.269,"Subsequently when he testified at the -- at the hearing, they received -- they obtained that statement and there's nothing to indicate that his statement at the hearing on the motion to dismiss was different from the statement given to the Border Patrol agents at the time of his arrest."
1981.81-450,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,308.654,309.477,Mr. Phillips --
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,309.477,309.62,"Yes, ma'am."
1981.81-450,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,309.62,315.701,-- I assume the Government could have prosecuted the witnesses who were deported --
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,315.701,315.727,"Yes, ma'am."
1981.81-450,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,315.727,316.893,-- for a criminal offense.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,316.893,319.824,"Yes, ma'am.We could have prosecuted them for illegal entry into this country."
1981.81-450,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,319.824,324.602,But it is the general practice not to do that and to simply deport them.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,324.602,327.572,"It is significantly easier, Your Honor, our resources to do that."
1981.81-450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,329.019,336.255,"There's no claim, I take it here, that the respondent himself transported the illegal aliens across the border --"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,336.255,336.382,No.
1981.81-450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,336.382,339.901,"-- just they transported them after they were in the country, and they hadn't been here for a year."
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,339.901,340.626,That's correct.
1981.81-450,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,352.951,358.138,Was the respondent represented and did the prosecutor know that at the time they were released?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,358.138,359.407,"No, the respondent was not represented by a counsel."
1981.81-450,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,359.407,360.464,He was not represented?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,360.464,362.687,"No, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,362.687,367.601,"Ultimately, did -- was he represented by a retained or appointed counsel?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,367.601,372.129,I believe it was appointed counsel.
1981.81-450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,392.986,400.932,Did he make any proffer of what the testimony would be given had these people been kept in the country?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,400.932,408.187,"Not specifically, the closest thing to a proffer, I suppose, would be -- he did offer a testimony of Romero-Morales at the hearing."
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,419.374,423.88,"Mr. Phillips, before you -- before you go on, can I get the time sequence a little in my mind?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,423.88,424.409,"Yes, sir."
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,424.409,426.652,"The man was arrested on the 29th of March, was it?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,426.652,426.951,"Yes, sir."
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,426.951,430.914,And the other occupants of the vehicle were sent back on the 30th.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,430.914,431.354,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,431.354,434.015,"And he was arraigned on the 31st, was it, the next day?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,434.015,434.713,Yes.
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,434.912,437.941,"Now, when -- was a counsel appointed for him on the 31st?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,437.941,439.278,I assume that that was the --
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,439.278,443.57,So it would have been a question of whether to hold him for one day to give the counsel an opportunity to interview him.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,444.177,449.015,"In this specific case it would have been but there was no way, I don't think, of knowing that at the time necessarily."
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,449.015,457.019,"Well, isn't there a procedure whereby these things are processed in this manner normally and wouldn't you normally expect the complaint to be filled rather promptly?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,457.019,463.659,"Well, we would assume that; although, of course, it's -- it's not really accurate -- altogether accurate to say that it's only holding him for a single day."
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,477.337,479.181,The -- the practice is to keep them for 10 days?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,479.181,480.086,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,480.086,483.884,"After -- I see, is that the -- well, I don't understand."
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,486.44,488.451,It's just a -- it's a common law practice.
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,495.143,497.873,Then why wasn't it followed in this case?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,497.873,504.58,"Well, because the case wasn't submitted to -- it wasn't -- the illegal aliens were already gone prior to the time that it went to the magistrate."
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,504.58,509.782,"In order to avoid the 10-day rule, you must ship them back before the magistrate complaint is filed, is that right?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,509.782,526.19,"Well, in a sense, yes, Your Honor because the problem is that given the state of the law in the Ninth Circuit, the magistrate's simply not in a position to release the illegal aliens unless we -- unless we can modify the Ninth Circuit's very strict ruling, it's very difficult to have a magistrate agree to release the illegal aliens even though there is no likelihood of --"
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,526.19,534.604,Would the Government's problem be solved if the Ninth Circuit rule were modified to require them to be kept safe for 24 hours or --?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,548.59,562.454,"Well, I suspect that -- I mean, obviously, the Government's position would be immaterially advanced by a 24-hour rule but I'm not sure that the decision as to how much time is one -- that is a -- you know, it's not an easy judgment to make and certainly, I wouldn't -- it's a --"
1981.81-450,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,562.454,562.733,Well --
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,562.733,564.054,-- close legislative judgment.
1981.81-450,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,564.19,575.9,"Apart from that, Mr. Phillips, I gather or perhaps I better put it as a question, do you think the -- they could have been released had counsel in fact been appointed before they were released?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,575.9,578.474,"Well, it might have been -- it would have been significantly more difficult."
1981.81-450,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,578.978,579.688,"Well -- no, I --"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,579.688,580.917,"Without consulting a counsel, you mean?"
1981.81-450,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,580.917,582.488,Yes.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,585.323,597.168,"No, I don't think so because it's still -- our submission is that there was no prejudice whatsoever and the -- and -- and even if there were some claim that we violated his right to counsel, you would still have to have a demonstration of prejudice."
1981.81-450,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,597.168,602.561,You mean there's no Messiah overtone after a counsel is appointed to whether or not you could -- may release them?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,602.561,605.753,"Well, you don't have there -- I mean I -- no, I don't think -- no, sir."
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,637.096,644.058,When did the respondent know that the witnesses were being set away?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,644.058,646.21,When did he learn that the witnesses had been sent away?
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,646.21,646.667,Uh-hmm.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,646.667,648.199,I suspect probably on the --
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,648.199,648.981,You suspect?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,650.038,653.018,"Well, I don't know exactly when they -- when he was informed."
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,653.018,656.069,"But if he'd had a lawyer you would know, wouldn't you?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,656.069,658.852,"Well, I assume his attorney was probably informed on the 31st."
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,658.852,674.012,"His attorney on the 31st, so neither the respondent nor his lawyer to be appointed had any opportunity to oppose the removal of the witnesses?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,674.012,676.511,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,676.511,679.939,What was happening to this third witness in the meantime?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,679.939,690.572,"He is being detained -- he was -- he was detained in custody as a material witness for the Government or -- and also for the defendant as it turns out -- I mean, for the respondent as it turns out he -- he did testify on behalf of the respondent."
1981.81-450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,690.572,692.536,Did he testify?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,692.536,692.856,"Yes, sir."
1981.81-450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,692.915,694.351,But he was called by --
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,694.351,695.22,He was called by the respondent.
1981.81-450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,695.22,696.092,-- the defendant.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,696.092,707.001,"And his statement was that he wasn't an illegal alien, that he had been in this country for less than two days at the time that the respondent transported him, that the respondent was the -- was the driver of the car."
1981.81-450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,715.024,718.467,Let me go back to my former question about whether there was a proffer.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,733.923,735.932,"No, Your Honor, none whatsoever."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,735.932,744.706,"Well, how would -- how would anybody have made that proffer if -- could never have a -- if there was no opportunity to chat with those witnesses?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,744.706,749.08,"Well, the circumstance -- I mean, the respondent had ample opportunity to chat with those witnesses, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,755.197,761.398,"Well, he was -- I think he was but his lawyer never had a chance to -- to talk with him, did he?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,761.398,766.693,"No, but his lawyer certainly had access to the respondent and to any information that the respondent has."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,766.693,774.103,"That may be so but the respondent probably didn't know what he was -- that A, he's going to charged or B, what he's going to be charged with --"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,774.103,774.536,"Well, even if --"
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.536,776.861,-- or what the elements of the crime were.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,776.861,793.94,"Well, even if respondent couldn't make an immediate judgment as to how to proceed in this matter, certainly sometime between the period or the time when he was arrested and the post arrest period all the way up until the time of the trial respondent had ample opportunity to explain to his attorney what possible defenses might be available and even to this day we still have nothing."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,793.94,803.082,That's hardly -- that's hardly equivalent to -- that's hardly equivalent to knowing what the witnesses would have said in response to questions from the lawyer.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,803.082,809.587,"Well, concededly it is somewhat different; although it is not -- I mean, this Court has never had any trouble in the Roviaro context in --"
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,809.587,819.563,Don't you -- your first submission as I understand it is that the Government should be relied on to decide whether a witness has anything relevant that might help the defendant.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,824.684,842.004,"Well, it's not that we're really -- I mean actually not, I mean if we were to take -- if we were to reason by analogy from United States versus Lovasco, it would seem to us that the rule ought to be that the United States simply in pursuing its policy with regard to immigration, should simply deport the illegal aliens."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,857.955,870.478,"Well, would you say that -- would you say that if you interviewed them and you thought there was something helpful to the defendant that you can nevertheless deport them?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,870.478,872.736,"Well, our assumption would be no."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.736,872.807,Why?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,872.807,873.219,There was reason to suspect --
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,873.219,873.668,Why?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,875.848,876.431,That's true.
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,877.676,879.862,Just deport them without talking to them.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,879.862,895.755,"Well, that's exactly what the Court's sanctioned in United States versus Rose but we're not asking this Court to adapt that view although as I said it would certainly -- it would certainly further our immigration policies if the Court order were to adapt that view, but we're prepared to give the respondent perhaps more protection than he otherwise might require."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,895.755,898.407,You already talked to them because you want to get a witness for yourself.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,898.407,899.596,I'm sorry?
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,899.596,906.311,You -- you interviewed the -- you interviewed the people because you need witnesses yourself.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,906.311,919.668,Admittedly we do but we also in the process of interviewing a witness on our -- in order to determine whether there is any inculpatory evidence we necessarily discover whether there's any exculpatory evidence.
1981.81-450,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,919.668,931.075,"Counsel, what is the Government's main concern, saving the -- the cost involved in maintaining these witnesses in jail over a long period of time or what?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,931.075,951.241,"Well, I mean, certainly the cost is a significant factor but I think the idea of -- of having illegal aliens languishing in jail for a period of time when no one has any intention of calling them as witnesses either the Government or the defendant and no one has -- you know, and they're not going to serve any useful function to anybody, I think that's the primary interest to the Federal Government in these cases."
1981.81-450,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,968.2,975.265,What about the various alternatives suggested by the respondents that might alleviate the problem?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,975.265,980.806,"Well, our submission is that none of those -- that none of those alternatives is very useful."
1981.81-450,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,987.21,993.431,"Well, how about an early interview at which defense counsel has an opportunity to be present --"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,993.431,993.665,"Well, the --"
1981.81-450,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,993.665,994.74,-- before release?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,994.74,1002.118,"The difficulty with that, with the idea of an early interview is one, it's difficult just to get -- get counsel appointed."
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1038.117,1038.161,What the --
1981.81-450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1038.161,1040.845,What do you mean as leverage for a plea bargain?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1040.845,1047.377,"Well, the -- I mean if -- it is absolutely true that the Government can only hold so many material witnesses."
1981.81-450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1060.521,1061.769,Under the rule of the Ninth Circuit?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1061.769,1063.147,"Under the rule of the Ninth Circuit, Your Honor, yes."
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1063.147,1073.785,"Mr. Phillips, on the proffer point that was raised by the Chief Justice, what is this stipulation on page 22 of the joint appendix?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1073.785,1082.994,"That was a stipulation offered by the Assistant United States Attorney, Your Honor, that we were willing to -- we were willing to stipulate that the illegal aliens --"
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1082.994,1084.708,But this wasn't agreed to?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1084.708,1085.169,"No, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1094.021,1098.642,"But it says, “It is hereby ordered that the substance of paragraphs belongs to--”"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1098.642,1100.496,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1111.243,1112.73,But that -- it --
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1112.73,1115.458,"That was agreed to, yes, that's why there wasn't a trial in this case."
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1115.458,1118.083,"Well, does this excuse the proffer or not?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1118.083,1118.564,"No, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1121.601,1122.472,That's my point.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1122.472,1124.208,I'm sorry.
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.208,1125.926,What were you referring to?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1125.926,1142.025,I was just -- referring to the offer to stipulate on the part of the Government that the illegal aliens who had been deported would not testify -- would not have testified that they had told the respondent that they were illegal aliens and have been in this country for more than three years.
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1153.274,1155.527,There was no response and no counter offer.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1159.342,1164.68,"No, nothing at all was said at all on that point, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1164.68,1172.822,It's awfully difficult for me to imagine how a lawyer who never talked to the people could proffer anything.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1172.822,1175.58,"Well, Your Honor, he has -- he still has access to the respondent."
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1194.792,1200.099,I'm not talking about the respondent; I'm talking about the lawyer.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1200.099,1203.205,"Well, the lawyer has access to the respondent."
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1203.496,1207.951,He might not know what the important point is.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1212.788,1214.416,"Certainly, Your Honor, and that's why his attorney can --"
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1214.416,1219.712,"I get back to the point, why couldn't he have -- around for one day?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1219.712,1222.754,"Well, because one day wouldn't have gained us anything, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1224.854,1226.972,It would have allowed the lawyer to talk to him.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1229.08,1229.216,No.
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1231.567,1235.321,It would allow the lawyer to talk to the witnesses.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1235.321,1243.273,"So, I mean, -- well, it wouldn't have allowed the lawyer to make any kind of a reasonable conversation with the witnesses because they had no opportunity to investigate the matter."
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1243.273,1248.567,The great thing was could -- it would -- I didn't have to ask the question.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1257.823,1262.58,"Well, he could have talked to them but I'm not sure that anything meaningful would have come from that conversation, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1262.58,1264.681,"Well, you never are but couldn't he have asked him a few questions?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1276.44,1276.659,No.
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1276.721,1283.322,Is it possible the lawyer could have found out something by direct conversation that he could not have found out through his client?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1283.322,1285.395,You mean as to their illegal alien status?
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1294.766,1299.153,Could the Government have deported him?
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1299.153,1301.694,You mean aside from the Fifth and Sixth Amendment problems?
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1301.694,1306.523,"Well, no, under your view of this case, would it have been permissible for the Government to deport him as well as all the other passengers?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1306.523,1316.296,"Well, it would have been -- the problem that that would have created is we would have a no -- we would have lacked a non-hearsay basis for proving some of the elements and perhaps created a Confrontation Clause problem."
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1316.296,1326.018,"Assume you had a statement that you thought was sufficient from the driver himself plus the testimony of the two agents who arrested the -- arrested them, that might have made out a sufficient case, just assume."
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1336.434,1336.898,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1339.918,1343.109,"And the question we have to decide, would that have been consistent with the Constitution?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1344.02,1347.033,"Sure, but there was still -- and you have to analyze it in two different grounds."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1379.538,1382.11,"Well, it wouldn't hurt you much then if you lost this case."
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1382.11,1383.06,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1383.06,1389.349,It wouldn't hurt you much then if you lost this case in the sense that the next case where the tape recorded statement would be different.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1389.349,1397.416,"Well, if you were prepared -- if the Court were to hold that it is abundantly clear that if we had that statement in hand, we can go ahead and deport the illegal aliens."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.15,1460.716,"Mr. Phillips, suppose it were perfectly clear that a counsel would always be appointed in the vast majority of instances within 24 hours after arrest or 48 hours after arrest."
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1471.258,1472.735,"Well, that's not altogether clear, your Honor."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1479.142,1481.967,"Well, I --"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1481.967,1487.13,Or what if they interpose an objection is the problem.
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1488.946,1505.891,"You would be in no different position than you would be if -- if somehow this alien, this defendant had a -- had a lawyer within the room when he was arrested and he went around and he subpoenaed all these witnesses."
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1507.894,1516.277,"Well, if he asked -- if he -- well, no, obviously, if he had a subpoena in hand, we might try to fight the subpoena."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.277,1518.903,That's just one of those -- one of those problems about what the Government does.
1981.81-450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1518.903,1523.022,"Well, does a subpoena protect you from deporting him?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1523.022,1527.069,"Well, I think if -- I guess a subpoena doesn't actually act against the Government."
1981.81-450,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1530.396,1535.485,"You might -- consequences might attach to your deportation of him, but I wouldn't think that --"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1535.485,1536.033,"No, that's true."
1981.81-450,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1538.465,1540.39,"But you wouldn't deport him, I don't suppose."
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1541.11,1542.37,I suspect we would not.
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1543.022,1554.377,"I don't understand why under a 24-hour rule, you would be precluded from deporting them after they've been interviewed because the burden would remain on the defendant to make a showing that their testimony would have been material, I would suppose."
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1554.377,1555.869,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I missed that --"
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1555.869,1578.249,"You seem to assume that if there were a 24-hour rule where you would just -- somehow there'd be a counsel appointed immediately then they interview, you seem to be assuming you could not then immediately deport if you're satisfied they have nothing material to present because then I would suppose if you did deport, the lawyer having interviewed the -- the person would be in a position to make a showing if he could that there was some material --"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1578.249,1591.854,"Well, but I guess -- I guess our response to that is I don't see that there's any significant difference between what we've done here because I don't think that the -- the appointment of a counsel in this situation would have materially altered the ultimate findings of the District Court that should have been upheld by the Court of Appeals."
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1591.854,1597.883,"Well, that's if you assume that the prosecutor should be the one who does the investigating for defense counsel on the facts."
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1597.883,1602.39,"Well, it's only -- but it's only that the -- that the Government makes the initial determination."
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1602.39,1602.923,"Well, I know but it's a determination that --"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1602.923,1604.143,"And then subsequently, that's subject to review."
1981.81-450,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1604.143,1608.495,-- totally forecloses the opportunity for the defense counsel to -- to investigate.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1608.495,1614.582,But that -- I mean I guess our response to that is that there -- it's just not simply realistic to say that they cannot know.
1981.81-450,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1640.211,1645.402,"You mean that on the day of the hearing, they couldn't have talked to these witnesses if they were there?"
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1645.402,1648.382,"No, of course they could have talked to them if they had been there, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1648.382,1651.267,That's what you meant then.
1981.81-450,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1651.267,1657.393,I will reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.
1981.81-450,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1657.393,1662.136,Mr. Iredale?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1662.136,1669.474,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I'd like to address four of the issues in this case."
1981.81-450,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1708.033,1711.0,"Well, the -- the Fifth is a little different, isn't it?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1711.0,1716.919,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, as we talk about that in the brief, the original decision was Avila-Dominguez."
1981.81-450,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1749.484,1752.235,That strikes me as out of line with the Ninth Circuit's approach.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1752.235,1753.706,"Well, whether you call it --"
1981.81-450,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1753.706,1758.038,I'm just objecting to your saying that this Circuit has followed the Ninth.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1758.038,1771.453,"I -- I should say that with the exception -- to our mind, the difference between the terms plausible theory or some slight suggestion and the Ninth Circuit formulation of conceivable benefit is a matter of semantics."
1981.81-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1797.09,1807.452,"Mr. Iredale, before you go on to that section, am I correct in thinking that the Ninth Circuit did not require the defendant to make any sort of a showing here before it dismissed the indictment?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1807.452,1808.386,"No, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1815.654,1817.178,What did the defendant show here?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1817.178,1820.477,"In the District Court, the defendant submitted an exhibit."
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1885.947,1888.578,Could you have taken their testimony by deposition?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1888.578,1889.141,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1890.393,1891.393,No.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1892.356,1893.803,In Mexico?
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1893.803,1897.777,What -- what could prevent you from taking that except the dollars?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1897.777,1901.251,"Dollars and the logistical difficulty, otherwise, I believe --"
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1901.251,1909.32,"And in terms of distance from where you were operating, how far were these witnesses away?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1909.32,1916.07,I may be wrong but I think that Jalisco was about 800 to 1000 miles away and the other witness was in another province.
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1916.07,1918.413,And they put them pretty far down in Southern Mexico.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1918.413,1919.502,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1921.963,1922.963,Is that in the record?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1924.755,1929.412,It is because the exhibit was introduced as an exhibit.
1981.81-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1943.471,1956.692,I understand your statement as to what the defendants showed here were simply letters to the missing witnesses saying that it would be very desirable to interview them on certain points.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1958.341,1972.655,"No, Your Honor, there was also a statement in argument by counsel that we wanted the witnesses because we felt that they could possibly testify in such a way as he might be found not guilty of a crime of knowingly transporting aliens."
1981.81-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2014.083,2016.405,"Relevant, one where it would have helped the Government."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2017.279,2020.997,"Yes, and because we didn't have the witnesses, we'll never be able to know for sure."
1981.81-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2020.997,2031.926,"Well, couldn't the defendant himself have made some sort of an affidavit or proffer if in fact he hadn't talked to any of the deported witnesses in the car?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2031.926,2038.191,"Well, there are several reasons why that would not be, I would suggest, an appropriate procedure."
1981.81-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2047.509,2055.193,"Well, but after that, I mean you're now at the hearing stages, talked to his lawyer and presumably has a much better idea from his lawyer than he would have had on his own."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2055.193,2057.773,He has the Fifth Amendment right not to testify.
1981.81-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2057.976,2065.761,"Sure, he has other kinds of rights that if he doesn't testify, he may not help himself."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2065.761,2066.835,"I understand that, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.617,2090.846,"Well, presumably if he swears to something and says, “I didn't talk to these witnesses while they're in the car.”"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2103.733,2110.111,"Well, Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit and none of the other Circuits have ever made a requirement that the defendant himself make a showing."
1981.81-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2110.216,2112.291,"Well, we're reviewing the Ninth Circuit here."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2112.291,2113.341,"Yes, I understand."
1981.81-450,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2131.466,2131.668,Mister --
1981.81-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2131.668,2134.41,All counsel could do is tell what the elements of the offense are.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2139.576,2142.683,"He may or may not depending on the facts of the case, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2142.683,2159.706,"Mr. Iredale, could the defendant not testify for purposes of the hearing only and preserve his right not to testify at trial and not have it used against him as much as we would have happen at other pretrial hearings?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2159.706,2160.37,Yes.
1981.81-450,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2167.154,2169.03,That has not been tested to your knowledge.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2169.03,2170.638,It has never been raised.
1981.81-450,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2177.767,2180.489,"But certainly, that would be one possibility, would it not?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2180.489,2181.918,"As to the showing, as to the showing --"
1981.81-450,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2181.918,2184.493,"For the showing of possible prejudice, wouldn't that be a possibility?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2184.493,2190.779,I think it could be except that it would trench on the defendant's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2242.249,2246.36,What was the testimony of the one who went -- and so did remain?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2246.36,2255.675,"The testimony in that regard, Your Honor, was that he did not enter with Mr. Valenzuela; that he met Mr. Valenzuela at a house in Escondido, which is some 50 miles north of the border."
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2255.675,2258.775,How could he -- did he justify how long he had been in the country?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2258.775,2259.291,Yes.
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2272.707,2278.298,What did he testified to as to communicating that information to this respondent?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2278.298,2282.436,"He denied any communication whatsoever, one way or the other."
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2325.702,2329.459,"What the -- what was the defendant charged with, transporting whom?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2329.459,2334.176,"He was charged with transporting Romero-Morales, the one witness who remained."
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.176,2342.168,"And so, whether he knew anything about Morales, Morales was available to testify?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2342.168,2344.855,"That was my point, Justice White."
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.17,2360.651,Let's -- let's suppose that defendant knew what -- about this particular witness.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2360.651,2361.492,Yes.
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2361.492,2367.626,That he was not only an alien but that he hadn't -- that he had just been in the country for two days.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2369.746,2370.609,Correct.
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2370.609,2374.071,No matter what the other witnesses might have said about them.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2374.071,2377.533,"About their own particular status, that's correct."
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2391.208,2397.232,And the -- the witness who was there said he didn't say anything to the defendant?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2397.874,2399.051,Correct.
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.717,2401.777,As to how long he had been there or --
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2401.777,2402.205,Yes.
1981.81-450,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2406.994,2409.307,Did he -- did he saying anything --
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2409.307,2409.675,He denies --
1981.81-450,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2409.675,2412.268,-- that he quotes either the two who had been deported?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2412.268,2413.128,"No, sir."
1981.81-450,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2414.201,2417.397,Was he asked any questions about that?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2417.397,2418.343,I'm not sure.
1981.81-450,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2429.454,2435.799,"Was there any question -- well, did you -- did the driver have any conversation with the two deported aliens?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2435.799,2436.643,I'm not sure if that question was put or not.
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2436.643,2443.291,"Well, how about on cross-examination of that witness?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2445.276,2447.329,We called him as a witness at the motion to dismiss.
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.329,2463.059,"Well, if you don't want him to see -- if you would have asked him that the other witnesses or the other aliens or whoever they were -- however you might want to call them, did the other aliens have any conversations with the driver?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2467.678,2468.663,"Yes, what was that conversation?"
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.663,2470.419,"Then you could have said, “Well, what was the conversation?”"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2470.419,2472.475,"Yes, but the -- the point is that --"
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.475,2484.076,So you didn't -- you didn't even take this opportunity to demonstrate that there might have been some help from the testimony of these other witnesses?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2484.076,2484.541,"Well, the --"
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2484.541,2496.031,"Because if he would have said, “No, they didn't say a word to the driver,” you might -- there isn't much use those witnesses would have been to --"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2496.031,2498.809,"Well, they could have -- they could have been of help in another way."
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2517.249,2521.888,"Well, I know, but the question is about Romero, and not them."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2521.888,2526.254,It's the question is whether those witnesses could help with respect to the charge --
1981.81-450,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2526.254,2548.508,"Well, I gather what you said earlier, Mr. Iredale, was that one of them might have said in the hearing in presence of the driver and this (Inaudible), might have said -- up in the great country three years ago and even though he denied that they had said anything, they might have come and testified that they did indeed say something."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2555.112,2555.249,Absolutely.
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2555.249,2559.933,"But they would have had to be saying something about Romero, not about them."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2559.933,2564.139,Or something that the defendant could have inferred related to Romero --
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.139,2565.31,That's what I was saying.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2565.31,2568.578,-- or to the group of them because --
1981.81-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2568.578,2588.79,"If he had said -- he had said any of those things to the respondent in this case, the respondent could have told his lawyer and his lawyer could have made a proffer that this witness would say -- that I talked about up in the great country."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2594.03,2605.41,"Given the rule of law, as it exists and the fact that any such requirement may well trench on the defendant's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, I would submit that --"
1981.81-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2605.41,2607.687,This is not the defendant testifying.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2609.76,2613.157,A proffer through counsel when such a proffer was made.
1981.81-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2613.864,2616.325,The proffer was made about picking the grapes?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2616.325,2617.855,"No, no."
1981.81-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2618.133,2621.159,I'm talking about something specific that you're not talking about.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2621.159,2622.995,No.
1981.81-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2624.181,2637.917,"If -- if these witnesses had said anything in that car that would have helped him, he could have told the lawyer and the lawyer could have made a proffer."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2642.467,2648.278,"Well, Your Honor, assuming that Valenzuela remembered accurately what happened, and assuming that he trusted his lawyer --"
1981.81-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2648.278,2659.948,"Well, I would assume that if a man's on the trial for his liberty, remembers, and if he doesn't remember, God help him."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2659.948,2663.645,"And if the witnesses aren't there to help him, God help him."
1981.81-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2663.645,2668.377,"No, but I mean, what are these witnesses going to testify to?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2672.307,2673.111,That's the problem.
1981.81-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2675.287,2678.266,What did your client tell you?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2678.266,2679.696,I wasn't the lawyer in the court below.
1981.81-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2679.696,2683.54,"Well, what did the client tell his lawyer?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2683.54,2685.294,"I don't know, Justice Marshall."
1981.81-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2685.294,2687.694,So how can we do any business?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2689.987,2691.361,Because the witnesses aren't there.
1981.81-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2696.355,2701.25,All you did was write to these two Mexicans letters in English.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2702.565,2705.654,"They were translated in Spanish, Justice Marshall, and the Spanish was sent to them."
1981.81-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2705.654,2706.673,Spanish?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2706.673,2708.242,Yes.
1981.81-450,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2715.356,2718.896,Do you think that discharged all your responsibility?
1981.81-450,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.896,2729.173,I must confess that I still find some difficulty in understanding what their testimony could have done to help the particular case even if they had said they had been in the great vineyards four years ago.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2732.289,2732.501,No --
1981.81-450,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2732.501,2734.358,"And they took off, there was flight here."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2737.969,2743.628,"I agree, but the issue is not what in the light most favorable to the Government, the evidence would --"
1981.81-450,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2743.628,2748.522,"Well, I think that in the light most favorable to the defendant, I don't really know what these other passengers could have done."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2748.522,2748.917,Well it --
1981.81-450,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2748.917,2754.814,It would have belied the testimony of the one man who was admittedly just had entered the day before.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2754.814,2762.695,"Well, what Valenzuela could have argued through his counsel to a jury is, sure, he knew they were illegally here, he knew he was illegally here, but there was no basis for him knowing."
1981.81-450,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2762.695,2767.165,"That he's been hiding in this place for four years, is that the idea?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2774.066,2782.519,"Well, many of the people who are illegally in California go from Southern California where they work up to the North and they have to get through the checkpoint."
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2803.531,2826.134,"Mr. Iredale, suppose the respondents here had been driving on the van with 30 aliens and 29 of them are released and there is evidence to support a conclusion -- a reasonable conclusion by a jury that one of them was knowingly transported."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2831.566,2833.73,I would say it would depend on the facts of the particular case.
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2833.73,2841.753,"Well, let me read you his testimony when they asked him why he fled at the checkpoint."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2857.926,2864.307,That he -- it could be argued first of all that he had some knowledge of their illegal status in the United States.
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2864.307,2866.185,You say it could be argued.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2866.185,2867.317,But was argued --
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2867.317,2868.036,No.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2868.036,2868.286,-- by the Government.
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2868.286,2871.74,And could a reasonable jury conclude --
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2871.74,2874.94,That they were illegal -- that he knew they were illegally in the United States?
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2876.561,2877.664,"No, no."
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2877.664,2879.173,But that doesn't -- that would not --
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2879.173,2881.3,But that didn't go to the three-year element.
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2881.3,2887.123,"Well, even if -- if you lose this case, I take it the conviction still would have to be reviewed in the Ninth Circuit."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2887.123,2888.046,"No, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.046,2889.953,Why?
1981.81-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2889.953,2892.403,There was no trial.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2892.403,2894.851,"No, he was convicted in the court below."
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2894.851,2895.088,"Yes, exactly."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2895.088,2899.156,"He was convicted in the court below, the Ninth Circuit reversed the conviction in this Court --"
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2899.156,2899.454,What do you mean?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2904.615,2905.256,That's correct.
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2905.256,2911.452,"But if we set that aside, I take it your appeal would be reinstated in the -- in the Court of Appeals."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2914.473,2918.162,There was no issue raised as to that.
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2918.917,2925.293,(Voice Overlap) But you're telling us it was the Government's proof that's absolutely deficient on -- on the knowledge with respect to the three years.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2925.293,2926.857,That was not argued in the Court of Appeals.
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2929.545,2939.452,"Well, which again -- let me come back to what do you -- what's your version of what he meant when he said, “I already knew that I had had it”?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2940.716,2942.186,He knew he was going to be arrested.
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2946.724,2948.34,In his car.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2948.34,2948.956,"But, he supposed --"
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2948.956,2952.307,Doesn't that go to his knowledge that this were at least --
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2952.307,2952.48,Yes.
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2952.48,2954.422,-- at least one illegal alien?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2954.422,2957.153,But the statute has two mandatory of requirements.
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2968.607,2976.722,"But then, as Justice White has asked you, why isn't that open for a review when the Ninth Circuit never reached that issue, it never considered it?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2976.722,2984.872,It -- it was never raised because we felt the Mendez-Rodriguez issue was absolutely all in our favor and we wanted to raise that issue only.
1981.81-450,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2984.872,2989.478,Do you think you're foreclosed on a remand if you lose this case?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2989.478,2990.741,I would hope not.
1981.81-450,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3086.971,3088.742,"Well, what kind of a showing must he make?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3095.748,3097.172,That's -- that's insufficient.
1981.81-450,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3102.008,3103.376,"Well, what is the standard of that hearing then?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3103.376,3115.876,"The standard -- the defendant must be able to show that the witness could offer relevant, material and exculpatory evidence that would not otherwise be obtainable from the witnesses that the Government is keeping."
1981.81-450,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3123.804,3127.265,And does he say at that hearing what the exculpatory evidence would be?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3127.265,3127.79,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3154.712,3169.959,"What if the -- what if the defendant objects to an action of the magistrate in discharging a particular witness or group of witnesses, I take it he can preserve that point and object at trial and conceivably either have the indictment thrown out or the Court of Appeals reverses it."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3169.959,3171.403,"Justice Rehnquist, that's correct."
1981.81-450,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3200.918,3210.484,"But there's nothing final about the magistrate's decision either, I take it, the defendant there can pursue the question into the District Court or the Court of Appeals, if he wanted."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3210.484,3215.622,"That's absolutely correct, but the witnesses ordered release at that time, if the magistrates still hold --"
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3215.622,3216.68,Can I -- Can I ask you?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3251.306,3253.27,"That's exactly right, and that would properly be held."
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3262.154,3279.593,"So if the Government -- if the Government made the witnesses available to a defense counsel even for a day and if he actually interviewed them, the Government -- if it was confident enough -- could just deport them if he -- if he -- they were sure you couldn't make the showing."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3279.593,3286.233,"Let me just say I hesitated the formulation of a day because depending on the facts of the case, a reasonable time might be necessary."
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3290.43,3290.844,All right.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3293.842,3297.304,"A reasonable time, given the reasonable time and adequate opportunity to know what the Government is going to charge."
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.304,3300.441,"Actually, my example was that you actually had interviewed."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3300.441,3301.113,Yes.
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3301.113,3309.93,"If you had actually interviewed and then the Government took the risk of deporting them, you would have to then make the showing that you -- district showing at the hearing."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3309.93,3311.805,Assuming a reasonable opportunity for investigation --
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3311.805,3313.753,"Well, I said actually you do."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3313.753,3314.509,Absolutely.
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.104,3321.849,"All right, you hadn't interviewed but you had had a reasonable time to interview."
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3321.849,3322.87,Yes.
1981.81-450,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3322.87,3327.766,Suppose you hadn't interviewed but you had had a reasonable time to do so and had neglected it.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3327.766,3329.762,Then it's waiver.
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3329.762,3336.068,You suggested that there's no reason why the Government should keep all these witnesses in the country.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3360.781,3366.514,"Either -- for a brief period of time, yes.For a reasonable period of time, three, four, five days."
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3366.514,3367.861,All 30 of them?
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3367.861,3370.574,Yes.
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3375.448,3386.656,Then what you're suggesting is it isn't enough if the Government sustains the burden of proof and assumes -- it sustains the reasonable burden of proof that one of them was there illegally.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3386.656,3409.329,"In Washington versus Texas, this Court hold -- held that the Government violates compulsory process when it makes unavailable to the defense or prevents from testifying a witness who is an eye witness to an event and who is physically and mentally able to testify about events which he personally witnessed which are relevant to the defense."
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3409.329,3413.902,"But the only issue is the -- the -- the knowing aspect, isn't it?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3419.054,3422.7,"Mr. Justice Burger, this case isn't a typical case."
1981.81-450,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3438.915,3450.921,"It would have been a better case if Morales or whatever his name was when he was put on the stand had said, “Yes, I told the defendant that I had been -- that I was an illegal alien and that I had been here for only two days.”"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3450.921,3452.727,"From the Government's point of view, it would have been a very good case."
1981.81-450,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3452.727,3456.939,"But suppose he had to testify that way, would you be here then?"
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3456.939,3460.778,"Yes, because those other witnesses could have testified that Morales --"
1981.81-450,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3460.778,3462.911,That Morales really didn't know what he was talking about.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3462.911,3463.937,"No, that he was lying."
1981.81-450,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3483.632,3487.907,Because he might -- he might be lying because he's getting a break from the Government.
1981.81-450,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,3487.907,3495.672,"All of these witnesses are subject to prosecution, and all of them are interviewed initially by the Border Patrol."
1981.81-450,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3496.458,3498.591,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Phillips?"
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3498.591,3502.293,"Just a few remarks, Mr. Chief Justice."
1981.81-450,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3514.601,3515.399,How did he answer?
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3515.399,3518.174,"No, both in terms of the car and then at the house prior to --"
1981.81-450,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3518.174,3519.135,But you didn't hear him.
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3521.339,3527.021,"Did -- he just said he didn't hear any statements made, but he was in their presence and if you're inside a car and they were together in the same room of the house --"
1981.81-450,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3527.021,3528.968,You said that was page 44?
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3528.968,3532.951,"Yes, Your Honor, at the bottom."
1981.81-450,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3558.512,3573.02,"On that point, Mr. Phillips, that -- that page 30 of the read brief, they give some figures about the number of cases and they say there were only 11 Mendez-Rodriguez motions filed in a total of 239 cases and only one motion was granted."
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3575.442,3588.343,"We -- we did not independently evaluate that; although, we wouldn't be terribly surprised if there aren't a lot of Mendez-Rodriguez cases in light of the fact that the Government's practice is typically to detain all illegal aliens and/or to dismiss the charges."
1981.81-450,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3591.709,3594.445,I'm assuming this case is an atypical case then.
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3596.486,3600.205,"In this case, the Government tested the theory of how much prejudice has to be demonstrated."
1981.81-450,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3600.682,3601.832,I see.
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3601.832,3603.044,With regard to a couple of points made --
1981.81-450,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3603.044,3604.023,May I ask one other question?
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3607.574,3610.79,"Well, it varies from one day to 120 days, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3610.79,3613.863,But do we don't -- we don't have any notion of what the average period is?
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3613.863,3619.524,"Well, the average according to the marshall is something in excess of five days per person."
1981.81-450,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3619.524,3630.543,"I -- I believe counsel that counsel for the respondent indicated that even if the Government won this decision, it wouldn't alter the number of witnesses retained."
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3630.543,3634.114,"Yes, I don't know where -- I don't understand how the respondent can make that claim."
1981.81-450,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3651.328,3661.706,How about the suggestion that the witnesses be retained for simply long enough to let defense counsel interview them and then let the Government deport at its peril?
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3661.706,3667.953,"I mean, that sounds good in theory, Your Honor, but the reality is that we simply can't get defense counsel there and ready to go contrary to what respondents suggest."
1981.81-450,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3667.953,3674.155,"Well, but if an opportunity were provided and they didn't take advantage of it, I suppose that's too bad."
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3674.155,3675.189,"That may, well -- yes, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3681.213,3683.071,"All right, but let's suppose there are."
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3689.67,3700.207,"Well, if -- if we thought it would work and then we could in fact deport at our peril and given them two days, I just think we're going to have trouble if that -- having that enforced in the Ninth Circuit."
1981.81-450,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3700.207,3704.087,"Well, you're certainly acting at your peril now."
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3724.017,3724.392,Ultimately that's --
1981.81-450,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3724.392,3726.186,That's your first submission.
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3726.186,3726.938,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3731.704,3734.731,"Have you ever had the Court agree with you on that, that first position?"
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3734.731,3735.382,Yes.
1981.81-450,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3735.382,3736.336,Who?
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3736.336,3743.652,"The Ninth Circuit holds that if we make a determination, that there is no connection in -- in time or space between the illegal alien and a criminal defendant, then we can --"
1981.81-450,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3743.652,3757.812,"No one has ever -- you say on the facts of this case, if you make a good faith judgment that even though they were present on the spot, that they would have no evidence, that's the end of the matter no matter what kind of a showing the other side is."
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3757.812,3763.503,"Sure, what we're suggesting though is that there is not a demonstrable difference -- yes, that is our submission but that's not demonstrably different from the judgment --"
1981.81-450,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3763.503,3766.081,"Suppose we rejected that, what's your next fallback?"
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3766.081,3777.05,Is that -- is that respondent under any circumstances must demonstrate with some concreteness the materiality of the witnesses that were lost which they cannot do in this case.
1981.81-450,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3777.05,3781.775,And -- and is -- is that rule extended in any circuit that you know of?
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3781.775,3782.397,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3783.574,3785.775,Do you think that's the rule the Fifth Circuit adapts?
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3785.775,3797.117,"I think so, Your Honor, because in the Avila-Dominguez case, those -- those witnesses were witnesses to the crime at the time they were arrested and the Court held that they could be -- that they could be sent away."
1981.81-450,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3797.117,3807.103,"So you -- so, if you would be acting at your peril in deporting witnesses under the Fifth Circuit rule?"
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3807.103,3814.385,"Certainly, to the extent there is a review, but -- I mean we don't -- we don't, you know wither from the notion that there'll be judicial review of our determination."
1981.81-450,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3815.449,3819.076,"Do you regularly take that risk in the Fifth Circuit now, or do you hold everybody?"
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3819.076,3821.258,"No, we regularly take that risk, Your Honor."
1981.81-450,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3821.258,3822.631,In the -- under the Fifth Circuit rule?
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3822.631,3828.51,"Yes, once we make an evaluation and if we think there is no material exculpatory evidence, we will deport."
1981.81-450,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3829.597,3836.086,"Because the rule is not that different from the Ninth Circuit rule, you don't think it's so strict that you can't take that risk."
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3836.086,3838.663,"Well, I mean, it's not my decision to take that risk but the --"
1981.81-450,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3838.663,3839.894,"Well, it's somebody's decision."
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3839.894,3852.255,"That's true, the Border Patrol agents and the Fifth Circuit have on occasion released illegal aliens especially in circumstances such like the (Inaudible) position -- situation where you have a large number of illegal aliens all of whom seem to say the same thing."
1981.81-450,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3854.457,3877.092,"My question -- my question really is that if you are -- if you don't -- if we do not agree with your first submission, would the Government regularly -- and I suppose you had to operate under the Fifth Circuit rule -- would the Government regularly release a lot of witnesses that it would not release under the Ninth Circuit rule?"
1981.81-450,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3877.092,3892.374,"Well then, there would certainly be some instances where there is clear inculpatory statements made by the -- by the defendant at the time of his arrest and where all other statements that are sworn by the illegal aliens are cumulative, we will almost assuredly release some illegal aliens."
1981.81-450,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3892.374,3893.119,"Thank you, gentlemen."
