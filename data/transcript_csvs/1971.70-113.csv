1971.70-113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,25.703,"We will hear arguments next in Number 113, Ford Motor Company against the United States."
1971.70-113,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,27.215,29.007,May it please the Court.
1971.70-113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,458.945,460.444,What was the Champion figure?
1971.70-113,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,460.444,465.439,The Champion figure originally was 50% at the time of the acquisition.
1971.70-113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,465.439,466.568,In 1961?
1971.70-113,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,466.568,476.934,"Yes, 1960-1961, just before the acquisition and Ford’s was 30 and Autolite was about 15."
1971.70-113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,776.669,779.848,"Well, the customer does not really choose either?"
1971.70-113,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,783.178,784.498,That is right.
1971.70-113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,890.732,896.51,"Up to the time of this acquisition, all General Motor car -- General Motors cars had AC plug?"
1971.70-113,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,896.51,897.109,That is right.
1971.70-113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,897.109,898.659,Is that correct?
1971.70-113,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,902.323,903.084,That is right.
1971.70-113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,903.084,906.594,And all Chrysler cars had Electra and the Autolite plugs?
1971.70-113,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,906.594,907.849,After 1936.
1971.70-113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,910.839,914.571,"Right, but from 1936 until the time of its acquisition, is that correct?"
1971.70-113,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,914.571,916.006,That is right.
1971.70-113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,916.006,933.886,"And then if as you tell us it was the habit or practice of mechanics to install as replacement plugs, the original equipment plugs, why would they have stocked all three just in the ordinary course of business because of the so-called big three automobiles?"
1971.70-113,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,933.886,944.491,"Well, generally speaking there are perhaps two reasons as far as the Autolite plug and the Ford Champion plug to take that first."
1971.70-113,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1034.181,1046.925,Did I read somewhere in the record that there have been testimony to the effect that most of the filling stations did not appear to want to carry more than two different brands?
1971.70-113,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,1046.925,1053.599,That was so for a long time and the business are trying to get them to carry three took a lot of effort and that is what went off.
1971.70-113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1414.86,1425.328,Did any of the -- was AC -- are AC plugs manufactured by General Motors or are they manufactured by a company that (Voice Overlap)
1971.70-113,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,1425.328,1430.758,"No, I believe and in fact I believe they are manufactured by General Motors at one of its divisions."
1971.70-113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1430.758,1435.743,And it was the only one of the so-called big three then that did manufacture its own plug?
1971.70-113,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,1435.743,1437.348,"Yes, yes."
1971.70-113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1440.502,1441.668,After its acquisition?
1971.70-113,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,1441.668,1447.715,"Now, I want to move along, I have spent more time over the industry than I intended to."
1971.70-113,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1720.197,1725.676,"Eltra does not supply, it does not supply any original equipment, does it?"
1971.70-113,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,1725.676,1729.035,"No, as far as I know."
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2062.85,2066.128,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-113,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2180.996,2183.722,"And in order to do that, you have to sell way below cost?"
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2183.722,2185.853,You have to sell way below cost.
1971.70-113,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2216.219,2233.105,"Mr. Friedman, do you agree with Mr. Seymour that as a result of the acquisition in 1961, the giants are less big and the lesser companies are bigger and have a greater share of the total market?"
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2233.105,2235.726,We do not agree as he characterizes it.
1971.70-113,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2339.253,2341.029,Who is at the top of the market now?
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2341.029,2342.737,Still Champion.
1971.70-113,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2342.737,2348.082,But do they not have to try harder as a result of this to hold their position?
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2348.082,2350.037,"Well, they may have to try it."
1971.70-113,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2394.146,2397.125,Is price the only area of competition or --?
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2397.125,2412.405,"Price is not the only area of competition Mr. Chief Justice, but one of the characteristics of an oligopolistic market is the absence of price competition and price competition is in the sense the ultimate of competition."
1971.70-113,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2442.732,2452.496,"Mr. Friedman, do you have any comment, perhaps it is not the case as to the very advantageous position with GM occupies here?"
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2455.172,2482.421,I do not think there is anything Mr. Justice that can be done about it here except I think the fact that GM has in effect tied up such a large share of the market because of its own manufacturing of plugs is an important consideration as to why it is significant and vital to preserve the other forces in the market that tend to be competitive.
1971.70-113,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2483.572,2487.553,But this is more of comfort to Ford I suppose?
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2487.553,2514.586,"That may be Mr. Justice, on the other hand the fact that General Motors is now engaged in the manufacture of its own spark plugs is no reason why Ford should be permitted to do the same thing whereas we believe and I will come to this in a minute now, you think the effect of Ford’s acquisition of the Autolite Company and going into the manufacture has definite and are competitive consequence."
1971.70-113,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2514.586,2520.07,(Inaudible) would not object before taking the time to develop it internally I take it?
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2520.07,2525.89,That is correct because Section 7 Mr. Justice speaks of acquisition.
1971.70-113,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2528.987,2531.476,Exact point under this decree?
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2531.476,2544.089,"Under this decree and as I will cover, and the reason for that Mr. Justice is that Ford is this prohibited from manufacturing for 10 years in order to give the divested company the opportunity to get on its feet again."
1971.70-113,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2669.433,2671.952,I take it the new company means the so-called New Fostoria?
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2671.952,2674.243,"In fact, New Fostoria --"
1971.70-113,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2674.243,2675.134,The divested?
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2675.134,2675.977,The divested company.
1971.70-113,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2675.977,2677.316,Autolite.
1971.70-113,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2677.316,2691.202,"Mr. Friedman, would you care to speculate on what impact this will have on Champion and General Motors if any or is there not anything that you can speculate it?"
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2691.202,2694.09,I think it is dangerous to speculate Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2788.128,2792.509,I take it (Inaudible) indicated a while ago the market really has not changed much?
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2792.509,2793.456,That is correct.
1971.70-113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2793.456,2795.052,It has not become anymore competitive?
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2795.052,2795.91,We do not think so.
1971.70-113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2795.91,2800.733,And if it remains throughout the same and this is after 10 years?
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2800.733,2802.005,This is after 10 years.
1971.70-113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2802.005,2805.271,Do you feel things might have been worse?
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2805.271,2806.261,It is hard to say.
1971.70-113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2807.781,2816.273,Well it is hard to pay and what about the -- what is the (Inaudible) is about?
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2816.273,2816.562,What --
1971.70-113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2816.562,2825.007,"Aftermarket, is this really have to change the market much, it does not make much difference one way or the other, whether Ford does or does not own the company?"
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2825.007,2828.859,"Well, we --"
1971.70-113,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2828.859,2843.655,"Perhaps you say we must ignore the experience of 10 years in some cases, perhaps indicate that 10 years is a long time for you to review the impact of the market and using to indicators is much impact at all?"
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2843.655,2843.992,"No, I did not."
1971.70-113,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2843.992,2845.572,"Nevertheless, you (Inaudible)"
1971.70-113,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2845.572,2846.92,"No, I did not indicate."
1971.70-113,2,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,4832.803,4840.357,I would just take a moment or two in the colloquy that developed the basic question.
1971.70-113,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5161.711,5162.682,Thank you Mr. Seymour.
