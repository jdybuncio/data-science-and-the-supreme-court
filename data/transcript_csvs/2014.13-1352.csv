2014.13-1352,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.63,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 13-1352, Ohio v. Clark. Mr. Meyer."
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,7.63,48.655,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In cases of foul acts done in secret where the child is the party injured, the repelling of their evidence entirely is in some measure denying them the protection of the law. That 254-year-old passage, I think, quite accurately predicts the situation we find ourselves in in Ohio following the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court in this case, we believe, misapplying the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause to these facts. We believe the Ohio Supreme Court erred in two fundamental ways."
2014.13-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,67.165,73.33,Do you have to be an agent of the government for the Confrontation Clause to kick in?
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,73.33,84.32,"Based on this Court's post-Crawford decisions, we believe that that is the primary analysis that should be conducted."
2014.13-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,84.32,85.755,Not primary.
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,107.61,112.99,"Well, in a civil case, I would agree that that is -- that is testimonial evidence, but purely private --"
2014.13-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,112.99,113.12,It is.
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,113.12,113.75,-- people --
2014.13-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,113.75,115.565,That's a private person.
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,115.565,124.05,"Well, in a civil case, Your Honor, I believe that -- that official solemnity that attaches to the oath that a witness is taking and an understanding --"
2014.13-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.05,132.195,"It's a question of solemnity, but solemnity -- solemnity has nothing to do with whether you're a civilian or -- or a policeman."
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,132.195,144.065,"Well, going -- going back to Crawford itself and what this Court explained was the purpose behind the Sixth Amendment, when the framers adopted it, was to prevent a very specific kind of abuse."
2014.13-1352,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,159.69,160.76,Doesn't the --
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,160.76,161.505,-- removed.
2014.13-1352,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,161.505,167.99,Isn't the test whether the statement is intended to be testimonial in nature?
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,167.99,170.31,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor, that --"
2014.13-1352,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,170.31,179.94,"So whether it's given to a private individual or a police officer is irrelevant. The question is, was it intended to substitute for testimony to be used later."
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,179.94,185.295,That is the test that this Court has announced in -- in Davis certainly.
2014.13-1352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,216.88,230.725,"Mr. Meyer, could you explain one anomaly in this case? The child, three and a half years old, is incompetent to appear in court as a witness."
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,248.97,290.195,"Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, I think it would be a mistake to say that his incapability, his incompetence for purposes of the courtroom setting means that nothing he's ever said on planet Earth could be taken as a reliable statement. Any parent knows that talking to their three year old, certain things they say can be relied upon. The Ohio rule, evidence rule 807, which is modeled, I think, off of this Court's opinion in Idaho v. Wright somewhat applies very rigorous factors to determine reliability. And so I think the -- the choice for a prosecutor is not between live testimony and hearsay."
2014.13-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.8,296.68,"Well, that -- that goes to the hearsay rule."
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,321.46,322.93,I don't think he can.
2014.13-1352,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,337.59,338.11,"Well, let's --"
2014.13-1352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,338.11,347.5,"Then they can talk about testimonial and I think we should, and I don't want to take argument in another -- suppose that this is not testimonial."
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,390.115,394.91,I don't think the reliability question is one for the Confrontation Clause.
2014.13-1352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,401.235,404.325,And has that been addressed here or is that still open?
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,404.325,405.35,I think that's --
2014.13-1352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,405.35,407.465,We -- we remand for that?
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,407.465,429.13,"I -- I think that's still open. And if you have a situation where the States are designing their rules for the deliberate purpose of -- of avoiding having live witnesses come to court, a sham rule, that would be a very arbitrary rule under the Due Process Clause, but I don't think the Confrontation Clause is what that was designed to address. Certainly --"
2014.13-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,429.13,436.94,What about the Due Process Clause? Do we -- have -- have we adopted hearsay rules under the Due Process Clause?
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,436.94,439.53,"Not that I'm aware of, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-1352,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.92,446.05,"I thought it was up to the States, let it in and let the jury take it for what it's worth."
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,447.7,457.955,What I meant to say -- and I think this Court did say this in Crawford -- was that the reliability question is one for the States and their democratic processes.
2014.13-1352,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,481.93,483.34,"Mr. Meyer, can I go back --"
2014.13-1352,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,483.34,486.304,Or of some hearsay rules.
2014.13-1352,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,486.304,488.885,Sorry.
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,532.235,541.39,"If you disagree with my formulation that private parties is the first step, this Court has consistently said that there's three key inquiries."
2014.13-1352,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,579.86,583.03,You're forgetting -- you're forgetting the circumstances prong of it.
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,594.605,596.05,Here --
2014.13-1352,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,596.05,596.26,So --
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,596.26,602.83,"I think the -- the intent from the questioner's standpoint, the teacher was just simply that."
2014.13-1352,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,625.96,633.42,"Well, that goes to reliability, and that goes to whatever the finder of fact, whether they take that approach or they take another."
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,646.21,661.5,"Well, I think that -- it -- it may go to reliability, but more fundamentally, it goes to the function that these actors are -- are performing. And if these aren't law enforcement people, if there's no direction by the police, this is just a teacher and student."
2014.13-1352,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,661.5,666.15,"Suppose this, Mr. Meyer. Let's take the -- the diminished capacity out of the equation."
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,708.51,726.6,"It -- it may be, and if I could explain. If both the intent of the questioner and the intent of the declarant both acknowledge that, in some way, this is going to the police and the circumstances of the discussion is for the police, that's a much closer question, and I would --"
2014.13-1352,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,726.6,744.86,"Well, that seems to me then, is then -- it suggests that the way to do this is actually more the way the S.G. suggests, that we should just ask in every case whether there -- whether a statement is testimonial rather than to draw the very sharp distinctions you want us to with respect to private parties."
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,744.86,766.93,"Well, I think the Solicitor General in Ohio's opinion are -- are harmonious in that they agree in their brief that in almost every circumstance, a private discussion is not going to be testimonial because it's just not for law enforcement. And maybe the better way, if the Court agrees, is to view it as a threshold determination before you even get to the question of purpose."
2014.13-1352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,797.23,815.95,"Could you remind us, the young people who -- who heard this child's utterances, what -- did their statements come in? The grandmother -- was it the grandmother, the aunt, the social worker, and the police, what happened to their statements?"
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,815.95,820.625,"Justice Ginsburg, the Eighth District Court of Appeals -- those statements did come in at trial."
2014.13-1352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,834.565,842.14,But the teachers didn't violate -- the teachers -- that was an hearsay exception; is that right?
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,842.14,848.49,The Eighth District analyzed the teacher's statements exclusively on the Federal constitutional question.
2014.13-1352,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,851.525,863.51,"Well, then what -- if all the others were -- were inadmissible under Ohio's own hearsay rule, why wouldn't the same thing apply to the teacher? What's the difference between the teacher and the social worker?"
2014.13-1352,0,56067,matthew_meyer,,863.51,869.99,"Well, first -- first off, Justice Ginsburg, I think this is a -- a purely Federal constitutional question."
2014.13-1352,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,917.47,938.89,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Eisenstein, welcome."
2014.13-1352,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,938.89,946.62,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ohio Supreme Court did err by viewing the teachers here as equivalent to police."
2014.13-1352,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1044.4,1056.25,"But what happens, Ms. Eisenstein, really along the lines of the hypothetical that I gave to Mr. Meyer where it's pretty clear to both the teacher and the student that back of that conversation, is the presence of police."
2014.13-1352,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1070.81,1074.47,"Justice Kagan, I think that is a much harder case for two reasons."
2014.13-1352,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1155.77,1166.355,I thought it was either -- that the school teacher could notify either the social worker or the police.
2014.13-1352,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1166.355,1169.06,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, they can notify either."
2014.13-1352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1188.66,1196.685,"Just so I have it clear. Social services, if they're selected to -- to get the information, I assume they have the obligation to advise the police."
2014.13-1352,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1198.095,1204.2,"I -- in terms of there is -- there is a cooperative structure, at least under the Ohio statute."
2014.13-1352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1206.3,1210.26,Is it a legal requirement in Ohio that social services report to the police?
2014.13-1352,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1210.26,1221.635,"I'm not sure the extent, Justice Kennedy, of the sharing of information and the degree to which social services in this particular statutory scheme must report all information to police."
2014.13-1352,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1221.635,1227.995,"Well, would I be right to think that where there is any kind of serious injury, police are involved as a routine matter?"
2014.13-1352,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1227.995,1230.76,"Well, Justice Kagan, I'm not sure about that."
2014.13-1352,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1252.0,1253.635,There can be a lot of --
2014.13-1352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1253.635,1254.38,Go ahead.
2014.13-1352,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1254.38,1254.47,Okay.
2014.13-1352,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1285.75,1296.27,"I think that is a challenge and the test, but it's less challenging in the context presented here where you have a -- a -- an ordinary citizen questioning a small child."
2014.13-1352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1320.73,1348.525,"What if you had -- maybe this is just a specific example of what Justice Alito is talking about, but what if you have the teacher who did this to you, Dee, the teacher knows there's nobody in the immediate vicinity named Dee, and then she asks, Well, has he done this before? I mean, is that something that's not subject to the Confrontation Clause? It's not related to the immediate concerns or immediate safety but seems to be designed to compile a case."
2014.13-1352,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1348.525,1362.04,"Well, Your Honor, to the extent to which the teacher is asking that question, I think that one of the -- the presumptions here is that it's not to gather, to collect evidence for a case because she's not thinking police prosecution, and there's good reason why --"
2014.13-1352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1362.04,1364.67,"How do you know that? Maybe she is -- you know, we've got to protect the child."
2014.13-1352,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1372.89,1374.2,"Well, and the immediacy --"
2014.13-1352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1374.2,1376.08,"I mean, sorry, wants to know whether he has done it before."
2014.13-1352,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1376.08,1397.66,"The immediacy here is not whether -- if I'm understanding your hypothetical, not immediate in terms of at the school, but in this particular case, there is the immediacy that, as was the case here, the defendant was the one who picked up the child and took him home at the end of the day leaving him, as it turned out, in a far worse position when the social worker finally tracked him down."
2014.13-1352,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1411.75,1429.27,"Well, what am I supposed to -- what are we supposed to do if we think 50 percent of the motivation was to comply with the statute and -- and -- and her duty as a teacher not to send this kid home, and 50 percent was in order to fulfill the reporting obligation to the police."
2014.13-1352,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1430.88,1439.55,"Well, Your Honor, I think you still have to the look at the three parts that this Court has addressed: the declarant, the questioner's intent, and the circumstances."
2014.13-1352,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1467.51,1477.34,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher?"
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1477.34,1489.335,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We are not here today asking for any sort of rule that would ban prosecutors from using statements like LPs in criminal prosecutions."
2014.13-1352,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1509.92,1520.1,"I'm looking at the -- the -- the judge said this witness is not -- this child is not competent to testify as a witness, and you've read the transcript."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1539.545,1541.54,"Well, two things, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-1352,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1572.45,1573.28,"Well, just let me stop you."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1589.575,1591.41,"Well, that -- that -- that is an issue."
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1643.95,1647.235,"I'm sorry, you start by saying she fed him a line."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1654.955,1657.26,"Yeah, she said, Dee, Dee, is it Dee who did it."
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1658.45,1661.34,"Well, but it wasn't as if she got Dee out of thin air."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1661.34,1661.855,Fair enough.
2014.13-1352,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1686.41,1686.88,May I ask this --
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1686.88,1687.65,That's all we want.
2014.13-1352,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1687.65,1691.485,"Suppose I'm in State X, not -- not Ohio."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1732.66,1743.94,"I -- I think you would start with Maryland against Craig where the Court has held that confrontation of children can be more flexible to accommodate child's perceptions, understandings and abilities."
2014.13-1352,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1743.94,1747.88,"That -- that case, the child was held competent as a witness."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1747.88,1749.46,That's right.
2014.13-1352,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1750.32,1750.635,This --
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1750.635,1753.89,"-- competency, though, is a creature of the State's own making."
2014.13-1352,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1798.04,1801.29,"And if -- but if that happened, would the statement to the teacher come in?"
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1801.29,1807.45,"Yes, of course, because once you have confrontation, then you can bring in any prior statement, and that's the essence of our position."
2014.13-1352,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1807.45,1829.52,"But by confrontation you mean the -- you -- you have a therapeutic expert, but as the defendant's witnesses, you're not -- I don't think you suggested that the Court could appoint its own expert and the defendant would be out of it."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1839.815,1844.92,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think the defense would have to have some inclusion in this questioning."
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1861.38,1861.83,Mr. Fisher --
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1861.83,1862.39,And Certainly the Court --
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1862.39,1864.88,-- I want to go back to your basic premise.
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1890.425,1909.455,"Well, you start with the rule the Court laid down in Davis and repeated in Bryant, which is: If the primary purpose of the statement is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to a criminal prosecution, then you have a testimonial statement. And I think a helpful way to analyze this particular statement is to start with Justice Kagan's hypothetical."
2014.13-1352,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1935.82,1944.58,"There's -- there's an awful -- a -- a great distance between Justice Kagan's hypothetical and what happened here. First of all, there's the age of the Declarant."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1957.785,1958.92,"No, Justice Alito."
2014.13-1352,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1959.5,1959.65,All right.
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1977.88,1980.14,Can I say one more word about the Declarant shortly?
2014.13-1352,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1980.14,1980.23,Sure.
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1980.23,2002.925,"And then I'll respond to you about the teacher. I absolutely concede that a three and a half-year-old doesn't have sophisticated knowledge of how the criminal justice system works, but I think a three and a half-year-old does understand when he's asked to -- whether somebody did something wrong to him. Again, remember that LP's three older siblings had all been removed from the home already for his mother's abuse and neglect."
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2004.86,2009.69,"That's a big assumption, to know that this child understood the criminal process at three years old."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2009.69,2010.88,I -- Justice Sotomayor --
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2010.88,2011.63,And when -- how long before had the --
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2011.63,2012.46,"-- I didn't say ""the criminal process."""
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2012.46,2014.01,-- children been removed?
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2014.01,2022.04,"I didn't say ""criminal process."" And -- and all I want to make the point is, is that if we're going adjust for the age of children, we also need to adjust across the board."
2014.13-1352,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2050.45,2071.505,"Mr. Fisher, I would like to ask you, before we get to the four -- your four points, it just seems to me that a teacher looking at a child who has been abused, the first reaction of that teacher is just as Justice Alito suggested: Get that child out of harm's way."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2087.145,2087.5,Right.
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2103.35,2103.54,And why --
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2103.54,2104.0,-- over the past --
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2104.0,2108.89,Why did the teacher bother saying that she wanted to make sure that it wasn't another child?
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2108.89,2111.77,"The teacher never testified to that, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.13-1352,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2181.55,2182.02,But before we --
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2182.02,2182.45,-- that training --
2014.13-1352,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2182.45,2203.21,"-- get to the prosecutor, is this child going to be returned to this person who the child has identified as -- it seems to me that -- that there is a concern immediately with the child's safety, and there is also, down the road, the potential prosecution."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2213.23,2213.85,Justice Ginsburg --
2014.13-1352,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2213.85,2217.36,And what Justice Ginsburg has said is completely consistent with your No. 3.
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2223.68,2224.21,That -- that's right.
2014.13-1352,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2246.58,2247.75,Much too late.
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2247.75,2254.135,"Well, it might be too late. But, Justice Ginsburg, it doesn't make it that much different than the situation you had in Hammon involving domestic violence."
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2301.86,2322.07,"Mr. Fisher, you -- in Davis, when an abused woman is separated from the abuser, she can voluntarily say, ""I don't want to go back."" She can make her own choices. How does a child make those choices?"
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2322.07,2325.56,"I think it's -- obviously, it's more difficult, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2330.28,2334.34,I -- I know for many women it's not -- they don't perceive it as a real choice.
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2335.27,2335.4,Right.
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2336.03,2341.275,But I think there is a difference in terms of protecting a child and protecting an adult.
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2341.275,2345.7,"There are differences, but again, I would give you my drug-dealing-on-the-corner hypothetical."
2014.13-1352,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2359.93,2366.0,Let's suppose that everybody who could have possibly done this to the child was immune from criminal prosecution.
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2371.25,2383.77,"Perhaps not, Justice Alito. I -- I'm just not sure what that tells us, because even if the teacher was gathering evidence for a civil legal process, then I think you still have a testimonial statement."
2014.13-1352,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2383.77,2386.295,The Confrontation Clause applies in civil cases?
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2386.295,2389.52,"Well, it applies in the same way Justice Scalia was adverting to earlier."
2014.13-1352,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2399.355,2403.05,"No, but all these people, they are immune from prosecution, from criminal prosecution."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2404.675,2406.98,I'm not sure she would -- they -- they would have.
2014.13-1352,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2406.98,2409.02,"Well, that would be the end of the question, isn't it?"
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2409.02,2411.07,I don't see why it is.
2014.13-1352,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2411.07,2415.33,Because then the teacher has no purpose of gathering evidence for use in a criminal prosecution.
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2415.33,2421.61,"Well, the purpose is gathering evidence for use in serious legal proceedings, and I think that would be enough, if I had to make that argument."
2014.13-1352,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2478.14,2485.885,"Mr. -- Mr. Fisher, can I ask a question that steps back a little bit? Because it seems to me that the strongest part of your case goes something like this."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2546.825,2566.05,"I think I can answer that question while also going back to the question I posed before you asked the question, which is what do you do when it's too difficult to pinpoint a purpose? The Court has also described in its cases the very helpful inquiry of whether the thing -- the statement when it's introduced in court functions as an in-court substitute for trial testimony."
2014.13-1352,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2570.7,2571.94,"You see, I think I don't think it really does."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2600.23,2620.7,"Well, I think the linkage between the two is that when a statement is made outside the courtroom for the primary purpose of establishing facts that might be relevant to a later criminal prosecution, then when it's transported into the courtroom, it does perform the substitute of trial testimony, which is exactly why you so accurately said, there was such power in this statement."
2014.13-1352,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2646.87,2650.97,But all -- all admissible hearsay is a substitute for in-court testimony.
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2656.21,2656.51,No.
2014.13-1352,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2983.47,2994.62,But -- but isn't -- but doesn't that indicate that the testimonial inquiry is somewhat -- somewhat awkward and formalistic?
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2994.62,2996.955,"No, Justice Kennedy --"
2014.13-1352,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2996.955,3006.475,"And -- there's -- just to follow up, it's almost the same one, that there are States in which every citizen has a -- has a duty to report abuse; is that not correct?"
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3006.475,3007.53,That is correct.
2014.13-1352,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3028.58,3030.74,Did we -- I'm going to use the primary purpose test at all.
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3061.405,3063.46,"Let me say two things, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-1352,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3126.84,3146.955,"To be fair to you, I don't think the misgivings come so much from -- they come from the fact that you don't want -- I don't want to see the Confrontation Clause swallow up the 30 exceptions to the hearsay rule, and therefore you have to draw lines. This case is tangential."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3183.71,3183.97,Yeah.
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3205.33,3208.735,But what you've -- but you haven't raised a Due Process argument.
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3208.735,3210.43,We haven't pressed that and we hope --
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3210.43,3215.285,"This is not a longstanding, traditional exception to the hearsay rule."
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3215.285,3216.1,"No, it's not."
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3216.1,3216.615,All right.
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3236.29,3236.35,No --
2014.13-1352,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3236.35,3238.555,Is this really Confrontation Clause.
2014.13-1352,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3238.555,3253.52,"It's really Confrontation Clause for all the reasons I've said about the objective purpose of the statement made outside the courtroom to partly aid the criminal process in the way it was used in the court. And, Justice Breyer, I agree with you these are tragic cases."
2014.13-1352,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3281.44,3286.33,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Meyer, you have five minutes remaining."
2014.13-1352,3,56067,matthew_meyer,,3286.33,3294.165,Thank you. One key point of disagreement I have with my colleague is the issue of Ohio law.
2014.13-1352,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3337.805,3347.705,"So in Ohio the teacher satisfies his or her duty by just phoning social service and then, ""There's a kid with terrible bruises in my class, good-bye."" That's it?"
2014.13-1352,3,56067,matthew_meyer,,3347.705,3348.63,That is it.
2014.13-1352,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3465.81,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
