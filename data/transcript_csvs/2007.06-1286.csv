2007.06-1286,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.231,"We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-1286, Michael Knight, Trustee, v. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue."
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,10.481,34.112,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is the meaning of a statute that provides that, in arriving at a trust or estate's adjusted gross income, amounts are allowable in full if they are... and I quote here from 26 U.S.C. section 67(e), which you can find at the bottom of page 3a of the appendix to the blue brief..."
2007.06-1286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,91.636,95.4,I think those three points are certainly what would help me.
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,110.721,118.468,"Well, 212 and 162 are really sort of two sides of the same coin."
2007.06-1286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,154.281,155.937,My other question is background only.
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,161.951,170.432,My recollection is that 162... 162 expenses are not subject to the... they're not miscellaneous itemized deductions.
2007.06-1286,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,170.432,178.444,"Counsel, you agree that as a taxpayer seeking an exception to a general rule, you have the burden of proof in this case?"
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,178.444,179.507,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1286,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,218.007,228.16,"We can't take... I guess it's not judicial notice, but we can't assume that individual investors with several million dollars of liquid assets might hire investment advisors?"
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,228.16,233.157,"--They might hire investment advisors, Your Honor, but we don't think that--"
2007.06-1286,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,233.157,234.937,Do they usually hire investment advisors?
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,234.937,265.832,"--I don't think it's clear that they usually hire investment advisors, but I think the important point here, in a way, is the premise of your question, which is that only certain trusts with certain assets, under a test that looked at what the Commissioner used to argue, which is commonality or customariness of a particular expense, only... the Commissioner herself now argues that, that this test is unmanageable because there's difficulty in figuring out what the denominator of the fraction is."
2007.06-1286,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,292.945,305.814,"I guess you'd concede, wouldn't you, that you're not entitled to all of the investment advice that you receive but perhaps only that that is related to the trust status?"
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,324.588,342.253,"--We think, Your Honor, that all trust investment fees are distinctive, that what renders them distinctive and renders them fully deductible under the statute is that they are incurred as a result of distinctive fiduciary obligations."
2007.06-1286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.246,363.572,"Well, I don't... I don't really see that line."
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,384.081,385.565,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.565,387.236,I think that's a very hard line to draw.
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,387.236,387.752,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,449.085,449.335,I'm still--
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,449.335,450.71,--it was held in such trust or--
2007.06-1286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,450.71,453.771,--I'm still trying to get back to my original question.
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,467.297,467.844,--The--
2007.06-1286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.844,469.266,I think fixing a roof is fixing a roof.
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,469.266,476.826,--The cost of... not distinctive costs would be the costs incurred by an S corporation owned by the trustee.
2007.06-1286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.826,477.545,Anything else?
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,477.545,482.184,"A condo fee, for example, that simply essentially runs with the property."
2007.06-1286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.212,499.098,Isn't there a trustee obligation to pay all... all expenses which if not paid will... would cause a depletion of the assets?
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,499.098,500.863,It's a question of--
2007.06-1286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,500.863,519.653,"Can't you say that that's a trustee response... I mean, if the criterion is he paid this money only to discharge an obligation as a trustee, it seems to me all of his expenses are in that category, with the possible exception of the S corporations you're talking about."
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,519.653,530.601,"--Well, Your Honor, the costs are distinctive in the case of... of those things that are caused by fiduciary obligation in the sense that we describe because that's how they are caused."
2007.06-1286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,554.216,567.086,"Mr. Rubin, you were not willing to agree with the Chief when he said: Well, maybe there are some investment expenses that are special because this is a trust."
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,577.972,580.503,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-1286,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,594.841,597.996,But they don't have to hire investment advisors.
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,614.316,623.36,"Whenever a trustee hires an investment advisor, it is to fulfill this fiduciary obligation."
2007.06-1286,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,626.906,630.326,"Why... if I could pause you on that, why is that the case?"
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,655.597,656.644,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1286,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,668.92,671.731,"Well, isn't that just like an individual investor?"
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,688.054,690.256,"--Well, Your Honor, there are unique obligations."
2007.06-1286,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,715.464,715.776,No.
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,731.521,734.035,"It... I guess I have two answers to that, Your Honor."
2007.06-1286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,753.557,761.431,"Well, it seems to me that that just simply couldn't have been Congress's purpose in passing this statute because now you have a recipe for avoidance."
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,789.371,798.196,"Well, Your Honor, to begin with, there is no risk here of tax avoidance through creation of a trust."
2007.06-1286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,807.364,808.427,"Well, is that true just in your case?"
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,808.427,809.083,--No--
2007.06-1286,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,809.083,812.52,"Universally, there is never a danger of tax avoidance?"
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,817.642,829.731,"--Well, the Commissioner concedes at page 37 of her brief that there is no substantial problem of income-splitting through the use of non-grantor trusts; and, indeed, throughout--"
2007.06-1286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,829.731,830.698,Is that true?
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,874.072,875.836,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-1286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,904.154,905.076,Excuse me.
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,910.886,913.948,A non-grantor trust is a real trust with economic substance.
2007.06-1286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.551,928.66,"Every trust has a grantor, I assume."
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,928.66,929.176,"--Yes, yes, yes."
2007.06-1286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,929.176,930.893,"So a ""non-grantor trust""--"
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,930.893,932.409,But this is... I guess this is a term of art.
2007.06-1286,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,932.409,933.017,--is a trust without any money.
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,933.017,933.361,Yes.
2007.06-1286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,933.361,937.203,A grantor trust would be one of those pass-throughs.
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,937.203,937.578,Yes.
2007.06-1286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,978.812,984.45,"May I ask this sort of elementary question, and it may reveal my stupidity."
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,1006.019,1011.564,"--I wouldn't say ""regardless of the actual facts"", Your Honor."
2007.06-1286,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1037.132,1040.864,"That's the most normal reading of the language, it's a case-by-case test."
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,1044.613,1048.611,"--Well, Your Honor, I think... I see your point."
2007.06-1286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1084.534,1095.077,"I've read the legislative history, which shows to me, anyway, precisely no light whatsoever."
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,1173.498,1179.668,"Well, Your Honor, I guess my response is severalfold."
2007.06-1286,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1249.797,1250.156,Okay.
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,1276.271,1287.549,"If it has nothing to do with fiduciary responsibilities, Your Honor, we think it would be a breach of fiduciary obligation to get... waste the trust money paying for the advice and to act upon it."
2007.06-1286,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1287.549,1288.22,"Oh, no."
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,1295.623,1299.323,We think that this is intended as a categorical rule.
2007.06-1286,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1342.994,1345.587,How can it be distinctive if the advisor doesn't even know that the person's a trustee?
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,1345.587,1349.819,"--Well, the question is the decisional process of the trustee."
2007.06-1286,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1358.425,1359.378,"Well, when it's filled out--"
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,1359.378,1359.863,He'll figure it out--
2007.06-1286,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1359.863,1363.596,--he knows it's on Form 1041 rather than 1040.
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,1363.596,1370.42,"--He will eventually come to know that the form is different, Your Honor, yes."
2007.06-1286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1417.323,1424.868,There's nothing that I could find anywhere that talked about pass-throughs in respect to the special situation of trusts and estates.
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,1472.865,1474.082,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1286,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1477.753,1480.095,"Not buying into they're thing with ""could""."
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,1481.345,1482.922,--Okay.
2007.06-1286,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1504.929,1509.208,But have they issued a regulation drawing up this list at this point?
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,1509.208,1511.552,"There's only a proposed regulation, Your Honor."
2007.06-1286,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1527.607,1528.513,Why is it not administerable?
2007.06-1286,0,38271,peter_j_rubin,,1547.989,1548.708,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1286,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1588.894,1590.175,"Thank you, Mr. Rubin."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1595.376,1608.934,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 67(e) creates a narrow exception to the 2 percent floor for costs which would not have not have been incurred if the property were not held in trust."
2007.06-1286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1608.934,1610.323,"It wasn't narrow in the beginning, right?"
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1610.323,1614.4,"Well, that's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-1286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1633.892,1637.578,"This is somewhat of a mystery, the wording of that clause."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1667.191,1675.579,"--I think, regardless of the timing, Your Honor, Congress chose to enact it and that choice has to be given effect."
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.282,1726.307,Why do you think that the only instances where the expense would not have occurred are those instances where it could not have occurred?
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1749.019,1751.891,"Well, they are... they're certainly different words."
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.498,1770.213,"Give me a context where... where... other than this statute, where in common parlance people use ""would"" to mean ""could""."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1770.213,1778.569,"Another example would be if I were to say that that glass would not hold more than 8 ounces of water, that would mean that it could not hold more than 8 ounces of water."
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1778.569,1779.6,"No, I don't think it would mean that."
2007.06-1286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1779.6,1782.458,A glass--
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.458,1788.987,Anything that could not be done of course would not be done.
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1792.36,1794.077,But--
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.077,1796.748,"It's true that one is included within the other, but they don't mean the same thing."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1796.748,1801.341,"--Would... I think that the unadorned use of the word ""would"" here--"
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.341,1802.777,"What could not happen would not happen, of course."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1808.744,1824.004,"--I think, when... when you have the word ""would"", as we have in this statute, that's not qualified in any way, it's ambiguous in the sense that it can mean definitely would not have been incurred, probably would not have been incurred, customarily, ordinarily would not have been incurred, which is the meaning--"
2007.06-1286,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1824.004,1826.472,"You didn't think much of this argument before the Second Circuit adopted it, did you?"
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1828.767,1831.812,--We did not argue it before--
2007.06-1286,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1831.812,1832.874,So you have a fallback argument.
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1832.874,1835.17,"--Well, that... that's right."
2007.06-1286,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1835.17,1836.92,"Well, now might be a good time to fall back."
2007.06-1286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1837.919,1843.277,"--Before... I mean, we have lots of good examples."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1853.116,1854.007,Right.
2007.06-1286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1867.501,1882.76,"If we can rush to the fallback position, is it acceptable to have a test that says would the expense have been incurred if the nontrust business wanted to achieve an objective that the trust wanted to achieve here, fixing the roof?"
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1882.76,1893.928,I... I think that that raises the question of what is the relevant comparison group for... for individuals outside of the trust side of it.
2007.06-1286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1893.928,1897.036,And I think the structure of the statute requires us to... to do that.
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1897.036,1897.817,That's right.
2007.06-1286,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1919.434,1927.635,"Will, you give as an example of something that wouldn't fall within the 2 percent floor the cost of preparing and filing a fiduciary income tax return."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1932.039,1933.555,The... the difference is--
2007.06-1286,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1933.555,1935.632,Just because it's a different form that's filled out?
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1935.632,1936.194,--What--
2007.06-1286,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1936.194,1939.786,Is it more expensive to... to fill out a 1041 than to fill out the 1040?
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1939.786,1944.222,--It's more expensive because it's an additional cost.
2007.06-1286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1973.976,1979.349,"Yes, but it's the individual who has to file the 1040."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2041.26,2049.366,"With respect to the tax return, it's not that it's a fiduciary tax return as opposed to an individual tax return; it's that it's an extra tax return that has to be filed."
2007.06-1286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2049.366,2052.771,"Well, it's the only tax return that the fiduciary has to file; isn't that correct?"
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2058.112,2059.94,"That's right, but if the beneficiary--"
2007.06-1286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2059.94,2064.594,But the only return the fiduciary's filing is the 1041; isn't that right?
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2064.594,2072.061,"--That's the only... but in that... in the system of the beneficiary and the fiduciary there are two tax returns that have to be filed, whereas--"
2007.06-1286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2072.061,2082.291,"Okay; I understand that that is a factual difference, but I don't understand what it is that makes that a difference in principle."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2082.291,2087.304,--I think that... that's an extra obligation that would not have been incurred in the absence of the trust.
2007.06-1286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2102.954,2117.559,"Well, can't you ask it... can't... can't you ask this question pointing towards something unique: If the individual investor does a very poor job of managing his investments, all he can ultimately do is cry about it."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2162.321,2167.977,"It's not a difference, because if the individual invests poorly he'll lose money."
2007.06-1286,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2178.847,2190.653,"Yes, but whether... whether he gets socked with damages or not is going to depend in part whether he is covered by an investment advisor's bit of advice; and that is... that is a different item in the calculus of liability."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2197.494,2210.787,"Well, the... the standard of conduct that is supposed to govern the fiduciary is the prudent investor rule, which looks at what a reasonable prudent individual would do in managing his own money so I think that--"
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2210.787,2213.691,"Well, I have the same problem."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2255.534,2262.593,--But there's no distinction in that case in the... in the fee that's charged or in the advice that's given by the investment advisor.
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2275.947,2285.74,"It may... it may well be the same advice, but in... but in one case it is... it is advice sought by and given to a trustee, a unique kind of advice."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2303.358,2312.542,"--I mean, but for the fact that the word ""trust"" is in there, I think the substance of the interaction with the investment advisor is exactly the same."
2007.06-1286,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2312.542,2325.225,But doesn't your proposed regulation concede that there is investment advisory advice that is unique to... to estates and trusts?
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2327.177,2328.208,No.
2007.06-1286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2348.309,2349.481,Why that limitation?
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2358.383,2364.459,--I think perhaps because that's most obviously the type of advice that is not unique to trusts.
2007.06-1286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2372.768,2375.11,It doesn't say it's one or the other.
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2381.389,2382.888,And--
2007.06-1286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2382.888,2398.68,"In other words, the regulation, the proposed regulation, doesn't answer this case of investment advice in general as opposed to advice on investing for total return."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2398.68,2405.317,--You're right that the regulation in terms of the enumeration in subsection (b) is silent on the question of other types of--
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2405.317,2408.222,Can you really spice up advice that way?
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2430.091,2441.039,"--I think that's right, and that's why I think that the... despite the fact that investing for total return is the only example given in the list, which, again, is described as not exclusive."
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2443.271,2444.584,But that's not all advice.
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2446.629,2447.504,--Yes.
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.504,2448.207,"Now, what about the rest of it?"
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2459.859,2475.227,"I think the best reading of the proposed regulation, and perhaps the Service may well clarify this during the rule-making process, is that all advice is not unique to trusts because there's no type of advice that a trustee could seek that an individual could not--"
2007.06-1286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2475.227,2479.241,"They certainly weren't sure about it when they drafted this regulation, proposed regulation."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2479.241,2485.442,"--Well, it is... it's just a proposal, again, and I think they picked what's perhaps the most obvious."
2007.06-1286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2485.442,2490.08,"But in other categories, they express no such limitation."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2505.622,2508.276,That's right.
2007.06-1286,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2535.297,2540.045,So how does your customary or commonly incurred test work?
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2558.147,2575.639,"--I think if the test is whether... whether the individuals would have... would commonly ordinarily incur that cost, I think one might well look at that because the comparison would be individuals with similar assets, and, as Your Honor knows, there might be a difference depending on the size."
2007.06-1286,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2575.639,2577.592,How many... how many individuals do you need?
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2591.977,2598.1,I think it might well be enough that... for something that the Service could clarify through--
2007.06-1286,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2598.1,2603.503,"Your answer to both questions is ""might well be"", and that's a fairly vague line when it comes to taxes."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2603.503,2605.22,--The--
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2605.22,2614.514,"And whatever line you... you pick, I guarantee you, trusts are going to break themselves up into mini-trusts that fall under the line."
2007.06-1286,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2618.264,2622.559,"Or, even worse, advisors are going to break themselves up into different advisors."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2629.12,2642.084,"--I think the difficulty in applying that test is one of the reasons why we suggest that the categorical... the more categorical approach, which we think is also a permissible reading of the statute, is the preferable one."
2007.06-1286,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2666.652,2667.417,What's your best case for that proposition?
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2673.383,2676.413,"It's not a case, but it's the rule."
2007.06-1286,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2684.034,2688.345,But I thought that rule applied to the applicability of individual exemptions.
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2702.636,2703.996,--No.
2007.06-1286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2720.207,2720.989,Are you saying--
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2720.989,2721.692,"A ""naked"" assessment is--"
2007.06-1286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2721.692,2725.831,"--Are we saying, as a question of law, the taxpayer has the burden of proof?"
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2729.143,2730.486,--No.
2007.06-1286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2745.308,2747.995,"Well, what would... that's why I made the suggestion I had earlier."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2805.128,2816.841,"If that is the test, then it's very easy to apply to the case of investment advice, because we know that the trustee's obligation is to act as a reasonable and prudent individual would."
2007.06-1286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2823.682,2824.463,But are you--
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2824.463,2825.01,--that would--
2007.06-1286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2825.01,2829.695,"--You would be, of course, exactly right, that there could be trusts, very big trusts."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2871.21,2881.769,"--I think that to the extent that you're suggesting that the Service could be... could clarify the statute through the use of regulations, we certainly agree with that."

2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.726,2913.709,"I think ""would not have occurred"" is pretty good--"
2007.06-1286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2913.709,2914.146,Yes.
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2914.146,2915.021,--actually.
2007.06-1286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2915.021,2915.864,That's right.
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2917.036,2923.94,The... the formulation that the Service has proposed of course is to look at costs that are unique to--
2007.06-1286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2923.94,2930.655,"If I reject this word ""could"" and ""uniqueness"", now what form of word should I write?"
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2930.655,2940.244,"--I think ""ordinarily"" or ""customarily"" is also a permissible interpretation of--"
2007.06-1286,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2940.244,2948.445,"If had you to choose between that and getting the idea of the reasonable taxpayer who didn't hold this in trust, which would you choose?"
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2948.445,2957.332,"--I think they are actually very similar inquiries, because we expect that the reasonable person is the ordinary person."
2007.06-1286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2961.065,2963.626,It almost sounds like ordinary and necessary under 162?
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2963.626,2971.998,"--Well, ordinary and necessary under... I mean here we are talking about... as Mr. Rubin said, it's under 212."
2007.06-1286,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2971.998,2972.45,212.
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,2972.982,2975.089,It's not in connection with a trade or business.
2007.06-1286,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2985.367,2996.081,"It seems to me the difficulty is in characterizing the level of generality at which you describe the cost, not whether it's ordinary or customary or unique."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3011.545,3021.416,I think what the Service is trying to do in the proposed regulation and what we have suggested is appropriate is simply a common sense practical approach to that.
2007.06-1286,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3026.96,3027.913,And this must be one.
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3053.762,3061.368,"--Again, I think what the Service was doing there was picking out just the most obvious example."
2007.06-1286,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3065.789,3067.24,How do we deal with this problem until there is a regulation?
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3078.877,3088.857,"--I think what we have suggested is there are two... there are a couple of possible readings of the statute based on the ambiguity in the word ""would""."
2007.06-1286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3109.411,3112.676,May I ask you the same question I asked your adversary?
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3123.359,3128.045,They will... they will be deductible but they will be subject to the floor.
2007.06-1286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3128.045,3133.855,"But they will never... you would not say some trusts yes, and some trusts no?"
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3133.855,3147.286,"Well, under... I mean, if the test were customarily or ordinarily, it might be the case that a trust could show that given the nature of the assets in it, if it were--"
2007.06-1286,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3147.286,3158.219,"Would you have to have a case-by-case analysis of the facts as to whether the particular advice would have been sought, whether the advice was by a trustee or by an individual?"
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3158.219,3162.64,--It's not... we are not suggesting that it's at the level of that particular advice.
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3164.607,3165.669,The cost of the advice?
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3191.643,3193.438,--I don't know the answer to that.
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3194.767,3196.141,"Well, imagine something else."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3204.279,3205.246,--One--
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3205.246,3210.308,"And then my follow-up is, is there any... I don't care about legislative history but some of my colleagues do."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3227.66,3237.968,"--To take your second question first, the legislative history is silent on specifically what Congress's objective was in section 67(e)."
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3237.968,3238.531,The dog didn't bark.
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3238.531,3252.447,"But I think... but I think what one can infer from legislative history of the '86 Act and more broadly and from the text of the statute is that Congress wanted property to be treated the same, regardless of whether it was held by an individual outright or held by a trust."
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3272.876,3275.14,"Well, you know a trust is sort of like a business."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3313.813,3321.825,"Well, individuals could get... could and do get investment advice that is no different in substance from the advice the trust might get."
2007.06-1286,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3331.681,3343.035,"What if you get a bill from the investor advisor, and it's $50,000 and it's broken up, 30,000 is general stock picking advice, and 20 percent is specialized fiduciary advice?"
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3358.076,3358.544,--Yes.
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3371.398,3387.877,"But the individual who wanted to maximize income, for example, if the trustee has to maximize income for some of the life beneficiaries or something, an individual could seek that same advice if he wanted that particular result from the investment, couldn't he?"
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3387.877,3389.875,That's right.
2007.06-1286,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3397.654,3398.387,"Oh, I didn't understand it to be that."
2007.06-1286,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,3412.102,3412.352,No.
2007.06-1286,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3414.287,3414.865,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
2007.06-1286,2,38271,peter_j_rubin,,3417.083,3444.087,"Trust investment advice is always distinct from the investment advice that's given to individuals, both because of the demanding legal obligations specifying certain factors that have to be taken into account by the trustee in investing and because of the risk of personal liability."
2007.06-1286,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3444.087,3445.821,What do you have to support that?
2007.06-1286,2,38271,peter_j_rubin,,3456.942,3478.855,"Well, I think, Your Honor, if you look at, at our brief, at pages 7 through 10, there is a discussion of the specific legal factors that are codified in Connecticut law in the Uniform Prudent Investor Act, which does not, as the Commissioner suggested, require people to invest as a prudent individual, but it's a different standard."
2007.06-1286,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3500.456,3507.672,But it could also be tailored to an individual with particular circumstances that are similar to that of the trust.

2007.06-1286,2,38271,peter_j_rubin,,3562.181,3562.587,--Both.
