1969.131,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.744,"Number 131, Dandridge against Williams."
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,32.549,39.265,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1969.131,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,332.516,345.44,"Through these two access, one on page of 119 and the other on page 194 indicate there are two quite disparate foundations for this maximum."
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,364.882,367.983,"I think Your Honor, that's correct in one sense."
1969.131,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,406.924,412.443,"So, what you are saying is that these are not independent and separate the reasons but rather relative reasons?"
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,412.443,414.106,I think that's true Your Honor.
1969.131,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,414.106,418.654,"Given insufficient funds, what shall we do about it?"
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,418.654,423.264,"Yes, they're always insufficient funds in almost any welfare program."
1969.131,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,430.652,441.08,How do that suggest aspect to the reason this do fit family where there's no breadwinner?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,441.08,464.302,"Your Honor, we discussed this at some length in our brief and we suggest that in addition to the -- we suggest that there are several considerations which can support the regulation."
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,846.952,848.924,Which how does one?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,848.924,852.393,Was withdrawn.
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,996.5,1000.226,Is that your complete argument or first?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1000.226,1001.731,"On abstention Your Honor, yes."
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1001.731,1002.96,"Alright, abstention?"
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1002.96,1006.72,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1006.964,1013.336,It's been decided by question been decided by the Supreme Court of Maryland yet?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1013.336,1031.588,"Your Honor, I think if not in the welfare context Your Honor, I think if when applies the tests announced by this Court in Harrison v. AACP and Sheckler v. Scooter to the situation in this case, abstention would be appropriate."
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1044.951,1047.498,"Well, that would divide one lawsuit, wasn't it?"
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1047.498,1054.024,"No, Your Honor, because it would be open to them to raise the federal questions from the state court is also, of course."
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1054.024,1067.985,"You have not -- your argument is they should not only abstain reference to the state question when it was asking declaratory judgment there, do you think can decide all the issues and then bring it up to the federal?"
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1067.985,1069.999,I think could Your Honor.
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1076.943,1077.07,No.
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1077.07,1078.11,And I am suggesting --
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1078.11,1078.717,Not the --
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1078.717,1084.69,The federal court should've abstain.
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1197.894,1211.926,"Could you state at least the -- I didn't understand it, which you understand that you would precisely should legally between you and the other parties, stately of the parties."
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1211.926,1224.964,"I think the issue, the issue Your Honor is -- there are several issues and I think the basic issue is whether the lower court acted properly."
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1224.964,1225.904,The crucial issue.
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1225.904,1244.464,The crucial issue is whether the lower court acted properly in validating this state maximum grant regulation on its phase under the Equal Protection Clause.
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1259.327,1261.982,Suppose the Court was wrong on that?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1265.292,1282.93,I believe Your Honor that reversal -- I believe that the decision of the lower court should be reversed and the injunction dissolves.
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1282.93,1291.323,If the challenge to the court -- what if the challenge to executive in the state law?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1291.323,1293.469,The challenge --
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1293.469,1295.82,Beside to what's the aim --
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1295.82,1296.615,What is the --
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1296.615,1299.507,What's it aimed at?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1303.767,1306.064,The application of the maximum.
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1306.064,1306.898,Maximum?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1306.898,1307.215,Yes.
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1307.215,1310.078,Does it claim that you cannot have maximum?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1310.078,1312.681,Its claim that you cannot have a family maximum.
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1313.497,1315.513,Cannot have a family maximum?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1315.513,1333.014,But you cannot have a family maximum which gives a large family less than what its members is might be entitle to if payments were made to them on what might be describe as a per capita basis.
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1333.014,1334.9,What is -- how much is the maximum?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1334.9,1340.346,It's $250.00 per month of the stage.
1969.131,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1340.346,1347.137,"Well, that's on a matching basis, isn't it or what might be call as matching basis?"
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1347.137,1369.305,"Your Honor, the consequence invalidation of this regulation was that in order to pay the families affected by of their full computed need, the additional money required had to come entirely out of state funds."
1969.131,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1400.6,1409.339,I thought there were two questions that the first I thought was whether or not this Maryland regulation conflicts with the Federal Social Security Act?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1409.339,1412.623,"Well, Your Honor, the --"
1969.131,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1412.623,1419.107,"That's a question that we have in another case is already been argued, the Rosado case, is that right?"
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1419.107,1420.023,Yes sir.
1969.131,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1420.749,1432.099,And the second question is whether the -- if it doesn't conflict to whether the regulation on its phase contravenes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1435.378,1436.357,"No, Your Honor."
1969.131,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1442.51,1444.085,I understand.
1969.131,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1444.085,1450.046,But the lower court abandoned this decision that there was a problem.
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1450.046,1450.284,That's correct.
1969.131,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1450.284,1451.259,If they do at decision.
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1451.259,1452.387,"Would do its decision, it just --"
1969.131,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1452.387,1454.737,To put its decision solely on Equal Protection?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1454.737,1456.009,That's correct Your Honor.
1969.131,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.009,1464.16,So the issue here is Equal Protection that except for the respondents would supported on the statutory ground also?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1464.16,1465.204,That's right Your Honor.
1969.131,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1465.432,1491.596,"On this is following up on rather brother Douglas' question, the reason for the state court's first of all paragraph --sustained contention with the recipients on the statutory language was and I believe the examination you said without a mark him."
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1500.946,1502.563,That is what the lower court --
1969.131,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1502.563,1512.497,"That for have reached the conclusion that they have been decide one way or the other on one of the court consideration may -- would state the constitutional question, is that right?"
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1512.497,1516.739,That's correct and I think it's a reversal of what usually happens in these case where there's never --
1969.131,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1516.739,1518.763,That's longer on this case.
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1518.763,1521.406,"And I think that's correct Your Honor and so, --"
1969.131,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1521.406,1528.325,"Well, you're looking here for the expertise that -- you didn't find that in below, is that right?"
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1528.325,1534.473,I think that Your Honor is a -- I am not sure that I would put it in that way.
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1554.446,1563.866,We do not know as I understand any question of the state's contention by the state that it's not able to do this.
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1573.301,1579.944,"Your Honor, I would not say that for this reason."
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1581.13,1591.517,"Well, there's no desire if it no ever get to get us to remand the state to raise the fund to pay the mention --"
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1591.517,1608.276,"Well, the lower courts Your Honor declined in terms to commend that state to pay them and issue to negative injunction which presented for the state with a abstinent choice of either finding and additional million dollars to pay --"
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1608.276,1609.721,You mean to make an appropriation?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1609.721,1629.233,"Yes, to the State either have to find their additional million dollars or would have been confronted with alternative of a 4% slash in all the welfare payments to the aged, the blind, the disabled, and other families under the AFDC program."
1969.131,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1629.233,1633.31,This because of a forfeiture of the federal contribution?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1633.31,1637.791,"No, there was no question of forfeiture of the federal contribution here."
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1656.502,1670.17,"Do you think, do we have to pass it on in this case whatever the decision on effort commend the state to make a appropriations to pay make these payments?"
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1670.17,1675.865,"Your Honor, my answer to that question would be this."
1969.131,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1706.892,1713.97,"You mean, with reference in making appropriations having an excess for the legislate to make appropriate?"
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1713.97,1729.774,"I think Your Honor, the nature of the choice presented the State Governments by these decisions particularly when you look for example the decision in California where physical effects were in the order of $40 or $50 Million."
1969.131,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1757.698,1767.164,"I can see that stand is for was dilute, is it that the invalidation results that in the over all appropriation down there for welfare."
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1779.461,1780.193,Yes Your Honor.
1969.131,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1784.023,1791.053,Your doing appropriately or appropriating -- increasing what's now appropriated for welfare general --
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1791.053,1791.297,That's right.
1969.131,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1791.297,1794.199,By sufficient sound to take care --
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1794.199,1794.407,That's right.
1969.131,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1794.407,1796.854,"Who need requirements, is that it?"
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1796.854,1807.198,"Yes, Your Honor and I think that the degree of rating of other programs as to take place is such not too much in Maryland but in some other states."
1969.131,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.198,1810.989,This way you say it's a ultimate choice that you can't rate the other programs since you --
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1810.989,1811.855,I think that's true Your Honor.
1969.131,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.855,1815.091,You have to appropriate additional sign to take care of --
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1815.091,1815.867,And I think that's true.
1969.131,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.891,1830.906,They have used the million dollar to save the additional amount pay?
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1830.906,1839.426,It's a million dollars in the Maryland and that's because we have a high maximum when the states their lower maximums and high welfare roles to some perfectly amends.
1969.131,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1839.426,1843.344,But under the court of each state fixes its own need.
1969.131,0,25653,george_w_liebmann,,1843.344,1855.58,That's correct Your Honor.
1969.131,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1855.58,1867.219,"Mr. Matera, you may proceed."
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,1867.219,1874.987,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, associate justices of this Court, as I mentioned to the various arguments this morning."
1969.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1994.121,2006.742,"Now, may I ask that computation is rather complicated as it is not depending upon the sex and the age of the child and upon whether or not he is a third or fourth or fifth or sixth child?"
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2008.969,2010.448,It is simply Your Honor.
1969.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.899,2031.837,And these computations by state law or Social Security Act standard?
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2031.837,2033.649,These are computations by the State.
1969.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2034.974,2035.962,By its own standards?
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2035.962,2044.743,Its own standards and there is a diminishing rate as the family goes larger that's two.
1969.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2044.743,2047.546,But there is a point in the appendix to where those computations --
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2047.546,2048.183,Yes.
1969.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2048.183,2051.904,Published?
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2064.916,2073.578,"Your Honor, these computations --"
1969.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2073.578,2095.525,"That's in quite wrong but if we are talking about Equal Protection here, I think it's important to know what the basic computations are up until you reach the maximum."
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2098.702,2101.815,"I will refer those around, yes."
1969.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2125.036,2126.81,Can you tell me just so I can call your argument.
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2134.391,2142.208,"Not anymore complicated than that Your Honor, that there is a schedule which sets out how much money a family for example of six would get?"
1969.131,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2167.407,2183.117,"Now, with your equal protection like base on the facts that where is skip up this continuation and go above that amount."
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2186.58,2206.595,"Your Honor, the Equal Protection argument is based on the fact that the Act itself as Social Security Act provides that each individual, each needy individual should be given subsistence needs and that these subsistence needs are provided for needy dependent children and small families."
1969.131,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2211.034,2212.332,And then less.
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2213.521,2214.148,"They are given nothing, Your Honor."
1969.131,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2214.148,2215.705,When you have your families or the child?
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2215.705,2217.37,They give them -- that's right.
1969.131,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2218.336,2220.751,And that is the Equal Protection argument.
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2220.751,2235.578,"And that in denying this assistance to families of five or six children or more that in denying assistance of these children, they are simply treating these children as none persons."
1969.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2248.032,2258.666,Would say that the State could give $30.00 per month for the first child that $25.00 in month for the second child?
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2258.666,2261.389,That Your Honor is yes and they do that.
1969.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2261.389,2262.702,Why?
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2262.702,2279.355,"Well, they do because it's clearly seem that for a second, third or fourth child that because they all live in the same family, it requires less to take care of that period of fourth child because that child shares the needs --"
1969.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.355,2282.775,"But further, do you think they at least must given something for the seventh child?"
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2282.775,2286.875,"Yes, they can completely ignore his needs as this particular regulation affects."
1969.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.875,2295.372,"This is all in the premise that whether it's $30.00 or $25.00, $15.00 whatever it might be depending the number of children, this is a bare subsistence?"
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2295.372,2296.258,"Yes, that's correct."
1969.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.258,2301.136,This is what is the minimum that s for the child action to exist at all?
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2301.136,2301.755,That's correct.
1969.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.242,2306.842,"Well, kind of $250.00 and you have a --"
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2306.842,2308.646,No subsistence needs.
1969.131,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2308.646,2313.125,The whole nothing provided than nothing whatever is provided for the essentials of the family?
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2313.125,2313.197,That's correct.
1969.131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2313.197,2319.161,"But if your argument would preclude any maximum, any limit, would it not?"
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2319.161,2330.635,"Our argument would only state that, you cannot treat a class of children in a large family any different, when you treat a class of children in a small family, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2330.657,2335.474,"Well, suppose they fix the limited $400.00 which is just hypothetically?"
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2335.474,2336.063,Yes.
1969.131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2336.063,2346.845,"I don't know just where the arithmetic is but then when you get up beyond the 12 of 15 children in one family, you have the same argument you have here today, wouldn't you?"
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2346.845,2358.048,"If there was a maximum based on family size which neglected the later -- children in the family yes, they are the same argument would prevail."
1969.131,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2360.551,2367.991,"Well, in short, the State cannot could say maximum figure?"
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2367.991,2386.509,"The State cannot set a maximum figure which is based simply on arbitrary family size which denies assistance to one classification of needy dependent children or at the same time providing assistance for the second class in this particular case, children of small families."
1969.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2523.968,2527.629,"Now, that $65 a month come under the same AFDC?"
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2527.629,2528.217,Yes it would.
1969.131,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2528.217,2530.445,"It would, not a separate program."
1969.131,1,31895,joseph_a_matera,,2530.445,2543.791,"At the same time that the Williams family, Your Honor, should put if Mrs. William should put two of her children and there somewhat older over the age of 12 with eligible relatives or an institutions."
