2018.18-726,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.8,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-726, Lamone versus Benisek. Mr. Sullivan."
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,6.8,27.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like quickly to try to reorient the Court to Maryland's case and then, if I can, address some of the concerns that I heard in the argument that you just had. In this case, the Court should reverse and vacate for three reasons."
2018.18-726,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,44.44,46.64,Was -- was this an excessive political consideration?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,46.64,50.36,"I don't think it was, Your Honor."
2018.18-726,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,62.04,113.52,"Well, if that's right, then your defense is not really that we can't tell the difference between excessive and non-excessive because, under any measure, this is excessive, isn't it? I mean, you'd only need 10,000 votes to -- to do the -- the population measure that -- that Baker requires, and instead map makers moved 66,000 Republicans out of the district, 24,000 Democrats into the District, flips the composition of the district from 47 percent Republicans and 36 percent Democrats to, instead, 45 percent Democrats and 34 percent Republicans, effectively ensuring that Republicans will never win this seat again and that -- and that Maryland, which has about 35 percent Republicans, is going to have one Republican House member for the foreseeable future."
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,114.92,117.8,"There's a number of things wrong with that, Your Honor, respectfully."
2018.18-726,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,142.56,145.2,That -- the stated goal was seven/one.
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,145.2,146.6,"For some, it was."
2018.18-726,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,147.72,148.48,The governor and others.
2018.18-726,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,148.48,150.08,"Well, for some, the governor, the speaker."
2018.18-726,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,150.08,154.76,"I mean, I don't think you should run away from the obvious."
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,181.8,188.08,"Well, I don't think it's running away to say that there were a lot of other factors that -- that had to do with this."
2018.18-726,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,199.24,207.92,"Well, sure, to make the others all the other way, and to get from six/two to seven/one or from five/three or six/two to seven/one, you --"
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,207.92,208.24,Well --
2018.18-726,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,208.24,216.2,"-- you get the Sixth and Eighth both Democratic, the first is going to be Republican for the foreseeable future, as Justice Kagan says, but it's going to be seven/one."
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,219.44,238.32,"Well, to get to that, you have to discount other statements in the record, which you can't do on summary judgment, such as Governor O'Malley's statement that, given the population growth in the western part of the central part of the state -- Montgomery County, primarily, had the largest growth -- you're going to see the most changes out the I-270 corridor."
2018.18-726,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,240.84,243.24,And the I-270 corridor is a community of interest?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,243.24,244.36,It is.
2018.18-726,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,249.48,252.4,"Well, they should have put it in the Eighth District then."
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,252.4,252.88,What's that?
2018.18-726,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,252.88,260.48,"If the idea was to unify the I-270 corridor, they could -- I look at the map, and it's very simple, put it in the Eighth District."
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,260.48,265.96,"Well, that would be an injury according to Plaintiffs' own complaint, because they say packing is an injury that's remediable."
2018.18-726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,280.04,280.56,"Yes, but --"
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,280.56,281.8,Then the Eighth District went north.
2018.18-726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,281.8,290.64,"-- suppose, hypothetically, to get away from these facts, that what we had used the three-part test that you just heard."
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,344.96,347.32,"I -- I'm not sure I understand all of that, and we may have an --"
2018.18-726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,347.32,355.48,"In other words, if it's absolutely indisputed that there was a clear and absolute intent to do this just so the Democrats could get the district."
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,376.72,383.32,"I don't know that I can because, Justice Breyer, you expressed the need to limit it to the extreme circumstance."
2018.18-726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,383.32,384.72,"Well, I just pictured a --"
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,384.72,397.92,"If you have that circumstance, then you're going to have to intervene in Arkansas, Kansas, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Utah, all states where more than 60 percent of the votes are cast for one party."
2018.18-726,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,426.08,458.28,"Well, why -- why should we assume, Mr. Sullivan, that everything would stay the same? If the Court said that something was unconstitutional, don't we usually assume that people change their behavior when the Court sets down a constitutional rule? I mean, the reason why, in this case and in the case just before you, all these politicians are bragging about the amount of partisanship they can put into the maps is because they think it's perfectly legal to do so. If the Court said it's not legal to do so, presumably, some actors would change their behavior."
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,459.28,460.08,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.18-726,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,471.88,483.44,"What would be an example of a situation where a -- the drawing of a district would be impermissible, would constitute impermissible political gerrymandering in your opinion?"
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,483.44,498.88,"Well, we've said in our brief, certainly, as indicated in the prior argument, where the minority vote getters dictate the results for the majority, that would be a situation where certainly the Court ought to be able to remedy that."
2018.18-726,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,498.88,514.24,"How does the majority -- minority get to do that? I mean, they have to -- this has to start with a legislature, both houses being controlled by the same party."
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,519.2,521.28,"Well, if -- in Maryland, there's history for this."
2018.18-726,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,540.28,541.76,And then what happened?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,541.76,543.6,Then a new map was drawn.
2018.18-726,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,556.52,565.16,It has been suggested from reading what was on the ballot that most citizens wouldn't understand at all what they were voting for.
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,565.16,566.24,"Three things, Your Honor."
2018.18-726,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,603.68,605.6,You -- you brought it up.
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,610.04,623.92,"I'm going to agree with our intermediate appellate court, which had a more full record before it than Justice Ginsburg does. But, also, this Court has -- has not presumed that voters don't understand."
2018.18-726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,650.84,671.2,"Well, what I read there is the exact words of the thing they voted for or against, that this referendum, petition, ""establishes the boundaries for the state's eight United States congressional districts based on recent Census figures, as required by the United States Constitution."""
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,671.2,671.68,Right.
2018.18-726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,671.68,675.6,All right? Now is that sufficient?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,675.6,685.2,"If that were the only thing the voters knew, but this Court presumes that they read the paper, they watch TV, they talk to each other, they have forums, as were held here, they read through the notice."
2018.18-726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,685.2,698.88,"But if this were the only thing, if I thought that at least a large number of them, that this was the only thing they knew, which is what you just mentioned, then is it sufficient?"
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,698.88,708.32,"No, it's not sufficient for this Court to conclude that there was a problem because its precedent says you have to have proof that there was actual confusion. And we have no proof in this case because it was not litigated at all."
2018.18-726,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,708.32,716.52,Am I understanding you to be saying that partisan gerrymandering is always non-justiciable?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,716.52,716.88,No.
2018.18-726,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,727.08,727.36,All right.
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,741.44,757.68,"They may be, but we -- in our case, we've only had a chance to litigate and have an experience with the one test that our court used, so we don't really have that benefit of being able to tell you with the informed level of analysis that counsel did in the prior argument."
2018.18-726,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,757.68,761.04,"Well, but, you know, you've had time to --"
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,761.04,761.8,Yes.
2018.18-726,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,761.8,764.76,And I'm assuming you would have.
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,767.52,771.8,"I -- I'm not going to take a position, Your Honor."
2018.18-726,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,787.8,794.36,You start your brief by saying that you agree partisan gerrymandering poses a threat to democracy.
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,794.36,795.6,Yes.
2018.18-726,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,796.92,800.6,So what -- what should we -- what should the test be then?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,800.6,806.32,"Well, I -- again, I can't speak beyond what's in our record."
2018.18-726,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,811.76,812.76,What is the threat that --
2018.18-726,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,812.76,833.76,"Well, is it your -- is it your position that this -- what -- what was done in Maryland would be okay under any test, but you're not going to tell us which of the possible tests is the right test, or are you just saying the wrong test was done, was used here, so we should send it back to -- for the Court to find some other test which you're not going to identify and then apply that to the facts of your case?"
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,833.76,834.52,"Well, it would be for --"
2018.18-726,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,834.52,836.28,I -- I just don't understand what you're saying.
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,836.28,840.44,-- it would be for plaintiff to identify it if you keep with the analysis in Vieth.
2018.18-726,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,871.28,886.04,"Well, I'll ask you the question that I asked Mr. Clement, which is, why can't the Constitution be interpreted to require something close to proportional representation in your view?"
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,886.04,892.04,"Well, in my personal view, it could be, but I don't think you need to get that far to -- to say that you could use proportionality."
2018.18-726,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,892.04,899.24,It could be? You -- you -- you're saying the Constitution could be interpreted to require something close to proportional representation?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,899.24,899.8,Justice --
2018.18-726,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,899.8,902.88,"Then you would lose, wouldn't you?"
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,902.88,939.8,"No, if proportionality is interpreted in light of the reality that, as both experts testified in this case or have written at least, when one party gets a super majority of votes, they tend to get a higher percentage of seats than they would get from the straight vote count. And as Dr. McDonald, plaintiff's expert, has written, if there is any correspondence between those two, it's merely accidental because, typically, it's going to be a higher seat count. So the Court has acknowledged that this can be justiciable, and I think the Court can come up with a standard."
2018.18-726,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,939.8,944.32,It's -- it -- I'd like to have you discuss the First Amendment argument a little bit.
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,962.88,983.4,"Well, as we've explained in our brief, retaliation, that whole analysis, has never been used in the legislative realm. And to say that legislation results because the party that had the more votes was retaliating against the other parties' views has -- is a position that's been repeatedly rejected in the cases we cited since the O'Brien case from this Court."
2018.18-726,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,983.4,995.6,"Well, you say we haven't done it in the past, but we're being asked to do a lot of things we haven't done in the past, and -- and it's because there's been a change in how redistricting has been done. And I guess I don't understand."
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1011.44,1023.96,"Well, in the employment context, you can't really -- unless it's a policy-making employee, you can't take into account the employee's political views pretty much at all. But, in legislating, political views have to be taken into account."
2018.18-726,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1046.4,1060.16,"Well -- well, but speech against other legislators or against voters? I mean, are -- are -- you think it's all right to retaliate against the Republicans from the district that were moved out because of how they voted?"
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1060.16,1064.16,I -- I don't think that's a fair characterization of what legislators do.
2018.18-726,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1092.36,1099.0,Are you suggesting that the redistricting here was -- was not successful?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1099.0,1113.68,"Well, if -- if you say the intent was -- was a partisan intent, yes, it was successful, except you still have a district that's capable of voting Republican. The Sixth District voted overwhelmingly for our Republican governor, Larry Hogan."
2018.18-726,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1116.8,1117.92,"Well, that then --"
2018.18-726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1117.92,1119.32,Why don't you improve that?
2018.18-726,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1119.32,1121.88,You can't use the government.
2018.18-726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1121.88,1154.08,"Why not say that would be a good defense? But -- but what you can't do is, if a party uses a map for its district, which is a statewide map, you used a statewide map, the Republicans won two statewide elections for governor, and so even a party with 60 percent of the votes cannot intentionally -- they have to prove it, you know -- intentionally draw these maps just so they increase their majority beyond two-thirds of the seats. I mean, I picked those numbers out. You can use other numbers if you want."
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1155.56,1156.68,Right.
2018.18-726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1156.68,1161.28,"The idea is looking into the minds of the legislators, which is difficult --"
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1161.28,1161.72,Uh-huh.
2018.18-726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1161.72,1178.24,"-- not impossible, and then applying it to extreme situations, and I just used numbers like two-thirds and so forth and majorities in order to show it's not impossible to generate analogous numbers from a constitution."
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1178.24,1194.0,"Your Honor, the problem with using the intent as your guide, as here, intent was the dominant factor that the Court relied on, is because, in -- in Davis versus Bandemer, the Court pointed out how easy it is to show partisan intent because that's the air that politicians breathe."
2018.18-726,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1204.92,1230.28,"But, when the legislature and the government, the legislative leaders and the governor, say we want seven to one, we want to shrink Republican representation by one, map makers, achieve that for us, I mean, is there any genuine doubt that that was the aim from the beginning, to shrink Republican districts by one?"
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1230.28,1254.68,"I think there is doubt. I think, if you read the entire record, including what Governor O'Malley said elsewhere in places not quoted by plaintiffs or the district court, where he said that what he wanted was for the constitution, the statutes, and all case law to be complied with, and after all of that, he would hope that a Democrat would be elected in that district."
2018.18-726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1254.68,1255.96,So you may be able to prove it.
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1295.4,1298.12,"Well, we do have a fair amount of stability in Maryland or --"
2018.18-726,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1298.12,1298.8,"Yes, I know."
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1317.16,1329.32,"Well, I think in other areas of your First Amendment law that plaintiffs have cited for you, for example, Crawford versus Marion County Board of Elections, didn't really care very much, the Court didn't, about the intent."
2018.18-726,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1357.44,1361.08,Now you say that partisan gerrymandering is justiciable.
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1371.4,1374.8,"Well, I will say under the Equal Protection Clause because that's this Court's precedent."
2018.18-726,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1374.8,1375.64,That's the only one?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1375.64,1378.88,And First Amendment is also present in this very case.
2018.18-726,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1378.88,1379.08,So both of them?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1379.08,1380.88,At least law of the case in this particular case.
2018.18-726,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1380.88,1382.04,Both of them?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1382.04,1382.4,What's that?
2018.18-726,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1382.4,1384.32,Both of them? Your answer is both of them apply?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1384.32,1388.4,Both -- both of them are potentially sources for a standard.
2018.18-726,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1388.4,1394.12,And what is the test under -- let's go to the First Amendment. What's your test under the First Amendment?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1394.12,1411.24,"I don't have a specific test to propose, but, as I indicated in my answer to Justice Breyer, I think anything the Court can do to get away from an intent-based standard where you have a realm, politics, where political aims are just endemic."
2018.18-726,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1411.24,1418.36,Do you think the First Amendment and equal protection dictate the same standard or different standards?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1418.36,1428.2,"I -- I would imagine they would have to be different in some -- because you have completely different bodies of -- of case law that the Court has developed in those two, so I would imagine there would have to be some difference between the two."
2018.18-726,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1428.2,1428.44,Okay.
2018.18-726,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1428.44,1428.72,You don't --
2018.18-726,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1428.72,1433.44,And what -- what's the test under the -- you can't tell me what the test is under the First Amendment.
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1435.4,1441.44,"It's intent, effects, and injure -- intent and effects."
2018.18-726,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1441.44,1446.04,What -- what degree of intent?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1446.04,1454.8,"Well, I tried listening to the prior argument, but I -- I -- I lost count of the tally of what -- where it came out."
2018.18-726,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1458.44,1468.68,"But, if you're back before the district court, what are you going to tell the district court? We should win, but are you going to try to explain to the district court why you should win?"
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1468.68,1495.72,"Well, first of all, the other arguments -- one of the other arguments we make is how -- given the plaintiffs' delay, which this Court found last time, puts us in a category of cases that we've cited where courts have determined that where there is delay and you're this close to the census, it's not equitable and it's no longer in the public interest to redraw the map because the same kind of disruption that plaintiffs compare -- complain about, you redraw the lines, you change all our associational interests, you affect our representation."
2018.18-726,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1502.24,1505.6,You think there's going to be a different map drawn after the 2020 census?
2018.18-726,0,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,1505.6,1508.24,There will be a different map.
2018.18-726,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1516.52,1523.48,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kimberly."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1523.48,1573.8,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin with just a very succinct statement of what our claim is and what our theory is. When state officials use redistricting to burden a particular group of voters because of their political views, with the express goal of making it harder for those -- for that group of voters to win elections, and when that goal is achieved so that group of voters is ordinarily doomed to usual electoral defeat under the map, and when the state cannot come forward with a legitimate governmental interest to justify the burdens imposed, the map has to be neutrally redrawn. That, in a nutshell, is our claim. And all of the evidence in our case proves that the 2011 redistricting in Maryland violated that theory."
2018.18-726,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1573.8,1583.12,"It's -- it's a -- it's a test that would be met in every particular, except for the one about durability that you mentioned."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1597.32,1630.56,"Well, I -- I do think all that the Court needs to say in this case is that dooming the targeted voters to electoral failure is enough to state a claim. I -- I think what's helpful, Your Honor, is that coupling that burden with intent makes sense because that is the intent that all map drawers who set out to gerrymander harbor. They -- gerrymanderers don't set out to fiddle at the margins; they set out to fix electoral outcomes. And that is exactly what the evidence in this case shows."
2018.18-726,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1663.6,1671.12,"How do you see your test? I mean, you introduced the Gingle factors, which the district court didn't rely on here."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1687.16,1693.68,"Well, I actually don't see a whole lot of daylight between our test and the tests that are presented in those cases."
2018.18-726,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1694.6,1699.76,Except that your test doesn't look at durability at all.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1699.76,1720.32,"Well, it doesn't look at durability as such, but the -- the focus last term was on the difference between vote dilution that would make a practical difference versus vote dilution that would result in a de minimis impact. And I think what would be more helpful to focus on, rather than what counts as de minimis, is to what -- is to focus on what counts as a practical burden."
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1754.36,1763.2,"If your -- if your claim is based on the First Amendment, doesn't that necessarily mean that partisanship cannot be taken into account at all, not one iota?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1763.2,1764.88,"No, I don't think so, Your Honor."
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1764.88,1773.84,Why is that -- why is that -- that not so? Have we ever said that there's such a thing as benign viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment?
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1773.84,1774.56,I -- I --
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1774.56,1779.72,"Where, you know, you can discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, but it just has to be small?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1779.72,1783.76,I -- I think most of this work is done at the -- at the justification stage.
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1803.36,1806.88,And what would be a potentially legitimate government interest?
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1806.88,1811.4,"I think it would be pursuit of balanced maps, as the Court said in Gaffney against Cummings."
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1816.16,1816.2,Okay.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1819.32,1824.52,"Well, I think balanced map in the Gaffney sense, which is the sense that I mean it, is proportino -- is a proportional map."
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1828.92,1857.92,"But, if you -- if you set out to draw a five/three here, say we want to be proportional, we want to be fair, so we're going to have five Democratic districts and three Republican districts, the Democrats, individual Democrats that you sort into the Republican districts are going to be able to say we're being deprived of our ability to be treated without reference to our partisan affiliation, our political affiliation, right?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1857.92,1858.84,"Well, I -- yes."
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1859.84,1864.12,So doesn't that show that your test -- but you said doing a five/three would be okay.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1864.12,1866.12,"No, no, that's right. So they would --"
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1866.12,1871.48,"Despite the fact it would still treat individual voters, it would penalize them because of their political affiliation."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1871.48,1876.0,"But, Your Honor, that is exactly the approach this Court takes in -- in its ballot access cases."
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1893.4,1894.04,That --
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1894.04,1895.04,-- considering voting --
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1895.04,1904.96,"-- that shows -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- that shows what the driver, I think, of your test, though, the overwhelming driver is proportional representation."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1914.44,1916.96,"I don't think it does require it, Your Honor, and I do not think it drives our request at all."
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1916.96,1919.04,Why don't you think it requires it?
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1919.04,1923.96,"Well, I -- I -- I don't see a textual indication in -- in the Constitution itself that suggests it."
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1923.96,1931.32,Equal Protection Clause does not suggest to you something where political groups are treated roughly equally?
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1931.32,1934.48,"I -- Your Honor, if that's the way that you're inclined to think about it, I'm certainly --"
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1934.48,1935.4,"No, I'm just asking --"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1935.4,1936.68,-- happy to have you -- have you rule that way.
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1936.68,1938.4,-- I'm asking why -- (Laughter.)
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1938.4,1941.68,I'm asking -- everyone seems to be running away from --
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1941.68,1942.72,"Well, I --"
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1942.72,1953.4,"-- challenging the maps but running away from proportional representation, even though, as you can tell from the questions, there's a suggestion that really it all comes back to proportional representation in some respects."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1953.4,1957.16,"Your Honor, I guess I'll -- I'll -- I'll answer the question this way."
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1975.12,1992.04,"You think the First Amendment might require or even tolerate the regulation of speech, and in this instance, the speech is the votes, for the purpose of providing a proportional representation of viewpoints?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1992.04,1994.36,"So, as I was about to say, I think not."
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1996.48,1998.08,Does it tolerate it?
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1998.08,2002.32,"I -- I think -- yes, I think that's the inevitable conclusion of Gaffney against Cummings."
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2002.32,2023.72,"So if -- if there is a -- a place in a public park, to get back to the classic example where -- that is open to speakers, the -- the -- the city that controls that could say we want to make sure we have equal speakers on both sides of this question, so we're going to -- you know, we're going to -- we're going to balance the speakers? They can do that?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2023.72,2027.56,"Your Honor, I don't think ruling in our favor requires the Court to say that in the least."
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2028.2,2038.28,"Well, you're saying this is -- this is a free speech case, right? And you're saying it's okay to regulate speech for the purpose of providing proportionality in some sense?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2038.28,2059.28,"No, Your Honor, what I'm suggesting is, after this Court's decision in Gaffney against Cummings, we accept as given that it is a legitimate state interest to pursue proportional representation in redistricting. If you take that as a given, then the sort of claim that Justice Kavanaugh was describing would, in fact, be justified under the third prong."
2018.18-726,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2082.44,2082.84,Counsel --
2018.18-726,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2082.84,2095.12,"You would think it would be -- you'd agree that if you had a partisan-free map, you said is required, that would be the first time in history, right?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2095.12,2097.12,"A neutrally-drawn map, you mean?"
2018.18-726,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2097.12,2101.0,"Yes, neutrally drawn, without -- without regard to partisan -- partisanship at all."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2101.0,2105.92,I can't say for certain whether as a matter of fact it would be the first time in history.
2018.18-726,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2136.92,2154.16,"Well, that's -- look, there is a classical political science view. It's very easy, draw state districts and imagine populations such as the state's 42 percent -- 48 percent Republican, 52 percent Democrat."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2220.16,2220.92,Right.
2018.18-726,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2220.92,2226.16,Do you -- do you want to just say that's it and it's the same argument? That might work.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2226.16,2229.44,"I think it is effectively the same argument, Your Honor."
2018.18-726,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2262.84,2263.44,What -- what do we --
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2263.44,2290.4,"So, yes, I think -- I think, as a practical matter, this -- the distinction that the district court below drew between vote -- deliberate vote dilution that makes a practical difference and doesn't is in effect the same. And we would be perfectly comfortable with the Court saying that the way that we know it's too much is if it results in a durable partisan gerrymander that will resist changes in politics over the coming decade."
2018.18-726,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2293.96,2298.56,What do we do about the referendum? The whole of the people had a chance to speak.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2318.84,2320.12,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2018.18-726,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2333.24,2347.52,"I -- I completely accept that answer, right? So -- so, in effect, you are asking the Court, no matter how good the referendum might be, no matter how much the people themselves might approve these lines, this Court has to tell them it -- it's unconstitutional?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2347.52,2354.56,"On the facts of this case, yes, I think that's correct. I want to come back to the question --"
2018.18-726,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2354.56,2354.76,I'm sorry.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2354.76,2355.72,-- of justiciability -- I'm sorry?
2018.18-726,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2355.72,2361.6,What do you see as -- on the facts of this case? What makes it so here?
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2361.6,2368.36,"Well, I -- for one, it was -- the intent that led to the adoption of this map in particular is undisputed."
2018.18-726,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2386.68,2387.96,Well --
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2387.96,2389.0,-- that Democrats and --
2018.18-726,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2389.0,2391.36,-- I -- I -- because of the uniqueness of this.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2392.04,2392.32,Yes.
2018.18-726,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2394.48,2404.88,"On the facts of this case, whatever the public maps might have been in an open situation were different than what happened here?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2404.88,2405.32,That's right.
2018.18-726,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2405.64,2406.16,That's what you're saying?
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2406.16,2407.8,"-- that would a very different case, Your Honor."
2018.18-726,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2407.8,2424.12,"Well, but -- but just to clarify, I -- and I just want to make sure I understand your position, I'm supposing that the people fully understood the -- the gerrymander that took place and fully understood that there was an alternative of pure proportional representation, and it would be great, all right."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2439.0,2441.52,I want to be clear that I understand the hypothetical.
2018.18-726,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2449.32,2449.52,Yeah.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2449.52,2453.84,And -- and a majority of Democrats who do better under this map choose this map?
2018.18-726,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2453.84,2454.4,Right.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2454.4,2455.36,I think that's --
2018.18-726,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2455.36,2455.84,Unconstitutional --
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2455.84,2456.2,-- unconstitutional.
2018.18-726,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2456.2,2458.0,"-- and we must say so, yeah."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2458.0,2464.04,"And I -- I don't think the Court should -- should feel especially troubled about that, for exactly the reason that the map itself here --"
2018.18-726,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2464.04,2464.32,Sure.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2464.32,2471.88,"-- I think, is unconstitutional. I want to come back to the question of justiciability."
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2531.52,2532.36,Does your test --
2018.18-726,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2532.36,2532.56,Am I not --
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2532.56,2567.88,"-- apply only to districts that are drawn for a partisan -- to -- to favor one political party over another, or could it apply to retaliation for some other reason? For example, suppose the objection of the map makers -- map makers is not that a particular -- that this district had voted Republican, but it was that the particular person in a district, the representative in that district, was a pain in the rear and so they wanted to get rid of that person. Would -- would that be prohibited by the First Amendment?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2567.88,2570.16,Not under the theory that -- that we've put forward.
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2570.92,2573.72,"Well, how could you square that with your retaliation theory?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2573.72,2574.2,"Well, I want to be clear --"
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2574.2,2580.44,So I vote for this person because this guy is -- this is the person that I want.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2588.88,2589.88,So that --
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2589.88,2599.6,-- diluting my -- my -- I want to vote for this -- for my representative and they're diluting my vote. They're taking away my opportunity to elect the person that I want.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2599.6,2608.2,"I -- so, to begin with, the First Amendment retaliation framework that we've referenced in our briefing is just that; it's a framework."
2018.18-726,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2647.12,2647.68,Mr. Kimberly --
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2647.68,2649.04,How much does -- go ahead.
2018.18-726,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2649.04,2702.24,"-- Kimberly, I'm wondering how easy it would be for plaintiffs to prevail under your standard in the future? Suppose we accepted your test and we made clear that this kind of behavior was unconstitutional, so you didn't have all these people bragging about how much partisan gerrymandering they were doing, right? What makes your case so easy is that everybody was completely upfront about what they were doing, as they were in the North Carolina case as well, because they think it's legal, so let's say what we're doing. But if we say it's not legal and that kind of intent evidence just disappears because you don't find silver bullets like that very often, then what kind of effects evidence would you need to prove your claim?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2702.24,2704.52,"Well, the --"
2018.18-726,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2704.52,2707.0,Now you have all that intent evidence; don't worry.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2708.8,2709.84,Yeah. (Laughter.)
2018.18-726,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2709.84,2719.32,"But, you know, suppose people act like normal people and they just stop saying all these things, and the next case comes along."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2725.48,2731.36,"Well, I think, to show intent, it would be the same sort of evidence that you would need in racial gerrymandering cases."
2018.18-726,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2735.84,2737.8,"I mean, it would really raise the bar, wouldn't it?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2737.8,2738.84,"It -- it would, Your Honor."
2018.18-726,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2739.16,2744.4,"I mean, you would have to show really dramatic effects to be able to infer intent, wouldn't you?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2744.4,2746.6,"Yes, I think that's right."
2018.18-726,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2746.6,2749.76,"So, in fact, this would be the outlier cases."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2749.76,2750.36,I -- I think --
2018.18-726,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2750.36,2750.64,This is not --
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2750.64,2751.16,-- as a practical matter --
2018.18-726,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2751.16,2753.72,"-- in every case in the universe, every district in the universe."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2753.72,2755.48,"Not -- not at all, Your Honor, and --"
2018.18-726,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2755.48,2762.36,"Well, why just -- why would you have to show dramatic evidence of effects before you can infer intent?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2762.36,2781.4,"Well, I -- I think, as a general matter, showing intent when you're talking about specific intent rather than general intent, which is the standard that the district court below applied and we think is the correct standard, I think raises the bar very high when you don't have direct evidence of -- such as the admissions that we have on our record here."
2018.18-726,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2783.24,2800.92,"So you think if you have the redistricting controlled by one political party and it comes out that the districts reflect a significant benefit for that particular party, that's not enough to infer an intent to draw the districts with an eye to the partisan effect?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2800.92,2846.8,"Well, I think here, Your Honor, that -- that may or may not be so. I think here, though, the question of intent dovetails with the question of justification. If in any of those -- if in a circumstance where you have a single-party control of the government and you have a badly imbalanced map that might suggest improper intent, as long as the state can come forward with some legitimate justification for the imbalance as it's drawn, and as the Court has said in its racial gerrymandering cases, the sorts of political considerations in -- in map drawing are myriad and malleable and they involve a delicate balancing of all of these factors, all the state has to come forward with is some explanation for the map as it's drawn and the burdens imposed identified by the plaintiffs --"
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2846.8,2859.04,"So, if you have the same -- if you have the record here with no intent evidence, to pick up on Justice Kagan's question, and it was five/three, any chance of prevailing on that?"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2859.04,2863.04,"We don't have evidence of intent and it's a five/three map, I think that's a very difficult case."
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2863.04,2863.72,How about six/two?
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2863.72,2865.92,I think that's also very difficult.
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2865.92,2867.0,How about seven/one?
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2867.0,2869.44,"I think, seven/one, it becomes easier to prove intent."
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2872.28,2875.56,And that's because it deviates from proportional?
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2875.56,2885.32,"It deviates for -- from -- from proportional, but I -- I think the question also, as I was saying about the third prong, is whether there are neutral justifications, and they might be things like geography."
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2887.44,2891.12,"That's to justify it, but it would be a problem? The seven/one is a problem."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2895.12,2901.72,"Well, I think that's right, but, to be clear, that isn't to say that our test tends towards proportionality."
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2902.28,2912.16,"Well, I -- I think if Justice -- to play out Justice Kagan's hypothetical, which I think is a good one, there would be no intent evidence in the future, or at least it would be hidden."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2935.08,2935.24,Yeah.
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2935.24,2943.4,"Something that's really extreme, to use Justice Kagan's words, would not be okay, seven/one, because it deviates so far from the proportion of --"
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2943.4,2943.64,"Right, it's just --"
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2943.64,2944.84,-- Democrats and Republicans.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2944.84,2947.64,"-- to say that where there's smoke, you're probably going to find fire."
2018.18-726,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2950.4,2950.88,Is another way --
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2950.88,2951.44,-- to find fire.
2018.18-726,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2951.44,2955.44,-- of putting the test: I know it when I see it? (Laughter.)
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2955.44,2956.16,"Certainly not, Your Honor."
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2956.16,2958.16,Now your test here --
2018.18-726,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2958.16,2966.36,So it sounds like you might be comfortable with Justice Breyer's two-thirds limit? Five/three is probably okay.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2972.72,2988.16,"Your Honor, I don't think a mathematical threshold is -- is probably the way to go about it, in large part because every state is different and, you know, how the geography plays out in every state is different. And what other sorts of justifications there may be, I'm sure will vary."
2018.18-726,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2989.96,3003.48,"It just seems, Mr. Kimberly, that what you're saying is that once people stop putting these statements on the record, which they will, that what your test will deliver is a way of going after the worst of the worst."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3005.96,3007.28,"I -- I think that's right, Your Honor."
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3062.6,3066.04,Can I isolate the role of geography with this question?
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3066.04,3066.48,Certainly.
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3066.48,3075.96,"Suppose you have crazy line drawing, something similar to what -- what is in Maryland, but it ends up in five/three districts."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3083.4,3085.52,"Well, it wouldn't be a First Amendment problem."
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3090.88,3091.12,Okay.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3111.36,3111.44,Yeah.
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3115.6,3116.12,Right.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3116.44,3116.68,Yeah.
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3116.68,3117.92,-- I take your point on that.
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3128.0,3128.28,Yes.
2018.18-726,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3179.12,3184.12,"Well, I mean, history has a little bit of, perhaps, significance there."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3203.28,3211.8,"Your Honor, that may be true, but since the beginning of the Republic, gerrymandering has been recognized also as a constitutional offense."
2018.18-726,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3221.04,3221.08,Well --
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3221.08,3221.56,-- from the beginning.
2018.18-726,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3221.56,3224.6,-- your best authority is a newspaper editorial? (Laughter.)
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3224.6,3226.76,"Well, certainly -- certainly not, Your Honor."
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3248.24,3248.64,What does incorporation have --
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3248.64,3250.4,-- cases to say that they're ahistorical.
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3250.4,3252.56,-- to do with congressional districts?
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3252.56,3252.96,I'm sorry?
2018.18-726,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3252.96,3256.36,What does incorporation have to do with congressional districts?
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3256.36,3266.76,"Well, congressional districting is an act by state legislatures. If state legislatures are cabined by the First Amendment in how they exercise that authority, the First Amendment has to be a limit on their authority."
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3266.76,3267.28,You -- you --
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3267.28,3269.64,And that wasn't recognized by this Court until the 1940s.
2018.18-726,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3269.64,3289.36,"You said gerrymandering has been recognized as unconstitutional. But are you defining -- if -- if gerrymandering is defined as deviation from what you would otherwise get with proportional, Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy have made very clear in various opinions that the Constitution contains no such guarantee."
2018.18-726,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3289.36,3311.48,"Your Honor, what we take to be partisan gerrymandering is the singling out of groups of voters for disfavored treatment in redistricting and using redistricting in turn to make it -- to doom those voters to usual electoral defeat. That is the original understanding of what gerrymandering was in 1812 and in the 18th Century before that."
2018.18-726,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3342.2,3345.64,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Sullivan."
2018.18-726,2,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3345.64,3346.32,Thank you.
2018.18-726,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3363.68,3381.64,"Why not? You have intent, which on this case they -- all the leaders said, yeah, that's what we want to do, reduce the Republican representation by one. And then they tell the map makers to achieve that result."
2018.18-726,2,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3394.44,3395.96,"Well, there's a number of things wrong with that."
2018.18-726,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3481.36,3507.6,"You mean if there's a referendum on a map that is -- that heavily favors one party, and the campaign -- and -- and this is a state in which that party is the majority party -- and the campaign in favor of the referendum has approved this map because this will really favor the party that you like, and the majority votes for that, that would not be -- that would be different from the legislature doing it?"
2018.18-726,2,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3507.6,3519.56,"Well, in the rhetoric, the discord as used in the gerrymandering area, yes, it would, because it's the people's will being expressed, which is the harm that politicians who gerrymander are subordinating the people's will."
2018.18-726,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3520.44,3530.24,"So, when the legislature does it and the -- the members of which are elected by the people, that's one thing, but, when people do it directly, it's a different thing?"
2018.18-726,2,62610,steven_m_sullivan,,3530.24,3531.56,It is a different thing.
2018.18-726,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3582.36,3583.04,"Thank you, counsel."
