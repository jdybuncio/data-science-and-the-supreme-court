1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,15.695,19.281,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.339,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,775.853,785.276,Your argument assumes the complete bona fide list of the contract in any given situation.
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,785.276,785.593,I'm not --
1960.339,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,785.593,786.264,Isolated contract.
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,786.264,787.645,"We don't -- that -- that's right, we do --"
1960.339,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,787.645,788.436,You don't -- you --
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,788.436,798.704,We -- we -- the -- the counsel representing the general counsel in this case did not challenge the good faith of the parties in -- in arriving at this contract.
1960.339,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,804.306,804.362,Yes.
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,804.362,809.196,"-- subterfuge and, of course, I am precluded by that concession from arguing that this was a subterfuge."
1960.339,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,874.235,885.681,"Another way of putting it is within the context of this past history of the contract of this kind perceive that, is that a fairway of putting that?"
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,885.681,887.138,That's right.
1960.339,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1070.94,1077.718,Is this formal contract phenomenon is peculiar to this trade?
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1077.718,1079.172,"As far as I know, yes."
1960.339,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1079.172,1084.4,"Well, what I was wondering was whether its Board's position would have application in other trade for --"
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1084.4,1084.715,"Oh, we --"
1960.339,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1084.715,1086.085,-- there have been no practice.
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1086.085,1097.657,"Oh, we've had cases, Your Honor, which have -- which have had contracts containing an illegal union security clause with some kind of a suspension clause."
1960.339,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1451.848,1454.563,May I ask you about one sentence in the Court's opinion below --
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1454.563,1455.159,"Yes, sir."
1960.339,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1455.159,1457.496,-- whether or not it's correct.
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1468.408,1469.399,"That's true, Your Honor."
1960.339,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1469.543,1470.205,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1470.205,1477.875,"-- that the contract, the contract does not have any provision saying that, saying that union membership is a condition of employment."
1960.339,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1511.407,1513.934,But then I don't quite understand.
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1524.192,1531.485,"Well, Your Honor, I think that all that means, all that means that there is no specific closed-shop provisions in the contract itself."
1960.339,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1532.376,1540.697,"But is there any other language that on the face of the contract, you could say violated the Act?"
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1540.697,1551.584,"We -- we take the position not that this -- it's a savings clause -- the savings clause, that because of what we deemed to be is its ineffectiveness."
1960.339,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1551.584,1553.13,You think it can?
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1553.13,1555.243,To suspend the General Laws.
1960.339,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1559.257,1566.47,You think they could utilize it as a vehicle from putting over a closed-shop contract --
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1566.47,1566.585,That --
1960.339,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1566.585,1568.414,-- and the facts could show that?
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1568.414,1571.352,That is the foreseeable consequence of this kind of a clause.
1960.339,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1572.998,1593.212,"Now, on page 834 of the record, Judge Hanks' opinion, he -- he says, We find a dirt of evidence, either the union journeyman was ever hired with preference to a nonunion journeyman or that the qualifying standards for the examination of the two groups are different."
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1593.212,1593.608,Yes.
1960.339,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1593.608,1595.043,Do you quarrel with that?
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1595.043,1596.257,"Well, Your Honor --"
1960.339,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1596.257,1603.286,Are -- are you talking about the potential in this type of arrangement for discrimination?
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1603.286,1609.216,"We -- we -- the Board found here, the Board found here that there had been actual discrimination."
1960.339,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1609.216,1610.38,"Well, the Court disagreed on that?"
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1610.38,1622.387,"The Court disagreed on that, but we think, Your Honor, we think, Your Honor, that the Court in reaching that conclusion was largely influenced by the fact that he had rejected the Board's original position."
1960.339,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1650.758,1657.701,"Do you, in your brief, point out instances where a union man was hired in preference to a nonunion man?"
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1657.701,1659.532,"Yes, we do."
1960.339,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1727.54,1741.567,"Are you asking us -- I don't quite -- are you asking us to review the holding of the Court that the record is varying that even in the slightest answer, there has been discrimination in the conduct of these examinations?"
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1741.567,1741.573,No --
1960.339,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1741.573,1743.343,Are you asking us?
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1743.343,1743.686,We did not --
1960.339,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1743.686,1745.341,Is that the question presented as it must (Voice Overlap) --
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1745.341,1747.474,"We did not preserve that question, Your Honor."
1960.339,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1777.224,1779.91,I still don't quite understand that.
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1779.91,1780.028,"Yes, sir."
1960.339,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1780.028,1789.133,"If we're not asked to upset what the Court found, how could we consider and in connection with what the contract -- whether the contract, on its face, is vague?"
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1789.133,1791.436,"Well, Your Honor --"
1960.339,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1791.436,1795.448,I mean the particular facts of this case.
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1795.448,1805.483,It seems to us that you can still look at what the objective facts were as to the how the hiring did -- did proceed.
1960.339,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1818.524,1824.343,"Certainly it wouldn't if you presented it as a question, but should we do it if you do not present it as a question?"
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1824.343,1833.137,"Well, otherwise, Your Honor, if it seems that the Court doesn't look to the background, to the -- to the background here."
1960.339,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1859.846,1865.229,You made a very sweeping finding on page 42A --
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1865.229,1865.833,42A?
1960.339,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1865.833,1882.773,"-- which includes the record does not warrant the finding if the hiring system in general is not merely this contract or the competency system in particular, by its discrimination against nonunion applicants incur his union membership."
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1882.773,1903.558,"Well, Your Honor, once -- once they had decided, once they had decided that the -- that the closed-shop provisions of the general laws were not incorporated in the contract or that there was no reason to attribute to the parts that they could have foreseen that the employees would've acted as though they were closed-shop provisions."
1960.339,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1927.307,1929.42,"Well, I understand."
1960.339,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1929.42,1936.505,"Well, I wonder why you didn't raise it in -- in -- on your petition."
1960.339,0,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1936.505,1955.448,"Well, I suppose that we didn't raise it because we had so many other issues in the case and that we felt that unless we could win upon these threshold questions that we'd never be able to get to that last one."
1960.339,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1955.448,1957.147,Mr. Schoemer.
1960.339,1,32961,john_r_schoemer_jr,,1957.147,1961.576,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.339,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2275.452,2284.134,The first thing the legal system as it is actually operated for has delineated in the contract.
1960.339,1,32961,john_r_schoemer_jr,,2284.134,2293.076,"This will be the system, Mr. Justice, as it actually operated as found by the -- as found by the Court of Appeals."
1960.339,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2617.385,2620.125,"Not just to weigh it down, not by whom."
1960.339,1,32961,john_r_schoemer_jr,,2620.125,2623.868,By the union initially with the agreement of the employers.
1960.339,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2633.898,2636.527,What kind of an examination is this?
1960.339,1,32961,john_r_schoemer_jr,,2636.527,2641.007,"Well, I believe it's both written and practical, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1960.339,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2649.792,2650.948,(Voice Overlap) to wrap newspapers?
1960.339,1,32961,john_r_schoemer_jr,,2650.948,2653.764,"Well, there is -- there is a little more to it than that."
1960.339,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2676.435,2682.197,Does this involve (Inaudible)
1960.339,1,32961,john_r_schoemer_jr,,2682.197,2687.915,"Well, most of that is done by machine, but not all of it, Mr. Justice Whittaker, and I can't answer question."
1960.339,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2962.457,2966.479,Do you think they wanted -- wanted you to replenish all workers in that --
1960.339,1,32961,john_r_schoemer_jr,,2966.479,2971.108,"All -- all employees in the mail-room, Mr. Justice Black, yes."
1960.339,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3046.263,3049.723,(Voice Overlap) why does that distinction appear in the --
1960.339,1,32961,john_r_schoemer_jr,,3049.723,3050.618,"Well, we --"
1960.339,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3050.618,3052.318,(Inaudible) of the Board?
1960.339,1,32961,john_r_schoemer_jr,,3052.318,3054.389,"I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand that, Mr. Justice."
1960.339,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3054.389,3064.242,Do you say that the rule wouldn't -- you wouldn't have this liability of tax to you if your offense was discouraging (Voice Overlap) --
1960.339,1,32961,john_r_schoemer_jr,,3064.242,3072.923,"Discouraging, I say, yes, because the normal remedy there the cease and desist order with back pay for discharged employees."
1960.339,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3080.217,3081.676,(Inaudible) got out.
1960.339,1,32961,john_r_schoemer_jr,,3083.502,3085.649,"But on my hypothesis, nobody got out."
1960.339,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3199.35,3200.948,Mr. Van Arkel.
