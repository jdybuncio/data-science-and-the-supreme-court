1998.98-223,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.218,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 98-223, Florida v. Tyvorus."
1998.98-223,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,12.84,15.552,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-223,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,65.783,74.7,"The way this came up, Ms. Snurkowski, was that evidence was found in the ashtray or something of the car and that was introduced at trial?"
1998.98-223,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,74.7,75.841,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-223,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,114.406,120.781,"And was the car taken because it was forfeitable, or was it taken just because he was arrested and something had to be done with the car?"
1998.98-223,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,120.781,129.077,This was not incident to a lawful arrest and it was not because of anything more than the officers' belief that it was under forfeiture.
1998.98-223,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,147.277,150.931,"So, from the moment they... they put the key in it and took it away it was because it was forfeitable."
1998.98-223,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,150.931,151.632,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-223,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,151.632,152.891,And how long--
1998.98-223,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,159.827,161.009,I'm sorry.
1998.98-223,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.737,173.265,"Did the officers... has it been determined that they had probable cause to believe that the vehicle, which they seized, had been used to transport illegal drugs?"
1998.98-223,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,173.265,173.765,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-223,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,182.892,190.007,And Florida law makes the car used for that purpose to be... makes it possible to forfeit it to the State.
1998.98-223,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,190.007,191.126,Subject to forfeiture.
1998.98-223,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,191.126,194.109,"Now, you don't rely on the G.M. Leading Corporation case?"
1998.98-223,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,194.109,194.8,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1998.98-223,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,194.8,197.003,I would have thought that was the closest case.
1998.98-223,0,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,197.962,201.634,I believe that that has been mentioned in the other briefs.
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,946.067,946.768,The rule--
1998.98-223,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,946.768,947.967,--what the State's asking for.
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,947.967,962.246,"--The rule we're advocating... and I think it is supported by a number of this Court's decisions... is that when items of personal property are found in public areas, they may be seized by law enforcement officials based on probable cause without a prior judicial warrant."
1998.98-223,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,964.228,971.913,"So... so, if the vehicle had been parked in the owner's driveway, could it have been seized?"
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,971.913,973.665,--The driveway is a close question.
1998.98-223,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,982.381,985.622,"So, what's your position on the driveway or the curtilage?"
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,985.622,995.039,"Our position on the... our position on the driveway, generally speaking, is that a driveway is not within the curtilage, and therefore the owner would not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in it."
1998.98-223,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.888,1028.511,It depends on how much is left of the Coolidge decision.
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1028.511,1028.921,That's correct.
1998.98-223,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1043.45,1053.736,"Is the purpose for the forfeiture, as you understand it, because this particular chattel is... is a nuisance?"
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1056.127,1058.53,"Well, I mean, a car--"
1998.98-223,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1058.53,1059.51,--from the streets?
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1059.51,1062.712,--A car is not per se dangerous.
1998.98-223,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1063.784,1065.243,Why are we forfeiting?
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1066.946,1068.837,--It is partly to impose a punishment.
1998.98-223,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1080.943,1088.51,"Now, if... if the latter is the rationale, then doesn't the delay that we're concerned about enter into the calculus?"
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1112.446,1114.616,--I guess I'd have a couple of responses.
1998.98-223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1175.246,1185.783,"Then you're saying there's sort of a notion of reasonable delay, but conversely I assume there... there... there is the thought in... in what you're saying that there might be an unreasonable delay in seizures."
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1185.783,1194.278,"Well, certainly the... the primary limitation on the amount of delay that would be considered reasonable in the arrest context is the statute of limitations."
1998.98-223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1201.574,1201.662,Okay.
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1224.819,1227.08,I... I think it would depend upon the... the circumstances.
1998.98-223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1237.736,1248.955,"You know, that might be a good basis for us to inform ourselves about contemporary standards of reasonableness, but at some point the reasonableness would dissipate, I take it, on... on your rationale."
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1248.955,1249.594,At some point.
1998.98-223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1254.917,1256.66,I... I... I agree with that.
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1256.66,1278.673,"--If, for instance, Florida by statute had said property can't be forfeited based on its use in criminal activity more than 5 years ago, then if police have evidence that the car had been used to facilitate narcotics offenses 6 years ago, the seizure would be no good because there would be no probable cause to believe that the property was forfeitable under the statute."
1998.98-223,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1297.346,1302.268,Do you rely here at all on the fact that the car is a movable object and--
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1302.268,1314.567,"Certainly we think... the rule we propose is not automobile-specific, but we certainly think that the mobility of automobiles reinforces the general principle announced in this Court's decisions--"
1998.98-223,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1314.567,1316.57,--I would have thought the principle didn't rest at all on that.
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1317.759,1319.442,"--Well, what... what the Court has said in--"
1998.98-223,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1319.442,1323.774,In this case where there's a forfeiture statute because of the use of the vehicle.
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1323.774,1344.697,"--Well, the general principle this Court has announced is that items of personal property found in a public place may be seized with... without a warrant, and one of the justifications the Court has given for that general rule is that, at least in many instances, the property... personal property, is susceptible of being moved away quickly, and we think that is all the more true in the case of an automobile."
1998.98-223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1360.619,1371.305,"Mr. Stewart, you said a second ago... I agreed with you a second ago... that the problem of staleness and dissipation of reasonableness is going to occur whether there's a warrant or whether there isn't, and I... I think that's right."
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1431.374,1444.863,I think... I think that that is not true because the problem you hypothesize is no different in principle from the problem that may always occur when the police undertake a warrantless seizure of property from a public place.
1998.98-223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1451.668,1453.939,"Yes, but here we're not talking about... I mean, you're quite right."
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1474.402,1475.093,"Well, the--"
1998.98-223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1475.093,1479.166,"That's true, maybe we can get by without it, but something would be served by recognizing it."
1998.98-223,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1479.166,1488.142,"--Well, the further element would simply be the legal determination of what period of delay would be regarded under the law as unreasonable."
1998.98-223,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1518.051,1519.233,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1524.006,1525.648,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1555.367,1559.079,How do you distinguish the Cooper case and the G.M. Leasing case?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1559.079,1565.473,--Cooper v. California only dealt with a subsequent inventory search after the car had been seized.
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1573.15,1577.332,"Well, but the Court certainly assumed that the seizure was appropriate."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1577.332,1581.844,"It may well have assumed it, but that just simply was not an issue before the Court."
1998.98-223,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1600.335,1601.256,How about G.M. Leasing?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1601.256,1609.351,G.M. Leasing represents the tax levied on a public street exception of the Fourth Amendment.
1998.98-223,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1629.216,1635.889,"Well, G.M. Leasing involved a warrantless seizure of a vehicle in a public place, and this Court upheld it."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1635.889,1639.281,"--Yes, but G.M. Leasing was not a forfeiture case."
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1655.794,1659.426,Why should it make any difference the fact that it wasn't a forfeiture?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1666.138,1670.452,--Probably because tax assessments seemed to create a special class.
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1672.233,1674.514,"Well, is that what... the Court didn't say that in G.M. Leasing."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1674.514,1675.856,--What the Court did say--
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1675.856,1687.473,"I mean, you... you can... you know, you can say that South Dakota against Opperman, the inventory case, involved a van, so it doesn't cover a car, but we don't distinguish cases that way."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1687.473,1699.172,"--What the Court said in G.M. Leasing, it went back to the history of the tax legislation and the taxing power, which is a constitutional power, it went back to the history of that and said almost--"
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1699.172,1702.464,"Well, you say... you say the taxing power is a constitutional power."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1708.477,1710.327,--No.
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1715.082,1728.41,"Well, but certainly under the allocation of government in our system, the Florida government has as much right to enact a forfeiture statute as the United States has to enact a taxing statute, does it not?"
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1728.41,1729.762,It certainly does that.
1998.98-223,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1752.105,1769.777,"Well, I think the question, at least mine, would be, how could it be a reasonable thing to seize a car in a public place without a warrant to satisfy a tax debt, but it wouldn't be a reasonable thing to seize an instrumentality of a crime, the car, in a public place?"
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1787.378,1792.992,"Well, one thing, of course, the tax debt has been determined to be a tax debt."
1998.98-223,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1794.724,1796.624,You mean you have to determine it beyond probable cause?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1802.198,1803.878,--To satisfy the debt or the forfeiture?
1998.98-223,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1803.878,1804.288,No.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1817.328,1820.942,"Well, G.M. Leasing was not a case that involved probable cause."
1998.98-223,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1821.372,1836.8,"No, but the Court in G.M. Leasing specifically said it took the case limited to the Fourth Amendment issue, and because there was probable cause, even though it was a warrantless seizure, it occurred in a public place and it was valid under the Fourth Amendment."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1857.474,1858.455,"--Okay, well--"
1998.98-223,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1858.455,1860.175,What is the distinction in your view?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1860.175,1872.012,"--The distinction, at least in my view, is that at least in the civil forfeiture area, they did not have a specific exception that has been validated by this Court to the Fourth Amendment for a seizure."
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1884.281,1889.524,"Well, we make a lot of exceptions to other constitutional principles in the tax field, don't we?"
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1889.954,1890.836,"Yes, we do and I hope--"
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1890.836,1898.43,"--We... we allow the Government to take your property before the... the actual tax judgment is issued, don't we?"
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1898.43,1899.702,"--Yes, we do, and in fact Bull v. United--"
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1899.702,1903.976,"They can take it now and... and... you know, and try the tax case later."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1903.976,1904.925,--That's exactly right.
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.925,1906.837,"We don't generally allow that in the criminal law, do we?"
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1906.837,1914.342,"No, we do not, and that's what Bull v. United States says, that that's the system that we have in taxing: the assessment comes first and the defense comes second."
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1914.342,1919.707,Maybe... I don't... maybe we trust tax gatherers more than we trust criminal law officials.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1920.198,1924.4,"I don't know, but in light of the legislative problems and hearings recently, maybe you'll reconsider that."
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1926.5,1927.812,I want to... I'm sorry.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1950.607,1957.213,"--There was not only a kind of process because first a tax assessment had occurred, which is equivalent apparently in tax law to a tax judgment."
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1967.548,1970.01,"Okay, but I take it then... I just don't remember this."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1975.814,1982.849,"No, other than that they went to the county courthouse and filed a tax lien so at least you had notice and opportunity, which is more than... than you have here."
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1982.849,1984.301,Notice and opportunity to do what?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1985.359,1987.911,To institute whatever procedures--
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1987.911,1991.965,Stake out in front of the car and... and meet the seizure with armed force?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1991.965,1992.706,--Well--
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.706,1994.636,What... what good did the notice do you?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,1994.636,1999.662,"--Well, the notice did do them something because they hauled a bunch of crates of information and stuff in the other part of G.M. Leasing."
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1999.662,2009.926,"Well, notice provides legal notice in... as... on a constructive notice theory, but in fact, the... the owner of the property may not have any actual notice whatsoever."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2012.287,2016.0,"True, although... and you're right, they're placed on constructive notice."
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2021.844,2025.327,"But this was not part of the Court's rationale in G.M., was it?"
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2025.327,2029.731,That was part of the foundation from which the Court's rationale sprung.
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2030.172,2035.915,"Well, it was the... it was a fact of the case, but the Court did not explain that fact as being essential to its holding, did it?"
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2035.915,2036.426,--No.
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2052.469,2057.225,"So, you're saying there was a kind of economic exigency rationale in G.M.?"
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2057.225,2069.002,"The Court in G.M. indicated it was an economic exigency, and they cited about three or four very old cases for that proposition, Bull v. United States, Springer, and several other cases."
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2069.002,2086.263,"It is your position, as I understand it, that a warrant would have been necessary even if that car had been seized when they first saw it being used in an illegal drug transaction, assuming... assuming that there were no exigent circumstances, that they... they had time to get a warrant."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2086.263,2088.864,"If there were no exigent circumstances, yes."
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2093.359,2100.555,It isn't just if you... if you don't seize it right away when you're seeing it being used illegally and you want to seize it later you need a warrant.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2102.396,2104.185,"No, you don't need a warrant all the time."
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2110.319,2110.629,Right.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2110.629,2117.946,"--and that the car was movable or may be moved because the occupants were alerted, then I think the car exception would apply, at least to the point where they could--"
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2117.946,2126.451,"Well, so then... then your answer is that if... if they had seized this particular car when they first saw him dealing drugs out of the car, they could have done it without a warrant."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2126.451,2127.6,"--Yes, if they had done it right then."
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2128.141,2132.114,"So, it's just... that certainly wasn't the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Florida."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2134.086,2134.727,What the Supreme Court--
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2134.727,2137.351,--I'm... I haven't finished.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2137.351,2138.52,--I'm sorry.
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2138.52,2146.347,I think what the Supreme Court of Florida relied on was just the fact that you need the warrant regardless of any delay.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2146.347,2154.011,"The Supreme Court of Florida I think said that there were no exigent circumstances and that that was admitted by the parties below, and that that's why the car exception was inapplicable."
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2154.011,2159.094,"Yes, and so... but did you read the opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida as relying on this delay factor?"
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2159.094,2163.177,I think delay was intrinsic in it because once there's a delay--
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2163.177,2164.078,You say it was intrinsic.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2166.96,2178.968,--The Florida Supreme Court set out the dates that occurred between the illegal activities that occurred and the ultimate arrest of the person and the seizure of the car.
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2178.968,2182.008,But did they rely on that in their reasoning?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2182.008,2188.153,"What they... well, their reasoning was that simply the car exception didn't apply because there were no exigent circumstances."

1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2191.094,2191.725,Sure.
1998.98-223,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2191.725,2193.728,--and you probably know.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2215.531,2217.553,"Well, I think what you're talking about is--"
1998.98-223,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2217.553,2218.024,Yes.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2218.742,2235.065,"--the plain view exception, and under the plain view exception, that if the officers are in a public place and they come across either evidence of a crime or per se contraband, that is, contraband which is just unlawful for anyone at any time to possess, then they can seize--"
1998.98-223,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2235.065,2237.025,--What about an instrumentality of a crime?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2237.025,2237.436,--No.
1998.98-223,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2239.657,2249.504,"No, but I'm... I'm saying in terms of what you just said, is it part of that tradition that they could seize in plain view an instrumentality of a crime, which I guess would be evidence of a crime?"
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2249.504,2251.355,"--Yes, if it's evidence of a crime."
1998.98-223,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2251.776,2254.446,There's not... there's no separate thing for instrumentality of a crime.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2254.446,2254.726,--No.
1998.98-223,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2273.88,2274.231,"No, no."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2277.633,2280.726,"--First place, they didn't seize it as evidence of a crime."
1998.98-223,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.78,2311.925,"I thought forfeited items were often evidence of the crime and would often be sold, if that's what the law provides."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2321.451,2323.201,--Not usually.
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2343.086,2371.644,"Mr. Gauldin, what do you make of the... the history which I... I think was put forward in the Government's brief that... that on the heels of the proposal and the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, the Congress of the United States passed legislation which, among other things, authorized the seizure of... of ships that had been used in carrying contraband and smuggling and... and... and it authorized the seizure without any warrant?"
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2388.495,2393.179,"Well, for ships are... I hate to mix analogies, but a horse of a different color."
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2399.854,2402.465,"Well, yes, the ship can... can leave the harbor."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2408.837,2415.763,"--Well, at least if it's driven to California, it's still within the continental United States and it's much easier to locate a car--"
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2415.763,2420.976,Mexico.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2423.627,2436.216,"--Even then it's limited, but it's easier to track a car at least while it's doing that, through registration and various other means, than it is to track a vessel on international waters, particularly a vessel owned by foreign powers."
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2436.216,2438.607,Do... do you have another basis for distinguishing that practice?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2438.607,2440.009,What the maritime?
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2452.308,2462.633,"Well, I would have supposed that if there was a ship in the harbor that had been shown to... to have goods being smuggled in, that they could have gotten a warrant for it."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2462.633,2466.316,"I suppose they could, but again because of what... the--"
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2466.316,2475.044,"In any case, your argument is that the ship involves again a... a justification of exigency and that that's not present with the car?"
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2475.044,2475.443,--Pardon me.
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2475.853,2483.329,"That the seizure of the ship without a warrant rests on a justification of exigency, whereas the seizure of a car under a statute like this does not."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2483.329,2485.32,"Yes, yes, yes."
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.336,2655.051,Why... why was that not the situation in Calero-Toledo?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2659.014,2660.176,No.
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.369,2665.77,"Oh, that was a disinterested government."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2665.77,2667.299,"Right, right."
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2667.299,2669.593,How do you tell the one from the other?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2669.593,2674.225,All I know is that in Florida we've got an interested government because--
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2674.225,2674.966,I see.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2675.834,2678.337,--the seizing agency is going to get the proceeds.
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2678.337,2683.711,Who was going to get the proceeds from the ship in... in Calero-Toledo?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2683.711,2689.936,I don't know and I'm not sure how the... that was a Puerto Rican statute and I'm not sure exactly what occurred with the Puerto Rican statute.
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.936,2693.566,You think maybe it was going to be distributed as a tax refund to the populace at large?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2694.437,2694.988,I doubt it.
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2694.988,2698.031,I don't see any difference between that case and this one.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2703.183,2715.692,"It may... there's a difference between the money going into the government's treasury where it goes into the general fund as opposed to where the seizing agency, the officers that get to seize it, get to either keep the vehicle and, say, use it for under cover purposes or later--"
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2715.692,2716.242,I see.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2731.142,2740.078,"--Yes, yes, although there's... there's a formula I think set up in the Florida statute as to which police agencies and hierarchy and all that get a cut and how, but the seizing agency does get a cut."
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2740.078,2743.13,"But it's law enforcement that gets funded, in effect, with this money."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2743.13,2746.433,"Yes, law enforcement does or law enforcement... the agency gets to use the car."
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2748.536,2749.474,Yes.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2749.474,2750.466,--they can keep it.
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2753.939,2758.531,"And I... do you know... I mean, I think... I think I can suspect the correct answer, but I'll ask anyway."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2768.808,2770.208,"No, I don't--"
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2770.208,2771.03,--whether the--
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2771.03,2773.36,"--No, I don't know whether the... the people that seized it got it."
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2773.881,2776.803,--That's probably a modern notion I would imagine--
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2776.803,2777.113,Oh--
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2777.113,2782.607,--that you... that you fund your agency out of the proceeds of... of your forfeitures.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2782.607,2784.109,"--Yes, very modern, in fact."
1998.98-223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2798.628,2801.461,"That's a healthy incentive to enforce the law, don't you--"
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2801.461,2815.098,"It is indeed, and too healthy if a magistrate hasn't reviewed it to make sure... the magistrate serves an auditing function in the sense that... you know, not that I imply that the law officers are dishonest, but it will keep them honest."
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2852.771,2856.816,--You say that Watson... Watson was a criminal case--
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2856.816,2859.146,"--Watson was a criminal case, yes, but this is a forfeiture case."
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2859.146,2861.868,--And does... why is that different?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2861.868,2863.2,Pardon?
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2871.695,2878.821,But you would think perhaps that there would be more protections against seizure in a criminal case than there would be in a civil case.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2878.821,2880.802,There are for a person.
1998.98-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2888.215,2890.087,But you... but you can be arrested without a warrant.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2890.087,2897.121,"--You can be arrested without a warrant for a felony outside of your home under Watson, under the circumstances of Watson."
1998.98-223,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2897.121,2920.278,"So, if the police need a warrant to... to arrest, in effect, or seize a car in a public place where they have probable cause to know that the... the car was an instrumentality of a crime, I would certainly think a fortiori they would need a warrant to arrest a person in a public place, although they have probable cause to believe that the person is or has engaged in a crime."
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2920.278,2924.38,"Well, the Watson decision holds otherwise in that respect--"
1998.98-223,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2924.38,2924.84,"No, no."

1998.98-223,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2933.836,2934.256,All right.
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2942.592,2972.872,"Well, no, I don't think you have to say that these other cases were wrong, if you mean Watson, because that's dealing... it's different because in Watson you have given them certain constitutional protections such as the right to a first appearance within 24 hours or 48 hours at the most, the right to a probable cause hearing where the burden is on the government to prove probable cause, the right to appointment of counsel if you're an indigent to help you make that decision when you don't have those rights, and any rights that you do have here are merely of a statutory and evanescent nature."
1998.98-223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2972.872,2980.175,But isn't there a... a public safety rationale behind the... the warrantless arrest which does not apply here?
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,2980.175,2980.896,"Yes, there is."
1998.98-223,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2993.595,3008.833,"And was there also a factor that a person is mobile and here there was no assertion that this car, as the cars that are under the car exception, might go across the border?"
1998.98-223,2,20876,david_p_gauldin,,3013.769,3020.283,There was certainly no assertion and the record doesn't support any idea that the car was going to go anywhere.
