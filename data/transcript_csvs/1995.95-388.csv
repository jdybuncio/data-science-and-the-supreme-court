1995.95-388,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.989,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-388, Antony Brown v. Pro Football, Inc., doing business as the Washington Redskins."
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,12.008,14.562,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-388,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,163.578,165.778,"Is Mackey a case from this Court, Mr. Starr?"
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,165.778,169.642,"--No, Your Honor, it's an Eighth Circuit case, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-388,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,230.824,235.288,"Well now, the 30 years you're talking about, what, dates from Radovich?"
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,235.288,248.936,"From Radovich, then Mackey was decided in the 1970's, and then after Mackey a large number of decisions in various industries, Your Honor, including professional basketball."
1995.95-388,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,248.936,253.388,Are you suggesting there were no contrary decisions from the courts of appeals during this period?
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,253.388,254.94,Until 1989.
1995.95-388,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,254.94,257.382,So the... so it's from--
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,257.382,259.524,The 1950's.
1995.95-388,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,341.318,344.63,"--The Powell... Powell is an Eighth Circuit Case, too, is it not?"
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,344.63,344.868,"--It is, Your Honor."
1995.95-388,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,344.868,348.712,Do you think the Eighth Circuit thought Powell was inconsistent with Mackey?
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,348.712,361.24,"There was a division of opinion, but the Eighth Circuit as a whole still concluded... and, in fact, we would still win, Your Honor, under the Powell analysis for this reason."
1995.95-388,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,381.306,388.709,Then why doesn't the exemption disappear in any case in which there has been a collective bargaining agreement at the date at which the agreement expires?
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,397.684,403.538,"Because the test, Your Honor, and this is our basic submission, is repugnancy."
1995.95-388,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,441.155,442.354,"Okay, but then the criterion is not agreement."
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,442.354,443.015,I beg your pardon?
1995.95-388,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,443.015,458.306,"The criterion is not agreement, and I don't see why, in principle, the agreement should... when there is an agreement following negotiations, I don't know why that should in effect be the touchstone, or its absence a demarcating point."
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,458.306,462.568,"Well, agreement is not, standing alone, the touchstone by any means."
1995.95-388,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,509.14,516.344,And prior to that point there is a unilateral imposition by the multiemployer group of a bargaining position.
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,516.344,528.351,"And, Your Honor, we think that is inherently part and parcel of the collective bargaining process, which unilateral implementation of terms is not."
1995.95-388,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.024,541.832,"Mr. Starr, I... why does the conflict between the antitrust laws and the labor laws have to rise to the level of what you call repugnancy?"
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,564.426,573.541,"Basic principles of statutory construction, that the court is under a duty to interpret the law so as to give full rein to both those--"
1995.95-388,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.541,574.172,"To both statutes, but if--"
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,574.172,575.121,--To both statutes.
1995.95-388,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.121,586.44,"--one statute simply says, unreasonable restraints of trade are not allowed, why isn't it possible to say, well, in the context of labor negotiations, what's reasonable is quite different from what's reasonable in other contexts?"
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,598.327,605.784,"Your Honor, the theory, it seems to me is, is there antitrust immunity?"
1995.95-388,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,632.2,653.475,"If you can make that nice, neat distinction, but I presume they also ultimately want some kind of a contract, and I'm not sure that the imposition of those terms after the moment of supposed impasse is somehow categorically distinguishable from the process which I presume is not necessarily over."
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,653.475,659.379,"--Your Honor, this Court has already charted the path in that very respect in Fort Halifax."
1995.95-388,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,687.045,688.668,"Those were all ERISA cases, weren't they?"
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,688.668,689.559,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.95-388,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,736.83,739.231,Those cases had nothing to do with antitrust.
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,739.231,739.832,That is--
1995.95-388,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,739.832,757.533,"I mean, I was brought up at my mother's knee to believe that antitrust and labor law do not mix, but the very reason that the NLRA was passed was because judges decided it was a fine idea, under the antitrust laws, to start enjoining trades unions and interfering with the collective bargaining process."
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,765.167,765.398,--Yes--
1995.95-388,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,765.398,766.269,"--Well, that's what I want to know."
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,770.771,771.602,"--Yes, the--"
1995.95-388,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,771.602,774.644,Why is this about organized sports any more than Schechter is about chickens?
1995.95-388,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,780.508,786.471,"--Because of the critical structure and nature of the sports industry, which is--"
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,948.58,957.175,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-388,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,957.175,969.033,"Mr. Wallace, would you tell us, please, why the National Labor Relations Board is not included in the brief filed by the Government?"
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,971.945,973.637,--That is correct.
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,975.418,976.219,--Federal Trade Commission.
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,976.219,980.323,--for the National Labor Relations Board to speak to issues of antitrust law.
1995.95-388,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1006.922,1008.012,But it certainly isn't explained.
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1010.022,1012.175,"--I understand that, Your Honor."
1995.95-388,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1052.982,1059.196,"And I guess the AFL CIO couldn't... did they have a vacancy in their boards, too?"
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1064.289,1078.018,"--We filed a brief, and the brief was prepared in collaboration and consultation with the board's staff, and they were consulting with the members."
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1141.59,1142.381,Mr. Wallace--
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1142.381,1145.033,--in applying the antitrust laws without--
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1145.033,1145.641,--Mr. Wallace--
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1145.641,1146.382,--expanding the exemption.
1995.95-388,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1146.682,1169.757,"--before you go on with that, your time is short, and there is a question that I'd like to put to you, because the heart of your argument is that the impasse is the point at which the antitrust laws come in, and yet your brief was... admitted that that's a difficult time to determine."
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1193.813,1221.723,"--Well, we recognize that can be a difficulty, although not a difficulty of much consequence in a case of this nature in which the employers are imposing new terms that were not included in the expired agreement, and they're going beyond anything that the National Labor Relations Act would have required them to adhere to prior to impasse."
1995.95-388,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1221.723,1222.193,"Well, the concession--"
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1250.55,1261.217,"There's no doubt that that is true, and that bargaining can continue, and bargaining collaboration among employers in a multiemployer unit can continue, but the question--"
1995.95-388,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.217,1276.147,"So why is operating as a single employer unit up until the mini impasse, okay, but between the mini impasse and then during that period until they sit down to the table again they have to stop acting as a single employer?"
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1276.147,1286.675,"--The National Labor Relations Act requires them to abide by terms of the expired agreement until impasse is reached, so their conduct is governed by that."
1995.95-388,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1323.137,1325.831,"Is it require or permit, Mr. Wallace?"
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1330.042,1361.933,"--The fact that it permits it, or has a remedy for it, is not enough for the judiciary to find an implied exemption from the antitrust laws when Congress never expressly granted an exemption, and under this Court's holdings it's only an exemption that is by necessary implication flowing from the very existence of the scheme of the labor act that is to be recognized--"
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1361.933,1362.925,Suppose this proposal--
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1362.925,1364.084,--to the minimum extent necessary.
1995.95-388,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1364.084,1376.883,"--Suppose this proposal had come from the player's side of the table, but they wanted, say, $3,000 a week, and the employer said, we'll do $1,000 a week, then there's an impasse, then the employers impose the $1,000 a week scheme, what result?"
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1376.883,1393.996,Our view is that after impasse the employers cannot in concert agree to change the terms under which they will pay without antitrust scrutiny being applicable.
1995.95-388,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1393.996,1399.888,"So the fact that the players themselves negotiated it, or suggested it, is not relevant?"
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1399.888,1436.202,"It's relevant to whether it's a permissible change for individual members of the unit to make under the National Labor Relations Act, or for that matter it wouldn't violate the National Labor Relations Act for the group to make the change after impasse, but it would be subject to antitrust scrutiny, which might very well apply a rule of reason in the context of a sports league where you can't field teams individually."
1995.95-388,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1437.363,1450.2,"Well then, would that satisfy you if we affirmed the decision on the different ground that although there's no antitrust immunity the rule of reason in this situation permits employers to continue to operate as a single employer unit--"
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1450.2,1450.551,--Well--
1995.95-388,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.551,1453.002,--between the temporary impasse and the final settlement of the dispute?
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1453.002,1463.45,"--Well, that is a question that the court of appeals did not reach, and I think it would be improvident for this Court to reach it, especially since it isn't presented or briefed here."
1995.95-388,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1463.45,1472.637,It seems like a distinction without a difference whether we say that the reason it's okay is because you're exempted from the antitrust laws or you're subject to the antitrust laws but the antitrust laws permit this.
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1472.637,1487.247,But antitrust scrutiny is something that draws distinctions depending on circumstances and justifications for restraints that can be very different if you're trying to field teams against one another in comparison with--
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1487.247,1489.437,"Yes, but Mr. Wallace, then, I think your reasonable--"
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1489.437,1492.528,"--producing motion pictures, for example, where one can go ahead without the other."
1995.95-388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1492.528,1505.578,"--But Mr. Wallace, I think your reasonable defense might well apply to a rule that says only six players on the replacement squad, or something like that, but I don't see how you could say it's a reasonable... doesn't violate the rule of reason to fix the specific salary level."
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1505.578,1508.53,I never said it would not violate the rule of reason.
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1508.53,1509.018,But you didn't suggest we could affirm.
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1509.018,1511.602,I said that it... I wouldn't suggest affirming.
1995.95-388,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1517.226,1520.926,You're just teasing us with the notion that the rule of reason might solve our problems.
1995.95-388,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1521.247,1524.86,--The rule of reason doesn't necessarily mean the defendant wins.
1995.95-388,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1532.423,1533.815,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1995.95-388,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,1535.495,1542.371,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1640.176,1655.947,"May I ask you, Mr. Levy, I realize there's lots of difficulty determining when impasse occurs and so forth and so on, but in your view of the law, does there ever come a time when the employers would be... would not be free to act collectively by imposing a term such as was imposed in this case?"
1995.95-388,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,1655.947,1659.48,"There may come a time, Your Honor."
1995.95-388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1659.48,1660.709,"And when would it come, in your view?"
1995.95-388,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,1660.709,1677.753,"If the employees ultimately elect, in good faith, and not as a strategic matter to engage... to get additional leverage in the collective bargaining process, to give up their rights under the law laws, but I would argue that as long as they continue to bargain collectively, that--"
1995.95-388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1677.753,1689.351,"I'm trying to hypothesize a case... I understand the difficulty of measuring impasse, but where everyone would agree that there's really an impasse there's no point in future bargaining."
1995.95-388,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,1694.282,1698.055,"--Once the employers give up their bargaining rights, the employee... excuse me."
1995.95-388,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1707.232,1717.018,"What happens in that respect in... forgetting professional sports, there are lots of multiemployer bargaining units agreed to by unions."
1995.95-388,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,1718.058,1718.949,Of course there is.
1995.95-388,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1718.949,1722.812,"All right, so I've been searching, and I can't find board precedent."
1995.95-388,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,1750.12,1750.581,Well--
1995.95-388,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1750.581,1751.951,Aside from my own inabilities.
1995.95-388,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,1751.951,1761.558,"--I can't answer that question as to why you can't find it, but there is no question, Your Honor, that Congress intended to encourage the practice of multiemployer bargaining."
1995.95-388,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1761.558,1772.894,"We know that, but the issue would be, is a decision by employers a) reached after the impasse or b) reached prior, but implemented after?"
1995.95-388,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,1788.556,1790.525,"The board has spoken on that subject, Your Honor."
1995.95-388,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,1790.525,1791.086,Where?
1995.95-388,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,1791.086,1797.311,In its brief in Bonanno Linen which this Court quoted in its opinion in Bonanno Linen.
1995.95-388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1935.263,1943.919,"Mr. Levy, the problem I have is, does the bargaining process ever come to an end, because I think you seem to agree that if it had come to an end, then the antitrust laws would kick in."
1995.95-388,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,1943.919,1950.962,"In this industry at least, Your Honor, I think it's clear that the bargaining process itself never comes to an end."
1995.95-388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1950.962,1951.783,It never comes to an end.
1995.95-388,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,1951.783,1960.439,"The NBA players represented to the court in the Second Circuit in Williams, in a passage that we quoted from a brief, everybody knows in this industry that there's--"
1995.95-388,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1960.439,1964.603,So basically what you're saying is there is an industrywide understanding that you never have impasse.
1995.95-388,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,1964.603,1965.821,--No.
1995.95-388,3,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3125.303,3125.742,Yes.
1995.95-388,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3126.292,3127.654,"Mr. Starr, before you... I have a very quick question."
1995.95-388,3,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3147.135,3148.637,"--Your Honor, the premise is incorrect."
1995.95-388,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3159.915,3164.689,"Oh, I understand, but presumably each individual employer can then impose his own terms."
1995.95-388,3,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3164.689,3165.12,Absolutely.
1995.95-388,3,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3165.12,3166.52,"Now, may those terms--"
1995.95-388,3,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3166.52,3166.75,An individual employer--
1995.95-388,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3166.75,3170.653,--Must those terms be the terms that had been bargained collectively?
