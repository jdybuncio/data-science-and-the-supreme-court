1992.91-6824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.456,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-6824, Gloria Zafiro v. the United States."
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,24.031,24.665,It's Cunniff.
1992.91-6824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,24.665,25.198,Cunniff.
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,27.233,29.935,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-6824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,59.372,64.506,"Did... there were four defendants, and did each one of them make a motion?"
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,64.506,65.958,"--Yes, Your Honor, each made a motion."
1992.91-6824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,65.958,69.477,And did they want to be separates from all the other three?
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,69.477,70.077,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-6824,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,72.929,73.296,I got it.
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,73.881,75.531,In affirming--
1992.91-6824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,75.531,80.952,Did Ms. Zafiro ever ask for severance?
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,80.952,83.07,--She did ask for severance at the trial level.
1992.91-6824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,86.189,89.908,Is she properly before the Court now?
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,89.908,104.667,"I would suggest under fundamental fairness she should be because if this Court finds that the antagonistic defenses are still a proper basis for severance, it had been raised previously, and she should still be considered in that position."
1992.91-6824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,142.025,150.714,"Mr. Cunniff, let me interrupt you for just... are all four of these people petitioners here, Zafiro, Martinez, Garcia, and Soto?"
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,150.714,151.481,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-6824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,151.481,152.364,Thank you.
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,152.364,171.676,The opinion of the court of appeals improperly relies upon civil law for its rationale using the analogy of interpleader and using the analogy of joint tort cases.
1992.91-6824,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,259.283,260.983,That's one scenario.
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,276.761,280.147,"--That's true, Your Honor."
1992.91-6824,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,280.147,281.53,It looks like a hard choice.
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,281.53,311.332,"But again, in a criminal case it's not up to the defendant to have to prove his innocence, and this court decision actually results in a shifting of the burden of proof from the Government to the defendant because when the defendant gets up, he then not only has the burden of proving that he himself is telling the truth, he also must convince the jury that the co-defendant is lying."
1992.91-6824,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.332,316.553,"Well, he'd have to do that if the co-defendant weren't a co-defendant and chose to testify."
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,322.29,323.107,"You would, Your Honor."
1992.91-6824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,351.226,356.63,"Well, when you say shift the burden of proof, you're not talking in any literal sense, are you?"
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,364.684,371.657,"I'm talking as a practical matter and also focusing in on the specific language of Judge Posner, if I can refer Your Honors to the opinion."
1992.91-6824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,388.868,390.751,What's wrong with that statement?
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,390.751,404.028,The problem is that the difficulty is that you have a particular defendant who then's defense is going to become blurred.
1992.91-6824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,439.034,441.736,"Well, what if they all refused to take the stand?"
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,444.419,455.561,"And in fact, that's the point I would try and make, Your Honor, because the Government would have to prove a particular defendant guilty with specific elements--"
1992.91-6824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,455.561,455.894,It still--
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,455.894,456.829,--proving specific elements.
1992.91-6824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,456.829,459.364,--It still does to have its case go to the jury.
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,477.159,501.274,"It doesn't, Your Honor, but what is does do is by not allowing severance, it no longer... by not allowing severance, the difficulty is each defendant is going to be prejudiced, and the jury is going to be unable to focus its attention on the individual defendant to determine whether or not the prosecution has met its burden of proving each and every element beyond a reasonable doubt."
1992.91-6824,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,502.957,511.047,"Well, we needn't quibble, but in your hypothetical, I doubt that the Government has sufficient probable cause to enable it to indict all three people in the jail cell."
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,511.047,512.664,"And, in fact--"
1992.91-6824,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,512.664,515.015,That would be questionable enough in a civil suit.
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,515.015,538.715,"--But again, in Judge Posner's opinion, he talks about specifically the analogy to interpleader and to joint tort cases, and when you're bringing those types of analogy into a criminal case, you're then talking about relative degrees of responsibility or relative degrees of fault which I'd respectfully suggest is inappropriate in a criminal case."
1992.91-6824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,538.715,547.236,But here there was no doubt in the world that this big suitcase of cocaine was brought to the apartment by one of these people.
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,547.236,549.838,"That's... in fact, there's no doubt it was brought by both people."
1992.91-6824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,549.838,550.305,Yes.
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,550.305,559.896,"The issue is whether or not which if either, knew what the contents was of this very large package that was brought up to the apartment."
1992.91-6824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,559.896,569.002,"And there would be a certain irony if... under the facts that we know about this case, if all four of these people were acquitted."
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,569.002,593.117,"There would be an irony, Your Honor, but I would suggest to Your Honor that that probably would not occur if, in fact, the Government was able to prove each of the defendants guilty and to show the knowledge which would be inferred by virtue of the fact of the possession without explaining what was contained in the suitcase or the package that was being carried by each individual."
1992.91-6824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,593.117,602.056,"Well, I suppose the trial court can give an appropriate instruction regarding the burden of proof on the part of the Government."
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,602.056,603.123,I believe that the--
1992.91-6824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,603.123,609.727,And we normally assume that jurors will follow such instructions.
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,613.679,632.14,"--It does not, Your Honor, and it does not because it's the position of the petitioner that as a result of the antagonistic defense, when each defendant is going against the other defendant rather than the Government going against the defendant, what you have is a blurring and there's confusion."
1992.91-6824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,638.294,646.816,"Excuse me, but if we assume that a proper instruction is given, why do we have to assume there is confusion?"
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,649.102,672.9,"--The difficulty is the jury focuses in on each of the defendant's defenses, and because each is, in effect, saying the other person did it and I'm innocent, the concern of the other cases in all the other circuits that have considered this question is that the jury will be unable to differentiate between the defendant or the defendants."
1992.91-6824,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,682.339,685.541,I just don't understand that fully.
1992.91-6824,0,33799,kenneth_l_cunniff,,700.701,707.307,"The difficulty is in a criminal case, the question isn't whether or not a particular act was done."
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1503.554,1509.208,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-6824,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1596.297,1600.468,Didn't Soto also say he would testify?
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1600.468,1603.42,--His motion on page 81 of the--
1992.91-6824,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1603.42,1604.403,Page 90 or so.
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1604.403,1610.157,"--I believe it's on page 81, Your Honor."
1992.91-6824,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.884,1686.407,"Are there any court of appeals, besides the Seventh, taken a... taken your view?"
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1686.407,1688.257,"--Your Honor, there are not."
1992.91-6824,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1690.126,1693.727,But how could all these other courts have been so far off base?
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1693.727,1695.762,"--Well, Your Honor, as our--"
1992.91-6824,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1695.762,1698.047,Which I think you'll say they were.
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1698.047,1699.447,--We do believe that they are.
1992.91-6824,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1750.397,1757.753,"Well, are most of the cases against you where they say severance wasn't required?"
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1757.753,1758.936,"--That's exactly correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-6824,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1759.67,1765.324,Are there some that say severance should be required?
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1765.324,1766.192,"--There are, Your Honor."
1992.91-6824,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1766.192,1771.328,And were they... was that order put in before trial or during trial?
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1771.328,1777.314,Typically I believe that the order for severance was denied before trial.
1992.91-6824,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.632,1806.501,There couldn't be a plainer case of antagonistic defenses.
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1807.369,1807.786,They couldn't.
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1831.484,1834.336,"Well but, Mr. Manning, I'm not sure that's always going to be true."
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1877.079,1878.798,"--No, Your Honor."
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1878.798,1879.765,You don't think that's possible.
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1879.765,1882.9,"We think... it's certainly possible, but we think it highly unlikely."
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1905.182,1910.734,"He might fear retaliation, for example, that he might not receive if he testified in a separate trial."
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1910.734,1911.669,--I'm sorry?
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1911.669,1913.469,He might be afraid of retaliation.
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1917.49,1922.458,"Yes, but that... I think that's the concern that exists whether or not you're tried together or in a separate trial."
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.629,1929.814,"But if you have a separate trial, it wouldn't hurt the uncle any."
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1929.814,1934.868,It would hurt the uncle if the Government gave the nephew immunity and called him to testify.
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1935.768,1936.252,"Oh, yes."
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1936.252,1937.235,--there would be no choice but--
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1937.235,1937.736,"Sure, if you get immunity."
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1937.736,1938.253,--I'm sorry?
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1938.253,1939.453,We're assuming no immunity here.
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1941.271,1955.948,But it's a somewhat... I think that it's not a natural reading of rule 14 to read it as a mechanism for requiring the Government to give immunity to a reluctant witness in the case in question--
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1955.948,1956.848,I'm not talking about immunity.
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1970.208,1970.758,"--But, Your Honor--"
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1970.758,1972.791,That's at least a hypothetical possibility.
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1972.791,1983.032,"--Certainly, and the premise of our adversary system is that when you bring all the facts before a jury, whether or not the person got on a witness stand or not, that the jury would make the accurate--"
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1983.032,1992.121,"In my hypothesis, all the facts didn't come before the jury because the innocent defendant was unwilling to testify with the other antagonistic defendant in the courtroom."
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1994.923,1995.873,--I understand that.
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2035.9,2038.019,--I didn't understand you really to acknowledge that.
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2045.356,2046.723,"--Well, when the... the only--"
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2046.723,2047.541,Or is that not right?
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2047.541,2050.327,--When the grounds... the only ground is the antagonism of the defense.
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2050.327,2050.76,That's right.
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2050.76,2052.795,"I mean, if there's something in addition to that, for example--"
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.795,2053.212,No.
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2053.745,2055.731,--Let's take a case of a conspiracy where--
1992.91-6824,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2055.731,2056.081,Let me just ask.
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2064.851,2065.319,--That's right.
1992.91-6824,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2112.733,2119.654,"But in the hypothetical with the uncle and the nephew with the shotgun, you would say it was an abuse of discretion to sever even if the nephew was reluctant to testify."
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2119.654,2121.923,Even if the nephew was reluctant to testify.
1992.91-6824,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2127.077,2130.695,"Well, as the hypothetical has been discussed here, you'd say it was an abuse of discretion to grant, would you not?"
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2130.695,2131.212,--We would.
1992.91-6824,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2131.212,2140.051,"Well, at some point you have to say that a defendant who decides not to testify because he doesn't want to hurt an uncle's feelings, that's his problem, not the Government's problem."
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2140.051,2141.586,"Well, that's exactly right, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1992.91-6824,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2141.586,2156.346,"And if the definition of an antagonistic defense is that if you believe one of them, you necessarily convict the other or you disbelieve him, here everybody was convicted."
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2156.346,2157.962,"Well, that's correct, and that--"
1992.91-6824,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.962,2161.214,And they didn't believe... they believed both of them.
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2161.214,2162.75,--Not only that--
1992.91-6824,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2181.461,2187.715,But the people who... all of the people who moved for severance were convicted.
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2187.715,2192.535,"All of them were convicted of at least one offense, but that... they were all convicted of conspiracy."
1992.91-6824,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.225,2204.327,But the other four.
1992.91-6824,1,31702,john_f_manning,,2204.327,2206.795,The other three were convicted of everything.
