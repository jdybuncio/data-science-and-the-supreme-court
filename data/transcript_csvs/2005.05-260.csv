2005.05-260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.282,We'll hear argument first this morning in Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,6.886,11.518,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,68.202,69.118,May I ask you this?
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,108.773,118.448,"Well, what I would say, Justice Souter, is that an injunction to... merely to prohibit distribution would be equitable relief."
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,118.448,118.932,Okay.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,118.932,127.34,"That doesn't necessarily mean, however, that once that injunction issued, the plan could enforce the terms of the contract under ERISA."
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,127.34,129.033,"Well, it could enforce the injunction."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,129.033,134.143,It could enforce the injunction provided that... that the injunction was not a mandatory injunction.
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,143.801,148.766,"Yes, but that... that was... that was an ex post remedy and there were no identifiable funds."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,160.941,161.857,--Well--
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,161.857,166.4,"It could not have said, give the $75,000, or whatever it is, to the plan?"
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,166.4,168.577,"--I... I would say two things, Justice Souter."
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,186.644,197.73,"Well, when we get down to clever attempts, aren't we at the clever attempt point when... when you say that they can enjoin the distribution to anybody else, including themselves, but they can't tell them to pay the money to... to GreatWest?"
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,200.084,207.471,"I don't... I don't think that's true, Your Honor, because we do not take the position that MAMSI or an ERISA plan doesn't have alternative remedies."
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,219.151,222.089,"But you... in any case, I don't want to prolong this unduly."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,233.425,238.317,"--Oh, to be clear, Your Honor, I will suggest a few remedies that I think might be available here."
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,238.317,238.684,No.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,246.865,247.576,That's correct.
2005.05-260,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,247.576,249.554,But I don't understand.
2005.05-260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,249.554,250.498,An injunction pending litigation?
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,262.76,266.026,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and that's extremely important because we would suggest--"
2005.05-260,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,266.026,268.63,But I... I still don't understand.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,284.926,286.937,"--That's a fair point, Justice Kennedy, but that doesn't--"
2005.05-260,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,286.937,288.447,So that's why I don't understand your questions.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,293.49,303.148,"--See, I don't think that's true, though, because there's a distinction I'd like to draw between having a remedy under 502(a)(3) of ERISA and having a remedy at all."
2005.05-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,335.916,342.802,"Mr. Stris, I'd... I'd like to know what... what you make of our opinion in Barnes v. Alexander."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,387.49,403.868,"That does not resolve the present case, Justice Scalia, because the... MAMSI's interpretation of the Barnes line of cases, the equitable lien by assignment cases, would entirely negate the limitation that Congress put into 502(a)(3)."
2005.05-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,436.709,445.867,"But we... but, you know, our opinions haven't said only certain kinds of equitable relief, only restitutionary equitable relief."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,459.39,459.984,I don't--
2005.05-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,459.984,464.432,"And... and if, indeed, it does... it does occupy a lot of the field, so be it."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,466.46,469.298,"--Yes, that's fair, Your Honor, but that's not what I'm saying."
2005.05-260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,488.959,489.625,"Well, what about--"
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,489.625,489.875,--my only--
2005.05-260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,489.875,515.761,"--what about if you're... if you're using GreatWest, it seemed to me the most relevant point made in GreatWest was that the plan could seek restitution in equity where money identified as belonging in good conscience to the plan could clearly be traced to particular funds in... in the defendant's possession."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,521.121,527.674,"--That... that's true, Justice Ginsburg, and... and it... it proves my point more than refutes it, and here's why."
2005.05-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,560.181,564.98,Suppose in the 18th century... I'm not an expert in this.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,575.15,575.633,Okay.
2005.05-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,575.633,576.56,Of the trustee.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,608.317,611.005,You don't need to say it.
2005.05-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,611.355,611.872,--All right.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,629.144,631.332,The answer is it depends and--
2005.05-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,631.332,631.815,It depends.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,632.593,633.853,"--It depends, and that... and that--"
2005.05-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,633.853,634.487,What does it depend on?
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,634.487,636.559,--and that is my answer to Justice Scalia's question.
2005.05-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,644.773,656.619,"The great grandson's intent was to get the money as fast as he could, and, in fact, he thinks... when he'll get the ring, he thinks he'll give it back to the trust but... at least... yes."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,657.269,662.245,"Then to be clear, Your Honor, that would not be enforceable as an equitable lien by assignment, and it's important--"
2005.05-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,662.245,665.45,"In other words, a court of equity could not have taken the ring?"
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,665.45,666.11,--That's correct.
2005.05-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,666.11,668.138,Like... what it is it?
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,673.415,680.812,"Well, we... we cite a... we cite a series of cases in our reply brief, pages 12 and 13, that all stand for this principle."
2005.05-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,727.092,728.77,"Well, suppose there are no other creditors."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,728.77,729.697,--If there were no--
2005.05-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,729.697,730.624,There's no other creditor.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,730.624,731.091,--If--
2005.05-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,731.091,732.635,"See, he goes... there's nobody."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,740.383,741.711,--The answer is still no.
2005.05-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,741.711,742.111,No.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,742.111,751.635,But... but I would add to that there... there are very few cases in that area because in that area the person would usually sue at law for money damages.
2005.05-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,752.379,752.746,No.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,754.984,755.351,--Yes.
2005.05-260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,768.592,771.963,Can I get back to the... the Barnes case that Justice Scalia asked you about?
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,786.58,810.357,"--Certainly, Your Honor, and... and as we note in our... in our reply brief, many courts over the years have described Barnes, Wylie, and the other attorney's fees cases cited by MAMSI in this case as... as very narrow exceptions to the strict rule at equity because in attorney's fees cases, it was the attorney's efforts that created the fund."
2005.05-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.945,815.483,What... I don't understand what difference that makes.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,833.689,841.003,"Well, to be clear, Your Honor, we don't rely on the distinction, but we do think the distinction adds some persuasive force, and here's why."
2005.05-260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,855.704,876.215,"Well, you may not... you may not rely on the distinction, but I would have thought your answer might have been that the lawyer had an equitable claim apart from the contractual provisions so that when you enforce the contractual provisions, Justice Holmes would have thought of it in equitable terms, while here, there's no equitable claim apart from the particular provisions of the contract."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,876.215,881.324,"Well, in candor, Your Honor, I was attempting to suggest that and clearly I didn't say it as artfully."
2005.05-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,883.834,883.917,Take it.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,884.7,885.2,--about the--
2005.05-260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,946.609,947.426,But why is that?
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,954.346,958.705,"I don't... I don't think it is arbitrary, Your Honor, and I would suggest that there's two reasons why they did that."
2005.05-260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1022.041,1029.511,"Do you... do you not think that Congress had in mind no compensatory damages, no punitive damages?"
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1041.691,1046.9,I... I wasn't suggesting that they had 15th and 16th century cases in mind.
2005.05-260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1053.304,1056.642,"Yes, but GreatWest also said money."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1073.198,1073.631,--Okay.
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1129.053,1138.379,"Well, isn't... isn't the simple answer to that is that the equity court would not enforce any injunction or any mandatory order, or whatever the relief was, if it involved double recovery?"
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1138.379,1147.037,"Well, I... I don't know how simple that answer is, Your Honor, but I would... I would take it, as Justice Scalia said a moment ago."
2005.05-260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1171.813,1175.428,What... what is the double recovery that you're talking about?
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1183.148,1183.926,--That's correct.
2005.05-260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1183.926,1187.608,And now it wants to get back its benefits in full.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1187.608,1188.408,Right.
2005.05-260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1207.685,1216.499,"But the plaintiff could so... in the tort litigation, if that's what it is, the plaintiff could say, I don't want any medical damages."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1218.687,1233.056,"--That's true, and... and I would suggest that if that occurred and you applied equitable principles, the insurer could argue, I think rightfully so, that the insurer impaired its subrogation rights."
2005.05-260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1256.32,1264.134,"Well, but they look at the medical expenses were something like $75,000 and the settlement was... what was it?"
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1265.134,1266.061,"--$750,000, Your Honor."
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1272.781,1274.458,"Well, did you attempt to?"
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1274.458,1275.819,"--We did not, but--"
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1275.819,1285.639,"Well, did... did you respond to the summary judgment by saying, you know, there are reasons why they should... specific reasons why they shouldn't get the full 75?"
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1285.639,1286.205,--Yes.
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1286.205,1288.083,And you were denied a hearing on that?
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1288.083,1289.493,We... yes.
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1289.837,1301.006,"That... that may be a... a reason for you to appeal on the merits, but I don't see what it has to do with the... with the jurisdiction of the court as... as awarding equitable relief."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1304.455,1305.155,--I... I don't--
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1305.155,1308.903,But it... it has nothing to do with its power to award an equitable remedy.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1308.903,1315.808,"--I don't think that's true, Your Honor, because MAMSI didn't move for summary judgment on an equitable theory."
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1328.998,1331.175,"Well, they would have nothing to say if they hadn't invoked the contract."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1335.868,1339.239,"I don't think they have to invoke the contract, Your Honor, in the sense that--"
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1339.239,1344.098,"You mean without a contract, they could have gone in and said, we'd like $75,000?"
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1344.098,1347.287,"--Not under 502(a)(3), but certainly under other principles."
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1362.915,1378.794,"And are you suggesting that the jurisdiction of the court would have been different if they had gone... if the... if the plan had gone in and said, we don't care anything about our contract, we're just relying on equitable principles of subrogation?"
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1389.629,1392.234,"--That is a very difficult question, Your Honor, and I would--"
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1392.234,1394.345,But I think that's implicit in your argument.
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1394.345,1396.433,"--It is an important question, and I would answer it this way."
2005.05-260,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1425.835,1427.512,Why... why isn't that what occurred here?
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1429.867,1442.464,"--Oh, the essential difference is that there are various equitable principles that were categorically applied to subrogation claims, including reimbursement versions of subrogation claims."
2005.05-260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1459.686,1465.562,"How does the... how does the insurer show that if the parties could just say... the plaintiff can say, I am the master of my complaint."
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1473.56,1485.473,"Right, but my answer to that, Your Honor, would be that if it's a lie, meaning if they did get damages for medical expenses, you couldn't overcome it merely by saying you didn't seek them."
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1555.196,1569.236,"Okay, but why... why isn't the answer to your argument the... the historical answer that courts of equity frequently provided remedies and supplementary remedies when remedies at law were not fully adequate?"
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1577.285,1577.562,Well--
2005.05-260,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1577.562,1579.639,Why isn't that the answer to your... your argument?
2005.05-260,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,1579.639,1583.671,"--I would say two things, and then I would... if... if I'm permitted, I would like to reserve the rest of my time."
2005.05-260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1643.403,1643.803,"Thank you, Mr. Stris."
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1645.514,1650.957,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.218,1688.34,"Well, but I mean, once you get out of the contract terms and are trying to make your case on the basis of subrogation, you do have to show that... that part of the recovery was... was for the... for the medical expenses."
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1691.622,1693.649,"It has been, Your Honor."
2005.05-260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1711.439,1713.71,"Well, if I can just stop you there."
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1722.868,1729.938,--I don't believe that he does cite cases disallowing it under circumstances anywhere close to this.
2005.05-260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1794.007,1813.752,"But he just said... your brother said, well... because I simplified that to the ring, and he says, well, if in fact you had a subrogation right or some other absolutely clear contractual right to get repaid from the ring, you know, which is a physical thing, you couldn't... stronger than your case... you couldn't get it in equity."
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1826.692,1828.202,I disagree with his response.
2005.05-260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1834.412,1835.14,"All right, fine."
2005.05-260,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1836.034,1838.872,Can you cite us to something for the... can you cite something to that effect?
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1838.872,1841.81,For the... for the ring proposition?
2005.05-260,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1841.81,1842.821,For your answer.
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1842.821,1860.876,"I do think the Barnes line of cases that include with it Walker v. Brown and... and other cases fully stand for that type of a proposition, that... that if you have committed to something that... that requires the return and recovery of a specific item or fund, that is it."
2005.05-260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1872.973,1881.47,"Well, instead of looking for an equitable counterpart, this is an action for money you think is owing to you under a contract."
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1884.669,1889.612,Because the right to subrogation exists independent of the contract.
2005.05-260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1896.171,1897.759,So why did you cite the contract in your complaint?
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1897.759,1904.48,Because of the specific requirements of ERISA litigation.
2005.05-260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1924.973,1938.831,"If equity... if the equitable subrogation claim were subject to the make whole doctrine or... or these other equitable doctrines, and your contractual claim is not, which relief are you entitled to?"
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1945.218,1954.626,"--We believe that the courts of appeals have already resolved that question, and that is that... first of all, there are... there are variations on make whole."
2005.05-260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1960.335,1966.723,Is your claim subject to the equitable doctrines or subject to the legal contractual claim?
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1966.723,1970.755,"--I don't distinguish between the two, Your Honor."
2005.05-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2025.032,2027.87,"Well, are you... do you contend it's always applied first to the medical damages?"
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2047.115,2051.313,I think we would be entitled to it under the... the terms of the plan.
2005.05-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.313,2052.241,You think that's the equitable rule.
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2052.241,2059.127,"Obviously, in... in doing these things, there's a practical side on... on the business side when they work these things out."
2005.05-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2067.275,2070.964,"Well, it might be because... it might be because there's contributory negligence, all sorts of things."
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2081.132,2085.081,"Again, it's... it's because of the nature of the allocation."
2005.05-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2085.081,2085.464,That's equitable in your view?
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2086.108,2086.792,It is because--
2005.05-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.792,2087.686,You think that's the equitable rule.
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2087.686,2089.53,--Yes.
2005.05-260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2100.199,2102.137,"And some do, but some do not I think."
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2102.137,2111.629,"--I think that's an accurate statement outside of the ERISA context, Justice Stevens, that there are courts that enforce one form of make whole that might not."
2005.05-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.806,2118.599,You... you have piqued my curiosity and... and didn't satisfy it.
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2125.736,2138.082,"--There are variations that... the... the most stringent is petitioners' rule, which is we have to be made whole for everything that we wanted to claim, pain and suffering."
2005.05-260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2198.73,2201.252,"Counsel, it seems to me you... you must be biting your... your tongue here."
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2221.913,2228.216,"--Well, the... the plan contains an allocation agreement that is part of... the allocation agreement is enforceable."
2005.05-260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2253.092,2253.586,What do you think--
2005.05-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2253.586,2262.15,"The fact that your equitable claim, you know, traces itself to a contract certainly doesn't... doesn't cause it to cease to be an equitable claim."
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2274.519,2277.351,--I believe... I believe that is correct.
2005.05-260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2289.963,2306.176,"--If... if you understand as I... that four people on the Court took a broader view that Congress didn't want to get into this matter, and restitution is restitution, whatever it means now; that five took the historical view."
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2363.159,2365.714,I'll try to get most of that in order.
2005.05-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2375.716,2380.414,I should think your response is that Congress provided for only equitable relief.
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2380.414,2382.186,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2382.186,2384.03,And... and that that's the... that's the answer.
2005.05-260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2384.03,2385.29,"--In other words, you don't care about these other--"
2005.05-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.29,2385.94,Congress said that.
2005.05-260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2385.94,2392.939,"--Well, I was actually interested in what your response was because I thought you have an interest in not losing your recovery in all those other cases."
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2392.939,2397.804,"Your Honor, we are very comfortable within the law that this Court has set out."
2005.05-260,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2399.992,2418.476,"Well... well, why should you be if... if an... if this... if you prevail in this case and then every other personal injury lawyer will make sure that that recovery goes into a trust for the care of the accident victims, never goes into their own investment account."
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2418.476,2427.456,"Your Honor, that presumes that... that we don't have things that we can do along the way before it comes into the attorney's hands."
2005.05-260,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2430.061,2433.26,"Yes, but Justice Breyer's question is the eggs have gotten scrambled."
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2445.94,2449.639,Justice Breyer's example is one specifically related to commingling.
2005.05-260,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2451.833,2453.671,"Well, that's what I meant by scrambled eggs."
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2453.671,2460.891,"--But if... if you go out and, you know, give out dollar bills on the street till it's all gone... we accept that there are limits to our recovery."
2005.05-260,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2460.891,2462.068,"Well, how about Justice Breyer's hypothetical?"
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2470.149,2481.901,The... the commingling situation is one in which the courts would look to see if the person is still essentially in possession of the funds as the Court stated in GreatWest.
2005.05-260,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2485.849,2491.82,"Under that... under Justice Breyer's hypothetical, a court, consistently with ERISA, could give an equitable remedy?"
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2491.82,2492.787,"--Yes, absolutely."
2005.05-260,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2492.787,2493.164,Okay.
2005.05-260,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2493.164,2514.158,"But... but if the recovery is set up in such a way that it never goes into the personal account of the accident victims and, instead, just what happened in GreatWest, isn't that what every personal injury lawyer will do if you prevail in this case?"
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2514.158,2521.223,"Then, Justice Ginsburg, we would test the language at the end of GreatWest and we would have to go after a different defendant."
2005.05-260,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2539.695,2545.748,Would California allow you to intervene when it has a no subrogation rule?
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2545.748,2551.957,"There, I believe there's a strong argument that California might not have permitted us to intervene at all."
2005.05-260,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2551.957,2560.95,"Well, then how are you going to prevent the funds from being commingled or being assigned immediately to a trust?"
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2560.95,2561.71,I think there are--
2005.05-260,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2561.71,2567.42,And I'm not sure how you can avoid also the trustee being one of the named plaintiffs.
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2567.42,2579.016,"--I... I think that our remedy is under (a)(3), Your Honor, and that we would... we would try to act under (a)(3) in terms of enforcing our equitable rights that exist."
2005.05-260,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2579.016,2580.776,Or you might try to get ERISA amended.
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2583.797,2588.995,"I'm sure you'll wish us luck with that, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2622.53,2628.816,Your theory is that your argument would be exactly the same if you did not have this provision in your contract.
2005.05-260,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2638.409,2649.394,"--We have a right that exists in equity independent of the plan, but (a)(3) does have that language that you seek appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the plan."
2005.05-260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2747.414,2750.696,"Thank you, Mr. Coleman."
2005.05-260,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2764.136,2766.408,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2798.571,2802.863,"How is this... to go to your first point, how is this specifically identifiable?"
2005.05-260,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2823.041,2825.629,"I don't think that's correct, with respect."
2005.05-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2842.525,2845.029,So we... how enforced?
2005.05-260,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2849.395,2850.405,I don't think that's right.
2005.05-260,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2912.481,2920.212,"Well, what would happen if this case were a weak case on... on liability and it was settled for $60,000?"
2005.05-260,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2922.65,2938.185,"I think... in general, I think that the terms of the plan, both under ERISA law and under these traditional equitable principles that we've talked about or I mentioned just now, that the plan would likely be entitled to get... get up to the amount of the medical expenses--"
2005.05-260,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2938.185,2941.884,Presumably such a weak... such a weak claim would not be brought because there--
2005.05-260,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2941.884,2942.644,--Right.
2005.05-260,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.178,2944.072,--there's nothing at the end of it.
2005.05-260,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2944.072,2959.272,"--It is the case that in extreme cases, for example, the beneficiary has collected the medical benefits, does have some leverage over the plan, and in fact, the plan... and... and can say, well, I'm not going to bring the claim, I'm not going to, you know, do what I can to collect the money unless we come to some kind of agreement."
2005.05-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2985.309,2995.562,"Are these claims subject to the qualifications that go along with the equitable lien, the make whole, whatever the applicable rules are?"
2005.05-260,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2995.562,2999.761,"Well, first of all, make whole I think is best... there are a variety of make whole rules."
2005.05-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3030.08,3032.768,So that wouldn't apply here because you're relying on the contract.
2005.05-260,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3032.768,3034.362,"Right, where you... where the parties have specified."
2005.05-260,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3055.373,3067.869,"So even if you had an early neutral evaluator who said this entire claim with pain and suffering, the medical, it's... all together it's $100,000."
2005.05-260,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3075.399,3080.659,"I think, first of all, the... the question presented in this case is whether there's a cause of action."
2005.05-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3108.45,3111.388,"So what if the plan said... you know, this is an insurance company."
2005.05-260,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3123.14,3135.331,"The Court has recognized that... that Federal courts, especially in an unusual circumstance like that... but Federal courts do have the obligation under ERISA to determine a common law of rights and obligations under ERISA plans."
2005.05-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3144.739,3147.593,But you would still call that an equitable claim?
2005.05-260,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3147.593,3148.443,--Yes.
2005.05-260,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3223.51,3233.779,It would apply simply as a matter of... of contract construction in determining what the contract was that... that would be looked to for determining what equitable remedy would be available.
2005.05-260,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3233.779,3234.212,--That's right.
2005.05-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3328.367,3330.055,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
2005.05-260,3,38345,peter_k_stris,,3333.16,3334.921,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-260,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3505.631,3509.631,"Thank you, Mr. Stris. The case is submitted."
