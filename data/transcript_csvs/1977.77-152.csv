1977.77-152,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,81.306,We will hear arguments next in Beth Israel Hospital against the Labor Board. [conferring]
1977.77-152,0,34309,louis_chandler,,85.994,90.699,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-152,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,217.687,220.962,Who is speaking in this material you are reading?
1977.77-152,0,34309,louis_chandler,,220.962,231.576,"This is union literature distributed by employees in the cafeteria at Beth Israel Hospital, in an area where patients and their families frequent."
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1694.295,1706.172,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1977.77-152,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1785.523,1794.978,Do you challenge the findings that a significant number of non-employees use that cafeteria over a period of a year?
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1794.978,1827.297,"The findings of the Board which were sustained by the Court of Appeals and which are based upon a survey hospital conducted that appear at record Appendix 124 shows that employees purchase 77% of the meals served in this cafeteria, visitors 9%, and patients only 1.56%."
1977.77-152,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1888.202,1894.765,"These controversial matters, these communications?"
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1894.765,1898.154,"Well, they were not Union organizational matters."
1977.77-152,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1898.154,1900.889,But they were controversial in any respect.
1977.77-152,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1900.889,1902.314,Red Cross.
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1902.314,1921.455,"Well, the trial examiner, at petitioners Appendix 33, indicates the nature of them."
1977.77-152,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1961.851,1966.147,Mr. Come following up a little bit on the Chief Justice's question.
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2003.453,2036.342,"I submit Your Honor that although some of this literature perhaps gets to the outer fringes, it is still a probe test working conditions and often Union literature on that subject is not for exactly the language of the filer."
1977.77-152,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2067.348,2074.641,"Well, the emphasis is on distribute, doesn't the record show that these are left on the tables and available to anybody?"
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2074.641,2086.699,I think that all that the record shows what employee Schunior distributed and what she was disciplined for.
1977.77-152,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2148.898,2151.604,And the restrooms you have got restrooms.
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2151.604,2152.299,And the restrooms.
1977.77-152,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2152.299,2155.339,I can conceive how you pass them out. [Laughter]
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2155.339,2159.617,The restrooms were joining the locker rooms as I understand it.
1977.77-152,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2249.949,2252.948,What about the locker rooms that you have just spoken to us about.
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2258.888,2265.153,"Well, those locker rooms are not open to all employees."
1977.77-152,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2265.153,2271.713,"Well, any employee that is interested can carry a literature in there if he wants to can't he?"
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2271.713,2275.542,Not every employee can get access to those locker rooms.
1977.77-152,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2275.542,2279.967,What about the entrance to the hospital?
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2285.876,2307.835,"Well, the hospital's rule as I understand it also preclude the distribution of literature in front of the hospital and as a matter a fact in the second Board case involving the Beth Israel Hospital which is still pending before the Board."
1977.77-152,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2318.211,2327.084,"Do the employees of this hospital use the same front entrance that the patients and the visitors do, if so it is the first hospital that I have ever heard of?"
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2333.866,2335.696,So far as the record show --
1977.77-152,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2335.696,2337.302,400-bed hospital?
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2337.302,2340.036,There is no such restriction.
1977.77-152,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2340.036,2343.653,Well I would not believe it unless you could demonstrate it affirmatively on the record.
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2348.129,2358.727,"Well, there maybe an employees entrance but in so far as the record shows there is no indication that they are confined to entering the hospital through that entrance."
1977.77-152,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2358.727,2364.323,"But the place for distribution to employees is at the employee's entrance, is it not?"
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2372.0,2381.27,"Well, that is certainly not the rule with respect to other establishments."
1977.77-152,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2444.422,2453.225,"Even when it is only 77% of the employees and the balance is someone other than employees, that is the figure you gave as I understood it."
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2471.453,2480.217,"Well, an accommodation has to be made between the organizational rights of the employees and those of the hospital."
1977.77-152,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2480.217,2485.182,Do you think some consideration needs to be given to the patients on the purpose of running a hospital?
1977.77-152,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2485.182,2506.034,"Yes, Your Honor and the Boards St. John's principle in which the board attempted to accommodate the general Republic Aviation principles to the special needs of the hospital is an effort to make such an accommodation."
1977.77-152,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3006.409,3010.529,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-152,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3068.708,3076.717,"Mr. Gold, do you view this primarily as a review of a rule making proceeding or as an adjudication?"
1977.77-152,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3076.717,3081.335,I would believe that it is of an adjudication.
1977.77-152,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3081.335,3083.817,Substantial evidence considered on a rule?
1977.77-152,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3083.817,3102.08,"That is right, in other words, the Board has, at least since the Republic Aviation case, followed this approach of stating a presumption and then litigating the applicability of the presumption in particular cases."
1977.77-152,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3102.08,3119.051,We will resume there at 1 o'clock.
1977.77-152,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3129.807,3131.93,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.77-152,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3154.523,3162.286,It is like this that is in quotation marks if I may quote you that perhaps creates the problem.
1977.77-152,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3175.047,3184.447,"Well, what the Board has done is say that in certain areas, rules are presumptively lawful and others presumptively unlawful, and the burden --"
1977.77-152,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3184.447,3198.338,"In a factory as you know and I know and we all know, except for a rare exception of a visiting fireman, the only people lunching are the employees and perhaps officers of the company."
1977.77-152,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3215.174,3223.749,"Mr. Chief Justice, the figures are that employees and other staff comprise 89% of the customers and there are --"
1977.77-152,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3223.749,3228.128,"Well, (Inaudible) doctors."
1977.77-152,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3228.128,3244.775,"I do not think there will be the doctors would be disturbed nor does the hospital argue it, and so the question is whether the 1.5% patients and 10% guests argue for a different presumption."
1977.77-152,3,34309,louis_chandler,,3715.03,3716.672,"Yes, Your Honor."
1977.77-152,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3716.672,3720.122,We have enlarged your time to compensate for your friends.
1977.77-152,3,34309,louis_chandler,,3720.122,3720.881,Thank you.
1977.77-152,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3829.072,3830.228,What page?
1977.77-152,3,34309,louis_chandler,,3830.228,3832.566,This is on page 49.
1977.77-152,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3888.482,3892.858,"Well, wouldn't that be a crime?"
1977.77-152,3,34309,louis_chandler,,3892.858,3893.61,Excuse me Your Honor.
1977.77-152,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3893.61,3897.54,Wouldn't it be a crime to fight?
1977.77-152,3,34309,louis_chandler,,3897.54,3898.42,Would it be a crime?
1977.77-152,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3898.42,3899.569,"Yes, it would be a crime."
1977.77-152,3,34309,louis_chandler,,3903.353,3903.948,You are right Your honor.
1977.77-152,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3903.948,3905.666,That solves that problem.
1977.77-152,3,34309,louis_chandler,,3908.372,3924.344,"No, we do not Your Honor, but the Board has recognized in a retail store setting and a restaurant setting that solicitation can be disruptive, and if they give that kind of consideration in the McDonald's hamburger place we would expect that they would be able to apply that same logic to a hospital setting."
1977.77-152,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3924.344,3942.917,"There are only complaint I would say that you are really lying which is the complain about the NLRB being consistent and then nothing we have been able to do so far to compel them to do that, so (Inaudible) doing on this case."
1977.77-152,3,34309,louis_chandler,,3942.917,3963.334,I would hope that this case where there is express congressional intent to give the needs of the patient's special attention that this would be the case where the Board has acted contrary to that congressional intent and where the Court should strike them down as did the Tenth Circuit and DC Circuit Courts in the St. John's and Baylor Cases.
