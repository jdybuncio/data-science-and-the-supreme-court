1995.95-354,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.609,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-354, James O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corporation."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,11.761,14.472,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-354,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,80.123,99.957,"Mr. Daly, the question on which we granted certiorari was whether a plaintiff can allege a prima facie case under the Age Discrimination Act by showing that he was replaced simply by a younger person, or does he have to show that he was replaced by someone outside the protected class."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,99.957,101.227,"Thank you, sir, I--"
1995.95-354,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,101.227,107.911,I think some of the facts that you're talking about would be relevant perhaps in the trial court or the court of appeals but less relevant here.
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,107.911,109.341,"--Well, I appreciate that."
1995.95-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,127.174,130.535,"I'm not sure why he needs the presumption, given the facts you've stated."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,139.552,142.554,"In the Fourth Circuit in this case, it was not."
1995.95-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,149.549,159.537,"Well, I know under McDonnell Douglas he wouldn't have one, but what does it take to establish enough to survive a motion for summary judgment?"
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,159.537,179.649,"In the Fourth Circuit it takes nexus, and they held that he did not have nexus because, even though under the record it's quite possible that the boss came in and said you're too old for this kind of work on the very day that the decision was made, since he was fired 2 weeks later, the circuit court said there's not enough nexus."
1995.95-354,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.928,196.531,"Mr. Daly, I thought that the Fourth Circuit said that that was just a sporadic comment, bantering."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,201.234,204.016,They said that they were stray remarks.
1995.95-354,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,204.016,204.306,Right.
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,204.306,216.464,"Yes, but the record shows that the person that made the decision, Ed Williams, made the remark on the decision day, arguably, O'Connor you are too damn old for this kind of work."
1995.95-354,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,224.128,235.776,"And I take it... correct me if I'm wrong... that if you prevail in your argument on the prima facie case and you obtain a reversal, then you're hoping to be able to go to trial, and then you can talk about all this evidence."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,235.776,236.417,That's correct.
1995.95-354,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,237.388,241.159,"All right, but then maybe we should get back to the prima facie case."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,241.159,242.862,"--Thank you, Justice Kennedy."
1995.95-354,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.396,286.469,"Well, do you take the position that, under the McDonnell Douglas framework, a plaintiff has to show that he was replaced, or she, by a younger worker, or do you adopt what the SG appears to be arguing, that a plaintiff doesn't have to prove that he was replaced at all in the McDonnell Douglas framework?"
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,286.469,288.102,We adopt both positions.
1995.95-354,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,294.294,299.329,But obviously we're going to have to articulate what's required.
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,300.819,301.55,I--
1995.95-354,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,301.55,303.863,--on which is the better approach?
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,303.863,321.656,"--Our position is that all you need to do in this case is to say that the replacement was younger, and leave for a later day the case that's not presented, which is the case of whether there needs to be any showing about the characteristics of the replacement at all."
1995.95-354,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,321.656,338.616,"Is your position as uncompromising as it sounds when you say you need only allege replacement by a younger person, or do you mean that there must be a replacement by a person sufficiently younger so that it might reasonably be the case that age had been the reason?"
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,345.24,351.645,"Yes, although that's not the case presented here."
1995.95-354,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,351.645,352.123,I realize.
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,352.123,356.888,"It's a difficult line to draw, as all lines are difficult to draw, but--"
1995.95-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.888,366.154,"Or another way to put it would be that the result is irrational, which is what you charge the... your opponent's position would be."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,377.411,383.025,--It really plays into the alternate argument that you shouldn't require anything at all.
1995.95-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.285,424.542,"As I understand the effect of this prima facie case, it is to entitle the plaintiff to judgment if the employer does not come forward with an explanation."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,425.752,427.885,"That is the correct statement, along with St. Mary's."
1995.95-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,427.885,432.646,Is there no due process limitation upon that?
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,463.457,464.296,Precisely yes.
1995.95-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.222,472.772,That seems to you like due process of law.
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,486.071,511.688,"In the very unusual case in which the employer articulates no explanation, which is the very unusual case, that presumption would establish enough to go to the jury and if the jury believed, on that evidence alone, that there had been age discrimination, then under this Court's precedents and the test we announced, you could get a judgment, just as--"
1995.95-354,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,511.688,522.385,"--Have we held that the presumption applies, that the McDonnell Douglas presumption, the prima facie case rule, applies in an ADEA case?"
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,522.385,524.868,"--No, you have not held that."
1995.95-354,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,524.868,531.481,"I take it that the respondent... and correct me if I'm wrong, how you interpret his brief... doesn't take issue with that."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,539.346,540.378,No.
1995.95-354,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,568.825,573.67,"Well, the reason I ask is because Justice Scalia's question indicates that perhaps we should think about it."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,596.604,610.505,"Well, I don't think you're making that much of an empirical judgment, because as a litigation practicality, once... there's almost always a statement of, an articulation of a reason by the employer."
1995.95-354,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,610.505,637.951,"Why would there be, because this applies not just to dismissals, it's also refusals to hire, isn't it, and it's also when you reduce force and you have two people doing the job of four, and so why... I mean, and it's the same problem whether or not you are interested in the question before this Court, because somebody 40 years old is not hired, and they hire somebody 39-1/2 years old."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,645.828,646.266,Well--
1995.95-354,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,646.266,656.715,"He then... and then under those circumstances you're saying McDonnell Douglas requires this to go to the jury, so for... I mean, there's no other evidence in the case?"
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,656.715,659.876,--In the very odd case when there's not only--
1995.95-354,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,659.876,674.145,"Well, is it very odd that people sometimes hire people where there are very equally qualified, and one is a few months older than the other, and you don't really know why, you just thought this was a little better, this person, you're not sure?"
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,675.435,696.151,"--I'm sure it happens, but the function of the presumption is to sort out the generality of cases in which we have identified factors that, as a due process matter, allow you to say with some assurance that it is more likely than not that there's been a prohibited reason."
1995.95-354,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,696.151,704.428,"Mr. Daly, you said that all of the circuits adopt the McDonnell Douglas test, but they don't all adopt it in the same way."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,737.779,751.88,"To that extent, you are correct that the circuits have not absolutely adopted the McDonnell Douglas test as written, except for the First Circuit in the Loeb case and the Banco Santienda case most recently."
1995.95-354,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,776.844,790.916,"It embraces the case that a couple of my colleagues are talking, where someone 55, 56 is replaced by someone 55, where it certainly isn't a rational presumption, it doesn't seem to me."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,790.916,797.988,"When someone 56 is replaced by someone 55, it is entirely possible that the motive is age discrimination."
1995.95-354,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,816.111,827.448,"But are you saying that it is the most logical assumption, if someone 56 is replaced by someone 55, that there's been discrimination because of age?"
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,827.448,828.57,Yes.
1995.95-354,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,829.068,831.742,I certainly don't agree with you on that.
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,831.742,847.159,"--If you have a person who is qualified and who sought the job, and who's within the protected class, and who didn't get the job, we say that at that point it is fair to call on the other side for an explanation."
1995.95-354,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,847.159,855.555,"Mr. Daly, why do you say that considering... what was the difference in age between your client and the person who got the job?"
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,855.555,858.987,"The difference in age was 16 years, which survives under any--"
1995.95-354,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,858.987,871.827,"So isn't it sufficient for your case simply to say, you don't have to be outside the protected class, that the person who got the job doesn't have to be outside the protected class, period?"
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,871.827,872.388,--That's correct.
1995.95-354,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,898.585,911.672,"Mr. Daly, I want to get clear... going back, I guess, to your original answer to Justice Scalia's question, I want to get clear on what you think happens in applying the so called prima facie case rule, or presumption rule."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,939.561,941.271,"Yes, exactly, an articulation."
1995.95-354,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,941.271,941.521,Okay.
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,961.894,962.285,Right.
1995.95-354,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,962.285,962.795,All right.
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,982.658,982.919,Right.
1995.95-354,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,983.439,985.262,It's going to depend on what else you put in.
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,985.262,986.492,"--On pretext, yes."
1995.95-354,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,986.492,987.043,Yes.
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,987.043,987.383,Yes.
1995.95-354,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,987.383,1000.97,"So there's no... so we keep using prima facie case, and so do you, but you don't mean by it that there is a prima facie... before the moment at which the employer either gives a reason or stands mute, you don't mean by that that there is a case that goes to the jury."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,1000.97,1003.201,"No, not at all."
1995.95-354,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1006.224,1008.307,It's the silence which is evidence--
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,1008.307,1009.135,--Exactly.
1995.95-354,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1009.135,1010.898,--if the employer doesn't come up with a reason.
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,1016.692,1032.781,"If you meet the presumption... if you mail a letter, and you put it in the post office box, and you put the right postage on it, and you properly address it, and you prove those facts, you get to the jury on that and the jury can consider what the person who is supposed to have gotten the letter wants to say."
1995.95-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1032.781,1046.662,"And the jury is able to come in with a verdict for the plaintiff based on nothing other than the fact that he fired someone who was 55, hired someone who was 54-1/2, and stood mute when asked what the reason was."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,1046.662,1058.028,"Right, and this employer comes into court and sits there with his lawyer and says absolutely nothing, and you've got a perfectly qualified 55-year-old who didn't get the job, was replaced by a younger person."
1995.95-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1058.028,1077.473,"That would be the case even when the person who did the hiring was a former employee of the employer who is now dead, or has since been fired and is antagonistic to the employer and the employer says, gee, you know, it was one of my agents that did it, he's no longer with the company, I can't give you a reason, and you'd say the plaintiff would still be entitled to judgment."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,1077.473,1077.806,No.
1995.95-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1080.425,1081.991,He hasn't given a reason.
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,1081.991,1082.491,The presumption only--
1995.95-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.491,1083.025,He hasn't given a reason.
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,1084.756,1090.35,"--Well, he's articulated a nondiscriminatory reason, I suppose, which is that we can't tell what--"
1995.95-354,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1090.35,1090.741,"No, listen to me."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,1106.511,1106.839,--Right.
1995.95-354,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1106.839,1109.323,"That's all you have to say, and that's the end to all these presumptions."
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,1119.739,1125.894,"No, I don't, but in all presumptions there are going to be cases at the margins."
1995.95-354,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1125.894,1129.286,Are you aware of any case that had those bare bones facts in it?
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,1135.05,1140.912,"I don't bring cases if a person who comes in and says, I'm 40, I was replaced by a 39-1/2."
1995.95-354,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1144.235,1145.296,Thank you--
1995.95-354,0,25220,george_daly,,1145.296,1146.326,I wouldn't go to trial--
1995.95-354,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1146.326,1147.447,--Thank you.
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1150.139,1163.039,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-354,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1200.042,1211.39,"Mr. Wolfson, those courts that have adopted the within the class rule that you have to show that whoever you fired was within the protected class, or outside the protected class, I'm sorry--"
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1211.39,1211.7,Right.
1995.95-354,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.7,1220.135,"--have they applied that only for purposes of the McDonnell Douglas rule, or have they applied that as a substantive test for liability as well?"
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1221.708,1224.549,Theoretically you can do the one without the other.
1995.95-354,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1280.816,1288.57,"Well, Mr. Wolfson, you suggested a moment ago that perhaps the plaintiff could prevail on the basis of the McDonnell Douglas test."
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1296.066,1300.228,"No, and in some cases it wouldn't even allow the plaintiff to go to the factfinder."
1995.95-354,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1300.228,1303.109,But does it ever allow the plaintiff to do more than that?
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1303.109,1304.741,No.
1995.95-354,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1311.066,1318.118,"Well, if the employer is mute, then my understanding was it allowed you to go to the jury, but you're saying it entitles you to judgment?"
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1318.118,1327.225,"--If a plaintiff makes... under Hicks, if a plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, and the employer is entirely mute, then judgment must be entered for the plaintiff."
1995.95-354,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1336.061,1349.19,"Mr. Wolfson, on the second step of McDonnell Douglas, there are cases saying what that reason must be and, as I recall, it doesn't have to be a good reason as long as it's a nondiscriminatory reason."
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1349.19,1349.989,--That's correct.
1995.95-354,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1360.007,1361.509,It does have to be something more than I don't know.
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1362.698,1366.001,"--The answer... in effect the answer is never, I don't know."
1995.95-354,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1373.377,1376.637,"Could it be that I prefer gregarious people, or I prefer quiet people?"
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1376.637,1377.208,--Yes.
1995.95-354,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1398.252,1403.016,"Well, why does the factfinder have to believe the employer's reason?"
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1403.016,1407.288,"No, it's not that the factfinder has to believe the employer's reason."
1995.95-354,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1430.154,1439.051,"What I'm trying to get at is, one... at one point you grant summary judgment to the defendant because the plaintiff hasn't made an adequate showing."
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1456.703,1457.601,"--Well, let me be clear."
1995.95-354,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1481.237,1484.999,"And who decides the question of whether it's false or not, the jury?"
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1484.999,1485.42,"--Well, the--"
1995.95-354,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1485.42,1486.121,Or the judge?
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1487.05,1495.746,"--The jury has... the jury, ultimately, but only if... only if... it only gets to the jury if there is some evidence tending to discredit what the employer's case is."
1995.95-354,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.746,1496.417,--Is that enough?
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1502.841,1504.052,A pretext for discrimination.
1995.95-354,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1504.052,1504.793,"Ah, okay."
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1504.793,1504.921,All right.
1995.95-354,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1505.332,1509.526,"But what if you just show that's false, but you haven't shown any evidence of age discrimination?"
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1519.263,1519.872,--I think it--
1995.95-354,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1519.872,1520.653,--to sustain judgment?
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1520.653,1527.829,"--If the only... if the employer's only explanation is, I didn't like the way... I thought he was not gregarious."
1995.95-354,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1527.829,1528.648,Right.

1995.95-354,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1544.368,1546.76,"Well, that is... by hypothesis at that point it has gone to the jury."

1995.95-354,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1586.709,1587.157,"--Well, why not?"

1995.95-354,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1594.012,1596.553,But you... the jury is free to disbelieve any witness.

1995.95-354,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1604.32,1614.496,"Mr. Wolfson, is it because this Court has said once the defendant articulates... not proves, just articulates a nondiscriminatory reason, then the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show--"
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1614.496,1615.227,To show pretext.
1995.95-354,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1615.227,1617.358,--that it was indeed proscribed discrimination?
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1617.358,1623.822,"Right, and that is the burden of persuasion at the pretext stage, that the employee has to come forward with that evidence."
1995.95-354,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1623.822,1631.376,"It's not clear what we mean by pretext, though, or I... I think what we mean by pretext is, he has to show not only that it's false but that it's a cover for discrimination."
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1631.376,1632.297,Yes.
1995.95-354,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1632.297,1634.298,Just showing that it's false is not enough.
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1634.298,1655.442,"Well, it is enough if the only explanation that the employer comes forward with is shown by the employee to be entirely false, and if there was evidence the employee has made, because then the factfinder could conclude that the reason why the employer is lying is because it was engaging in age discrimination, but there has to--"
1995.95-354,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.442,1663.927,"Why wouldn't the jury conclude he's lying because the procedural gimmicks that we've set up requires him to come up with an answer, whether he has one or not?"
1995.95-354,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1676.075,1690.865,"--Well, that is part of the fact that the risk of nonpersuasion is on the employee, and the employee has to come forward with the evidence that the employer's offered reason was a pretext for discrimination."
1995.95-354,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1715.952,1717.352,"Thank you, Mr. Wolfson."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,1720.126,1730.411,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1834.119,1836.05,"Well, why isn't that at least a starting point?"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,1836.05,1852.803,"--It's a starting point but not sufficient for prima facie, Mr. Chief Justice, because in... this Court in Hazen Paper I think makes clear that the essence, the particular essence of the age act is differential treatment, and differential treatment is not just a difference in numbers."
1995.95-354,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1871.076,1872.919,"Well, Mr.--"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,1872.919,1874.608,"--that relates to that, the different... the numbers alone are not sufficient."
1995.95-354,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1874.608,1890.51,"--Mr. Spears, do you take the position that if a 65-year-old worker is replaced by a 41-year-old worker, that it cannot constitute a violation of the ADEA?"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,1890.51,1891.651,That alone?
1995.95-354,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1891.651,1891.759,Right.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,1916.836,1917.416,No.
1995.95-354,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1919.667,1920.298,There can be.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,1920.298,1921.748,--Not on that alone.
1995.95-354,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1931.195,1940.472,"Okay, but you would say it's a different case if a 50-year-old worker were replaced by someone 39."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,1940.472,1948.457,"I can't differentiate between those two because, with all respect, that's simply a difference in numbers."
1995.95-354,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1951.569,1963.326,But I gather in the court of appeals that we're reviewing here in the Fourth Circuit if it were 39 that would have been enough for a McDonnell Douglas presumption.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,1963.326,1965.547,--That's correct.
1995.95-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1965.547,1967.928,"Well, you agree with the court of appeals, don't you?"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,1967.928,1969.16,"Oh, entirely."
1995.95-354,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1975.835,1987.273,But why should it make any difference if you have the 65-year-old replaced by the 41-year-old versus a 55-year-old replaced by a 39-year-old?
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,1988.204,1989.574,"Justice O'Connor, I think there are two reasons for that."
1995.95-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2035.056,2035.985,"--Well, just--"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2035.985,2037.006,And that's contrary to the age--
1995.95-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.006,2048.583,"--Just to fill out the numbers of hypotheticals, we should add to Justice O'Connor's hypothetical a hypothetical of someone who is 40 who is fired and replaced by someone who is 39."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2054.618,2067.467,"--Yes, and the reason I think that case is appropriate, even though you can always construct some difference of numbers that might appear arbitrary or may appear even nonsensical, that while that--"
1995.95-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.467,2070.478,I think that's a fair description.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2070.478,2083.418,"--But even though that may be true, it focuses upon whether or not there's an inference that the plaintiff's age made any difference, and I think that's what he's--"
1995.95-354,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2083.418,2097.827,"Well, if we're going to resort to some kind if presumptions based on inferences, why shouldn't we try to make them rational, things that we would think could properly lead the factfinder to infer something or other?"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2100.969,2108.816,--All we're saying is that those distinctions alone should not be sufficient to establish a prima facie case.
1995.95-354,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2120.274,2121.103,"Well, you keep talking about that."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2138.313,2151.814,"--Well, there was an allegation, and that was the heart, the center of the plaintiff's case, and they felt, because the actual replacement was within the protected age class, that did not meet its test."
1995.95-354,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2151.814,2155.687,May I ask a question about... we're arguing all about McDonnell Douglas now.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2167.166,2173.939,"The fourth element has... of course, McDonnell Douglas facts were hiring phase, but even there--"
1995.95-354,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2173.939,2175.551,"It was a refusal to hire case, of course, too."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2175.551,2175.892,--Yes.
1995.95-354,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2175.892,2183.726,"You have to prove qualification, the position remained open, and they interviewed people afterwards and they ultimately hired someone."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2187.288,2193.673,"No, but it did say, the fourth element says someone who had the qualifications comparable to the plaintiff."
1995.95-354,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2193.673,2194.084,Correct.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2194.084,2198.265,"They did relate to some extent, even in a hiring context, to other people."
1995.95-354,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2198.265,2198.646,Yes.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2198.646,2211.245,"And... but footnote 13 in McDonnell Douglas I think anticipated a lot of confusion, which I think has occurred, and said different claims, different fact situations will call for the different formulations of the prima facie."
1995.95-354,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2211.245,2218.759,"Well, isn't that necessary, if you're dealing with a hiring case and you're going to apply the standard to a promotion case, that there has to be some adjustment?"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2218.759,2222.342,And discharge and demotion and... yes.
1995.95-354,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.027,2304.067,"The one requirement of McDonnell Douglas that hasn't been emphasized very much in the argument so far is one of the elements of the prima facie case is to prove that the person is qualified for the job, which then you say, why did you fire him?"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2319.325,2320.807,Yes.
1995.95-354,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2320.807,2323.107,And I guess you don't deny that that proof was met in this case.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2323.107,2325.559,"No, we do dispute that."
1995.95-354,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2341.961,2353.89,"But we never got to that in the case itself because the plaintiff here was disqualified, was he not, because the person who was put in the position was over 40?"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2353.89,2359.555,"--Justice Ginsburg, the court did get to that because of the Rule 56 summary judgment motion."
1995.95-354,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2373.204,2377.197,Well then we wouldn't even have the issue posed on which we granted review.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2421.904,2425.748,"Justice Ginsburg, the entire case in the Fourth Circuit was not about that."
1995.95-354,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2425.748,2428.169,But isn't that the issue on which we granted cert?
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2428.169,2435.425,"That is the issue on which we granted cert, but I don't think that can be viewed in a vacuum here with regard to why the plaintiff lost."
1995.95-354,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2435.425,2444.912,"Well then maybe, if plaintiff lost, if that's an irrelevant question, if plaintiff lost independent of the answer to that question, then I suppose you're telling us we should not have granted review."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2444.912,2449.814,"Well, that's not for me to comment upon, whether you should or shouldn't."
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2462.532,2480.425,"Well, are you taking the position that if, in fact, we conclude that on the point on which we took cert that the Fourth Circuit was wrong, that we will nonetheless have to affirm the case because there was another element of McDonnell Douglas which was found by the court, by the Fourth Circuit, not to have been met?"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2481.564,2491.161,"Not... well, there was another analysis of McDonnell Douglas under writ, but beyond that, Justice Souter, the Rule 56 motion required the opposing party to put--"
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2491.161,2494.694,"No, I'm... with respect, I'm just asking you about the McDonnell Douglas presumption."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2518.119,2529.568,"--Yes, for that reason and an additional reason, because Rule 56 required the opposing party to put their evidence out there, the court evaluated all the evidence--"
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2529.568,2530.958,"No, but we just took a McDonnell Douglas case."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2530.958,2531.769,--Excuse me?
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2531.769,2534.301,"I mean, we just took this case for the McDonnell Douglas--"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2534.301,2536.844,That issue was the limited issue before this Court.
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2536.844,2537.504,--Yes.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2537.504,2538.215,But that deal with--
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2538.215,2544.589,"And tell me just so that I don't misunderstand it, what is the other prong which the Fourth Circuit held had not been satisfied?"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2547.181,2555.315,"--Under... that he failed to show that anyone was performing at a level equal or lower than him, and that's under the--"
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2555.315,2565.403,"Well, McDonnell Douglas simply requires... as I recall, simply requires a demonstration that the complaining employee was qualified to do the job."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2570.616,2576.72,"--The Fourth Circuit concluded he had not been able to point to anyone else similar to him, similar to--"
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2576.72,2580.463,"That's not my question, and I don't think that's what the McDonnell Douglas criterion is."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2588.097,2590.698,--With regard to the termination replacement prong--
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2590.698,2592.871,Yes or... I think it's a yes or no question.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2592.871,2597.683,"--Well, the... under the issue of termination replacement, it did not address that issue."

1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2602.715,2608.289,"On the termination replacement analysis, but there were other analysis which makes that unnecessary."
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2608.289,2608.68,Well--
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2657.323,2666.528,"I'm saying there was no... as the court is, that there was no issue of that because the employer's explanation was undisputed."
1995.95-354,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2668.9,2673.234,"When you're saying there's no issue does that mean that the third prong, that he's failed to establish the third prong?"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2683.88,2697.62,"Well, not a... but when summary judgment is brought forward, then the evidence has to be... the evidence has to create an issue of fact at the Rule 56 position, and that's exactly where this case was ultimately resolved."
1995.95-354,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2697.62,2700.913,"All right, I... you can just say I'm wrong."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2712.13,2712.571,Right.
1995.95-354,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2712.571,2715.422,"Then, let's see if it's a reduction in force case."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2727.3,2727.941,Correct.
1995.95-354,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2727.941,2728.881,"They said, we just go to the fourth."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2772.219,2773.469,I think so.
1995.95-354,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2773.469,2774.49,"Okay, fine."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2776.291,2777.733,It sounds real good.
1995.95-354,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2777.733,2778.023,Good.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2847.488,2851.081,The prima facie?
1995.95-354,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2851.081,2855.155,"Should it be substantial, or just any difference?"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2882.96,2886.323,It should be neither of those standards.
1995.95-354,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2886.323,2886.784,All right.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2886.784,2896.06,The reasons are that neither of those standards accounts for the reality of life.
1995.95-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2925.149,2928.992,"But I understood this law to be against nature, if you consider that against nature--"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2961.543,2965.294,--That no person's age shall be considered.
1995.95-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.015,2976.263,"Even when you're firing a 67-year-old, if there's a 69-year-old who's been with the company 30 years, and you tell me the normal employer would want to get somebody else who'll be around for a while, the statute says no, you can't do that."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2980.057,2980.334,No.
1995.95-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2980.334,2981.146,It isn't?
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,2981.146,2987.571,"Well, I don't view the statute as mandating any sort of affirmative action for older people, if that's what you're--"
1995.95-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2987.571,2991.554,"Oh, it's... but you cannot say, you know, these two people are even."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3000.07,3001.311,"--No, I don't think so."
1995.95-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3003.782,3010.975,So you're positing that it's in the nature of things that when you fire an older person you normally hire a younger one.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3014.038,3030.4,"Well, I'm saying where a plaintiff in an age discrimination lawsuit relies upon that difference, that reliance simply... and any test of a prima facie doesn't accommodate for what frequently happens without there being any age discrimination clause."
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3030.4,3031.011,"Yes, but isn't it--"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3031.011,3031.78,That's all I'm saying.
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3031.78,3036.685,--Isn't it fair to say that... Benjamin Franklin was right.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3086.396,3090.209,I may have been misunderstood.
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3094.56,3095.021,Good.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3095.392,3096.842,--And if I--
1995.95-354,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.842,3099.453,Justice Powell will be glad to hear that.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3099.714,3103.607,"--If I misspoke on that, I apologize, and I apologize for any confusion I've created by--"
1995.95-354,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3103.607,3116.297,"But Mr. Spears, you are arguing that in the application of McDonnell Douglas there is a bright line between 40 and 39, and if the replacement is 39, you have a case, and if it's 40, you don't."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3117.186,3119.589,"--On the replacement, if that's the age of the replacement."
1995.95-354,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3120.588,3132.385,"Whatever... whether it's a promotion, whether it's initial hiring, whether it's a discharge case, the line you are drawing is between the 39-year-old who gets in, and the 40-year-old."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3136.359,3136.82,--No.
1995.95-354,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3144.373,3149.127,"I thought the Fourth Circuit said, don't give us a person who's in the protected group."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3159.473,3165.266,"For a termination replacement case, yes, Justice Ginsburg, that is precisely what they said, but I think it's limited to that."
1995.95-354,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3167.718,3180.037,"But that's the case that we have here, and that's why your answer to Justice Breyer's question, understandably, is, you're wrong both times, because it doesn't matter to you whether the age differential is 20 years, 25 years."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3191.154,3197.088,"In a termination replacement case, where the plaintiff relies upon that difference, yes."
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3197.088,3204.204,"And is that your position simply because a line has got to be drawn, the statute draws it somewhere, and that's it?"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3221.815,3225.328,"The second part of that, Justice Souter, I don't think is correct, and we don't--"
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3225.328,3227.067,"Okay, so you're simply, a line--"
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3227.067,3227.588,--that came up in the briefs.
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3227.588,3235.132,--You're simply basing your position on the fact that a line has got to be drawn somewhere or your presumption starts getting useless.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3235.132,3243.339,"Well, not that a line has to be drawn, but the line drawn by Congress is the appropriate line, not some other arbitrary or different line."
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3243.339,3243.6,Sure.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3243.868,3244.278,And--
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3244.278,3250.482,But ultimately it's because you should draw a line somewhere or your presumption basically ceases to be useful.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3250.482,3253.955,--Where the presumption of--
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3253.955,3254.295,Yes.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3256.716,3256.977,--Right.
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3256.977,3258.957,--the presumption would produce results which were irrational.
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3258.957,3262.63,I think they'd produce results contrary to the intent of Congress in the age act.
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3263.371,3264.681,"That, too, I suppose."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3264.681,3269.266,"--Yes, and so I think a line should be drawn and the Fourth Circuit--"
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3269.266,3269.506,But not--
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3269.506,3269.987,--drew the right line.
1995.95-354,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3269.987,3281.344,"--But not because Congress intended that there would be no liability under the age act in the event that the person hired was, himself, within the protected class."
1995.95-354,2,33149,james_b_spears,,3282.504,3285.298,"That's not our position, and there's an EEOC guidance on that."
1995.95-354,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3372.204,3373.316,"Thank you, Mr. Spears."
