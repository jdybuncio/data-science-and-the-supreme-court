1976.76-423,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.461,"We will hear arguments next in 76-423, Puyallup Tribe against the Department of Game of Washington."
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,61.569,63.739,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.76-423,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,440.024,450.321,I had thought your question presented for writ of certiorari was that the State Court simply lack jurisdiction to hail the tribal court before it.
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,455.53,459.324,"No, Your Honor, both propositions are presented here."
1976.76-423,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,492.097,502.021,"And would that extend to individual Indians, as well as the tribe, if it depends on Article II of the treaty, that pre-emption?"
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,502.021,524.549,"Your Honor, that would be the case except there are qualifications with regard to individual Indians; namely, other provisions of Federal law, perhaps the Indian Civil Rights Act, but basically we think that that pre-emptive argument would apply to the individuals, as well."
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,532.815,539.023,"Mr. Rodgers, you said Proposition 1 allows that the reservation still exists and has not been terminated."
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,539.023,539.473,That is correct.
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,539.473,543.998,"And that, you say, was accepted by the Supreme Court of the State of Washington in this case?"
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,543.998,544.718,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,544.718,552.825,Could you tell me offhand where in its opinion that factual proposition is accepted or --
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,552.825,576.246,"I cannot, Your Honor, except that in the course of the opinion, the findings below were accepted, namely, that the Ninth Circuit reservation decision recognized by the State throughout as being dispositive on the status of the reservation was accepted by the State Supreme Court."
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,576.246,585.579,"Because in the first Puyallup case, the Supreme Court of Washington indicated that the reservation had been terminated."
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,585.579,586.014,That is correct.
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.014,590.983,And that was not decided by this Court in the first Puyallup.
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,590.983,592.472,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.7,610.694,We do not have the Ninth Circuit here.
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,612.428,612.478,"That is right, Your Honor."
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.478,614.733,"The Ninth Circuit was in a different case, wasn't it?"
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,614.733,615.573,That is right Your Honor.
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,626.882,630.464,"In this litigation, that is, as it began many years ago --"
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,630.464,630.698,That is correct.
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,630.698,637.795,"-- the first Puyallup decision by the Supreme Court of Washington, the court held -- and you correct me if i am mistaken -- that the reservation had been terminated."
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,637.795,639.117,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,639.117,641.289,And that holding was not disturbed by this Court.
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,641.289,642.021,"Well, this Court specifically --"
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,642.021,647.747,"We said that what we are dealing with is individuals fishing, individual Indians fishing off-reservation."
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,647.747,653.772,"This Court, however, did indicate that the question of the reservation question was not being resolved."
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.772,654.429,Exactly.
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,654.429,671.494,"This Court also indicated the same proposition in the Satiacom case five years later, recognizing the unresolved nature of that proposition; then the Federal Court litigation ensued."
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,671.494,673.151,In a different case.
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,673.151,673.876,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,679.575,681.295,"Well, that is rather important."
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,694.765,696.94,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.56,701.161,All right.
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,704.372,708.914,The reservation boundary does reach suburban Tacoma.
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,708.914,710.361,"In fact, inside the city limits, isn't it?"
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,710.361,713.01,"That is correct, that is correct."
1976.76-423,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.876,734.117,"You are not making any claim of re- -- you did not present any question of Res judicata in your petition for certiorari, did you?"
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,734.117,740.369,"Well, Your Honor, we believe that the question of Res judicata is fairly within the petition for certiorari."
1976.76-423,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,740.369,741.932,"Well, how do you explain that?"
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,759.65,767.31,"We believe that that ought to be read as fairly embracing the issues that would be dispositive and, of course, in our petition --"
1976.76-423,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,767.31,772.8,"Well, what do you mean by that, that it ought to be fairly read as embracing issues that ought to be dispositive?"
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,774.474,785.29,"Your Honor, the Res judicata issue, we believe, because it does establish the reservation, should be recognized as binding and controlling in this case."
1976.76-423,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,795.016,795.75,All right.
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,800.718,802.387,I am prepared to deal with that.
1976.76-423,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,802.387,808.491,"Well, Res judicata in this case would just be a matter of the laws of the State of Washington, wouldn’t it?"
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,808.491,809.225,"No, Your Honor."
1976.76-423,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,810.972,812.078,Why?
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,812.078,835.427,"Because the Res judicata effect to be accorded that Federal judgment, although not directly covered by the full faith and credit statute, we would submit presents a Federal question under principles of the supremacy, basically the Supremacy Clause."
1976.76-423,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.427,840.851,"Well, do you care to articulate that all, because you certainly do not spell it out in your brief at all."
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,843.603,848.004,"No, Your Honor, and that does not address that proposition."
1976.76-423,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,856.706,860.24,What is your authority for that?
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,860.24,869.932,"As we cite in our Reply Brief, Your Honor, the -- well, we do not have case authority for that proposition."
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,869.932,879.175,"Well, your argument is, though, that the State of Washington was constitutionally bound by a decision of the Federal Court."
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,879.175,879.709,That is correct.
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.709,882.011,On an issue under the --
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,882.011,883.096,On two issues.
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,883.096,884.615,Under the Supremacy Clause.
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,884.615,885.708,That is correct.
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,903.332,904.493,But you have no cases.
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,906.717,913.769,"We cite Res judicata cases, including, in fact, one, the City of --"
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.769,921.503,"Yes, but you are not citing anything that says that a state is constitutionally bound to --"
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,921.503,922.619,That is correct.
1976.76-423,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.365,930.342,A case book?
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,930.342,937.868,"It is a very interesting question, because the full faith and credit statute does not address it directly."
1976.76-423,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,937.868,946.215,"You would have thought if Congress intended to have that provision, the full faith and credit statute would have addressed it directly, wouldn’t you?"
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,946.215,963.79,"Not necessarily, Your Honor, for the reason that we believe that it could well be argued that the preclusive effect to be accorded Federal judgments in light of the Supremacy Clause ought well to be governed by Federal law."
1976.76-423,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.79,970.216,"Mr. Rodgers, would this Court be bound by that Res judicata holding?"
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,973.625,980.926,"Your Honor, I would think that this Court clearly if it desired could go on to decide the reservation question."
1976.76-423,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1015.38,1018.25,And both times to go around?
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,1018.25,1034.974,"That would be my next point; but if the Court were inclined to remand, what we would do again is to plead Res judicata of the Federal judgment, and you would then have the entire record of the Ninth Circuit case back here a fourth time, and the issue --"
1976.76-423,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1034.974,1036.832,That would be if we took it.
1976.76-423,0,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,1036.832,1043.038,"That is correct, that is correct."
1976.76-423,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1573.126,1574.317,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1976.76-423,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1610.24,1616.256,"And, third, that the fishing in this case goes on on the reservation, if any."
1976.76-423,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1616.256,1618.565,That the fishing that we are arguing in this case --
1976.76-423,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.565,1626.83,The premise of Puyallup I was that these were individual Indians fishing off the reservation.
1976.76-423,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1626.83,1634.003,"That is correct, and the arguments that I am discussing this morning do not deal with whatever Indian fishing may occur off the reservation."
1976.76-423,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1666.594,1669.219,You mean in the State Supreme Court.
1976.76-423,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1669.219,1673.573,"They did not argue it, either, before the State Superior Court or in the State Supreme Court."
1976.76-423,2,21670,don_s_willner,,2466.242,2470.197,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3685.517,3689.333,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.76-423,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3733.526,3738.55,"I seem to have missed it, but why are they automatically not included in the treaty?"
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3738.55,3740.909,"That is the issue in this case, Your Honor."
1976.76-423,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3740.909,3742.492,"Well, I mean, you stated it as a fact."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3742.492,3750.688,"Well, my opponents say that you cannot get to that question; that you should not decide that question at all."
1976.76-423,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3761.643,3761.987,Yeah.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3765.98,3766.876,Exactly.
1976.76-423,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3766.893,3771.722,"Well, the answer is, suppose you get a brand-new type of fish coming by."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3771.722,3776.971,"If that is a natural fish, I think that the Tribe has both to the benefit -- yes, sir."
1976.76-423,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3776.971,3783.66,Suppose somebody makes a fish and puts him in the river.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3783.66,3791.703,"If the State creates a new breed of fish, that would have exactly the same rights as the hatchery steelhead do."
1976.76-423,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3792.556,3798.436,You mean the treaty is limited to the fish that ran the river when the time the treaty was made.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3798.436,3799.464,The treaty is limited to the --
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3799.464,3800.543,At least to their descendants.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3800.543,3802.423,-- natural fish.
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3802.423,3803.427,And their descendents.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3803.427,3804.549,And their descendents.
1976.76-423,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3833.327,3837.611,"But that is what I said: once you exclude one, you are meant to include the others."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3837.611,3847.641,"If there was something else to include, Your Honor; but not when that something else did not exist until 1950, 100 years after the treaty was written."
1976.76-423,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3916.752,3922.671,"Attorne Generla Gorton, may I ask you a question about the hatchery fish that Justice Marshall’s question prompts?"
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3944.312,3945.532,Enlarged the natural run?
1976.76-423,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3945.532,3946.713,"Yes, enlarged the natural run."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3946.713,3948.363,I would not make that contention.
1976.76-423,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3948.363,3955.939,"So it is not the question of where the funds come from; it is a question it is fish that are artificially added, and it does not really matter how they paid for, I guess."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3955.939,3964.281,"Well, it is a question of where the funds come from in the sense that these funds were used to create a run, which is an addition."
1976.76-423,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3971.732,3978.706,And what if they are simply general-revenue funds that were used to subsidize a new development of a breed of fish or something like that?
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3978.809,3981.182,"Under those circumstances, we would make the same claim."
1976.76-423,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3981.182,3986.727,"So the point I am trying to identify is, it is not critical to your argument that there are license fees being used."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3989.041,3991.134,It is not critical to my argument.
1976.76-423,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3992.75,3992.846,"Well, I understand."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3992.846,3995.878,"He emphasizes that, because he represents the people who may pay those fees."
1976.76-423,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3995.878,3998.469,"It might have something to do with his standing to be here, too."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3998.469,4001.003,It may.
1976.76-423,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4072.312,4097.795,"Mr. Gorton, do you understand your opponent’s sovereign-immunity contention to be that you simply cannot bring the Tribe into court, the Superior Court of the State of Washington, for whatever purpose or more like an NLRB pre-emption type of thing, where because Federal law such as the Treaty of Madison Creek is involved, a State Court cannot pass on it."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4097.795,4110.005,"It is clearly the former, Your Honor, by reason of the argument to which Mr. Willner referred to, that this same counsel are now making in the Ninth Circuit that Federal Courts have no jurisdiction, either."
1976.76-423,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4131.287,4134.591,So counsel may concede that the United States could bring a suit against them.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4134.591,4138.928,"No, they do not concede that the United States could bring a suit against them."
1976.76-423,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4152.981,4155.915,"You mean me and my colleagues, I take it."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4155.915,4162.84,"No, my colleague here was reading from that brief, I am sorry."
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4185.068,4204.347,"Because of perhaps a misapprehension of the Court in Puyallup I, which in the course of its opinion said we do not need to be concerned with the existence or nonexistence of the reservation, because this case involves fishing by Indians off the reservation."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4204.347,4210.2,"I think that your decision in Puyallup I, Mr. Justice Stewart, went considerably further than that."
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4210.2,4213.571,"Well, did the Court say something along those lines in the course of its --"
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4213.571,4217.073,"It did so, but it also said something else."
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4247.979,4249.08,Right.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4249.08,4259.171,"And therefore, the implication was, that it did not make any difference; their on-reservation rights and their off-reservation rights were the same."
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4301.533,4318.905,"What was the purpose, since I have already interrupted you, of the first large section of the opinion of the Supreme Court of Washington in this case, giving its view of how the treaty ought to be construed, a view in conflict with other constructions of the other one?"
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4318.905,4329.27,You effectively have three allocation formulas that are involved with fisheries on the Puyallup at this point.
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4411.503,4418.215,"And the Court in any case, under its construction of the treaty, no net fishing would be permitted at all by Indians."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4418.215,4419.744,"That was, of course, the --"
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4419.744,4426.942,"But what was the function and purpose of that law, an interesting part of the Supreme Court Washington’s opinion?"
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4426.942,4432.447,"I think in order to persuade you that your decision in Puyallup II was incorrect, because you did not have the facts in front of you."
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4432.447,4434.397,In Puyallup I.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4434.397,4437.611,"No, in Puyallup I, you did not require an apportionment."
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4438.652,4442.745,"But that did construe it to allow net fishing, didn’t it?"
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4442.745,4444.445,"I am sorry, I missed your question."
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4444.445,4450.421,Didn't Puyallup I construe the treaty to allow Indians to fish by net?
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4450.421,4454.314,Puyallup I did not construe the treaty in that respect at all --
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4454.314,4454.691,I see.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4454.691,4472.506,"-- because the State Supreme Court in Puyallup I had already vacated the Trial Court's judgment on allocation; and so you had no allocation in front of you in Puyallup I, and you quite specifically stated that you were not going to attempt in Puyallup I to say whether an allocation was required."
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4474.024,4478.857,You have explained now your understanding of why the Supreme Court of Washington wrote that part of its opinion.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4483.309,4513.984,"I am, and there is a considerable section of our brief which is devoted very precisely to that argument, because we feel, as the Supreme Court of the State of Washington did, that our record was incomplete and our State Supreme Court made a misstatement in its decision in Puyallup II, which led you to feel that there was discrimination; that only non-Indians could engage in the sports fishery and that therefore an allocation or apportionment was required."
1976.76-423,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4652.838,4665.336,"Well, the description of the Ninth Circuit opinion in the brief of the United States, it says the Ninth Circuit concluded that the reservation was in existence on Page 5."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4677.73,4680.923,That was in the introduction to the Court's opinion.
1976.76-423,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4680.923,4681.781,But it was not an issue.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4681.781,4689.885,But it was not an issue in the case.
1976.76-423,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4695.124,4695.816,Because --
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4695.816,4704.061,And the quotation in the petitioner’s brief here quotes its complaint in front of the whole --
1976.76-423,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4704.061,4713.353,Because I thought the claim was that the Indian fishing rights were not subject to reconsideration in this case because of decisions in those two other cases.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4713.353,4727.379,"Yes, but I think that case, their claim is based most heavily on the decision by Judge Bolt rather than this, because the Ninth Circuit in a very, very short decision simply stated that the reservation had not been terminated."
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4731.308,4734.322,"Well, was there a decision on fishing rights or not?"
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4734.322,4735.329,There has been a decision.
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4735.329,4738.451,Was there a decision by the Ninth Circuit on fishing rights?
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4738.451,4739.091,Yes.
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4741.194,4743.361,"No, in the case they are talking about."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4743.361,4746.26,"No, I do not believe that there was."
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4769.041,4777.292,"Yes, but he says on the reservation, the State cannot limit their fishing, Judge Bolt."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4777.292,4778.955,"I am sorry, whose?"
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4778.955,4779.188,Judge Bolt.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4779.188,4785.962,"Oh, okay."
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4799.28,4808.764,"Well, the United States gives a cite at Page -- job cite to it here that he decided that on-reservation fishing is not subject to State regulation."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4808.764,4823.918,"I believe that that is correct that he made such a decision, though that was not a matter which was argued before him; it was not a general subject of that set of proceedings."
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4853.382,4865.749,And what was the basis of the 45% allocation of the non-hatchery fish?
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4865.749,4866.209,I am sorry?
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4866.209,4873.843,What was the basis of the 45% allocation of the non-hatchery fish?
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4873.843,4877.261,I have some difficulty in answering that question precisely.
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4877.261,4879.871,Was it to protect the Indians or to protect somebody else?
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4879.871,4887.776,"It would be to protect the Indians, because it would give them a considerably larger percentage of the natural run."
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4887.776,4890.12,But there may also be a limit on what they could take.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4890.12,4891.022,No.
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4896.434,4900.496,"All right, so it was a limit on what they could take by a net commercial fishery."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4900.496,4903.162,By a net commercial fishery.
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4904.765,4907.259,But also an allocation that they could take at least that much.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4907.259,4915.963,"At least that much, because they could then go on and take whatever they could get in a sports fishery in common with all of the non-Indian sportsmen."
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4915.963,4918.945,That is de minimis almost to it.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4925.228,4935.531,"Some of them get better than others, and I think -- well, there may not be a record on this -- I suspect that these professional Indian fishermen are better than the average amateur sportsman; but they will get some."
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4935.531,4939.107,That is on here; that is with a good line.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4939.107,4941.584,I do not think it is de minimis.
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4954.715,4959.955,How much riverfront trust property do you suppose there is?
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4959.955,4961.681,I do not think there is any.
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4961.681,4964.208,"You mean, the river actually does not run through any property?"
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4964.208,4968.99,The river is on a new alignment now from what it was at the time the treaty was signed.
1976.76-423,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4974.823,4979.841,"Well, assume the reservation is not in existence."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4979.841,4987.38,"If the reservation is not in existence, I do not believe that there is any Indian property or any Indian trust property on the river at all."
1976.76-423,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4993.233,4995.26,What is this thing between two state highways?
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,4997.942,4999.337,Yes.
1976.76-423,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5001.458,5004.098,"Well, isn’t this the reservation?"
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5004.098,5006.322,"That is one of the questions, Your Honor."
1976.76-423,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5019.844,5022.972,And how much is that is within the limits here?
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5022.972,5028.485,"22 acres, according to Puyallup I, and I think they bought a few acres since the time of that."
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5062.597,5075.712,"What is the State's position with respect to the reservation question, Mr. Attorney General, in terms of whether it was raised in the cite below or whether you conceded it away?"
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5075.712,5083.97,"The question was raised in Puyallup I, was decided by the State Supreme Court in Puyallup I."
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5124.23,5131.773,Does that reach issues that were not decided by the State Court?
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5131.773,5133.359,"No, it reaches an issue which was decided by the --"
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5133.359,5136.608,"Well, you did not present that issue to the Washington Supreme Court."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5136.608,5137.774,"No, we did not."
1976.76-423,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5137.774,5140.951,"So, it was neither presented nor decided by the Washington Supreme Court."
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5140.951,5147.812,It was presented -- I think that it was presented by the United States in both cases.
1976.76-423,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5152.481,5156.038,"If that sounds correct, is there any evidence on it?"
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5156.038,5164.827,"There was not any evidence on it later than Puyallup I; but this is all the same case, of course, as Puyallup I."
1976.76-423,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5165.245,5170.438,I understood you rightfully to say you can use whatever you have to support the judgment.
1976.76-423,3,41407,slade_gorton,,5173.267,5178.928,"Oh, I think that if we go to the record in this case, there is evidence on it."
1976.76-423,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5198.006,5198.395,Thank you.
1976.76-423,4,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,5201.369,5204.88,May it please the Court.
1976.76-423,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5238.655,5240.505,"Well, where are you reading from now?"
1976.76-423,4,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,5240.505,5246.884,"I am reading from the Appendix, Pages 20 and 21, the Joint Appendix, Your Honor."
1976.76-423,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5277.912,5278.546,"Well, it says off-reservation."
1976.76-423,4,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,5278.546,5282.748,"Excuse me, is only material to the off-reservation fishery."
1976.76-423,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5364.597,5374.455,"But would that not be limited to -- even if we take your assumption, limited to cases where there is an artificial input or artificial --"
1976.76-423,4,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,5374.455,5375.645,Absolutely not.
1976.76-423,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5398.503,5402.36,"Well, what is allocation now to the Puyallup Indians?"
1976.76-423,4,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,5402.36,5411.442,"The allocation issue is as follows: basically, there is an off-reservation, the Bolt decision indicates a 50/50 allocation question."
1976.76-423,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5474.201,5479.541,"Mr. Rodgers, at what point in the litigation did you first assert sovereign immunity as a defense?"
1976.76-423,4,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,5479.541,5484.107,"Sovereign immunity, Your Honor, has been asserted in this litigation ever since the case began."
1976.76-423,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5500.221,5508.357,"Of course, that court thought it was doing no more than obeying the order on remand of this Court in Puyallup II."
1976.76-423,4,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,5508.357,5509.568,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1976.76-423,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5509.568,5525.704,"So instead of the wide precedent that you have indicated that affirmance here might mean, really, this is just limited to the Washington Supreme Court’s carrying out what this Court told it to do on remand of this particular and precise case, isn’t it?"
1976.76-423,4,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,5525.704,5536.511,"But to do that, Your Honor, as the concurring opinion below indicates, you have to read Puyallup II as contradicting 150 years of Indian law."
1976.76-423,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5536.511,5536.935,Yes.
1976.76-423,4,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,5536.935,5538.956,And we believe that you cannot do that.
1976.76-423,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5540.413,5543.31,"Mr. Rodgers, let me ask you one more question."
1976.76-423,4,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,5559.241,5571.32,"No, Your Honor, because those cases based upon the premises established -- and indeed, they were facts -- and those cases were off-reservation cases involving individual Indians --"
1976.76-423,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5571.32,5573.012,Same case as this case.
1976.76-423,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5573.012,5575.063,"It is the same, same litigation."
1976.76-423,4,45964,william_h_rodgers_jr,,5575.336,5588.613,"Except the reservation now exists, and the orders that initially run against individuals now run against the Tribe."
1976.76-423,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5648.347,5649.037,"Thank you, gentlemen."
