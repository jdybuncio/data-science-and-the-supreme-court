1982.81-184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.528,We will hear arguments next in United States against Security Industrial Bank.
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,72.849,77.201,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,141.445,144.406,Does it include after-acquired property?
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,144.406,149.679,"It includes substitutes for the property, and I believe it includes after-acquired property."
1982.81-184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.666,237.727,Much like the Fraser-Lempke Act?
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,237.727,240.938,"Very different from the Fraser-Lempke Act, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,437.316,450.766,"Mr. Horowitz, I suppose the problem of the Fifth Amendment question could have been avoided if it had been determined that the provision was not intended to be retroactive, right?"
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,450.766,451.527,Yeah.
1982.81-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,452.537,458.861,What leads... what leads you to believe that Congress intended retroactive application of this section?
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,458.861,466.405,"--Well, there's nothing at all in the legislative history in the statute that suggests that the section wouldn't be retroactive."
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.588,552.721,Is the exemption... is the amount that's involved... isn't the exemption limited to $200?
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,552.721,554.423,"Well, it's limited to $200 in--"
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,554.423,555.913,With respect to household goods?
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,555.913,556.524,--Yeah.
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.337,562.439,As to each item.
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,562.439,563.23,Yeah.
1982.81-184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,563.23,575.816,"On quite a large house if that's the application, you could have quite a large exemption... one of the Rockefeller homes, for example."
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,577.949,583.172,Any household good is exempt up to a value of $200 on that item.
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,697.075,698.668,"Well, the bankrupt should never worry then."
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,698.668,705.682,"--Well, he has to worry because the creditor can use it as a lever in order for him to pay his debt."
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.682,706.182,"Oh, no."
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,706.182,707.024,That's one--
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,707.024,712.937,"If it's true, if he... all he'd have to know is what Congress' finding was, that there was no interest in repossessing."
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,712.937,717.01,"--Well, Congress' finding is that it's not worth it in dollar terms."
1982.81-184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,717.01,719.792,--We'll resume at 1:00.
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,741.996,745.157,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,797.651,801.855,But I think that there are repossessions in--
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,801.855,802.954,"--Well, there certainly--"
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,802.954,805.598,--In enough cases to make the threat real.
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,805.598,809.929,--There certainly would be repossessions just for the very sake of making the threat credible.
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,809.929,814.184,"Well, and not only that but they repossess them when their debt isn't very much."
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,814.184,817.637,When it's not... to reaffirm the debt.
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,818.996,826.641,"They can collect their $600 by repossessing the household goods, and they do."
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,826.641,833.906,"Well, depending on how much the transaction costs are for having to repossess the items and hold a garage sale to sell them."
1982.81-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,838.397,848.635,"Mr. Horowitz, is there anything illegitimate about using liens to encourage payment, and isn't that really the normal function of a lien?"
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,848.635,851.96,"Well, there's certainly nothing illegitimate about it."
1982.81-184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,899.509,907.723,"Well, that may make it a poor loan, but that doesn't mean that the people might not want to foreclose the security and get what they could out of it, even though it doesn't pay off the debt."
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,907.723,915.78,"--Well, but in fact the goods are of such negligible value that it's usually just not worth the creditor's while to foreclose."
1982.81-184,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,924.616,934.922,"Mr. Horowitz, does the term ""appliance"" in this section include refrigerators, deep freezers, television sets, video equipment?"
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,934.922,941.958,"--Well, it hasn't really been litigated in this case as to exactly what items are covered by that definition."
1982.81-184,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,942.619,943.497,Is there any reason to think--
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,943.497,947.391,"I think ""appliances"" certainly was meant to cover things like refrigerators and dryers."
1982.81-184,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,951.694,952.423,--Are covered?
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,952.423,953.004,Yes.
1982.81-184,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,953.004,959.919,"But you wouldn't suggest, would you, or have you already said that you regarded them as having little value on resale?"
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,959.919,962.931,"Well, it varies."
1982.81-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,980.463,986.417,"It isn't right that the good has a value of less than $200, just that the interest involved is only to the extent of $200."
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,990.367,991.058,That's right.
1982.81-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1001.055,1003.667,He'd just get $200 out of the proceeds of resale.
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1003.667,1005.299,"--I think that's right, yes."
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1021.449,1022.36,"Well, he... excuse me."
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1036.178,1037.598,"--Yeah, exactly."
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1038.249,1044.814,"Provided he... or if they repossess a television set, the lien would give them the $500 if it's worth $500."
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1045.245,1045.796,--Right.
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1047.536,1048.267,--Exactly.
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1048.267,1048.978,But it doesn't completely--
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1048.978,1054.431,"Well, it reduces it by enough to get it down to $200."
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1058.443,1059.094,--Right.
1982.81-184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1066.42,1082.618,"Well, I suppose when Congress enacted these provisions they had some information about the average secondhand value of most household items and then arrived at this $200 figure."
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1082.618,1083.148,Yeah.
1982.81-184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1151.645,1164.991,"Well, are you saying that a debtor who has given a chattel mortgage on his personal property the way it happened here is no different than a debtor who simply is given an unsecured obligation?"
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1164.991,1179.581,"--It's not that he's no different, but for the purposes of the Fifth Amendment the question is whether such a sharp line should be drawn between the kind of paper security interest that you have here where in fact there's no actual interest in taking the property or in reselling--"
1982.81-184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1179.581,1185.265,"Well, but there is... there is a property interest created under the laws of most states by that sort of security."
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1190.34,1197.983,--But for the purposes of the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment it's important to focus on the type of property interest you have here.
1982.81-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1225.062,1237.31,"Mr. Horowitz, under your arguments what type of destruction of liens, if any, would be compensable under the Fifth Amendment takings clause?"
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1237.31,1240.553,"What kind of destruction of these liens, these kinds--"
1982.81-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1240.553,1243.395,"Of any liens, if not these."
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1243.395,1250.337,"--Well, I mean, for example, in the Armstrong case the Court held that the destruction of the liens there was compensable."
1982.81-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1251.909,1252.57,You agree with that?
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1252.57,1254.15,"--Yes, I'd agree with the Armstrong case."
1982.81-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1281.058,1287.413,And I take it you concede that under Kansas law the liens here are liens on specific property.
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1287.413,1295.297,"Well, I would agree that there's a property interest created under Kansas law by these liens."
1982.81-184,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1301.201,1304.885,"Any difference under Colorado law, the five Colorado cases?"
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1304.885,1307.306,I don't know of any difference in the state laws.
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.306,1314.842,Do you know whether self-help was allowed or did they have to foreclose these liens if they wanted through court?
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1316.792,1319.373,I think the security agreement provides that--
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.373,1321.244,They just go and repossess.
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1324.877,1328.991,"--The debtor has to pile all the furniture in his living room, I think, and make it ready for them, and then they can go in."
1982.81-184,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1331.963,1334.905,And under the laws of both states that is permissible.
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1334.905,1336.944,--I believe that's correct.
1982.81-184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1336.944,1344.07,"Well, there are some practical problems in what has been described as repossessing."
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1347.601,1348.572,That was addressed there.
1982.81-184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1349.473,1356.489,And this isn't like repossessing an automobile which has a license number and a serial number and is readily identified.
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1364.393,1364.864,--Yeah.
1982.81-184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1365.692,1368.714,Does that enter into creating some problems here?
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1368.714,1372.758,"--The debtor is usually required to make a list of some of the property he has, so--"
1982.81-184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1372.758,1374.34,At the time--
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1374.34,1375.44,--I suppose... at the time he enters into the loan.
1982.81-184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1375.44,1375.83,--The lien is--
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1375.83,1376.171,Yes.
1982.81-184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1376.171,1377.5,--At the time the lien attaches.
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1377.5,1378.011,Right.
1982.81-184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1380.973,1382.295,All the new property coming in.
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1382.295,1383.635,Yes.
1982.81-184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1383.635,1387.627,"But there are some practical problems with respect to the after-acquired property, aren't there?"
1982.81-184,0,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1387.627,1392.689,"Well, I'm not sure how the after-acquired property is handled under the laws of these various states."
1982.81-184,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1456.684,1461.697,Mr. Field.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1461.697,1464.649,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.465,1633.228,"Well, the Government's position just isn't threats or overreaching or anything."
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1653.381,1655.521,--I think that's--
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.521,1658.844,It's just... it's just... has no substance.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1658.844,1659.915,"--I think that's their argument, Your Honor."
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.915,1660.336,Yeah.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1660.336,1676.325,"However, it's patently false because... and although, again, it might be permissible to make that judgment in the future, that's certainly not true of the cases that are before this Court, and it's certainly not true... there's no substance to any such suggestion of the record here."
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1676.325,1693.516,"Well, if Congress... if Congress viewed that... took that view about these kinds of liens for the future, it certainly was a considerate judgment that these kinds of liens aren't worth very much, because they certainly didn't do it as to mortgages on real estate."
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1693.516,1696.751,"Well, that may be."
1982.81-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.627,1759.34,"Well, it isn't quite correct to say that all these property rights were destroyed as of the date of the enactment of the statute."
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1762.092,1763.474,"--That's exactly correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1763.985,1768.706,So that at the time the statute was passed no rights were immediately affected by it.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1768.706,1770.467,--That's correct.
1982.81-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1775.942,1776.353,If you're right.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1787.168,1788.458,--That's correct.
1982.81-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1790.852,1793.433,And it only applies to those debtors who go bankrupt.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1793.433,1795.214,--Exactly.
1982.81-184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.158,1819.199,"Well, Congress can't legislate the way a state legislature could in the very broad context."
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1819.199,1819.43,That's correct.
1982.81-184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1819.43,1821.551,It was just dealing with bankruptcy.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1821.551,1822.902,That's correct.
1982.81-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1822.902,1832.588,Do you think it could have changed the order of priority... I don't know what the order of priority was... to make these junior to some claims to which they were previously senior in the future?
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1832.588,1833.519,No.
1982.81-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1833.519,1837.062,"See, what they've done here really, it says they'll be treated like general creditors is what--"
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1837.062,1837.633,Correct.
1982.81-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1838.932,1842.075,--But you say they couldn't even rearrange the order of priority.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1842.075,1850.799,"Well, there are principles on which such a decision could be made a court; that is, the Pepper v. Litton situation--"
1982.81-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1850.799,1860.596,"Well, supposing they just said in the new act these claims will be junior to wage claims... previously it was the other way around; I don't know whether that's true or not... would that be a taking?"
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1860.596,1864.469,"--If it resulted in the destruction of... yes, I believe it would--"
1982.81-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1864.469,1866.881,It would result in a diminution of the value of your lien.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1866.881,1867.422,--Yes.
1982.81-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1869.352,1872.324,And if you take any change in the order of priority it would violate the terms.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1872.324,1872.694,--Yes.
1982.81-184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.324,1939.327,What about when Congress first introduced the four-month preference period into the Bankruptcy Act... was it the act of 1898?
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1955.459,1956.971,"--It was not done, Your Honor."
1982.81-184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1956.971,1957.402,It wasn't?
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1957.402,1958.233,No.
1982.81-184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1965.046,1965.677,Only prospectively.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,1965.677,1967.908,--To avoid the problem we're talking about here.
1982.81-184,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2001.989,2003.912,You're going to comment on Penn Central.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2003.912,2005.712,Penn Central.
1982.81-184,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2086.195,2087.557,So it's a matter of degree.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2087.557,2088.426,"No, not completely."
1982.81-184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2131.523,2137.128,"Well, that's not true, is it, if the items are worth more than the $200?"
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2137.128,2142.251,"Well, that's true, Your Honor, in... I was referring only to the cases before this Court."
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.629,2157.211,There would be a voiding of the lien.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2157.211,2158.133,--Yes.
1982.81-184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.119,2265.271,"Mr. Field, if the Auffm'ordt case, which you mentioned or implied by a question I asked, is rightly decided, that sounds like it's fairly good precedent for saying that an act like this applies only prospectively, and that you pick out simply a section of the act that may raise these kind of problems and say it applies only prospectively."
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2265.271,2266.392,"I think that's true, Your Honor."
1982.81-184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2266.392,2267.942,But do you make that argument?
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2267.942,2269.775,Yes.
1982.81-184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2272.417,2276.169,You don't really cover it in your brief.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2276.169,2286.475,"I think that's correct, but that was the argument made, and it has been an argument we have made, and we do affirm it in this case."
1982.81-184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2313.102,2337.249,Is there also some support in the language of Section 522(f) itself where it says that the debtor may avoid the fixing of a lien on an interest of the debtor and property to the extent that such lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled under subsection (b) by saying he wouldn't have been entitled to an exemption prior to the effective date--
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2337.249,2338.047,I think that's a--
1982.81-184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2338.047,2338.808,--Of the act.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2338.808,2349.617,"--Possible construction, although I myself have never really been happy or able to understand completely why that phraseology was written that way."
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.105,2455.707,"Well, what about the... what about the suggestion, though, of the Government and apparently of Congress that there's hardly ever a repossession, and hence, the property interest is just de minimis?"
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2455.707,2469.053,"That, again, could be a point for the future, but how they can say that could possibly bear on or be relevant to A's interest... does A get a chance to testify to the contrary?"
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2478.14,2491.588,"Well, do you think congressional judgment is infirm, that there's hardly ever a repossession on this kind of a lien, and hence, it's of negligible value?"
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2493.821,2495.622,--Yes.
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2497.635,2497.832,Fine.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2497.832,2498.553,--Is wrong.
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.423,2501.565,"Well, I don't know."
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2507.258,2508.21,Okay.
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2520.669,2530.584,"You do agree that you're entitled to win even if the Congress is quite right just because you have a property interest, pure and simple, whether you use it or not."
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2530.584,2531.726,That's correct.
1982.81-184,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2538.361,2540.211,He's the only one who can waive it.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2540.211,2541.463,That's correct.
1982.81-184,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2541.463,2542.601,Congress can't waive it for him.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2542.601,2543.793,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1982.81-184,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2630.581,2634.202,Do you read that as the Court's holding in Northern Pipeline?
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2634.202,2635.494,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2674.607,2683.874,"Well, this kind of claim, whether or not a debtor is entitled to an exemption, is something that could have been clearly decided by an old-fashioned referee."
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2687.677,2712.594,"Your Honor, that... whether that's true or not... and that's true as the matter of a referee under the prior act... but under the... the result of the Northern Pipeline opinion is that the grant of jurisdiction is unconstitutional... is inseverable and therefore inoperative."
1982.81-184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2733.676,2739.021,I think you read a lot more into the Northern Pipeline case decision than I would have.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2739.021,2753.049,"Well, that may be, Your Honor, but at the minimum the Northern Pipeline decision holds that the grant of jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts is inseverable and partly unconstitutional."
1982.81-184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2768.26,2775.574,"These, of course... these cases were all decided before the Northern Pipeline case."
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2790.343,2828.547,"Chico deals with the situation of a closed case and under the Linkletter doctrine that this Court has announced, in this case our clients can take advantage of the Northern Pipeline ruling and can urge the position we urge both in this case and as amicus in Northern Pipeline while other cases may not, because we had presented this issue on appeal in this Court at the same time, and under the Linkletter doctrine that allows us to take advantage of that rule... the ruling in that case... for our clients."
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2868.877,2869.615,Your lien is valid under State law--
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2869.615,2876.891,--Your lien is valid under State law and there is no... and you should argue... I suppose you do... that there is no bankruptcy Act to avoid them.
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2878.32,2885.887,"--Well, you don't need any... if this provision is invalid, it is just invalid, and--"
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2885.887,2889.46,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2909.932,2912.323,--Why do you need the prior law?
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2912.323,2916.136,"As an alternate ground of decision, Your Honor."
1982.81-184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2922.241,2928.806,"It is the doctrine of dependent relative revocation at will, isn't it... that this bankruptcy act was no good."
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2930.365,2931.036,Absolutely.
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2931.036,2932.567,But you wouldn't need the old Act.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2937.549,2944.624,"Well, you still have to ask whether the court below had jurisdiction to apply some bankruptcy law."
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.624,2945.265,Right.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2945.265,2946.725,And the--
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2946.725,2949.867,You don't care whether they apply a bankruptcy law or not.
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2953.831,2964.447,"--No, but if there was jurisdiction below, we would still have to fight it out in that court as to whether our interest was valid or invalid and presumably--"
1982.81-184,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2964.447,2971.323,"But the Court would have to have some authorization under the bankruptcy statute to invalidate your lien, which you wouldn't have."
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2971.323,2972.264,--That's correct.
1982.81-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2977.546,2988.702,"Well, it would have had jurisdiction, wouldn't it, to invalidate your lien on some entirely different theory such as unconscionability or something or other... you didn't sign the papers correctly."
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2988.702,2989.043,Precisely.
1982.81-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2989.874,2993.545,"And that kind of issue, you are saying, would be adjudicated under the old Act rather than the new Act?"
1982.81-184,1,26961,henry_f_field,,2993.545,2994.877,--Precisely.
1982.81-184,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3014.95,3018.914,Mr. Horowitz.
1982.81-184,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3018.914,3021.715,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-184,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3152.311,3154.681,"Well, you are really just saying the lien isn't worth much."
1982.81-184,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3154.681,3156.502,That's right.
1982.81-184,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3158.903,3160.926,--Eastman and Loretto or not?
1982.81-184,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3162.796,3169.461,"Well, it's worth even less than Eastman and Loretto because there you at least have a real property, a traditional kind of property interest, which was someone's possession of property."
1982.81-184,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3170.122,3171.393,This is not a lien?
1982.81-184,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3174.935,3179.219,"--Not in this context, where there's no expectation of possession."
1982.81-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3179.219,3186.291,"Well, but a non-possessor of property interest originated about the 16th Century, didn't it, in personal property?"
1982.81-184,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3189.954,3197.779,"Well, Justice, all I can say is that if there were no property interest here of course we wouldn't be here, because then there would be no claim of a taking at all."
1982.81-184,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3239.666,3246.241,"Let me ask you, supposing a state passed a statute that invalidated liens like this retroactively."
1982.81-184,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3251.885,3258.73,"--Well, I would state you have the additional problem of the contract clause, which forbids any impairment of contract by the state."
1982.81-184,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3271.387,3275.56,Would you say such a state law would be invalid under the contract laws?
1982.81-184,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3275.56,3277.511,"That's my immediate reaction, yes."
1982.81-184,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3277.511,3286.517,I don't suppose... Congress couldn't really have thought that there never was a... never was a repossession in these kinds of cases.
1982.81-184,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3286.517,3287.068,No.
1982.81-184,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3287.068,3292.742,"As a matter of fact, maybe out of a hundred you would say... ten out of a hundred, one out of ten, that is probably a repossession."
1982.81-184,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3305.051,3321.342,"Well, I mean one problem here is that the creditor here is not seeking to enable to use his lien entirely, and that is to be able to get the debtor to reaffirm the debt... have the whole lien survive."
1982.81-184,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3321.342,3324.481,That isn't the only use of the lien in every single case.
1982.81-184,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3325.723,3330.425,But in passing legislation Congress has to make the general judgment as to what--
1982.81-184,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3330.425,3331.647,That may be so for the future.
1982.81-184,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3331.647,3343.335,"--Well, if it was only for the future, there would be no Fifth Amendment claim at all, obviously, because there wouldn't be any taking of any property if this Act was already on the books that these liens could be avoided."
1982.81-184,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3350.658,3352.731,I agree with you.
1982.81-184,2,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3352.731,3357.884,And I think it's necessary to consider the nature of the regulation in doing so.
1982.81-184,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3359.336,3359.766,"Thank you, gentlemen."
