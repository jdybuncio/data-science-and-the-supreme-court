1983.82-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.936,"We will hear arguments next in Consolidated Rail Corporation against Lee Ann LeStrange Darrone, as Administrix of Estate of Thomas LeStrange."
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,99.187,114.587,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the application of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as it was amended to claims of employment discrimination on the basis of handicap."
1983.82-862,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,356.394,362.749,Your opponents say that that wasn't discussed in Congress at any point.
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,364.699,366.32,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-862,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,380.949,382.321,"It is 3,000 pages."
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,382.321,394.939,"--There are 3,000 pages in the Rehabilitation Act, and the Rehabilitation Act itself is a lengthy statute dealing with a myriad of vocational rehabilitation programs."
1983.82-862,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,403.285,405.927,Do you have any explanation why it wasn't even mentioned?
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,405.927,422.6,"The only explanation that I can offer, and it would be one by hypothesis rather than by reference to the legislative history, is that Congress understood what they meant in Title 6."
1983.82-862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,872.882,875.653,What is your definition of remedial legislation?
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,875.653,887.552,--Remedial legislation is when the primary purpose of the legislation is to provide a remedy for a wrong that is identified in the statute.
1983.82-862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,913.829,925.527,But certainly legislation such as we were discussing in the preceding case provides for remedies for failure to comply with the conditions on which the funds are given.
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,925.527,928.16,"Yes, it does, and Section 504 does."
1983.82-862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,939.337,943.16,Would you agree that those are remedial provisions?
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,943.16,950.744,"--Those are remedial provisions, but the primary purpose of the provisions is to obtain compliance."
1983.82-862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,983.856,992.382,Then your definition of remedial really means something which grants a private cause of action to somebody.
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,992.382,1004.299,"Well, I think the remedy could be provided by someone else having... a governmental cause of action could also be remedial in character."
1983.82-862,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1059.355,1085.271,"Isn't this legislation parallel in many ways to Title 9, where the Court in the Cannon case found there was a private right of action, that it was in effect remedial, to use your terms, and how do you distinguish the analysis that should be made here from that?"
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1085.271,1110.739,"Well, we believe that in the Cannon case, that they recognized the private cause of action, and as a result of this Court's recent decision in the Guardians case under Title 6, we have conceded in our reply brief that there is a private cause of action under Title 6... under Title 6 and under Section 504, in the context of a handicap discrimination complaint."
1983.82-862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.431,1193.623,Do you mean Congress?
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1193.623,1194.793,--I am sorry.
1983.82-862,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1204.649,1209.221,"Well, now, the damages question wasn't even argued below, was it?"
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1209.221,1211.474,"No, Your Honor, it wasn't--"
1983.82-862,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1211.474,1215.356,Why should we depart from our normal practice and get into it here?
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1215.356,1225.925,"--Well, Your Honor, if the damage question is not resolved, then we will have to start all over again with the district court, and determine--"
1983.82-862,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1225.925,1231.2,"Well, maybe you should have raised it below, but the fact is that it wasn't, so why should we deal with it here?"
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1231.2,1247.68,"--Mr. LeStrange was alive below, and he had a live claim for injunctive relief, and that injunctive relief entitled him... it kept the case alive, notwithstanding the disposition of the damages question."
1983.82-862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1385.93,1387.892,"Well, what was the purpose of that latter money?"
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1387.892,1396.979,"--That latter money was designed to keep ConRail afloat, and hopefully enable it to operate as a profitable railroad."
1983.82-862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1396.979,1398.409,It could use the money for anything?
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1398.409,1400.95,"Well, the financing agreement is very broad."
1983.82-862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.051,1404.924,"So the answer is yes, it could use it for anything."
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1404.924,1406.063,"--Yes, they could use it for anything."
1983.82-862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1406.063,1407.565,They could pay wages of employees.
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1407.565,1423.847,"Yes, they could have paid wages of employees with it, and the question then is, in the case of unrestricted money, does that require an institutional application of Section 504?"
1983.82-862,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1491.05,1494.062,"Mr. Rissetto, may I interrupt you just a minute?"
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1503.837,1504.948,"No, they aren't."
1983.82-862,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1510.071,1514.525,Is it clear that the government will not get its money back?
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1514.525,1524.321,"Well, the government has agreed to subordinate the preferred stock in the event that ConRail has successfully conveyed to another... to another entity."
1983.82-862,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1525.522,1528.334,Subordinated stock is not always worthless.
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1528.334,1540.601,"--It is only worthless... well, it may have value if ConRail in the form of a subsequent entity subsequently goes into bankruptcy."
1983.82-862,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1556.651,1567.73,"I was just wondering whether the government renders financial assistance if it chooses to buy securities that should have a fair market value that approximated what the government paid for, but that is not this case."
1983.82-862,0,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,1567.73,1569.801,"That is not this case, Your Honor."
1983.82-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1673.178,1678.832,Mr. Lenahan.
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,1678.832,1688.129,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I must first correct a misstatement made by Mr. Rissetto with reference to the facts in this case."
1983.82-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1722.38,1727.033,"Well, granting all of that, do I understand you to mean that there is a one-armed engineer?"
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,1727.033,1728.453,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1728.453,1729.765,You have no problem with that?
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,1729.765,1731.836,"Your Honor, I think that the statute--"
1983.82-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1731.836,1735.049,Would you put a sign up to tell all the passengers they've got a one-armed engineer?
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,1735.049,1745.126,"--Your Honor, I think that there is an issue here... first off, the record was not made completely... insofar as the otherwise qualified."
1983.82-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1745.126,1749.38,"I agree with you it is beyond us, but I mean I'd still like your comment on it."
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,1749.38,1753.381,"Your Honor, Mr. LeStrange was seeking employment as a yard engineer."
1983.82-862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2051.625,2053.896,"Where do we find that, Mr. Lenahan?"
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2055.628,2058.07,"--Yes, that is cited in the appendix to our brief."
1983.82-862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2092.742,2101.117,"Well, if there was already a private cause of action intended by Congress, as you said, why did Congress add this?"
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2101.117,2117.489,"What Congress intended, and actually it is explicit in the legislative history, was that they wanted to codify existing HEW procedural regulations and make also that remedy available to handicapped individuals."
1983.82-862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2220.707,2239.917,"Well, Mr. Lenahan, the gist of your argument, I take it, and of the position taken by the Third Circuit, is that private rights of action to enforce this discrimination against handicapped law are more extensive than the agency's or department's authority."
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2239.917,2247.043,"No, the... first off, let me state that the petitioner even concedes that a private right of action exists here."
1983.82-862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2254.938,2266.845,"Well, you say that the agency and department is just as free as... perhaps you want to talk to Cort v. Solage."
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2266.845,2268.047,"No, that's all right."
1983.82-862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2268.047,2280.746,You say the agency and department is just as free to enforce the Act regardless of Section 604 as a private individual is?
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2280.746,2284.747,"Your Honor, maybe I am misunderstanding your question."
1983.82-862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2295.825,2299.387,What is the effect of Section 604 in your view?
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2299.387,2304.463,"In this particular instance, with 504, it has no effect whatsoever."
1983.82-862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2304.463,2310.244,What effect did Congress intend when it enacted Section 604?
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2310.244,2317.558,"Your Honor, you mean within the context of 504, or within the pure context of 604 in and of itself?"
1983.82-862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2317.558,2319.93,What was Section 604 designed to do?
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2319.93,2331.517,"As I understand it, it was dealing with termination of funds and limiting specific types of agency action, but that deals with Title 6, which is not necessarily completely controlling in this case."
1983.82-862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.901,2349.419,"Well, assume we thought that 604 was incorporated into the Rehabilitation Act and that it does apply."
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2351.241,2369.174,"First, Your Honor, I think if that assumption is made, in dealing with that hypothetical we would have to say that it applies only to an agency action, and that the private right of action would exist anyway, which in our belief was created back when 504 was originally enacted, and it is only one of the remedies."
1983.82-862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.623,2388.886,"Well, the remedies of Title 6 were made available."
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2388.886,2390.236,"--And I agree with you, Your Honor."
1983.82-862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2529.377,2538.483,It really isn't correct to speak of Section 604 should be neglected because it is contrary to the regulations of a group of agencies.
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2543.867,2551.893,"Your Honor, am I to understand that these regulations that you are speaking of are not to be given deference in this instance?"
1983.82-862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2551.893,2555.887,"Not if they are... not if, as you say, they are contrary to Section 604."
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2555.887,2556.368,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2561.069,2566.903,"Assume Justice White's hypothesis, that the Court were to feel it were incorporated."
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2566.903,2587.536,"--We don't feel, quite frankly, that there is any basis to incorporate them, but if you are saying that they are, obviously the regulations which ignore them would have to be inconsistent with them, but that is not... the interpretation and the repeated interpretation of Section 504 is that Section 604 is not incorporated into the statute."
1983.82-862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.536,2591.637,"We haven't decided that yet, and that is one of the issues."
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2591.637,2592.748,That is one of the issues in this case.
1983.82-862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2614.845,2615.673,How would it do that?
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2615.673,2627.592,--Because it limits the scope of Section 504 to only those programs which were the primary purpose is... where the funding is... primary purposes deals with employment.
1983.82-862,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2642.381,2654.029,"Unless what it means is, it is limited only to enforcement by the government agency itself, a fund termination, for instance, by that agency."
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2654.029,2654.5,If that--
1983.82-862,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2654.5,2655.451,If that is the limitation--
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2655.451,2655.832,--Yes.
1983.82-862,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2655.832,2656.49,--it wouldn't.
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2656.49,2657.741,"No, it certainly wouldn't."
1983.82-862,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2776.948,2779.842,"But if there is no monetary relief, the case is moot, isn't it?"
1983.82-862,1,31480,joseph_p_lenahan,,2779.842,2783.092,"Your Honor, if there is no monetary relief, the case is moot."
1983.82-862,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2841.161,2849.997,Mr. Reynolds?
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2849.997,2861.785,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I have but a few minutes, and I believe they can best be utilized by underscoring some of the points made by Mr. Lenahan."
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2989.211,2999.577,"So, Mr. Reynolds, the provision then would reach employment in the programs, in the appropriate program."
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,2999.577,3000.559,That's correct.
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3000.559,3015.457,"Have you taken a position in this case, or are you going to, as to what the program would be if there are federal funds given to an entity on an unrestricted basis that it could use for anything it wanted to?"
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3015.457,3018.998,We have not in this case taken a position.
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3024.501,3027.834,There are funds in this case of that nature.
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3027.834,3036.45,--I believe that there are funds that... there are indications in the record that there are funds of that nature.
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.45,3045.775,"And if the only program that you could identify in such an unrestricted grant is the entire entity, the entity can use the money for anything it wants to."
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3045.775,3046.737,Right.
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3046.737,3054.932,And you say it would include and it certainly would reach employment in whatever the program is.
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3054.932,3055.473,That's--
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3055.473,3056.514,What would be the program?
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3056.514,3058.996,"--In that case, the--"
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3058.996,3061.487,"Is the government prepared to take a position now, or not?"
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3061.487,3070.834,"--I think in that case that the program would be again defined by the funding grant, and it could well be the whole entity."
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3072.093,3079.84,"The funding grant says, here's the money, put it in any of the empty coffers that you want to."
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3079.84,3093.137,"--There is no resistance on the part of the government with respect to the program specific issue, to define the program indeed as the whole entity in an appropriate circumstance."
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3093.137,3112.471,"Well, in which event the remand would be sort of a... I know you say that it ought to be remanded to really define the program, but it would be a rather hollow gesture if a good deal of this money is on an unrestricted basis, and if it is, that means the entire entity."
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3112.471,3121.317,"Well, I think that in the event that there is, as the record now sits, I think that certainly there would be a presumption that it would be the entire entity."
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.688,3137.836,How could it be rebutted with respect to the money that goes to ConRail on an unrestricted basis?
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3137.836,3141.76,--I don't know how it would be rebutted.
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.652,3162.314,How could the program be unfunded?
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3162.314,3169.727,--I don't know where the funds went or indeed how the security works in this case with respect to the funding.
1983.82-862,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3178.832,3182.035,"Mr. Reynolds, I am confused by your use of the word ""program""."
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3217.738,3226.805,"I think the program has to be defined by the funding statute, and therefore it would be the program that the federal government is funding."
1983.82-862,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3247.489,3254.003,"Is the program tied to the government agency that is passing out the money, or to the recipient?"
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3254.003,3257.754,"It is tied to the funding agency, to the government agency that is passing out the money."
1983.82-862,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3257.754,3262.238,"So this might be... the program would be bailing out railroads, perhaps."
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3262.238,3265.03,"It could be, yes."
1983.82-862,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3267.691,3271.544,"Well, that is not the argument that was made in the prior case, was it, Mr. Reynolds?"
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3288.345,3289.827,--I am sorry.
1983.82-862,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3338.528,3343.872,We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock.
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3365.847,3368.549,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3426.788,3429.62,"Well, that wouldn't be post-enactment history at all, would it?"
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3429.62,3430.151,--No.
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3430.151,3431.18,That would be enactment history.
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3431.18,3439.097,"That is the point I was trying to make, that that is enactment history, and it would therefore be a reason to give some--"
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3439.097,3447.712,"I know you weren't arguing... you aren't arguing the prior case, but would the same argument apply to the prior case?"
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3447.712,3454.745,--With respect to which... the regulation... I think that if Congress has in--
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3454.745,3473.388,"Well, the regulations that we were... the regulations that were extant when these grant statutes were re-enacted, they were in place when Congress re-enacted the grant statutes."
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3473.388,3474.549,"--Well, I think that--"
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3474.549,3478.531,"Well, I don't need to waste your time arguing the other case."
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3479.141,3480.834,"--I had an answer, but I--"
1983.82-862,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3480.834,3484.845,I would be interested in your answer.
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3484.845,3487.217,"--Well, I think--"
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3487.217,3488.008,Go ahead.
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3488.008,3495.324,"--In the other case, I think the relevant legislative history relates to Title 9 and what Congress intended by Title 9."
1983.82-862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3505.219,3509.101,"Nevertheless, it wouldn't be post-enactment history, would it?"
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3515.056,3532.147,"--I think insofar as it might inform the federal program... the program that is being subsidized by federal funds, it might be relevant, but not in terms of what Congress intended with respect to the coverage of Title 9 and the strength of that coverage."
1983.82-862,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3532.147,3542.374,What is your view on the meaning of Section 604 if that in fact is part and parcel of the remedies?
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3551.459,3569.86,"Well, I think that if 604 is imported into the statute, and we are talking about an implied right of action, that the implied right of action would be defined by the parameters of the statute as it is written, and therefore that that limitation would also apply to the private right of action."
1983.82-862,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3588.152,3595.198,"--And what is your view of what remedies are available to a private litigant, Mr. Reynolds?"
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3595.198,3596.888,I think that the private litigant--
1983.82-862,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3596.888,3597.93,Back pay?
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3597.93,3609.057,"--I think the private litigant would, if you have a violation of the statute, that the private litigant would be able to obtain equitable relief with respect at least to back pay, and that is the claim in this case."
1983.82-862,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3609.057,3611.118,"An equitable relief, in your view, includes back pay?"
1983.82-862,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3611.118,3617.392,"Yes, I would put that in the category of back pay, and I think that at least would be recoverable if you had a private right of action."
1983.82-862,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3621.805,3623.616,"Anything further, Mr. Rissetto?"
1983.82-862,3,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,3623.616,3625.068,"Just two short points, Your Honor."
1983.82-862,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3625.068,3626.029,Very well.
1983.82-862,3,27958,harry_a_rissetto,,3627.971,3641.517,"It was recently mentioned that the HEW regulations were in existence in 1978, and constitute enactment history."
1983.82-862,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3896.835,3898.247,"Thank you, gentlemen."
