1982.81-1748,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.291,We'll hear arguments next in United States against Mitchell.
1982.81-1748,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,107.159,112.506,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1748,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,502.803,514.528,"I guess you would concede, wouldn't you, though, that, for instance, the timber statutes would mandate that the Government pay the allottees the money to the extent that it's earned on the timber?"
1982.81-1748,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,514.528,515.347,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-1748,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,605.701,611.038,"Mr. Schwartz, can I interrupt a second, because Justice O'Connor's question troubles me also."
1982.81-1748,0,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,619.794,629.967,"Oh, no, there is such language, and I gathered that was the basis of Justice O'Connor's question, with the one qualification that I've given."
1982.81-1748,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,1782.886,1791.606,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1748,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2440.63,2463.48,"Mr. Hobbs, do you agree with the Solicitor General that there is perhaps an ambiguity and perhaps confusion in nomenclature among our cases as to whether you're talking about the Tucker Act as a simply jurisdictional basis or as an implied waiver?"
1982.81-1748,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2463.48,2464.496,"Yes, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1748,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2471.1,2473.869,It's just we who are confused.
1982.81-1748,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2473.869,2475.152,I wouldn't even say that.
1982.81-1748,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2477.088,2479.69,We haven't admitted it anyway.
1982.81-1748,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2479.69,2490.161,"--To me what you've said is the Tucker Act... you've said sometimes the Tucker Act is a waiver of sovereign immunity, but you need further waiver of sovereign immunity when you're dealing with a damage claim."
1982.81-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.411,2574.567,"But if... if... if... Mr. Hobbs, if it's a question of implying a damages remedy or a cause of action for damages, then we are... even though the United States is involved, doesn't it raise the... generally the same sort of questions as whether other statutes contemplate an action in damages; in short, whether you should... whether an implied right to damages exists under statutes generally?"
1982.81-1748,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2586.642,2589.594,"Well, you're referring to the court type cases?"
1982.81-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2589.594,2590.227,Yes.
1982.81-1748,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2590.227,2593.629,Implied private right of action.
1982.81-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.388,2621.76,"Well, that may be so, that may be so, but the question still remains did the Congress anticipate a damages action."
1982.81-1748,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2621.76,2622.527,--Yes.
1982.81-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2631.633,2645.041,"Well, why shouldn't whatever test we've evolved for deciding whether the statute contemplates a damages action, whatever that standard is, why shouldn't it be applicable here?"
1982.81-1748,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2645.041,2647.093,--Perhaps it should be.
1982.81-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2671.674,2673.458,"Well, they want to sue on them."
1982.81-1748,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2681.629,2682.296,--Of course.
1982.81-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2694.537,2695.503,Yes.
1982.81-1748,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2695.503,2706.677,And I'm going to give you the reasons why we think that it all adds up to where there's a compelling inference that Congress must have intended that these Indians have damages.
1982.81-1748,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2981.331,2982.916,Money damages against the Government.
1982.81-1748,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,2982.916,2983.95,Yes.
1982.81-1748,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3205.376,3212.265,"Well, but that would all be... if you read the Indian Tucker Act that way, then Mitchell was wrongly decided, wasn't it?"
1982.81-1748,1,19256,charles_a_hobbs,,3212.265,3215.567,I can't speak to that.
1982.81-1748,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3652.605,3654.639,Very well.
1982.81-1748,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3657.824,3661.961,"Briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, two points."
1982.81-1748,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3767.595,3769.778,"Thank you, gentlemen."
