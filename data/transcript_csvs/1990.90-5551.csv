1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.009,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-5551, Edward Harold Schad, Jr. v. Arizona."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,12.198,15.872,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,53.826,57.459,"This was a verdict in the guilt phase, Ms. Young?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,57.459,58.841,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,174.705,179.67,"Ms. Young, did the judge give any lesser included offense instruction at all in this case?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,179.67,187.193,The judge did give an instruction for second degree murder which was a lesser included offense instruction for premeditated murder.
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,187.193,197.09,"And do you think Beck requires, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, any number of lesser included offense instructions if... if the evidence makes them out."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,197.09,198.583,Yes.
1990.90-5551,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,274.321,294.765,"Well, is it... is it all that clear that Beck should be read as requiring the giving of every potential lesser included offense rather than just a less drastic alternative than the death penalty which was given here?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,300.668,302.651,"Your Honor, I just--"
1990.90-5551,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,302.651,306.321,"And if not, why shouldn't we read it that way?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,306.321,318.319,"--Because, Your Honor, of the principle that Beck was based on which was eliminating the distortion in the fact-finding process and ensuring the integrity and reliability of the verdict."
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,329.558,333.67,"Wasn't that... wasn't the... Beck was confined to capital cases, wasn't it?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,333.67,335.422,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,335.422,339.383,And so it was to give the jury an option to imposing the death penalty.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,339.383,345.217,"Yes, Your Honor, but also giving them an option to return a rational verdict."
1990.90-5551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,351.691,370.696,"So you're saying if the jury in the jury room agrees at the outset that first degree premeditated murder has not been proven, at that point, if they... they cannot consistently go to second degree murder?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,370.696,372.395,"That's right, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,509.535,514.217,"Well, if we agree with you, we needn't reach your second issue?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,514.217,516.619,"--That's right, Your Honor, you do not."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,516.619,527.227,The respondent here contends that robbery is not indeed a lesser included offense of first degree murder if you look just to the statutory definitions.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,527.227,532.02,"Yes, Your Honor, that is what the State contends here."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,532.02,532.631,Do... do you agree with that?
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,532.631,533.981,"No, I do not agree with that."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.274,573.708,"Well, but no, you could have... they had a first degree murder instruction."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,575.068,576.149,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.149,582.823,"They could have found him guilty of the defined offense, first degree murder, without having found him guilty of robbery, isn't that correct?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,582.823,584.513,"Yes, Your Honor, they could have."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,584.513,590.327,"And pursuant to our prior law and what constitutes a lesser included offense, that wouldn't suffice."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,601.844,603.697,"I don't believe it does, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.846,621.929,I thought we just... I thought we just went through that.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,629.713,630.635,"--That's true, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.635,632.475,So it's not necessarily included.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,632.475,636.539,In the overall scheme of first degree murder that's--
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,636.539,637.808,But that's the offense.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,637.808,641.662,"--That's true, Your Honor, which... which brings us to our second issue, of course."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,641.662,642.603,As I said.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,642.603,649.326,But... but this jury was not just... they weren't given an instruction of this is just first degree murder.
1990.90-5551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,659.023,663.177,"But... but in felony murder, the defendant must cause the death in Arizona?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,663.177,670.499,"No, Your Honor, felony murder is basically a strict liability offense in Arizona."
1990.90-5551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,676.874,677.795,And there was no instruction to that effect in this case?
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,677.795,678.805,The--
1990.90-5551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,678.805,684.388,"In this case, there's no instruction that the defendant must have caused the death for there to be a capital conviction?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,684.388,686.1,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,690.234,690.703,I understand that for premeditated--
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,690.703,691.745,Not for felony murder.
1990.90-5551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,691.745,693.845,--And that's not... that's not required in a capital case?
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,693.845,695.167,Not in Arizona.
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,695.167,697.518,"Well, what about the penalty phase?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,697.518,702.052,At the penalty phase it is performed by a judge.
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.062,703.443,"Well, I know."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,711.987,717.711,"Yes, Your Honor, he must, in order to be eligible for the death sentence, make an Inman-Tison finding."
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,719.574,720.465,But that's after sentencing phase.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,720.465,722.097,That's at the sentencing phase.
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,722.097,722.498,But that's just... the sentencing phase.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,727.371,728.851,"Yes, there is, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.808,744.31,"I thought the defined crime was first degree murder, and there are various ways of proving first degree murder."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,749.925,753.988,--It's... it's under the first degree murder degree statute.
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,755.437,757.59,So I think your answer should have been yes.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,757.59,762.743,"--A defendant can be tried in Arizona only for felony murder, though."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,766.617,774.722,"He can be tried for first degree murder with the State arguing only one theory of first degree murder... to whit, the felony theory... if the State wishes to proceed that way."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,774.722,775.741,"That's right, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.407,791.792,"Well, I'll ask it later I guess, whether you must win on this in order to win on the first."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,791.792,797.506,"--No, Your Honor, I do not believe we must win on this issue in order to win on the first at all."
1990.90-5551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,923.868,935.266,"Is that any different from saying you can convict a burglary if he broke through the door or broke through the window, and six jurors think he went through the door and six jurors think he went through the window?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,935.266,937.359,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that is different."
1990.90-5551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,937.359,938.017,What's the difference?
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,938.017,947.313,Here the difference are the completely separate factual routes that the jury must take in order to establish the essential elements of the crime--
1990.90-5551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,947.313,949.316,"Well, you can't go... you can't go through both the door or the window."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,950.555,956.579,--But... but the crime of burglary requires entering into a struction without a legal--
1990.90-5551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,956.579,962.914,"Well, but first degree murder in Arizona requires that you... one of two possible ways of doing it."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,962.914,965.706,--But let's look at how Arizona defines these crimes.
1990.90-5551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,983.638,988.499,"Well, is it unconstitutional for Arizona to draft its statute in this way?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,988.499,989.711,"No, Your Honor, it is not."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1007.093,1008.776,But they are not required elements.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1032.569,1033.45,"That's right, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1044.946,1047.461,Which is this... which brings you to Justice Kennedy's question.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1052.483,1055.095,--That's not an essential element required.
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.286,1059.977,"Yeah, a break-in is an essential element."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1059.977,1063.54,"--Yes, but not breaking and entering by one certain means."
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1063.54,1065.22,But by one or the other.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1065.22,1067.313,By break--
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1067.313,1071.934,You've got to have some finding as to the burglary to make it felony murder.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1071.934,1072.916,--Yes.
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1072.916,1078.42,Then don't you think under your theory you would also have to find all the elements of burglary?
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1078.42,1080.531,Unanimously?
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1080.531,1081.111,Yes.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1081.111,1083.733,"Well, Your Honor, it would depend on the case."
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1083.733,1085.275,"Well, why would it depend on the case?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1085.275,1086.444,It would depend on the facts.
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1086.444,1087.926,Why would it depend on the facts?
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1087.926,1088.957,--of the case.
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1118.156,1132.658,"Well, is... is the key to your theory the fact that you... you must prove burglary as one... as one element if you're going the felony murder route to first degree, but you don't have to get into the details of burglary, so to speak?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1132.658,1153.159,"Your Honor, if the... if the burglary required that the jury have to choose one of... if the elements of burglary were such that, like the elements of premeditated murder and felony murder, the jury must choose one of the two, then yes, I would agree that they would have to unanimously find that."
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1153.159,1163.617,"So why... why aren't you insisting on that here or rather why don't you say that the... if... if the jury splits as to whether it was a door or window, that is unconstitutional?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1169.431,1184.34,"If... if the elements defined by State law and... I don't have the elements of burglary... but if the elements defined by State law required them to do so, then yes, that they had to choose, then yes."
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1184.34,1191.245,But do you think Arizona requires the jury to choose between premeditation?
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1191.245,1194.177,"No, I... Arizona does not and that's why we're here."
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.177,1194.746,I know.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1194.746,1195.698,But that's the problem.
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.55,1216.251,"Well, I assume--"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1216.251,1216.942,He strangled the victim.
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1216.942,1223.715,--I assume you would say the same thing if we granted your... your claim in this case.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1238.975,1240.247,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.247,1241.877,"--All right, where... where do you stop."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1249.724,1253.056,It can end with the capital case.
1990.90-5551,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1260.5,1261.411,"Well, I don't understand that."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1266.113,1267.104,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1267.104,1273.088,"With the... with Justice Kennedy's example, it's the same element, namely entry, that you don't care how he got in if they all thought he broke in."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1282.465,1283.283,That is--
1990.90-5551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1283.283,1284.094,--not just capital cases.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1297.255,1302.658,"--You might, but that's... I think a unanimous jury verdict would have to--"
1990.90-5551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1302.658,1303.688,There are not many indictments--
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1310.723,1311.584,--That's right.
1990.90-5551,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1312.542,1336.019,"But doesn't... doesn't that then just raise the further question, why... why isn't it appropriate to analyze the Arizona statute as simply requiring a guilty mental state which may be proven either as premeditation or may be proven as a element in the intent to commit robbery in the course of which there is a killing?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1346.277,1348.648,"But... but there are, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.954,1378.316,"Well, there are many more than two mental states required."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1389.434,1390.515,For the premeditated murder--
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1390.515,1395.927,"I mean every felony if it's... if it requires mens rea, I assume, has a different intent, right?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1399.44,1404.383,"--Intents... intents that the statute has required for that particular felony, that's right."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1404.383,1407.275,"Well, and for... and for this first degree murder."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1407.275,1408.186,That's right.
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1414.2,1415.082,That's... that's one intent.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1415.082,1416.281,Yes.
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.281,1420.575,"And then there's not just a second, which is an intent to commit a felony."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1425.538,1426.479,There could be.
1990.90-5551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1433.902,1438.336,"Well, I think it is unless you want to have some special rules for capital cases."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1463.832,1464.603,They... they--
1990.90-5551,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1464.603,1466.674,Because those are really a different act.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1466.674,1476.781,"--If in fact the evidence is such that it is, they do have to unanimously agree on the facts essential to that crime."
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1486.676,1488.629,You say that's... that's the present state of Federal law?
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1507.411,1507.941,"--No, I--"
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1507.941,1508.452,No.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1508.452,1510.132,"--I do not know that to be so, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1586.123,1595.35,But you had 12 who believe that killed the person and 12 who believed that he had the kind of intent that the State made unlawful.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1595.35,1596.239,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe you did."
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1596.239,1596.629,Are you sure?
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1596.629,1598.351,"First of all, if... if six--"
1990.90-5551,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1598.351,1601.601,One or the other of the various kinds of intent that the State made unlawful.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1601.601,1616.961,"--No, Your Honor, if the six people who believe felony murder... and setting aside the Beck issue for a while... those six people may not have had... believed he had anything to do with the killing but simply was present during a robbery."
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1621.636,1633.694,Do you... do you say that it must be clear that the jury was unanimous on each... on whatever theory that... on one theory or the other?
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1633.694,1636.636,On either premeditated murder or felony murder?
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.004,1642.68,"What is... what is your case that says that, in a State case, there must unanimous verdicts?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1642.68,1647.552,"Under Arizona law, the constitution requires that their verdict be unanimous."
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.552,1651.556,"I know, but do you have any case here that says it must be unanimous?"
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1651.556,1653.679,A United States Supreme Court case?
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.032,1672.22,"Well, what makes it... let's assume that there's... that there's a clear rule here that... that... that there may not be unanimous verdicts in the state criminal cases, including capital cases."
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1673.04,1673.701,--Okay.
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1673.701,1676.813,But Arizona requires it.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1694.035,1698.089,"Well, the possibility that the jury here split evenly--"
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1698.089,1699.367,Yes.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1699.367,1702.581,--even violates this Court's minimum requirements.
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.581,1704.982,So that's... you really get down to a 6 to 6 thing then?
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1704.982,1706.133,"Yes, Your Honor, or--"
1990.90-5551,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1706.133,1707.643,It would have to be a majority.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1707.643,1709.085,--At least a majority.
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1710.858,1712.257,You say you have them.
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1713.937,1714.658,"That's... yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1714.658,1715.92,We don't know how the jury--
1990.90-5551,0,21730,denise_i_young,,1715.92,1718.321,We have no idea here what the jury did.
1990.90-5551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1720.942,1722.234,"--Very well, Ms. Young."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,1724.304,1728.726,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-5551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1775.968,1776.418,May I ask you right there?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,1794.58,1801.396,--I... my assumption was that the death by drowning by a forcible... it was a killing... and that the jury ultimately decides that way.
1990.90-5551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1803.906,1804.637,"No, no, no."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,1809.87,1815.784,--My... my presumption should have been that it was death by drowning... by forcible drowning.
1990.90-5551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1827.092,1835.947,"And my question to you is... I think to put your question, you have to assume the statute only applied... there's a special crime of killing by drowning."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,1838.618,1841.611,--Under the... if the statute said killing by drowning?
1990.90-5551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1841.611,1842.181,Right.
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,1842.181,1846.145,Then the jury would have to be unanimous in making that finding.
1990.90-5551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1873.262,1878.696,"Well, but that... counsel for the petitioner I think will say that that's not her argument."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,1899.518,1903.211,"--If that's the position that the petitioner is taking, I'd say--"
1990.90-5551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1903.211,1908.316,Then you'd need only... and you need only have been intended to engage in the robbery.
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,1908.316,1909.456,--Pardon me?
1990.90-5551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1909.456,1912.367,When you need only to have intended to engaged in the robbery.
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,1912.367,1916.661,That... that is an issue that is determined in Arizona at the sentencing stage.
1990.90-5551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1920.343,1927.978,So the... you're saying... are you saying that the elements are the same for felony murder and for premeditated murder in Arizona?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,1927.978,1933.882,The elements of the crime were... are the same for first degree murder in Arizona.
1990.90-5551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1950.064,1957.468,"How about the petitioner's argument that the prosecutor told the jury, now there's two different routes you can go, two different prongs to this statute."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,1961.01,1964.062,"No, I disagree that the prosecutor presented that to the jury in the first place."
1990.90-5551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1990.068,1993.391,It's not... not immediately clear to me that those aren't different elements.
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,1993.391,2000.383,--Those not elements of the crime per the statute.
1990.90-5551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.781,2065.409,"Well, how far does that go toward Arizona... just abolish all of its specific felonies and adopt a new crime called a generic felony."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2090.905,2102.713,"I believe that the legislators... the legislature's prerogative would be able to do... if you're talking about the traditional type crime, which would be like the homicide crime, if you place that... if you say not as a felony."
1990.90-5551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2116.811,2118.524,"You can do it for homicide, but you can't go above homicide."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2143.429,2145.961,It would depend on how the statute would be written.
1990.90-5551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2146.361,2147.203,I told you how it's written.
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2147.203,2147.894,--Okay.
1990.90-5551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2147.894,2148.334,It's a felony.
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2148.334,2157.128,"If... if you mean that there a robbery independent and we're going to punish him for a... a homicide, I don't believe that they could do that."
1990.90-5551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.532,2163.851,"Well, take homicide... I think you're getting confused by homicide."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2164.973,2165.484,--Okay.
1990.90-5551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.484,2172.567,"It's a... it's a new crime called a nonhomicide felony, and it includes every felony in the world except homicide."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2172.567,2173.268,Okay.
1990.90-5551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2173.268,2173.979,All right?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2182.375,2186.098,I believe that Arizona... that the legislature would not be allowed to do that.
1990.90-5551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.772,2192.002,Uh-huh.
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2197.825,2203.128,--Because you're talking about a traditional category of crime here.
1990.90-5551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2231.306,2245.196,"Well, what's... what's the standard that you using in order to answer Justice Scalia's question in which you said that the hypothetical statute he put of a generic felony statute has a due process problem?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2251.711,2265.339,"You would have to look at the way this statute is written and determine whether or not the jury is making the determination of the crime that is charged in that case, as opposed to--"
1990.90-5551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2265.339,2268.071,"Well, but the crime is the one Justice Scalia put."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2278.018,2296.188,"--If you define it that way, then you're beyond... I foresee the problem there as... what you're doing is you're giving up the jury's... the defendant's right to a jury trial and giving it over to the judge merely because the jury is deciding, okay, he did something wrong."
1990.90-5551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2299.971,2302.262,"Well, that's... that's the argument in this case."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2302.262,2304.626,"I disagree, because in this case--"
1990.90-5551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2304.626,2310.64,"What's the difference in the two cases, and what's the standard you use to determine that... that one is valid and the other is invalid?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2310.64,2322.417,"--The line that I would draw would be if it falls within one of the traditional type of crimes, then it would be all right for the legislature to say, you have committed a homicide."
1990.90-5551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2333.503,2342.049,"Well, would you say there has to be a close conceptual mens rea between the acts that are grouped in this same statute?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2342.049,2348.814,--That has been one of the factors that has been considered in classifying crimes throughout history.
1990.90-5551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2350.595,2353.947,But you don't think that has anything to do with due process analysis?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2353.947,2357.249,"--Oh, it... due process is certainly involved in that, yes."
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2397.545,2408.153,"Well, Mr. Ford, suppose that Arizona did have a third valid and they want... they want the jury to say what the verdict is."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2426.623,2432.397,"--If... if they had... if they came back with separate verdicts itself, yes, under the Arizona statute."
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2432.397,2434.35,Six and six?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2434.35,2441.793,We're talking about the way... the manner in which the murder was committed as opposed to whether a murder was committed.
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2441.793,2451.741,"So, so... so you're... you're quite content with the assumption that six on one and six on the other would still produce a guilty verdict constitutionally?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2451.741,2462.768,"If six jurors found, yes, that there was... that he killed by premeditation and six found that he commit... that he killed during the commission of a felony, there's no problem under that."
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2468.422,2476.677,"Because... and you would say the State law rule of unanimity is satisfied, because there's 12 people who voted for first degree murder?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2476.677,2478.84,Because 12 people voted for the offense.
1990.90-5551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2486.313,2495.64,"In effect, you're... you're saying then that if there's a 6-6 split on how it's committed, we don't have a due process problem keyed to reasonable doubt?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2519.556,2520.226,"--No, no."
1990.90-5551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2523.378,2543.483,"Well, I guess then... let me if I may just ask you one other question, and that is when... when you were... when were answering Justice Kennedy's question, he said, well, what is the due process implication that bothers you in Justice Scalia's hypothesis in which there might be, you know, 30 ways to commit the generic felony."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2552.229,2557.041,"Due process would be, under Winship, keyed to reasonable doubt."
1990.90-5551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2567.099,2585.478,"And... and weren't you saying... I guess I misunderstood you... weren't you in effect saying that in... in a system in which there might be 12 different theories, one for each juror about how the generic felony had been committed, the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt would not be satisfied."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2587.371,2600.298,"--I was saying that there would not be a reasonable doubt question if you're talking about a category of crimes such as, in this case, the way it's defined in Arizona, of murder."
1990.90-5551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2601.08,2612.147,"Okay, why is that so when there would be a question about it on Justice Scalia's hypothesis in which we might have 12 different theories within the jury about how the crime was committed?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2612.147,2625.887,"--As I understood Justice Scalia's question, it spoke to the fact that we have several... we just designate one crime as being a felony, and that could include from homicide all the way down to traffic--"
1990.90-5551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2625.887,2636.936,"Right, and that means that among 12 jurors... in theory 12 jurors might come to 12 different views about how... one juror might say, well, you know, this fellow robbed."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2650.764,2656.748,"--I... I do foresee the problem there, when you start crossing the lines between categories of crimes."
1990.90-5551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2656.748,2667.595,"Okay, and you're now saying that when there are only two possibilities, so that the worst that we might have would be six jurors feeling one method, six another."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2671.849,2677.973,I'm saying that where it falls under a certain type category of crime that you wouldn't have the reasonable doubt problem.
1990.90-5551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2697.263,2698.265,xxx--
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2729.214,2730.906,You mean as a generic felony or as a--
1990.90-5551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2730.906,2732.416,"No, no, no, no, no."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2737.762,2742.544,"--That's... in almost all States, including the Federal Government, murder is defined."
1990.90-5551,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2746.097,2748.168,"And this could happen, you assert, in any State?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2758.476,2759.355,Absolutely.
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2759.355,2764.879,"Yeah, but the statutes may be that way, but how about the practice of submitting separate verdict forms?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2767.67,2771.823,With the court... the trial court actually submits the different forms?
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2776.596,2780.829,"No, and your supreme court even says it's a good idea to do it, doesn't it?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2780.829,2783.22,--For a different reason than what we're talking about here.
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2783.22,2785.351,"Well, nevertheless it says go ahead and do it."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2785.351,2787.404,It has suggested--
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2787.404,2788.813,What about other jurisdictions?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2791.215,2795.118,--I'm unaware of it being done in the Federal system or any other system.
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2825.809,2828.19,And deserves the death penalty.
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2828.19,2830.391,--That's the death penalty exclusively.
1990.90-5551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2831.713,2835.076,May I just be sure we don't have a dispute about one rather fundamental thing?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2853.276,2855.889,That is correct to a point.
1990.90-5551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2860.731,2864.084,"Well, no, that are two different ways of proving the same offense, and--"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2864.084,2865.644,"--Right, and if you prove first degree murder and--"
1990.90-5551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2865.644,2879.244,--What I'm really asking is can you prove the offense at issue in this case by proving robbery and that a death occurred in the course of the robbery without proving that the defendant had any intent to kill?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2879.244,2882.357,--Yes.
1990.90-5551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2882.357,2883.436,"Well, I just wanted to be sure."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2883.436,2897.524,The statute so reads that because we're... what we're doing in all felony murder situations... you're transferring the specific intent from the felony to satisfy the premeditation issue which all comes down... that's why they're satisfied in that way.
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2897.524,2903.601,But you may not be able to impose the death penalty without proof of that element... without proof of intent.
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2903.601,2905.34,"Without... yes, that's correct."
1990.90-5551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2905.34,2907.041,Let me... let me just get the terminology right.
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2911.285,2913.656,For first degree... for murder?
1990.90-5551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2913.656,2916.138,What is the common element for first degree murder?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2916.138,2917.98,There's killing with malice of forethought.
1990.90-5551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2917.98,2919.86,It's the... it's the killing with malice?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2919.86,2922.022,That's the way the statute was defined at the time--
1990.90-5551,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2922.022,2929.228,The malice may be supplied by premeditation or it may be supplied by the intent to commit the felony?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2929.228,2930.417,--Either way.
1990.90-5551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2955.634,2961.828,"May I just... because I don't think this makes a difference in the end result, but I just want to get my thinking straightened out."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2976.207,2981.78,"In Arizona the trial court is required to make the finding during the sentencing phase, yes."
1990.90-5551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2981.78,2982.021,Right.
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2982.021,2984.021,Independent of what the jury may have found.
1990.90-5551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2984.021,2998.271,"Would he have been permitted to do that if the jury had only been instructed on felony murder and in effect... or had two separate counts and rejected the premeditated and found felony, would he still be permitted under Arizona law to impose the death penalty?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,2998.271,2999.753,"Yes, he would have been."
1990.90-5551,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3098.766,3101.828,In what case do you say this Court established that rule?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3101.828,3110.244,"--It's a matter of procedure and established that in Schmuck v. United States, Your Honor, 1989 case out of this Court."
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3171.025,3177.967,What is second degree murder that... there was an instruction on second degree murder?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3177.967,3179.299,"There was in this case, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3179.299,3180.05,What is that?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3180.05,3184.072,Second degree murder is any type of murder that is not first degree.
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3191.368,3203.726,"Well, what... so to get to that, you would have to say no felony murder... no premeditated murder, no felony murder... but murder."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3203.726,3205.557,--To get a second degree murder?
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3241.11,3258.37,"Well, they... but they would have to find him not guilty of either premeditated or felony murder in order to hold him guilty... to let him off with second degree murder?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3258.37,3259.272,Right.
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3261.443,3264.755,As a matter of law under Arizona law and under those instructions.
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3264.755,3267.437,--Under the... the instructions didn't exactly follow the law.
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3268.068,3274.623,"Well, they... yeah, but the instructions said if you don't find him guilty of first degree murder, you may find him guilty of second degree murder."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3274.623,3275.692,That's right.
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3275.692,3284.567,"Well, to find him not guilty of first degree murder, you would have to say he wasn't... they weren't guilty of either premeditated or felony murder."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3284.567,3288.05,"Under the instructions, that's exactly what happened... would have happened."
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3296.244,3299.066,What's the penalty for second degree murder?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3299.066,3305.05,At that time I believe the capital... the top end was 15 years... either 10 or 15 years in Arizona.
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.572,3307.804,5 to 15?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3307.804,3308.773,5 to 15.
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3308.773,3311.355,What was the penalty for robbery?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3314.667,3316.43,"I'm not sure of that, Your Honor."
1990.90-5551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3329.036,3331.459,May I ask this about second degree murder?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3352.661,3354.364,"No, he could not be."
1990.90-5551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3373.126,3375.916,"I mean, you had to follow the law, that they could not have done that consistently with the law."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3375.916,3377.358,--Yes.
1990.90-5551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3383.392,3388.155,"Well, no, I'm just saying... forget what these instructions... as a matter of Arizona law--"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3388.155,3388.856,Okay.
1990.90-5551,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3388.856,3401.695,"--if the jury was totally convinced and properly instructed that he did... had nothing to do with the killing except his participation in the robbery, but he was guilty of the robbery, could they... and consistently with Arizona law, find him guilty of a second degree murder?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3401.695,3402.446,No.
1990.90-5551,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3402.446,3415.083,"So your position is that if you have an indictment in which you'd alleged just the felony murder aspect of the Arizona statute, there is no requirement for any lesser included offense under Beck?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3415.083,3416.044,That's correct.
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3423.688,3433.565,"Well, if they... if there was proof in the question of robbery... of course in a lot of felony murders I suppose you can prove who killed him?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3433.565,3435.265,That's correct.
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3435.265,3446.992,"And if there's proof that... of the... if the jury believes that there was not only a robbery, but this defendant killed him, would they give him second degree murder?"
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3446.992,3450.805,"Not under Arizona law, no."
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3450.805,3451.546,Why not?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3451.546,3452.986,That the Arizona--
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3452.986,3453.517,That's the way it is?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3453.517,3464.266,--court has decided that there is no lesser included offense of... for felony murder that includes second... second degree or the lesser... any homicide.
1990.90-5551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3470.33,3473.951,So it's only a second degree to premeditated?
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3473.951,3476.523,"Under the Arizona law, that's correct."
1990.90-5551,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3476.523,3477.804,"Thank you, Mr. Ford."
1990.90-5551,1,39190,r_wayne_ford,,3477.804,3478.155,Thank you.
1990.90-5551,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3478.155,3479.745,"Ms. Young, do you have rebuttal?"
