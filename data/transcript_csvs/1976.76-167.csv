1976.76-167,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,60.947,"We will hear arguments next in 167, United States v. Ramsey."
1976.76-167,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,65.372,68.966,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court."
1976.76-167,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,145.579,148.074,Are these fairly sizable envelopes?
1976.76-167,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,148.074,160.655,"The envelopes, Mr. Justices Blackmun, were 8.5x4.25 inches and 6.75x4.75 inches, they are normal sized envelopes used in domestic and international mail."
1976.76-167,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,162.817,164.27,That is the size of the envelope.
1976.76-167,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,164.27,164.477,Yes.
1976.76-167,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,164.477,171.414,I suppose it would depend in fact on what was in them to determine how big the package was.
1976.76-167,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,177.707,179.634,"No, it had more than that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1976.76-167,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,182.765,186.701,Can you answer the question in terms of ounces or grams?
1976.76-167,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,186.701,198.811,"Yes, officer Kallnischkies weighed the envelopes because they seemed rather unusually bulky and large, and he determined that they weighed 42 grams, which is about an ounce-and-a-half."
1976.76-167,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,227.883,235.822,Then are you asking us to infer that there was a probable cause?
1976.76-167,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,235.822,241.829,"Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, the Court of Appeals in an obscure footnote hinted that there might well be -- have been probable cause there."
1976.76-167,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,241.829,243.358,What is your position?
1976.76-167,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,243.358,244.679,"Well, we hesitate to disagree…"
1976.76-167,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,244.679,247.486,I thought your position was that there was no probable cause.
1976.76-167,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,247.486,253.398,"Our position is that probable cause is not necessary, and our position in addition is that, using the standards of probable cause…"
1976.76-167,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,253.398,261.101,"If there was probable cause here we do not need to deal with whether or not probable cause is necessary, because if there was probable cause, then there was probable cause."
1976.76-167,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,261.101,276.668,"Well, if Your Honor’s determine that a warrant requirement should not be imposed on border searches, but that a probable cause requirement may or may not be necessary, I think you would have to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals based upon the Court of Appeals apparent conclusion that there was probable cause here."
1976.76-167,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,276.668,278.837,"And you agree, are you submitting there was?"
1976.76-167,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,278.837,290.871,"Well, we hesitate, as I said, to take issue with that because it is favorable to the government, but we think using the standards developed for probable cause in domestic searches, that it is hard to say that officer Kallnischkies has had probable cause here."
1976.76-167,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,301.126,308.576,"Well, I am just inquiring whether your position is that there was probable cause or whether your position is that there was not probable cause."
1976.76-167,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,308.576,317.474,"Our position is that it is difficult to conclude that there was probable cause here, as that standard has been determined for domestic searches."
1976.76-167,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,328.802,342.797,"But when you get off the airplane at any international airport, or when you are about to get off, does the government need probable cause to support the search of your suitcase and your briefcase and your pockets?"
1976.76-167,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,342.797,344.228,It does not Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.76-167,1,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1739.259,1743.523,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.76-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1826.765,1843.447,"Or maybe he did not know about this statute that appears on the appendix of the government’s petition for search, presiding and to search any trunk or envelope wherever found, in which he may have reasonable cause to suspect and so forth, maybe he did not know about that."
1976.76-167,1,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1843.447,1854.978,"I find that hard to believe Chief Justice, that the General Council of the post office concerned dealing with customs day-to-day, would not know or be apprised of this statute, I frankly must reject that."
1976.76-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1854.978,1859.728,"If he did not know about it then he was disagreeing with this statute, was not he?"
1976.76-167,1,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1859.728,1861.745,"Well, assuming he did not know about it, but I cannot…"
1976.76-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.745,1866.688,"Is there any other alternative; either that he didn’t know about it, or he did not agree with it?"
1976.76-167,1,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1866.688,1872.067,The only alternative I can say is he knew about it and did not think it applied to the circumstances at hand.
1976.76-167,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1872.067,1875.134,But he did not think envelope in the mail.
1976.76-167,1,16700,allan_m_palmer,,1875.134,1891.719,"Well, I think, like I did, he viewed the history of that statute, the progenitor of it in 1866, is clear that it only concerned with envelopes or trunks on person, vehicle, etcetera, and that the present statute is merely a shorthand version of it."
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,2717.687,2722.345,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.76-167,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2841.518,2856.83,"What about the cases where the opening of the envelope disclosed pornographic pictures, we had that just two or three years ago."
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,2856.83,2859.177,"Yes, 37 photographs."
1976.76-167,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2859.177,2861.211,I see.
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,2867.059,2882.394,"Well, I think we look at this as a number of different situations at the border, rather than say that everything that crosses the border, whether it moves or not, is detainable or not, is subject to an exception from the entire Fourth Amendment."
1976.76-167,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2904.175,2915.326,"Well, at the border, question is whether the person or the thing is going to be admitted into the country, is it not?"
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,2915.471,2916.823,"Yes, that is one of the…"
1976.76-167,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2916.823,2921.558,That is the whole enterprise of having border guards and all that sort of thing?
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,2921.558,2921.724,Yes
1976.76-167,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2921.724,2925.553,"They are not yet admitted when they are being examined, is that not so?"
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,2925.553,2926.823,That is correct.
1976.76-167,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2934.322,2936.2,"Open his briefcase, his trunk?"
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,2936.2,2939.722,"Yes, because that may evade capture if not done at the time."
1976.76-167,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2939.722,2954.19,"Don't you also have the alternative there Mr. Panzer of being able to simply detain them at the border, and not open their stuff, if the rationale is simply escape of capture."
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,2960.732,2964.142,"No, but that is too intrusive and too offensive."
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2977.196,2988.621,"Suppose somebody comes in with eight envelopes in his suitcase, and the customs agent opens it up, could he open those envelopes?"
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,2988.621,2991.073,"It is my view that he could, it is my view that there is a …"
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2991.073,2995.291,"Alright, now he has them in his pocket, could he open them up?"
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,2995.291,2996.726,"Yes, it is my view that he could."
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2996.726,2999.221,"He had them in his hands, could he open them up?"
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,2999.221,3000.091,"Yes, my view is that he can."
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3000.091,3002.138,"He send them ahead, could he open them up?"
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,3002.138,3003.354,They could not.
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3003.354,3004.716,The difference is?
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,3004.716,3005.812,In the mail.
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3006.733,3008.317,"Mail, it is in the mail?"
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,3008.317,3010.243,"Yes, I make a distinction between mail and --"
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3010.243,3013.904,(Inaudible) in the airplane.
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,3013.904,3015.577,In the form of a letter?
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3015.577,3022.616,"The AI eight letters on an airplane and agreed to deliver it in New York, could they take those off?"
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,3022.616,3027.357,"No, they could not, if that is regular letter mail, they could not, not without a search warrant."
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3027.357,3035.572,"It was not mailed, they just gave the eight letters and said deliver them to Kennedy Airport."
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,3035.572,3037.049,"I see, it is a personal delivery…"
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3037.049,3041.086,"You do not think customs would take them off, I have got news for you."
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,3045.06,3047.161,"Well, I think mail is different."
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3047.161,3048.574,Is the privacy what you are talking about?
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,3048.574,3049.724,"Yes, it is the expectation of privacy."
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3049.724,3053.408,"Well, it is private if it is in his possession, as if it is in the mail."
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,3053.408,3059.209,"I do not think we have an expectation of privacy if we carry that same letter with us, no."
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3065.502,3073.583,"Well, right now, if you walk around the street with envelope in your pocket, do not you have the right to think that, that will be private?"
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,3073.583,3074.875,"Yes, just as anything else I have."
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3074.875,3077.367,And it will not change when you cross the border.
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,3077.367,3079.477,"At the border, I do not have that expectation, no."
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3079.477,3081.201,"But that is the same with mail, isn’t it?"
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,3081.201,3086.845,"No, I think mail when sent in from abroad rises to a wholly different level."
1976.76-167,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3100.717,3109.267,"I might go along with you if you have a constitutional right to write a nice letter, but I get in trouble with if the guy is choosing to right the mail 51:34."
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,3109.267,3111.853,"Let us turn to another point, though."
1976.76-167,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3147.317,3149.088,What about a package of books?
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,3149.088,3155.208,"A letter rises to First Amendment levels that a package or a book does not, in my opinion."
1976.76-167,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3155.208,3158.868,A letter then in your view has a superior First Amendment claim to --
1976.76-167,2,28649,irving_r_m_panzer,,3158.868,3163.43,"Absolutely, absolutely, and that makes the difference, because --"
1976.76-167,3,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3585.247,3586.967,"Yes, Mr. Justice Powell."
1976.76-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3688.785,3693.265,"But isn’t the reason nobody questioned it, because the government did not do anything?"
1976.76-167,3,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3693.265,3694.683,"Well, the Government has been opening packages…"
1976.76-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3694.683,3698.902,"Well, they took it to the man and said, will you give me your consent, and if he said no, they would not open it, so he did not have the problem."
1976.76-167,3,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3698.902,3704.371,"No, Mr. Justice Stevens, packages have always been opened at the border without the addressee being present under the…"
1976.76-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3704.371,3706.785,"I am talking about envelopes, thought."
1976.76-167,3,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3709.278,3709.783,"That is correct, that is right."
1976.76-167,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3709.783,3711.005,"Oh, I see."
1976.76-167,3,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3711.005,3716.314,And in fact I believe Cotzhausen might have been considered a package rather an envelope under the Court of Appeals stand.
1976.76-167,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3716.314,3717.18,Thank you gentlemen.
