2002.01-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,6.853,"We will now hear argument in Number 01-1120, Meyer against Holley."
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,8.256,10.957,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,97.01,115.503,Suppose... suppose that I were to agree with you and the Court were to agree with you as to your criticism of the Ninth Circuit's reasoning and... and that it agreed with you too that general principles of agency and corporate liability apply.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,132.675,133.956,--The answer--
2002.01-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,133.956,137.011,Or... or would I have to... would we have to remand before we did that?
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,159.385,160.211,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,160.211,163.35,"If... if we find who the principal is, we know the principal is going to be liable."
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,163.35,163.888,That's where--
2002.01-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,163.888,166.572,Under California law the broker is the principal.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,166.572,171.152,"--My... Your Honor, my answer to that is... is several-fold."
2002.01-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,193.815,196.294,But isn't it fair to say that... or isn't it?
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,206.697,207.861,"It has to, Your Honor."
2002.01-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,218.419,230.307,Is... is there any California law saying that... that the corporation is the principal in a situation like this and not the holder of the... not the... not the named broker?
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,230.307,236.706,"--The named broker, again... to answer your question, no, not that I'm aware of."
2002.01-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,236.706,237.738,This... this is a--
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.738,238.731,--Let me ask the opposite.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,247.397,249.998,"Not the designated officer, Your Honor."
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,251.855,252.227,Yes.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,252.97,255.365,But not the designated officer/broker.
2002.01-1120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,255.365,255.903,So--
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,280.878,282.281,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2002.01-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,314.769,317.536,May I ask you this question?
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,331.653,332.275,"--Yes, it has, Your Honor."
2002.01-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,362.739,367.281,"So in this case the individual could be subject to discipline, but not to liability."
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,367.753,368.107,Correct.
2002.01-1120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,368.107,368.767,--Yes.
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.767,369.76,What were your other reasons.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,374.84,375.416,The--
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,375.416,377.895,--prongs or the other facets of your answer?
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,377.895,384.432,--The other facets is that liability under the FHA cannot be premised on California agency law.
2002.01-1120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,434.942,435.564,Is that--
2002.01-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,435.564,441.841,--Suppose it were the majority rule that a real estate broker is the principal for the salesman.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,443.737,445.966,"Again, Your Honor, the--"
2002.01-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,445.966,450.962,"And again, I'm... I'm referring to the red brief at pages 14 and 15 which sets this... this out."
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,458.021,458.559,--Correct.
2002.01-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,458.559,462.524,"Now, we... I... we can explore that a little bit."
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,467.847,476.27,"To answer that question, I think you still need to make a distinction between individual brokers and corporate licensed brokers."
2002.01-1120,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,478.228,482.564,"Well, I... I was simply addressing the point of whether or not State law as opposed to Federal law controls."
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,491.442,494.314,"--Again, I... I disagree, Your Honor."
2002.01-1120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,508.969,516.028,I thought you said those were general common law principles that are... presumably the States would share.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,516.028,541.003,"The general law principles applied in the broker/agent context would establish that the agent... the sales agent... is the agent of the principal broker when the broker is acting in his individual capacity when the agent is acting on behalf of the principal, of the individual broker, and subject to that broker's control."
2002.01-1120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,552.603,578.792,"Then if I understand your argument correctly, you're saying that the discussion, whether it's California law or Federal common law, is in this case at least academic because under California law, if you were to apply it, there is no relief for these plaintiffs, that the only remedy where it's... the license is held in the corporate name is a disciplinary sanction?"
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,578.792,586.04,"To date, that is how California has treated violations of the California statutory scheme."
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.866,591.696,Only... only by these corporate brokers or... or by... by individual brokers?
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,591.696,592.439,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.719,594.296,Okay.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,594.296,601.81,It's a statutory scheme that applies to brokers in general and salespersons in general who... who allegedly violate the act.
2002.01-1120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,601.81,616.216,"But I thought you said that if... if this were a license to an individual broker, if this were held... the license were held by Meyer as an individual... that he would then have a principal agent relationship with Crank."
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,617.209,619.893,"That is correct, Your Honor, if it's an individual broker's license."
2002.01-1120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,652.625,668.395,Is there an issue in this case about piercing the corporate veil as a means of holding Meyer liable?
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,668.395,670.086,"Not in this case, Your Honor."
2002.01-1120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,690.481,690.647,But they came--
2002.01-1120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,690.647,697.251,--Was there some reference to veil-piercing in the respondents' brief in the Ninth Circuit?
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,697.251,711.081,"On the last page of argument in a footnote, Your Honor, there's a reference arguing that based on sole ownership, that they could establish an alter ego, but as a matter of law, that's insufficient to establish alter ego."
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,711.081,714.258,"Well, didn't... refresh my recollection."
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,716.737,718.761,"First a motion to dismiss, Your Honor--"
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,718.761,718.944,Yes.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,718.944,719.399,--followed by a--
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.399,721.999,Which was denied and then there was a motion for summary judgment.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,721.999,726.086,"--The motion for dismiss was granted in part, Your Honor, as to all the State law claims--"
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,726.086,726.457,Okay.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,726.457,730.051,"--the 1981 claim, and it proceeded just on the FHA claim."
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.051,730.438,Right.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,743.547,744.456,Absolutely.
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,744.456,745.504,And what did they bring forward?
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,745.504,747.734,"Nothing, except sole ownership."
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,747.734,750.689,Sole ownership is the only thing--
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,750.689,752.092,Which is in dispute.
2002.01-1120,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,761.341,776.656,"--I thought that if... that a judgment winner, as the Holleys are at this stage, can defend the judgment on another ground."
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,820.784,825.242,They... the theory was never raised below.
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.728,861.158,"Even if... even if it had been raised, my understanding is in... in order to have it sent back on the... on the basis that although the court below relied on one theory, it could have relied on the other, the motion for summary judgment put the plaintiff to his proof to... to at least come up with facts, the assertion of facts, not the demonstration of them, but the assertion of facts that would support the other theory."
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,871.848,872.591,That's correct.
2002.01-1120,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,874.533,876.762,I thought there were a bunch of things.
2002.01-1120,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,899.069,903.777,"I mean, they have a list of things which I take it they didn't just make up, that they're there in the record."
2002.01-1120,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,903.777,923.301,"Then... and then they say that, well, in the Ninth Circuit brief, what it says in the footnote is that evidence... evidence will show that Meyer is the sole shareholder of Triad, and thus an argument to pierce the corporate veil would be meritorious."
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,940.762,941.877,No.
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.014,973.955,Was it not even asserted?
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,975.031,975.691,--No.
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.691,982.09,"--to survive the motion for summary judgment, you don't have to prove it, but you have to say I... you know, I will prove it."
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,982.09,982.545,"No, it wasn't--"
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.545,983.659,It wasn't even asserted.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,983.659,984.941,--It was not even asserted.
2002.01-1120,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,986.92,990.429,"Well, in the footnote... they mention it in the footnote."
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,990.429,992.304,They mention sole ownership in the footnote.
2002.01-1120,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,992.304,994.433,"Well, that's... that's... you're quite right."
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,994.433,994.888,Yes.
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1006.283,1007.276,I don't know what that means.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,1011.074,1012.039,--Right.
2002.01-1120,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1012.477,1016.73,There... there was no evidence brought in at all to establish it.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,1016.73,1019.126,--That he... that taxes were paid under his ID?
2002.01-1120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1019.719,1023.517,"Well, was... was there an affidavit on their side claiming that?"
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,1023.517,1025.458,On the other side claiming that?
2002.01-1120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1025.458,1025.912,Yes.
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,1028.597,1032.228,It was raised solely as a... as an allegation in the complaint.
2002.01-1120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1036.935,1040.113,"So at the summary judgment stage, they didn't rely on that is what you're saying."
2002.01-1120,0,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,1040.113,1040.363,Correct.
2002.01-1120,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1040.363,1040.529,They didn't.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1401.877,1404.561,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1511.314,1517.092,"Well, could prove or... or claimed they could prove in response to the motion."
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1535.257,1548.138,"--And the facts that we alleged were that Mr. Meyer was the sole owner of the corporation, which they denied, and that that was sufficient to impose individual liability."
2002.01-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1556.805,1563.287,--isn't that true that... that you have to have something more than simply a person being a sole owner of a corporation?
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1568.034,1568.877,--Absolutely.
2002.01-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1568.877,1569.398,All right.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1577.654,1578.686,That's... that was my point--
2002.01-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1578.686,1579.308,Yes.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1579.308,1580.384,--with respect to the summary judgment.
2002.01-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1580.384,1580.794,All right.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1583.849,1584.925,I don't think so because--
2002.01-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1584.925,1585.18,Because?
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1585.18,1589.505,"--at the 12(b)(6) motion stage, we are told that you can't even--"
2002.01-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1589.505,1589.877,"No, no."
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1591.818,1592.19,--Yes.
2002.01-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1632.274,1632.563,Okay.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1645.156,1646.187,"Correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1648.683,1649.159,"No, no."
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1658.78,1673.269,"--The allegation, if I could refer Your Honor to page 4 of the joint appendix in paragraph 6 of the complaint, says that he owned the corporation and on that basis he's individually liable."
2002.01-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1680.865,1683.466,"Yes, I see where it says he owned the corporation."
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1691.079,1695.537,"--There is another part, Your Honor."
2002.01-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1713.787,1713.87,No.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1740.126,1744.623,"Well, I wish it was more detailed, Your Honor, but it seems to me it's sufficient for notice pleading."
2002.01-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1748.094,1755.563,"Well, he didn't seem to, in his opinion, understand it because the only reference he has to veil-piercing seems in a footnote in a paragraph."
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1769.392,1772.16,And that's at the 12(b)(6) stage.
2002.01-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.881,1785.822,This was at the summary judgment stage?
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1785.822,1786.399,"No, sir."
2002.01-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1793.995,1796.307,32 of the joint appendix.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1796.307,1797.422,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1861.118,1863.347,"Well, had you alleged any of these things?"
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1872.84,1873.583,--That we did allege.
2002.01-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1873.583,1874.204,Okay.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1881.635,1888.239,"Page 7 of the joint appendix, Your Honor, paragraph 13 toward the bottom of the page."
2002.01-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1893.273,1894.099,Yes.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1894.638,1895.009,--Got it?
2002.01-1120,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1895.009,1895.668,Yes.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1906.071,1910.036,We... we did not allege the details of that.
2002.01-1120,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1928.49,1937.285,You're... the point you're making is that you are not certainly required under the Federal rules to set out your... any theory of the pleadings.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1942.858,1944.799,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2002.01-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1962.509,1965.026,"Mr. Schwemm, can I ask you this question?"
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1967.544,1968.165,--Yes.
2002.01-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1968.165,1971.509,--a California question as esoteric as this one is.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1981.168,1983.026,Our position--
2002.01-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1983.026,1985.998,Or Federal regulation.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,1985.998,1996.112,"--is that the Ninth Circuit's judgment was correct, but it went too far when it reached out and said under the Fair Housing Act we have to go beyond traditional principles of agency."
2002.01-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2044.947,2049.982,"Well, then is your piercing-of-corporate-veil theory a Federal theory or a State law theory?"
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2049.982,2067.898,"Our position on that is that it's probably Federal law, but as I read Bestfoods, the Court hasn't specifically determined, and if I may say that this... this is something that I don't have a position on."
2002.01-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2148.478,2158.675,"Yes, but your opponent says that the... the results under California law is he can be disciplined if he fails to do so, but there are no California cases holding him personally liable if he fails to do so."
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2158.675,2162.596,"Our position is that that may be right, it may be wrong."
2002.01-1120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2165.197,2166.683,Do you think it's right or wrong?
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2166.683,2173.908,"If we got a remand, Your Honor, we would very much like the opportunity on this basis to argue that it's wrong."
2002.01-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.001,2206.23,"Well, can... can I go back to an earlier point you made."
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2247.84,2248.212,--Well--
2002.01-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2248.212,2256.718,"Now, as I understand the California law, this broker could not operate under that license on his own."
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2261.586,2263.815,--I would put it actually a little differently.
2002.01-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2314.608,2317.125,"Well, yes, but... sure, of course, there can."
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2325.382,2327.611,"Ordinarily, Your Honor, but not in this case."
2002.01-1120,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2340.493,2344.414,Do you think the Gipson case that you cited in your brief is on all fours with your case?
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2344.414,2346.25,"--No, Your Honor, it's not on all fours."
2002.01-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.697,2388.009,"Well, so that means you can't have a corporation."
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2398.246,2400.929,"There are many uses, Your Honor, and I would like to address that."
2002.01-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2424.873,2434.077,"Well, but if he defrauds a client or, I mean, anything that's going to involve big money on the part of the corporation is going to come back on the head of the individual broker."
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2440.765,2442.584,"Only I'm not saying it, Your Honor."
2002.01-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2442.584,2443.16,"That's... well, no."
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2445.473,2445.911,Yes.
2002.01-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2480.683,2485.596,That's even tougher than... than what most States provide for lawyers.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2485.596,2487.165,"--It's very analogous to lawyers, Your Honor."
2002.01-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2487.165,2487.453,No.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2520.807,2521.345,Let me--
2002.01-1120,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2521.345,2525.637,"Evidently that's what California has held, and given the wording, it seems reasonable."
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2525.637,2531.46,"--Well, it held that and then California's legislature came along and added... added the requirements."
2002.01-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.031,2577.118,I only have 74 pages in my joint appendix.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2577.611,2578.065,I'm sorry.
2002.01-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.544,2581.037,--Oh.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2581.037,2582.235,It's the large tan one.
2002.01-1120,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2582.235,2582.607,Got you.
2002.01-1120,1,40412,robert_g_schwemm,,2582.607,2586.943,"And this was done, by the way, for Mr. Crank on four different occasions."
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2637.848,2641.767,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1120,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2662.368,2670.624,"Well, do we look to general Federal common law agency principles, or are we bound by State agency law, Mr. Stewart?"
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2670.624,2672.193,I think the Court... I'm sorry.
2002.01-1120,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2702.619,2712.9,"Well, do you think it's fair to read the complaint that was filed as putting anyone on notice that it was a veil-piercing case?"
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2712.9,2714.924,--We think that the claim was adequately raised in the district court.
2002.01-1120,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2714.924,2715.212,Where?
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2715.212,2715.751,The--
2002.01-1120,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2715.751,2717.441,Could you read it to us?
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2717.441,2718.723,--The... the plaintiffs--
2002.01-1120,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2718.723,2721.999,Because it's not clear to me.
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2721.999,2723.014,--The plaintiffs--
2002.01-1120,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2723.014,2729.413,"I don't think if I read that complaint, I would read it as one that was proceeding on a veil-piercing theory."
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2729.413,2729.646,"--Well, the--"
2002.01-1120,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2729.646,2733.733,I would have thought it was proceeding on the designated broker theory.
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2733.733,2749.503,"--Well, the plaintiffs... the plaintiffs didn't use the phrase, veil-piercing, but on page of the joint appendix, for instance, they alleged that Mr. Meyer is the designated officer/broker of Triad, the president of Triad."
2002.01-1120,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2758.131,2766.199,But that would be consistent with a corporation that's wholly adequately funded and... and whose... which... whose veil cannot be pierced.
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2766.199,2770.02,--And it's true that they... they didn't allege in the complaint inadequate capitalization.
2002.01-1120,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2780.051,2781.165,"But it isn't... I mean, look."
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2843.292,2850.146,--I think you're right that the primary theory that the respondents advocated in the district court was based on Mr. Meyer's--
2002.01-1120,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2850.146,2850.396,No.
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2852.375,2856.052,"--Well, this... this was raised and disputed in the Ninth Circuit; that is--"
2002.01-1120,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2856.052,2856.712,In the footnote.
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2856.712,2859.938,--Not just in the footnote.
2002.01-1120,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2886.022,2898.448,"Of... of course, what was raised is we get Meyer because Meyer holds the license, and even though it's held in the name of the corporation, that really doesn't matter."
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2898.448,2898.82,No.
2002.01-1120,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2913.764,2914.169,"Well, maybe it is."
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2914.169,2919.83,"--in the light most favorable to the respondent, is the combination of functions that Mr. Meyer played."
2002.01-1120,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.569,2971.722,"Mr. Stewart, as... as I understand the theory of why the failure to bring forward affidavits or some... some evidentiary proof of these matters at the summary judgment stage was not necessary, as I understand it, the plaintiffs' theory is it wasn't necessary because the piercing-the-veil portion of the complaint never made it to the summary judgment stage."
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2974.944,2975.603,--That is correct.
2002.01-1120,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2975.603,2980.971,"Now, was there an appeal of that dismissal on the face of the complaint?"
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2980.971,2991.624,"The... the ultimate... there was not a separate appeal, but the ultimate appeal that went to the Ninth Circuit was an appeal both from the dismissal of certain portions of the complaint and from the grant of summary judgment with respect to--"
2002.01-1120,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2991.624,2992.654,What portion?
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3000.084,3001.488,--It was not specific.
2002.01-1120,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3017.796,3024.772,"--Well, so in addition to the complaint being very vague, the... the appeal of the dismissal was pretty vague too."
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3035.918,3044.091,I would acknowledge that the theory that... that we and the respondents have... the veil-piercing theory that we have advanced in this Court is a refinement of what was said in the Ninth Circuit.
2002.01-1120,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3070.097,3074.35,"Mr. Stewart, I'm... I'm confused about one procedural point."
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3076.951,3077.794,--There... there--
2002.01-1120,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3077.794,3096.286,"--at the end of the rope, one final judgment that says that defendant wins and then you... from that final judgment you can take up all the rulings against the verdict... the... the judgment loser?"
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3096.286,3097.029,--That... that's correct.
2002.01-1120,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3112.611,3119.775,And the final judgment would include all the rulings on the way to that final judgment disposing of the entire case.
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3119.775,3120.435,That... that's correct.
2002.01-1120,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3207.415,3216.415,"You don't... you don't rely in your submission on the proposition that under California law, the broker is liable."
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3216.415,3217.446,We... we don't.
2002.01-1120,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3217.901,3225.536,And is that because you accept the distinction between a corporate broker... a broker's license which is in the corporation?
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3225.536,3226.529,--I think it's partly that.
2002.01-1120,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3235.817,3245.97,"Suppose in a majority of the States, the broker is liable for the... I forget the... intervening corporate... suppose in a majority of the States, the broker is liable for the acts of the salesperson."
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3245.97,3246.796,May I answer?
2002.01-1120,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3246.796,3247.334,Yes.
2002.01-1120,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3247.334,3258.601,"If a consensus developed among the States that designated officers/brokers were sufficiently different from ordinary supervisors that they should be held vicariously liable, then we would advocate that as the general Federal rule."
2002.01-1120,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3261.573,3263.225,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2002.01-1120,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3263.225,3267.146,"Mr. Benedon, you have 7 minutes left."
2002.01-1120,3,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,3267.146,3273.545,"Your Honors, I would submit at this point unless there are any further questions."
2002.01-1120,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3273.545,3274.288,Thank you.
2002.01-1120,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3274.288,3274.588,I--
2002.01-1120,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3274.588,3275.114,"--Oh, excuse me."
2002.01-1120,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3275.114,3300.916,I do have... I'm still... what is... what is your response to the... to the assertion that it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to bring forward any affidavits or evidence at the summary judgment stage because on the... on the veil-piercing issue... because that issue was no longer alive at the... at the summary judgment stage.
2002.01-1120,3,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,3303.267,3308.096,"I would start from the premise that the veil-piercing theory was never born, not that it wasn't alive."
2002.01-1120,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3309.294,3320.068,"In other words, you... you concede that then and... and you... you fall back on... on the simple fact that the veil-piercing theory was never... was never really contained in the complaint."
2002.01-1120,3,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,3320.068,3321.842,"Never contained in the complaint, never raised--"
2002.01-1120,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3321.842,3322.752,But it is actually.
2002.01-1120,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3330.72,3333.071,That's what it says in paragraph 41.
2002.01-1120,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3333.071,3352.202,"And then previously in paragraph 13, it lists a whole lot of facts about the relationship of Mr. Meyer to the company including the fact about the tax numbers and so forth."
2002.01-1120,3,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,3374.393,3377.57,"--But again, we have to look at what are the allegations in the complaint."
2002.01-1120,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3377.57,3379.594,"Well, the allegations are just what I had said, paragraph--"
2002.01-1120,3,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,3379.594,3379.882,There--
2002.01-1120,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3379.882,3380.708,--Yes.
2002.01-1120,3,20634,douglas_g_benedon,,3380.708,3394.288,"--There are allegations of sole ownership, corporate... that he was the sole owner, that he was the officer/broker, and that he was the president, and that the taxes were paid under his ID number, an allegation that's never been proven."
2002.01-1120,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3446.839,3448.78,"Thank you, Mr. Benedon."
