1990.89-1452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.176,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-1452, Mobil Oil v. United Distribution Companies, and No. 89-1453, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. United Distribution Companies."
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,15.893,20.462,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1452,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,163.856,170.76,"Mr. Kneedler, my I ask you about the abandonment question--"
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,170.76,171.16,Yes.
1990.89-1452,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.16,172.328,--that we have in front of us.
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,189.339,193.291,"Well, there... the Commission's regulations specific... the answer is yes."
1990.89-1452,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,209.587,217.324,It wasn't clear to me from your brief whether that is the position that FERC was taking.
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,217.324,219.376,"No, that is, that is clearly our position."
1990.89-1452,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,221.728,222.178,Yes.
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,222.178,235.218,"What the Commission... the standard for abandonment under section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, the Commission may authorize abandonment if it concludes that the present or future public convenience or necessity warrants the abandonment."
1990.89-1452,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.301,441.419,Would that petition necessarily be given a hearing?
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,441.419,458.965,"I think that what would be required is that the, that the purchaser would at least have to make a showing of pretty substantial reasons why an exception should be made to the general standards in Order 451."
1990.89-1452,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,458.965,474.224,"So if I think that the, that the word hearing in 7(b) in that context requires an individualized hearing, it is not your contention that this waiver procedure through petition would necessarily satisfy it?"
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,474.224,477.342,"Well, I... I think the place--"
1990.89-1452,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.342,490.317,"I mean, you say the waiver, the waiver procedure is available, but you are not arguing that that necessarily fulfills the requirement, if there is one, which you contend there is not, of an individualized hearing."
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,490.317,495.138,"--Well, not across the board."
1990.89-1452,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,575.923,588.064,"Mr. Kneedler, perhaps it isn't significant, but we are talking about kind of an abandonment of a particular customer, rather than abandonment of service in the sense of the supply of gas is, doesn't come off the market, it just goes to some other purchaser, doesn't it?"
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,588.064,588.831,Yes.
1990.89-1452,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,674.503,688.013,"Mr. Kneedler, do you agree with the statement I see in the brief on the other side, the Commission has admitted that the new ceiling price for old gas would not be just and reasonable if it were actually collected?"
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,688.013,688.579,"No, we do not."
1990.89-1452,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.725,707.641,"What do they mean, if it were actually collected?"
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,707.641,710.943,"Well, again, this ties into this good faith negotiation procedure."
1990.89-1452,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,731.856,733.308,"Well, it sounds like you do agree with the statement."
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,733.308,735.494,"--No, no, what we don't agree--"
1990.89-1452,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,735.494,738.196,"You mean this contractually, it wouldn't be fair."
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,738.196,748.052,"--Well, it wouldn't be fair... this rule was in fact set up for the protection of respondents and pipelines and consumers, not for the protection of producers."
1990.89-1452,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,831.039,834.241,What about the other 10 percent that didn't have an escalator clause?
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,834.741,835.358,If the--
1990.89-1452,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.358,836.376,--Doesn't this provision apply to them?
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,836.376,837.026,"--No, it does not."
1990.89-1452,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.802,867.562,"But Mr. Kneedler, it is true, just following up on Justice White's question, that the ceiling price is presumably above the market price for most of the old gas, and that that price is nevertheless, in your view, just and reasonable?"
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,867.562,867.812,Yes.
1990.89-1452,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,867.812,868.028,Yes.
1990.89-1452,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,868.028,879.268,"And the reason that is so is because the Commission con... this price is based on calculations the Commission did in 1974, which have been updated over time by inflation."
1990.89-1452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,915.976,917.376,"Very well, Mr. Kneedler."
1990.89-1452,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,919.428,922.463,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1362.562,1364.062,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,1366.03,1370.251,"Thank you, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1452,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1487.376,1497.065,"Ms. Halladay, the statute says that FERC can raise the price ceiling on any gas, so long as it is just and reasonable."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,1513.276,1518.097,"It cannot be the end of it unless, of course, we ignore the statute as a whole."
1990.89-1452,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1579.838,1585.992,"Well, certainly the Commission can change its mind and its approach, so long as it's within its statutory authority."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,1585.992,1587.392,It can change its mind.
1990.89-1452,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1604.768,1610.155,"Well, Congress decided that that should happen at the moment when it passed its legislation."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,1615.741,1617.01,I think--
1990.89-1452,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.01,1618.343,"I mean, does that appear anywhere in the statute?"
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,1629.901,1645.327,--And yet the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also ruled in Order 72 that one of the key components of the overall pricing scheme of the NGPA had been the continued availability of sections 104 and 106 to old gas.
1990.89-1452,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1770.808,1772.426,"That is the ceiling price, Ms. Halladay?"
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,1775.794,1777.378,--Is the new ceiling price--
1990.89-1452,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.378,1777.778,--Is the new ceiling.
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,1788.019,1792.238,"--There have been, as Mr. Kneedler pointed out, a number of negotiations."
1990.89-1452,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1876.744,1887.1,"When you say the pipeline offers to pay the market price, that suggests that the price it is paying under the contract is lower than market?"
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,1887.1,1890.837,In many cases the prices were lower than market.
1990.89-1452,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1891.354,1893.287,So you have really three kinds of prices.
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,1899.091,1902.626,"--Yes, quite grossly above the market ever since the rule was adopted."
1990.89-1452,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1914.581,1915.716,Which it has succeeded in doing.
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,1915.716,1919.818,--It has in some cases succeeded in doing that--
1990.89-1452,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1919.818,1922.501,Overall it has succeeded in doing that.
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,1926.555,1937.946,"--Yes, but now, if that is true, it is interesting because precise language in section 121 of the act stated where Congress intended to deregulate and where it did not intend to price deregulate."
1990.89-1452,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2030.868,2033.318,"Well, it does have these teeth at least."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2054.731,2057.25,"The Commission, of course, that is its position."
1990.89-1452,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2225.141,2232.294,"If the producer walks away when you offer the market price, can't you find other people to buy from at the market price?"
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2232.294,2235.662,Under present conditions that is likely to happen.
1990.89-1452,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2243.268,2249.839,"Well, whatever the future holds, it's a truism that you can always buy a commodity at the market price."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2254.158,2257.778,"Well, that would be a truism, but for, in this case, Order 451."
1990.89-1452,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2270.919,2273.371,"I don't see why that is, Ms. Halladay."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2284.679,2291.499,In many cases they are able to make a substitute because the market does provide that opportunity.
1990.89-1452,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2300.986,2305.473,"Well, true, and the market won't be what it, the same today as it is 3 months from now."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2311.627,2320.296,"Well, the further point is in fact that that is what Congress specifically intended as to new and hard-to-produce gas by virtue of section--"
1990.89-1452,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2320.296,2322.065,--You say that is what Congress--
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2322.065,2325.934,--The ability to go out and shop in the market for gas supplies.
1990.89-1452,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2325.934,2328.236,"--Which you, which the pipelines now have."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2328.236,2337.158,"But in the NGPA, what Congress said is the pipelines should make that kind of a shopping excursion as to new gas and hard-to-produce gas."
1990.89-1452,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.905,2361.69,Unless perhaps the Commission wanted it to.
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2370.729,2378.235,In this case in fact the Commission alleges that it has regulated in some sense the abandonment of old gas.
1990.89-1452,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2486.337,2499.312,"What, what use would it be for an individual party to participate, unless he is contradicting one of the, compliance with one of the general requirements that the Commission has set forth by rule."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2509.834,2514.321,"Well, that is our whole concern, because the Commission has said if you don't say A, B, or C, don't even bother coming to us."
1990.89-1452,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.356,2522.142,Isn't the Commission entitled to set forth the conditions on which it will permit abandonment?
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2524.427,2525.962,The Commission--
1990.89-1452,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.962,2530.181,"Whether by rule or by adjudication, it is going to set forth criteria for abandonment."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2531.114,2534.918,"--But it has to, it has to provide some regulatory presence for itself."
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2600.742,2605.11,"Well, do you... are there escalator clauses in your clients' contracts?"
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2605.11,2605.61,"Yes, there are."
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2605.61,2607.412,And what do they mean?
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2614.716,2615.1,Exactly.
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2615.1,2621.988,"I would think, I would think you would like to get out of that contract... if the market is lower, if--"
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2621.988,2628.992,"That, of course, was a problem as to these high-cost contracts that were contributing to the take or pay problem."
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2638.331,2650.223,"--Well, that may be, but under... I suppose under your contract you would, if the producer said, pay me the ceiling price or else, you are supposed to pay it, aren't you?"
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2650.223,2653.758,"Under the contract as it stood, that is true."
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.329,2670.387,"Well, yes, but if the producer has said to your clients either pay the ceiling price or not, or the contract is cancelled, I suppose you would prefer the contract was cancelled."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2670.387,2673.505,"--In some instances that might be true, but where you--"
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2673.505,2675.039,"Well, what instances wouldn't you, if you--"
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2675.039,2675.905,"--Well, when you... for example,--"
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.905,2679.523,"--Because if the contract is cancelled, you can automatically go get gas at the market."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2679.523,2685.177,"--But you can't always buy the volume that you need or when you need it, and so the problem is that we have--"
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.177,2690.665,"Well, I know, but... are you saying then you would stick to the contract and pay the ceiling price?"
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2690.665,2695.283,--There have been instances when respondents have had to stick to the contract because they needed the gas supply.
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2715.78,2721.767,"Well, it looks to me like the good faith negotiation provision is really in your favor."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2721.767,2727.254,"That was their statement, but any kind of a hard look at that indicates it cannot be."
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2730.17,2738.36,"Well, I know, but if there hadn't been that process provided for and... why, the producer can, is in charge anyway."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2742.763,2749.333,"--And had there not been that process, the Commission would have taken an action that it itself conceded was unlawful."
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2750.952,2751.935,When did... wait a minute.
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2751.935,2753.821,--The Commission defined--
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2753.821,2754.587,What is the basis for that statement?
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2754.587,2760.741,--The Commission stated that the GFN process is an integral component of the rate itself.
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.917,2911.769,You mean the ceiling price?
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2911.769,2922.209,"The ceil... the price of... the average wellhead price paid for old gas is now higher than the average price of all other wellhead gas, including new gas that has been deregulated."
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.722,2950.228,"Well, if the market, if you say the Commission really deregulated it and said the market is going to set the price for old gas, is that what you say?"
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2950.228,2950.611,Um hum.
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2950.611,2953.763,And they deregulated new gas--
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2953.763,2956.715,Congress deregulated new gas.
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2956.715,2957.015,"--Well, all right."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2961.869,2962.852,In many cases it is.
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2963.935,2973.874,"Well, why... if the market is determining both kinds of gas, why do you say old gas is, in the marketplace is getting a higher price than new gas?"
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2973.874,2978.278,"--Because, in fact, its price has gone up under this rule in some instances."
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2979.495,2979.995,"Well, why would it?"
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2981.811,2982.53,--The procedure--
1990.89-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.53,2983.263,--I don't know why it wouldn't--
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,2983.263,2987.399,--The procedure apparently isn't working in all respects as they anticipated.
1990.89-1452,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3008.578,3020.286,"--Ms. Halladay, Congress wanted this great disparity in the prices and the much higher price for new gas at the time the statute was passed, which was a time of severe gas shortage."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,3020.286,3020.536,Um hum.
1990.89-1452,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3020.536,3027.106,"Which has been transformed in, or was transformed into a period of gas glut, was it not?"
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,3027.106,3028.073,That is true.
1990.89-1452,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3028.073,3035.379,"And this is what the, what the Commission is doing, is scrambling to take account of those vastly altered, of that vastly altered situation."
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,3053.756,3062.01,"No, no, Congress never said that the Commission could deregulate old gas, and the Commission in Order 451 specifically said it could not."
1990.89-1452,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3080.238,3088.56,"You think it's a good thing that there should still be a great incentive for the production of new gas as opposed to old gas, so that the glut can be, can get even bigger?"
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,3088.56,3089.345,"Well,--"
1990.89-1452,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.345,3089.845,That's the--
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,3089.845,3091.095,"--Actually, the Commission--"
1990.89-1452,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3091.095,3092.131,--That's the condition you want to perpetuate?
1990.89-1452,2,39480,roberta_lee_halladay,,3092.131,3094.881,--I just want to follow a scheme that Congress proposed.
1990.89-1452,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3109.926,3112.709,"The bottom line is your time has expired, Ms. Halladay."
1990.89-1452,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3116.497,3118.313,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1452,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3131.756,3142.564,"Mr. Kneedler, could you explain the apparent contradiction that the Commission says a ceiling price is just and reasonable but does not allow it to be charged--"
1990.89-1452,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3142.564,3144.564,The Commission doesn't prohibit--
1990.89-1452,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3144.564,3145.849,--without later negotiation.
1990.89-1452,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3146.649,3155.622,"--Well, first of all, what the Natural Gas Act provides, allows the Commission to set a rate within a zone of reasonableness, as the Commission has said in Permian Basin."
1990.89-1452,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3155.622,3157.824,It says the ceiling is within the zone--
1990.89-1452,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3157.824,3161.108,"The ceiling was within the zone and certainly the market, the current market price is within the zone."
1990.89-1452,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3161.108,3161.541,--I have no problem with that.
1990.89-1452,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3162.141,3182.805,"And what the Commission has said is that because automatic collection of the higher price, not that it is a just and reasonable rate in the abstract, but that automatically allowing producers to charge rates above the market would distort the market, and therefore not be just and reasonable within the context of a rule that is trying to bring order and regularity to the market."
1990.89-1452,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3190.375,3191.475,You think the Commission could do that to rates?
1990.89-1452,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3198.481,3199.231,"--Well, no--"
1990.89-1452,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3199.231,3201.331,"I mean, is that the definition of a just and reasonable rate?"
1990.89-1452,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3201.331,3201.797,"--No, no."
1990.89-1452,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3202.433,3204.616,"If you can coerce somebody into paying it, it is just and reasonable."
1990.89-1452,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3205.301,3211.622,"--No, because there is an important limitation here, and it is also the complete answer to the respondents' position that this price is deregulated."
1990.89-1452,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3246.961,3251.33,"Mr. Kneedler, can you help me on one concept on the abandonment part of the case?"
1990.89-1452,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3266.256,3266.806,"No, no."
1990.89-1452,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3274.746,3279.849,--What if the producer decides that it's no longer economic to produce gas from that particular well?
1990.89-1452,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3279.849,3288.003,"--Well, the Commission's position on that is that its jurisdiction does not extend to additional productions of gas from wells, that that is subject to State jurisdiction."
1990.89-1452,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3307.167,3314.754,"So this order doesn't, this order just doesn't deal with the problem of abandonment that we normally think of in other regulatory contexts of discontinuing production?"
1990.89-1452,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3314.754,3316.522,"--Right, this is... this speaks of abandonment of sales."
1990.89-1452,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3316.522,3317.155,Okay.
1990.89-1452,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3317.155,3324.378,"And again, only in circumstances where the, where the pipeline is unwilling to pay the market-responsive price and a price that it is obligated to pay by contract."
1990.89-1452,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3378.577,3379.993,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
