1998.98-369,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,54.988,"We'll hear argument next in No. 98-369, National Aeronautics and Space Administration v. Federal Labor Relations Authority."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,56.367,58.59,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,101.808,109.952,"Mr. Frederick, before you get too far into it, how is the FLRA appointed?"
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,113.145,116.277,"Yes, it is, Justice Scalia, appointed by the President."
1998.98-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.277,118.718,"But once appointed, cannot be removed by him?"
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,118.718,119.188,No.
1998.98-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,122.601,135.291,"Well, if all of the agencies don't like this ruling that the FLRA has come up with, why don't they just tell the President to... you know, to tell them to shape up or ship out and put in people who will agree with what the agencies want?"
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,139.672,154.752,"This Court has made clear on numerous decisions, Justice Scalia, that this particular statutory scheme is permissible and acceptable and that the courts are the appropriate place to resolve disputes that arise between the FLRA and agency management."
1998.98-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,158.134,158.595,You're right.
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,189.845,193.227,I'm not an... I am not prepared on the Federal Power Commission.
1998.98-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,193.227,196.599,"Well, I think it was so the President couldn't control it."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,214.081,229.802,"If I could return to this case, the control theory upon which the court below based... part of its theory is based on a mistaken construction of the Inspector General Act, a statute that is outside the FLRA's expertise."
1998.98-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,262.823,279.654,"Well, Mr. Frederick, normally we would defer to the agency interpretation of the meaning of the language, and here the FLRA wants to tell us that they interpret this language of representative of the agency as including the Inspector General."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,279.654,280.345,--Deference--
1998.98-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,280.345,282.025,"So, why don't we defer?"
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,282.025,284.026,"--Two reasons, Justice O'Connor."
1998.98-369,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,363.557,365.09,Could I come to your first point?
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,396.459,418.736,"Justice Scalia, the answer is no, and the reason is that there is nothing in the Inspector General Act that gives the FLRA authority to construe the provisions of that statute just as this Court in the ATF case held that the FLRA was not entitled to deference in... in construing the travel allowance statute, which is a statute that was outside its area of presumed expertise."
1998.98-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,418.736,426.282,"Well, I thought the statute we were construing was 5 U.S. Code, section 7114 (a)(2)(B)."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,426.923,428.073,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1998.98-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,428.073,430.925,Is that within the jurisdiction of the FLRA?
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,430.925,432.246,"Yes, it is, Justice O'Connor."
1998.98-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,432.246,437.46,"So, why can't it say what is meant by the term a representative of the agency?"
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,437.46,442.213,"Well, there are two bases on which it has done that, and... and let me try again."
1998.98-369,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,469.059,471.022,"But, Mr. Frederick, I didn't understand them as doing that."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,532.261,536.996,"I have several responses to that, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.98-369,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,582.033,596.814,"What was the... all the language in Weingarten... and I realize that Weingarten itself is not what's before us, but 7114... that the employee may be too fearful or inarticulate to relate accurate... accurately the incident being investigated?"
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,622.439,640.501,"That was a factor, Justice Ginsburg, but as we have quoted in our main brief at pages 20 to 21 from the Court's Weingarten decision at pages 260 to 261, the safeguard is to redress the perceived imbalance of economic power between labor and management."
1998.98-369,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,640.501,647.987,The... the statute says an exclusive representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be represented.
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,651.409,652.92,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-369,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,685.641,695.678,"Why wouldn't Congress have just wanted to, just thinking about it crudely, say, well, if a person who can afford it can have his lawyer in the room, many of those who can't afford it could have their union rep?"
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,712.599,714.579,"--Well, that would be--"
1998.98-369,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,714.579,717.823,Why isn't that a reasonable interpretation of what Congress was doing here?
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,717.823,719.405,"--No, Justice Breyer, it is not."
1998.98-369,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,757.87,758.281,"No, that's right."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,775.491,777.411,"--No, it would not, Justice Breyer."
1998.98-369,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,777.411,777.832,All right.
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,779.043,788.147,"In the private sector, if an FBI agent shows up at a company to interview an employee who is accused of criminal wrongdoing, there is no Weingarten right."
1998.98-369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,802.998,808.831,Would the Weingarten right apply in the private sector if the employer hired the Pinkerton Detective Agency to come in and conduct the interview?
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,808.831,809.352,--Yes.
1998.98-369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,809.352,810.303,It would apply.
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,810.303,811.432,"Yes, because--"
1998.98-369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,811.432,812.544,Why isn't that the same as this?
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,812.544,822.962,"--The Pinkerton control... the Pinkerton Agency would be within the control of agency management, and it would simply be a designatee... a designatee of agency management."
1998.98-369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,831.678,836.95,"No, but doesn't the statute provide that there... that they report to and under the general supervision of the... of the agency?"
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,836.95,837.761,--That's correct.
1998.98-369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.761,842.113,"And wouldn't they normally, if they discovered some kind of employee misconduct, report it to the agency?"
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,842.113,849.469,"That's correct, but that doesn't transform the Inspector General into an agents... anymore than the FBI is--"
1998.98-369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,849.469,853.843,"No, but the whole purpose of the Weingarten rule, it seems to me, is duplicated in that... in that setting."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,853.843,854.843,--No.
1998.98-369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,857.474,861.948,"I understand that they have to be a member of the bargaining unit and so forth, but that's... this fellow was a member of the bargaining unit, wasn't he?"
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,861.948,863.277,--That... that's correct.
1998.98-369,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,869.392,871.175,"Well, he's like an independent contractor."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,873.565,873.996,--No.
1998.98-369,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,910.521,926.071,"Mr. Frederick, inside of an agency like this one with an Inspector General, what percentage of the employee misconduct would go to an ordinary manager and what percentage would be under the wing of the Inspector General?"
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,926.071,936.667,"I can't give you that percentage, but what I can tell you is that approximately 15 percent of the NASA-OIG's investigative caseload concerns employee misconduct cases."
1998.98-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,947.135,954.82,Does it ever happen that the agency head would request the Inspector General to make an investigation?
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,954.82,959.203,"Certainly, but that also does not transform--"
1998.98-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,959.203,962.596,"It's not an order, but I guess the agency can request it."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,962.596,969.469,"--Yes, just as an agency head has requested the FBI to conduct an investigation too, and that doesn't transform the FBI into a representative."
1998.98-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,969.469,975.212,And I guess the agency head has to order the employee to appear and be available.
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,975.212,981.058,"That's correct, which further indicates the insulation of the Inspector General's investigative function."
1998.98-369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,991.425,994.346,"Well, it seems to me your case would be stronger if he did have that authority."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,994.346,1008.204,"No, I don't think so, Justice Kennedy, because this shows that the Inspector General has to... in order to complete his... his function, has to do what he does, and then the agency manager does what he or she does."
1998.98-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1008.204,1020.984,"Well, but now, if the employee doesn't want to cooperate with the interview, is it the employing agency that says if you don't, I'll discipline you or fire you?"
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1020.984,1022.423,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1998.98-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1022.423,1026.637,"So, there is to that extent control over--"
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1026.637,1028.118,It's the same in an FBI interview.
1998.98-369,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1053.374,1060.808,--What position does the FLRA take concerning an FBI investigation or a grand jury investigation?
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1062.4,1089.488,"--They have hinted in their decision in this case, which is at 43a of the petition appendix in footnote 23, that the D.C.... and they're referring to a D.C. Circuit case which pointed out that the FLRA's construction would also apply to the FBI in the context of an... of an investigation done of a Department of Justice employee."
1998.98-369,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1194.039,1210.738,"Mr. Frederick, I... I understood the FLRA to take the position that the FBI and external agencies, grand juries are not... are out of this, and perhaps it would be best for the FLRA to speak for itself on that point."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1210.738,1215.37,"Could I just have one point, though, Justice Ginsburg?"
1998.98-369,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1243.609,1253.434,May I ask you a question about something that is in... in your agency's domain and... or at least in the executive domain?
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1277.443,1280.343,When they are being investigated by the Inspector General.
1998.98-369,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1285.737,1288.68,"Well, they had something that was pretty close to an Inspector General, but not quite."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1289.478,1289.929,No.
1998.98-369,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1299.677,1309.214,"But in any event, there were people who... doing the same thing now that they... if they had done it a year ago, would have the union representative with them and now will no longer."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1309.214,1322.6,"It would be no different than if, instead of creating an office of Inspector General, Congress had said, we want the investigative function of the agency transferred from under agency management's control and given to the FBI."
1998.98-369,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1324.863,1334.648,"Well, there is... there is a difference between a wholly external agency, an FBI or CIA, and something that's still under the roof of the... of the department."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1334.648,1349.018,"It's a policy decision that Congress made to create entities that would be developing particular expertise, sources of information, and have expert knowledge of the kinds of wrongdoing and other frauds and abuses that might be committed within Federal agencies."
1998.98-369,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1349.018,1359.346,"But... but maybe what that argues for is that we've really got a... a third alternative here, and instead of looking at it in an either/or situation, there's a new possibility."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1432.093,1444.292,"Justice Souter, that would... that would impose a penalty on an Inspector General for violating something in the collective bargaining relationship to which the Inspector General is not a party."
1998.98-369,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1444.292,1455.029,"Well, he's not a party, but he... he has... he certainly has as much knowledge or is entitled to as much knowledge of the collective bargaining arrangement as the... as the normal head of the agency is."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1494.433,1496.456,"Yes, there is, Justice Souter, for two reasons."
1998.98-369,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1511.016,1514.637,"Well, that might violate the statute creating the Inspector General."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1533.189,1552.741,"--My second point then I hope will satisfy you is that nothing in either statute would... gives the FLRA the authority that it asserts in this case, which is to decide on a case-by-case basis whether or not the prerogatives of the Inspector General, as defined in the Inspector General Act, have been defeated."
1998.98-369,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1568.191,1568.591,Right.
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1578.97,1581.13,"I don't think so, Justice Souter."
1998.98-369,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1581.13,1582.39,What's the textual bar to it?
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1582.39,1588.876,Because it requires you to determine that an Inspector General is under the control of agency management.
1998.98-369,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1588.876,1589.316,"No, it doesn't."
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1621.186,1622.768,And the Inspector General does not--
1998.98-369,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1622.768,1634.816,"Now, textually if that... if you... if that rationale is... is roughly sound, is there any textual basis that precludes our indicating that that is the way the... the two schemes ought to fit together?"
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1634.816,1635.506,--Yes.
1998.98-369,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1642.17,1644.023,How does... how does it do that?
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1653.096,1655.41,It would make the FBI a representative of the agency--
1998.98-369,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1655.41,1656.328,Why?
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1656.328,1660.011,--an internal Department of Justice investigation of a Department of Justice employee.
1998.98-369,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1660.011,1660.642,It might well.
1998.98-369,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,1660.642,1662.282,If I can reserve the balance of my time.
1998.98-369,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1662.282,1663.374,"Very well, Mr. Frederick."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1718.201,1718.852,"No, Your Honor."
1998.98-369,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1761.159,1770.796,"But presumably you... if the argument that you're making here, you ought to get deference so that if... if the thing is debatable one way or the other, your view ought to prevail."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1772.228,1774.308,"Of course, we would make that argument."
1998.98-369,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1858.842,1866.439,Has the Authority taken a position in the situation of an FBI investigation or a grand jury investigation?
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1866.439,1885.109,"--We note in... in our... in our brief, as counsel adverted to, Your Honor, that the FBI would not be a representative of the agency under our statute in all likelihood because the FBI has, number one, concerns outside of the internal agency."
1998.98-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2014.236,2018.676,Does the NASA Inspector General appoint to anyone other than the head of NASA?
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2018.676,2020.667,No.
1998.98-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2028.213,2037.33,"Well, I assume... could he go directly to the FBI or does he have to go first to the head of NASA, if he sees something he thinks the FBI should know about?"
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2037.33,2038.819,In this case?
1998.98-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2038.819,2039.881,"No, generally."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2039.881,2052.71,"Generally, I think the Inspector Generals might well receive tips or advice from an external law enforcement agency, but they have the right to investigate on their own."
1998.98-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2055.592,2062.194,Does the... does the Inspector General for NASA report to anybody in... in the office of Inspector General?
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2062.194,2069.71,"If I understand your question, the... the office of Inspector General has a number of people that work in it."
1998.98-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2071.02,2071.851,Yes.
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2071.851,2079.569,--that did this interrogation was at the Marshall Space Flight Center and reports to the NASA-OIG in Washington at headquarters NASA.
1998.98-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2079.569,2080.737,To the NASA-OIG.
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2080.737,2081.208,That's correct.
1998.98-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2086.931,2090.295,Was... was the employee in this case entitled to counsel to be present?
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2090.295,2091.694,Yes.
1998.98-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2091.694,2093.136,Why?
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2093.136,2098.319,The employee requested counsel and the request to counsel was acceded to.
1998.98-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2098.319,2099.52,But was he entitled?
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2105.584,2112.597,"As I understand the OIG position, they acknowledge that the right to counsel is present."
1998.98-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2112.597,2115.119,Assume that... and why?
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2118.011,2119.844,The Eleventh Circuit found as much.
1998.98-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2161.591,2167.175,"Well, because I suppose the answer is, is that the union rep has a obligation to... to report to the union."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2187.637,2196.473,"In point of fact, the Authority has responded to that very concern, Justice Kennedy, in a recent decision of the Authority, which we... which we cite in our brief."
1998.98-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2217.488,2224.59,"Yes, but that's troublesome because that seems to me to compromise the union representative's function and role vis-a-vis the union--"
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2224.59,2225.191,Well--
1998.98-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2225.191,2227.583,--which is the whole reason that he's there under... under Weingarten.
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2227.583,2228.484,--No.
1998.98-369,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2275.505,2290.434,"Mr. Smith, you mentioned NRC, and while you may not agree with that case, I take it that Judge Kravitch thought that the Eleventh Circuit decision was compatible with the NRC decision."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2290.434,2291.666,That's correct.
1998.98-369,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2329.872,2339.396,"The D.C. Circuit seems to think that the NRC case was dispositive of this situation, and according to the Eleventh Circuit, it is not."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2339.396,2343.689,"--The D.C. Circuit errs in a number of respects, Judge Ginsburg."
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2400.757,2405.7,"Mr. Smith, I'd like to revisit with you."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2414.146,2416.717,"Yes, sir."
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2416.717,2420.26,"Now, isn't that only a part of the story?"
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2426.103,2429.175,Prior to the passage of the Inspector General?
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2429.175,2430.136,That's right.
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2430.136,2433.379,"It might get before my time, but I'll have to take your word for it."
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2433.379,2436.641,"Well, not all before your time."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2440.151,2444.996,"Well, the Inspector General Act was passed in 1978."
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2444.996,2448.688,"Well, there's a separate Inspector Generals act for the smaller agencies."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2458.335,2463.109,"I'm not aware of that particular attitude, Your Honor."
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2463.47,2464.367,"Well, that was the attitude."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2464.367,2465.018,--I can't dispute your point.
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2466.308,2469.212,"The point was, I don't think you can have it both ways."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2493.176,2493.667,Yes.
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2493.667,2499.651,Do you agree that the head of the agency cannot direct the investigation by the IG?
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2499.651,2508.687,The... the legislative history says that if an agency head requested an Inspector General to undertake an audit or an investigation--
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2508.687,2509.668,"No, that's not what I'm talking about."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2509.668,2510.587,--it is assumed that they would do so.
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2510.587,2512.54,"No, that's not what I'm talking about."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2517.553,2518.013,Yes.
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2518.013,2520.464,"--can the agency head say, no, you can't?"
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2520.464,2521.285,They cannot do so.
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2521.285,2529.0,"If the IG said, I want to investigate this matter in this manner, can the agency head say, you cannot?"
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2529.0,2530.412,I think so.
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2531.641,2532.853,The agency head can tell them that?
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2532.853,2533.344,--Yes.
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2536.467,2537.188,By what authority?
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2537.188,2544.08,"--I think the authority is you are expected under the IG Act to comply with, quote, other statutes when you perform your investigative function."
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2544.08,2545.633,"Well, I don't know where you get that authority."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2558.228,2566.864,"Well, the IG would have to go to their employing authority if they chose to do so, which would be either, depending on the size of the agency, the agency head or the President of the United States."
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2566.864,2572.73,Isn't it true that the IG has a separate line of communication and separate reporting authority to Congress?
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2572.73,2573.319,Right.
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2577.703,2580.365,And in reality they have separate reporting authority to Congress.
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2580.365,2581.036,Yes.
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2581.036,2584.298,If they are at loggerheads with the head of the agency.
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2584.298,2585.277,Yes.
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2585.277,2600.217,Do you know of any instance where the agency head has been directed by or the IG has been directed by... an IG has been directed by an agency head to conduct an audit or an investigation in a certain way?
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2600.217,2614.255,"Well, in this case, the Authority directed the NASA headquarters to inform the NASA-OIG to comply with the 7114 (a)(2)(B) right in subsequent cases."
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2614.255,2614.556,No.
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2620.41,2624.213,Where an agency head has requested an Inspector General to perform an investigation?
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2624.213,2624.603,No.
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2631.669,2643.744,"We have no... we have no such case, but I think it's fair, Justice Thomas, to conclude that an Inspector General can be told to comply with the law when you conduct an investigation."
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2649.919,2652.78,"Well, you could be told... the IG can be told anything."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2665.5,2674.496,"In our view, the... the Inspector General can be told by the agency head and/or the appointing authority, the President of the United States, to comply with the law, yes."
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2674.496,2675.106,Okay.
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2677.317,2688.814,"The only examples that we would refer to would be the ones I previously mentioned, that in the... in the statute, in the legislative history it's conceded, for example, that the Inspector General must comply with the Privacy Act."
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2706.637,2711.719,"But you would have to agree... I mean, you can't to a specific provision in the IG Act for that."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2730.923,2742.891,"The IG's position would have to be, in such a case, that the inclusion of a union rep prohibited or precluded me from conducting an investigation because that's the statutory string that we go through to analyze--"
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2742.891,2757.459,"No, but if your argument is, if... if this were my chief of staff who was conducting the... the investigation and I said, look, you are to include the union representative, my chief of staff theoretically as the agency representative would have to do that."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2781.566,2782.946,--We think the authority--
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2782.946,2785.139,And I'd like you to point to me where that authority is.
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2785.139,2791.761,"--Well, the... the premise of your question is that it is the agency head that is imposing this requirement on the Inspector General."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2791.761,2792.101,That's right.
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2792.101,2793.023,We think that's incorrect.
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2799.338,2812.815,"But your argument is that this IG reports to the Administrator, and if the Administrator can't direct the IG to do precisely what you think the IG should be doing, then I don't know how you can say that the IG reports to the Administrator."
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2812.815,2816.719,"--Well, I don't want to... I don't want to butt heads with you."
1998.98-369,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2822.322,2823.673,I bet you the agency head does.
1998.98-369,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2824.494,2828.307,"--In conducting their investigations, they have to comply with the law."
1998.98-369,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2830.166,2832.499,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,2845.257,2848.288,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-369,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2921.556,2923.018,Excuse me.
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,2947.265,2955.369,"Typically it is correct, I would say, that an agency will instruct the employee to appear before the IG."
1998.98-369,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2982.568,2984.939,"You say here, Mr. Kirsch."
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,2986.709,2987.199,--Yes.
1998.98-369,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2987.199,2990.082,And what did happen in that respect here?
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,2990.082,2997.757,In this case we had a referral from the FBI to the OIG.
1998.98-369,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3040.474,3042.554,What is it--
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,3082.693,3088.256,Nothing about specifically that he has to tell--
1998.98-369,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3088.256,3089.765,"No, I'm not saying--"
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,3089.765,3090.216,--But--
1998.98-369,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3090.216,3095.66,--Does the... does the head of the agency have the authority to do anything whatsoever in respect to the IG--
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,3095.66,3096.801,--Yes.
1998.98-369,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3096.801,3100.113,--that an ordinary citizen of the United States wouldn't have?
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,3100.113,3101.634,"Yes, and also--"
1998.98-369,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3101.634,3102.305,What?
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,3102.305,3113.411,--the OIG has duties and responsibilities vis-a-vis the agency head and access to certain information that others outside an agency would not have.
1998.98-369,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3153.399,3162.014,Those are examples of instances in which the IG might have some authority that he wouldn't have were he not part of the agency.
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,3168.699,3184.638,"By... by... he can tell him to not assert the disciplinary authority of our agency here to compel the attendance of our employees, if he so chose to do that."
1998.98-369,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3200.068,3210.374,"Could the agency head tell the employee directly, now, when the IG calls you, you don't have to go and I won't give you any discipline unless you have the union rep there?"
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,3211.816,3212.587,Yes.
1998.98-369,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3212.587,3217.5,Would that... that would not be an interference with the OIG's authority?
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,3219.21,3232.02,"There's nothing in the OIG act that gives the OIG subpoena power over a particular employee within his agency, and there's nothing that could compel the employee to appear there and to fully cooperate other than disciplinary--"
1998.98-369,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3232.02,3234.0,"--Well, if that's so, then he wasn't entitled to counsel here, was he?"
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,3234.0,3235.401,--I'm sorry.
1998.98-369,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3235.401,3238.183,"If he was not compelled, he wasn't entitled to counsel in this case."
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,3238.183,3246.137,"If he was not compelled in this particular case, the... the statute says compelled to appear before any agency... then he would be entitled to counsel."
1998.98-369,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3247.95,3250.051,"But if he was not compelled, then he was not entitled to counsel."
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,3250.051,3262.39,"Perhaps he may not have been entitled to counsel unless there was a custodial interrogation, a criminal type investigation, or some way otherwise overbearing the will of the individual--"
1998.98-369,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3262.39,3270.835,"Well, that would... that would mean that the evidence might not be introduced... introducible in a criminal trial, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he has a right to counsel."
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,3270.835,3279.63,--If he... the statute... you are both correct... indicates where an... where an employee is compelled to appear before the agency.
1998.98-369,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3280.992,3303.897,"Mr. Kirsch, I... I would... I had assumed... and please correct me if I'm wrong... that if an employee is told show up at that interview or you lose your job and the employee then says, okay, can we meet in my lawyer's office, that that employee is being compelled to show up at the interview even though he says okay."
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,3307.049,3322.647,"--That's exactly our position, that absent an affirmative statement that you don't have to be there, the... the appearance is clear to any employee that their job is in jeopardy for refusal to participate or cooperate fully in an investigation."
1998.98-369,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3370.129,3373.311,You say it's excluded under the labor statute.
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,3379.615,3391.404,--They're explicitly excluded by definition of being an agency and therefore would not be subject to the provisions of the labor statute in any respects.
1998.98-369,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3391.404,3399.468,So... so that... you say an FBI investigation is by definition not covered by the--
1998.98-369,2,41626,stuart_kirsch,,3399.468,3403.581,"An exclusive FBI investigation, yes, that would be correct."
1998.98-369,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3428.498,3430.139,"--Thank you, Mr. Kirsch."
1998.98-369,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3432.099,3451.293,"Justice Kennedy, I'd like to return to your question about who the IG reports to because Executive Order 12993, which is not cited in the briefs, provides that the President shall engage a process to investigate wrongdoing by an Inspector General."
1998.98-369,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3571.804,3572.835,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
