1980.79-1943,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.539,We'll hear arguments next in Alessi v. Raybestos and the consolidated case.
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,67.273,71.327,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1943,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,159.066,161.351,"Let me ask you a question, if I may."
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,169.974,171.191,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1980.79-1943,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,171.191,175.828,It is not just a question of administering an act?
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,175.828,177.128,"No, that is correct."
1980.79-1943,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,405.678,411.499,"Counsel, the Internal Revenue Service I had always supposed to be part of the Treasury Department."
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,411.499,412.482,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1943,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,412.482,431.361,"So that, isn't it rather unlikely that the Administrator of ERISA for Treasury would be at odds with the Administrator of the IRS?"
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,431.361,435.097,I'm not suggesting a disparity of views as between Treasury and IRS.
1980.79-1943,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,438.149,442.318,I thought you had said that the IRS took a different view?
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,442.318,449.79,"Oh, I am saying that, sir, with respect to the specific elements that are part of the offset in the Raybestos plan."
1980.79-1943,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,512.615,517.668,"Mr. Sachs, let me just... this suddenness of it, it's been a part of the plan for quite some time?"
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,517.668,519.758,"--It has not, Your Honor, with all respect."
1980.79-1943,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,525.372,528.824,Were these plans the product of collective bargaining?
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,528.824,534.494,"It's difficult to answer that yes or no, Your Honor."
1980.79-1943,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,534.978,540.38,"Well, usually they are, where you've got a union involved, and the terms of the plan are usually a key thing in negotiation."
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,540.38,547.652,"--There are aspects, Your Honor, there are aspects of the present plan of General Motors which are of the power of collective bargaining, the product of collective bargaining."
1980.79-1943,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,548.669,551.838,Isn't it fair to assume the union knew about this offset provision?
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,555.29,569.682,"--Your Honor, there is no question that the union was aware of that, but Your Honor's question was related to the length and duration of these clauses, and my response is that they came into the contracts in 1970 virtually at end of the working career of these employees."
1980.79-1943,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,573.353,573.919,"Well, I understand."
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,578.321,585.042,"Well, the equitable argument is relevant, Your Honor, because of the congressional purpose, and that is the key, I would respectfully submit."
1980.79-1943,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,586.394,591.148,"You'd make the same argument, even if this had been in the plan for 40 years and everybody knew about it, it seems to me."
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,591.148,592.165,"--Absolutely no question, Your Honor."
1980.79-1943,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,800.416,803.819,"Your contention, then, is that the regulation is invalid?"
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,803.819,804.586,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1943,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,808.155,811.357,And it's invalid across the board?
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,811.357,815.325,"Absolutely, Your Honor, and certainly it is invalid in application here."
1980.79-1943,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.616,860.803,"Mr. Sachs, would you address this very narrow argument that the Court of Appeals made?"
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,874.611,875.463,--Yes.
1980.79-1943,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,875.463,876.58,--And it is clear that that's permitted.
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,878.848,884.068,"Your Honor, there is absolutely no question that social security offsets are permitted."
1980.79-1943,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,884.068,885.636,Are they a forfeiture or not?
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,885.636,887.27,They are not a forfeiture because--
1980.79-1943,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.27,890.139,"If they're not a forfeiture, how can you be so sure this is a forfeiture?"
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,890.589,898.845,--They are not a forfeiture because Congress independently addressed in ERISA social security integration.
1980.79-1943,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.521,920.592,--So your argument is that it's not a forfeiture because there's evidence Congress specifically intended to permit this kind of offset.
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,927.212,944.14,"--Your Honor, if I may, not merely evidence; the statute does speak explicitly to social security in 206(b) of ERISA and in 401(a)(15) of the Tax Code, which was added by ERISA, Congress agonized about integration of social security benefits."
1980.79-1943,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1106.093,1107.711,Just your warning sign.
1980.79-1943,0,43354,theodore_sachs,,1109.378,1109.961,--Yes.
1980.79-1943,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1156.492,1157.961,Very well.
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1164.632,1167.167,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1240.615,1248.369,"Well, do you contend that the regulation previously discussed is unauthorized by the statute?"
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1248.369,1252.756,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, are you referring to the Treasury regulation?"
1980.79-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.756,1253.59,Yes.
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1253.59,1257.994,We do contend that this is unauthorized and contrary to the statute.
1980.79-1943,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1259.36,1262.362,You're addressing the preemption act?
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1262.362,1266.599,"--Yes, but I do concur that that regulation is invalid and unauthorized."
1980.79-1943,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1374.919,1377.654,"Mr. Gettis, can I interrupt you again, because I want to be sure I've caught it?"
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1382.075,1382.841,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1943,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1382.841,1384.557,Is that quoted in your brief?
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1384.557,1385.424,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1980.79-1943,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1385.424,1387.026,Do you happen to know the page?
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1390.428,1396.715,4(b)(3) of ERISA perhaps was cited as 29 U.S.C. 1003(b).
1980.79-1943,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1396.715,1401.517,1003(b).
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1401.517,1419.812,"Your Honor, that's quoted at page 19 of the reply brief, and I believe it also appears in the main brief at page 44... of the petitioners' brief, that is."
1980.79-1943,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1616.738,1619.59,"Mr. Gettis, let me just... because I frankly had missed the point."
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1640.334,1642.117,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1943,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1642.117,1647.038,"But that's not quite like an exception from the preemption section, is it?"
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1647.038,1650.873,Your preemption is--
1980.79-1943,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1650.873,1655.425,"And furthermore, this is not a plan maintained solely to comply with the state workmen's compensation law."
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1655.425,1657.894,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and we have never contended otherwise."
1980.79-1943,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1657.894,1658.31,I see.
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1658.31,1663.081,"However, the preemption provision, Section 514, is a part of Title I."
1980.79-1943,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1664.75,1670.653,"Well, the preemption does not apply to plans maintained solely for the purpose of complying with state... which is not this plan."
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1670.653,1671.819,--That is not this plan.
1980.79-1943,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1706.277,1707.943,I don't follow the argument.
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1716.882,1717.682,"That is true, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1943,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1717.682,1718.95,That's all it really says.
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1718.95,1740.364,"Well, we suggest that in 4(b)(3) Congress has shown an intent to allow states to regulate certain areas, traditionally within state regulation, not to regulate pensions but to regulate these particular areas, and should that regulation ""relate to pension plans"", that will not invalidate the state statute."
1980.79-1943,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.364,1741.114,I see.
1980.79-1943,1,35864,marc_c_gettis,,1741.114,1742.883,Thank you.
1980.79-1943,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1742.883,1747.404,"Very well, Mr. Reich."
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,1747.404,1750.871,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1943,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2217.741,2225.479,"That rather circular statutory argument doesn't depend at all on the Treasury regulation, is that correct?"
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2225.479,2225.979,"--No, sir."
1980.79-1943,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2270.991,2273.892,But your argument didn't depend at all upon that regulation?
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2273.892,2275.191,Yes.
1980.79-1943,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2277.644,2287.577,"And in other words, your argument would allow a plan to offset by the amount of recovery in a common law court, wouldn't it?"
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2287.577,2289.935,"--No, sir, it would not, because--"
1980.79-1943,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2289.935,2292.353,"It hasn't always been a fixture of the plan, and--"
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2292.353,2298.695,"--No, sir, because it's a fixture of the plan, a fixture of the plan permitted by Section 401(a)(5)."
1980.79-1943,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2325.495,2326.528,--Where does this appear?
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2326.528,2338.919,"--This appears in the petitioners' and appellants' briefs in the Appendix, I know."
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2338.919,2342.454,Could you give me the Code cite to 401(a)(5)?
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2342.454,2346.84,"That is Section 401(a)(5) of the Code, 26 U.S.C.--"
1980.79-1943,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2346.84,2347.774,401(a)(5).
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2351.243,2351.759,--Yes.
1980.79-1943,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2395.022,2400.79,"Of course... well, workmen's compensation is not the same as retirement benefits."
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2400.79,2409.563,"I submit that when it is income provided as post retirement income to a retiree, it replaces--"
1980.79-1943,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2409.563,2418.721,"Workmen's compensation is compensation for illness or accident, employment connected, is it not?"
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2418.721,2419.521,--Yes.
1980.79-1943,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2419.521,2420.171,It's not a retirement plan.
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2420.171,2430.177,"But social security disability benefits are also benefits for disability, although it need not be work connected."
1980.79-1943,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2436.349,2441.484,"Well, in any event, compensation, workmens' compensation, is compensation for injury or accident."
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2443.236,2452.675,"It is compensation for a disability, it is compensation for a disability whether it is injury, accident, or occupational disease."
1980.79-1943,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2455.308,2462.645,"And it's not generally... I doubt that it would be generally considered as a retirement benefit, if you're relying on that language of the statute."
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2462.645,2487.779,"--Well, indeed, when the period for which it is, or the disability covers a period of retirement, I suggest that it should so be considered for the simple reason that the retirement is, the concept of retirement is not limited to retirement for age."
1980.79-1943,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2487.779,2495.599,"Well, I suppose a judgment in a state court would be the same argument, a retirement benefit created under state law."
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2495.599,2510.609,"No, it's been... there has been a distinction drawn by the Internal Revenue Service in holding that state law common law actions may not, the common law damages may not be offset."
1980.79-1943,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2510.609,2512.411,"Well, that's a Treasury regulation."
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2512.411,2514.095,That is a Treasury--
1980.79-1943,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2514.095,2518.031,It has no... it plays no part in your present statutory?
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2518.031,2518.581,"--Oh, yes, sir."
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.649,2626.853,"Mr. Reich, I confess I had misunderstood part of your argument."
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2629.37,2630.322,401(a)(5)--
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2630.322,2635.958,"Did you say it was reenacted in ERISA, and in what section of ERISA is 401(a)(5)?"
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2635.958,2654.086,"--1021, I believe it is, in Title II."
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2654.086,2654.87,Is there a 1016?
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2657.138,2658.571,1016.
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2660.523,2661.873,Where is that?
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2661.873,2663.691,--That was part of ERISA.
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2663.691,2664.991,"I know, but where in?"
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2664.991,2667.627,"Oh, the 1016 is merely a--"
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2667.627,2669.362,Is it printed here somewhere?
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2669.362,2674.13,"--No, it is not, sir, the text of 401(a)(5) as it was amended."
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2680.851,2684.122,Could you give me the code citation of 1016?
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2684.122,2686.372,--The code citation is Section 401(a)(5).
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2686.372,2692.792,"No, I want the Code citation of the statute, the part of ERISA that reenacts 401(a)(5)."
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2692.792,2695.061,"It is not in the Code, as far as I understand."
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2695.061,2695.594,"Oh, I see."
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2695.594,2698.446,It is merely a part of the public law.
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2731.217,2740.105,"Well, after lunch, will you tell me where I can find 401(a)(5) in ERISA, if I can?"
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2742.941,2744.007,--Not in Title 29.
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2746.659,2749.078,"Well, you said it was reenacted as part of ERISA."
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2750.445,2751.613,"--Yes, sir, I'll be happy to do so."
1980.79-1943,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2751.613,2753.747,We'll resume there at 1 o'clock.
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2769.859,2785.751,"In response to Mr. Justice Stevens' question before recess, the text of Section 401(a)(5) of the Code as it was amended by ERISA is to be found in 26 U.S.C., Section 401(a)(5)."
1980.79-1943,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2867.422,2872.307,But you can get workmen's compensation without retiring.
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2872.307,2879.98,"Yes, but when... you can, but you can also get workmen's compensation when you are retired."
1980.79-1943,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2904.395,2909.582,You're talking about a retired person getting workmen's compensation.
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2914.403,2917.253,--It is not necessarily to presume that he would have.
1980.79-1943,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2952.076,2956.028,"If a man retires by age, he gets workmen's compensation?"
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2956.028,2961.182,--He can under the laws of many states and New Jersey is one of those.
1980.79-1943,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2961.182,2961.732,How?
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2971.038,2985.297,"If he's retired and wasn't working he can, and in fact as was pointed out, the General Motors plan provision covers only cases in which he has applied after, more than two years after he retired."
1980.79-1943,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2995.169,2996.521,"Well, how much does he get?"
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,2996.521,3000.307,That would depend upon the award and the particular state.
1980.79-1943,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3000.307,3005.961,"Well, I mean, if he retires at 65, he gets a certain amount of money?"
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,3005.961,3006.577,Yes.
1980.79-1943,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3008.913,3011.365,Regardless of his condition?
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,3011.365,3014.932,"Well, regardless of his physical?"
1980.79-1943,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3017.434,3023.005,"Well, that's what I would think so, but you say that automatically if he retired he gets workmen's compensation?"
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,3023.005,3024.205,"No, sir, no I did not."
1980.79-1943,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3025.188,3026.055,That's what I understood you to say.
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,3026.055,3033.977,I said he may get disability retirement benefits... disability benefits or workers' compensation after he retires.
1980.79-1943,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3033.977,3039.662,"But the workmen's compensation is based on the disability, not his age?"
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,3039.662,3040.481,That is correct.
1980.79-1943,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3040.481,3041.547,"Well, that's what I thought."
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,3041.547,3043.516,"No, I did not mean to say otherwise, Justice Marshall."
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3043.916,3048.35,"May I ask you a question, though, that's related to one I know that Justice Rehnquist asked?"
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,3063.596,3065.162,"--That's right, an injury or other disability."
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3065.162,3077.737,What would the retirement plan and what would the law be if after his retirement he went to work for an entirely different employer and was injured and then became entitled to workmen's compensation as a result of that injury?
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,3079.172,3080.239,"No, there would not."
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3080.239,3081.624,Because it's not funded?
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,3081.624,3091.063,"It's only where the same employer funds both the workmen's compensation benefits and the pension benefits, If he got the benefits from another employer, then--"
1980.79-1943,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3091.063,3091.613,There's no offset.
1980.79-1943,2,35025,laurence_reich,,3091.613,3095.615,--the plan would take no offset.
1980.79-1943,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3095.615,3101.685,Mr. Casey.
1980.79-1943,3,44331,warren_j_casey,,3101.685,3103.704,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1943,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3221.297,3233.022,Are you saying that the Raybestos collective bargaining contract expressly contemplated workmen's compensation payments as a part of the pension plan?
1980.79-1943,3,44331,warren_j_casey,,3233.022,3233.855,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1980.79-1943,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3382.883,3389.438,"Mr. Casey, how do you... do you have an answer to Mr. Gettis's argument based on 4(b)(3)?"
1980.79-1943,3,44331,warren_j_casey,,3389.438,3404.748,"Your Honor, Mr. Gettis basically argues that ERISA does not preempt and includes express relief from preemption for any state law related to retirement plans so long as it is part of the workers' compensation statute."
1980.79-1943,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3459.18,3468.185,"What kinds of plans, Mr. Casey, are maintained solely for the purpose of complying with applicable workmen's compensation laws?"
1980.79-1943,3,44331,warren_j_casey,,3468.185,3487.966,"Justice Brennan, under most state workers' compensation laws, an employer may either pay into a state fund an insurance premium which will then fund the periodic income for the disability or it may make arrangements with a private insurer."
1980.79-1943,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3518.868,3528.026,Is there anything in the legislative history of 4(b)(3) to show us that kind of plan and only that kind of plan was in the reach of 4(b)(3)?
1980.79-1943,3,44331,warren_j_casey,,3528.026,3531.061,"--As I recall, the legislative history in that provision is very scant."
1980.79-1943,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3571.12,3572.638,You have about three minutes.
1980.79-1943,4,43354,theodore_sachs,,3572.638,3574.922,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1980.79-1943,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3726.636,3734.442,Do you think this is what you would call a typographical error or omission?
1980.79-1943,4,43354,theodore_sachs,,3734.442,3736.394,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1943,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3736.394,3742.781,If one were to turn to the original source one would find the thing that you state it was?
1980.79-1943,4,43354,theodore_sachs,,3742.781,3744.154,"The words I just read, Your Honor,"
1980.79-1943,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3784.941,3785.575,"Thank you, gentlemen."
