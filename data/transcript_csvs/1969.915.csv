1969.915,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,20.394,23.143,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.915,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,23.143,43.221,You may defer a moment if you wish Mr. North Seymour until we see that all counsels are at ease.
1969.915,0,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,45.02,47.123,Thank you sir.
1969.915,1,34822,lester_c_migdal,,1790.687,1795.266,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1969.915,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1858.487,1860.492,That's Harlem River and Oak Point yards?
1969.915,1,34822,lester_c_migdal,,1860.492,1862.347,That's the Harlem River and Oak Point yards?
1969.915,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1862.347,1867.698,The question is whether or not there would be good rail service available to that market area?
1969.915,1,34822,lester_c_migdal,,1867.698,1868.847,"That's right, Your Honor."
1969.915,2,28861,joseph_auerbach,,4150.712,4153.193,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.915,3,34477,leonard_s_goodman,,4637.338,4642.183,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.915,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4867.518,4882.694,"That is the liquidation value to what as of December 31, 1966 but discounted over for by reason of the fact that would take at least six years to dispose off the assets, is that it?"
1969.915,3,34477,leonard_s_goodman,,4890.049,4892.398,Yes those deductions are a part of the {Voice overlap}.
1969.915,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4892.398,4894.835,(Voice Overlap) the date of liquidation value?
1969.915,3,34477,leonard_s_goodman,,4894.835,4897.727,"The evaluation date is December 31, 1966."
1969.915,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4897.727,4909.086,"And then six years estimated to dispose of it and then you had another year for abandonment, permission abandonment, is that about it?"
1969.915,3,34477,leonard_s_goodman,,4910.281,4912.764,"Well, --"
1969.915,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4912.764,4914.8,Plus the bond sales?
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,7595.507,7601.814,"Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.915,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7696.418,7706.937,"You say Mr. Cox that's the only standard that the Commission could apply, do you mean that's the only constitutional standard or statutory standard or practical standard or what do you mean?"
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,7706.937,7713.489,"Well, I will say this that it's the only standard I know of that could give the estate and bondholder anything now."
1969.915,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7713.489,7717.647,Do you think it's required as a minimal standard by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution?
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,7717.647,7726.752,"If I would suppose that if it’s not certainly they are entitled to something under the statute before you ever get to the Constitution, you know."
1969.915,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7745.62,7746.968,"Well, what do you mean something like that?"
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,7746.968,7765.907,"Well, Judge Friendly said in his opinion that this gets into an abstract problem which I'd rather not get involve in but Judge Friendly suggested in his opinion that since in this case there was no picking in a real sense and there wasn’t."
1969.915,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7817.27,7829.785,"With the misfortunes that you spoke out that were encountered by the New Haven over a long period of time that were well known, Penn Central have encountered to some degree some of these same misfortunes, have they not?"
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,7829.785,7830.881,"Oh, yes indeed!"
1969.915,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7855.292,7873.451,Would it be fair to say that this combination of Penn and Central first and now the inclusion of New Haven which was made as one of the conditions is something compelled by the public interest in furtherance of the National Transportation System policy?
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,7873.451,7875.872,"Surely Commission has determined, yes."
1969.915,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7891.599,7902.119,"So, that we have here something of unwilling buyers and perhaps unwilling sellers."
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,7902.119,7910.9,"Well, I should not speak -- wish to speak for anyone except my client but my client did not embrace this opportunity to the edge."
1969.915,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8120.619,8124.547,As the point of what it's all about is a year from when?
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,8124.547,8124.782,Well --
1969.915,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8124.782,8139.887,"But the claim is, as I understand part of the claim of your brothers in opposition is that had they not been had done a primrose path, that's perhaps their own metaphor but had they not been induce into this inclusion business."
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,8144.149,8145.723,"So, perhaps they would."
1969.915,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,8147.912,8151.147,"Well, they didn't but we're talking about Alice in Wonderland, anyway."
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,8151.147,8152.934,You're talking about Alice in Wonderland.
1969.915,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8280.971,8287.254,"But all of the losses in fact are prior to the bondholder's interest, aren't they?"
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,8297.048,8304.487,Mr. Justice White I have to answer that question by saying that so far as they issued the trustee’s certificates.
1969.915,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8306.218,8306.898,Yes.
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,8306.898,8309.218,"Now, there have been some figures cost about here --"
1969.915,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8309.218,8309.394,$60 million.
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,8309.394,8329.915,"-- but I can't analyze those figures because I don't know what they are but it's quite true that any amounts represented by the trustee’s certificates would be ahead of the bondholders and of course, they've been incurring deficits since 1956 quite long and since they -- ever since they've been in receivership."
1969.915,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8357.833,8363.588,When did the bondholders first voice any objection to inclusion or did they ever?M
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,8363.588,8368.262,I think the first time they did so was in the spring in 1967.
1969.915,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8375.45,8376.611,Then you should liquidate?
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,8376.611,8377.781,"Liquidate, yes."
1969.915,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8377.781,8383.901,And did they participate in the inclusion proceedings?
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,8383.901,8384.304,Oh!
1969.915,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8454.291,8458.708,"Well, unless Mr. Cox they get some -- they abandon some --"
1969.915,4,26750,hugh_b_cox,,8458.708,8470.19,Unless they can get but there's no indication that the Commission is going to allow them to abandon the freight service and nobody knows what will happen on the passenger service.
1969.915,5,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,10214.082,10216.463,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1969.915,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,10233.522,10238.332,"The reorganization court modified the underwriting agreement, is that right?"
1969.915,5,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,10238.332,10241.05,The reorganization court created the underwriting agreement.
1969.915,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,10241.05,10244.57,I know but in this -- its opinion is here for review.
1969.915,5,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,10250.276,10252.072,"No, Your Honor."
