2003.03-1027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,34.904,"We'll hear argument next in Number 03-1027, Donald Rumsfeld versus Jose Padilla."
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,69.295,72.33,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,158.202,167.625,"May I ask you on that point, Mr. Clement, supposing this petition had been filed while he was still in New York, and then he was removed to South Carolina."
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,169.292,173.879,"There would be jurisdiction in that case, Justice Stevens, under the Endo decision."
2003.03-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,191.073,193.859,I'm not quite sure what your answer is to my question.
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,193.859,198.494,"--Oh, my answer is jurisdiction yes, under this Court's decision in Endo."
2003.03-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,198.494,198.927,All right.
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,198.927,203.381,But then there would still be a subsidiary question that's not raised here about venue.
2003.03-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,203.381,206.75,Which the government would presumably would be free to raise.
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,206.75,210.885,"Exactly, and we would raise in the case where there was in fact jurisdiction."
2003.03-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,210.885,211.487,Yes.
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,211.487,216.455,"But in this case our position is there is no jurisdiction whatsoever, and I think that--"
2003.03-1027,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.455,231.733,"Jurisdiction under the Habeas Statutes has been a bit of a confusion because, for instance, on behalf of aliens, I think we have allowed jurisdiction to be obtained in the manner it was here, have we not?"
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,231.733,233.25,"--I don't think so, Justice O'Connor."
2003.03-1027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,250.196,252.262,What do you do with ex parte Endo?
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,252.262,270.442,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, as I was suggesting to Justice Stevens, that case involves a kind of unique situation where a habeas petition is filed, challenging a certain kind of confinement, and then after the petition is filed, and after jurisdiction attaches, the prisoner is moved."
2003.03-1027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,272.642,277.096,"They never, they never named any custodian in that case, did they?"
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,277.096,282.0,"--Well, I don't know for sure, Mr. Chief Justice, but I would say a couple of things."
2003.03-1027,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,328.129,333.366,"Well, is there a circuit split on whether aliens can name the attorney general?"
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,333.366,335.968,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
2003.03-1027,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,398.791,403.243,"Where does jurisdiction lie for someone in Guantanamo, do you suppose?"
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,403.243,407.73,"--Well, if, let me answer the question this way, which is if you had a citizen in Guantanamo."
2003.03-1027,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,407.73,408.347,Yes.
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,408.347,415.068,"And under this Court's cases like Toth against Quarles and Burns against Wilson, that citizen is unable to file a habeas petition."
2003.03-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,454.009,454.359,But why?
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,457.747,460.063,"Well, I think there are a number of--"
2003.03-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,460.063,461.532,"I mean, there are offices all over the country."
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,461.532,463.651,"--I think that's right, Justice Stevens."
2003.03-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,488.599,491.967,"Yes, but I'm not sure that's, that's appropriate relief in a habeas petition, anyway."
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,491.967,502.442,"--Well, I think you can file a mixed petition and seek that kind of relief, but in any event, I think that what they are looking for is not just release from detention, but the stopping of the interrogations."
2003.03-1027,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,502.442,518.718,"--how this particular case was pleaded, which it wasn't, because we don't have any flushing out of this, but you keep talking about jurisdiction and it seems to me, this is essentially a venue question."
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,539.632,549.34,"I mean, unless the word essentially is going to bear a tremendous amount of weight, I disagree because I think that what you have here is not general venue principles."
2003.03-1027,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,577.99,591.25,"Although, if the prisoner is moved, so prisoner goes someplace else, they still have jurisdiction over the case, although the original custodian no longer has the prisoner in his or her care."
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,591.25,592.667,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.03-1027,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,689.68,694.567,"Well, Mr. Clement, is Schlanger still good law after Strait and Braden?"
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,694.567,695.767,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,780.957,788.613,"You recognize that it isn't a jurisdiction question like, can the Federal courts entertain this kind of suit."
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,813.494,817.78,"--Justice Ginsburg, its statutory jurisdiction, but I agree."
2003.03-1027,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,824.286,824.852,All right.
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,853.888,856.507,"With respect, Justice Breyer, I would disagree."
2003.03-1027,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,904.904,906.79,"Let me ask you a question to get you to the merits, if I can."
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,906.79,907.706,That would be fine.
2003.03-1027,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,907.706,920.93,"Suppose, suppose that you're right about your basic claim that the uniform, what is it called, the Use of Force Act is in fact a statute of the kind contemplated in 4001."
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,952.985,955.004,"Justice Breyer, I will answer the question."
2003.03-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,997.181,1000.45,Can I ask you just one last question on the jurisdictional issue?
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1015.626,1021.363,"--Even if, contrary to our position, it was a venue question, we would still say no."
2003.03-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.302,1036.289,"No, but the Government is responsible for him being in New York, which it seems to me, that they should not be complaining about litigating there."
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1036.289,1047.645,"--Well, with respect, Justice Stevens, I don't think anybody would think that if you filed a habeas petition to challenge Padilla's detention as a material witness while he was being detained in New York, that that should be filed in Chicago."
2003.03-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1061.654,1063.023,"He had a lawyer appointed, didn't he, there?"
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1063.023,1064.773,He did have a lawyer appointed there.
2003.03-1027,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1077.949,1085.203,I suppose it's a little easier for the Government to find a lawyer wherever it needs it than it would be for a prisoner being moved from district to district.
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1085.203,1090.424,In none of these cases have we seen a problem with the detainees finding legal representation.
2003.03-1027,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1090.424,1093.892,"Getting back to the merits, merits part--"
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1102.648,1103.981,"Well, I hate to disappoint you."
2003.03-1027,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1148.795,1161.02,"What rights does Padilla have, if any, in your view, that a belligerent who is apprehended on the battlefield does not have?"
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1166.091,1171.643,"I think for purposes of the question before this Court, the authority question, he is just the same."
2003.03-1027,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1181.433,1182.966,Can we punish him?
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1182.966,1184.885,Could we punish him?
2003.03-1027,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1192.658,1195.058,Would you shoot him when he got off the plane?
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1195.058,1198.645,"--No, I don't think we could for good and sufficient reasons--"
2003.03-1027,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1198.645,1206.549,I assume that you could shoot someone that you had captured on the field of battle.
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1206.549,1210.37,--Not after we captured them and brought them to safety.
2003.03-1027,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1216.873,1218.523,If they're an unlawful belligerent?
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1218.523,1220.741,"--Yes, even if they're an unlawful belligerent."
2003.03-1027,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1231.283,1247.126,"But if the law is what the executive says it is, whatever is necessary and appropriate in the executive's judgment, as the resolution you gave us that Congress passed, and it leads you up to the executive, unchecked by the judiciary."
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1250.661,1252.947,"Well, first of all, there are treaty obligations."
2003.03-1027,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1274.21,1280.114,Suppose the executive says mild torture we think will help get this information.
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1292.588,1295.874,"--Well, our executive doesn't and I think... I mean--"
2003.03-1027,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1295.874,1297.541,What's constraining?
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1303.795,1308.033,--This is a situation where there is jurisdiction in the habeas courts.
2003.03-1027,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1340.337,1343.789,So what is it that military... go back to Justice Kennedy's question.
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1391.02,1394.805,"Well, Justice Breyer, let me give you a practical reason answer and the legal reason."
2003.03-1027,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1439.268,1442.72,Would you have that authority in the absence of the authorizing resolution?
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1444.488,1451.742,"I think he might well, Justice Souter, and you in fact suggested that yourself, which is if there was actionable information--"
2003.03-1027,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1451.742,1454.444,"No, I suggested that he might have on September 12th."
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1465.501,1472.472,"--Well, I think he would certainly today, which is to say September 12th or April 28th."
2003.03-1027,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1472.472,1473.091,Two and a half months later.
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1490.201,1491.569,That would be my answer.
2003.03-1027,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1494.938,1497.457,How does he get that from just being commander-in-chief?
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1534.063,1541.235,"--No, but Justice Scalia, presumably the authorization of force is read against prior history and this Court's precedents."
2003.03-1027,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1559.297,1567.117,But Quirin rested on the fact that there was congressional authorization for a military commission to try on such charges.
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1567.117,1568.986,"Well, two things, Justice Souter."
2003.03-1027,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1592.001,1596.553,"I guess I would settle, as a rhetorical point, for the fact that it's not a clear statement for you either."
2003.03-1027,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1596.553,1598.488,"Well, it actually... it purported to be."
2003.03-1027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1630.376,1632.259,"Very well, Mr. Clement."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1634.328,1637.38,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-1027,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1704.941,1715.149,"Ms. Martinez, the authorization passed by Congress is quite broad and it talks about force against individuals."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1715.149,1724.755,"--Yes, Your Honor, but there is no reference in the text of that authorization to any power to detain American citizens on American soil based on suspicion."
2003.03-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1730.675,1733.877,"Well, you surely don't think that it excluded American citizens."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1741.882,1743.449,"Certainly, Your Honor, as--"
2003.03-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.449,1749.303,"So whatever authority it gave him, there is no indication that it's limited to non-citizens."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1749.303,1761.444,"--No, but what is limited to citizens is Section 4001 in which Congress specifically provided that no citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an act of Congress."
2003.03-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1761.444,1767.498,And you would say that 4001 prevents the President from detaining on the battlefield?
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1767.498,1768.867,"No, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1768.867,1771.652,"Well, then it doesn't mean what you just said it meant."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1771.652,1779.573,"What we are talking about... first of all, there is a general presumption against extraterritorial application of statutes."
2003.03-1027,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1791.147,1793.582,So the clear statement rule doesn't apply to 4001?
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1793.582,1796.767,"--Which clear statement rule, Your Honor?"
2003.03-1027,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1796.767,1799.303,"Well, I thought you were arguing for the clear statement rule."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1799.303,1804.54,"Yes, Your Honor, we are and our argument is limited to detentions within this country--"
2003.03-1027,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1804.54,1807.575,But your qualification is only implied from the statute.
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1807.575,1817.515,--Our argument is that what there needs to be a clear statement of is of the authority to detain an American citizen on American soil.
2003.03-1027,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1838.528,1839.13,What about hijackers?
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1852.121,1864.829,"Your Honor, our position is that certainly the President would have inherent authority with or without this resolution to seize an individual who is engaged in an act like that that took place on 9/11."
2003.03-1027,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1885.325,1891.229,"And if they are captured on the battlefield and then brought here, 4001 clicks into operation, in your view?"
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1891.229,1898.585,"--Our position is that 4001 applies within the United States and its text means what it says, that no, no person--"
2003.03-1027,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1898.585,1900.235,"Well, then your answer to my question is yes?"
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1900.235,1901.204,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1901.204,1902.404,So if you were--
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1909.658,1915.712,"Your Honor, our position is that Congress could provide for some alternative legislative scheme for dealing with such individuals."
2003.03-1027,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1915.712,1918.83,What about my question on Iraq?
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1918.83,1927.102,"At this time, our position would be that such persons would have to be given an Article III trial, unless Congress came in with some other provision."
2003.03-1027,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1928.535,1930.821,What distinguishes citizen?
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1964.727,1965.344,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1982.82,1983.453,"--Well, let's get to that question."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,1998.714,2015.141,"--If Your Honors believe that 4000... that the authorization was meant to specifically authorize the detention of American citizens on American soil, we would contend first that there is no limiting principle within that authorization for who may be detained."
2003.03-1027,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.562,2038.773,"So the principle would be that if somebody is like a missile sent over here, you know, he is actually one of the hijackers or the equivalent thereof, that's an obvious limiting principle, that people who are sent offshore, sent right over here and we catch them in mid-air."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2038.773,2059.337,"I think when you start trying to draw those lines on a case-by-case basis where this individual because they are actually in the midst of a hijacking is close enough whereas some other individual who is merely in the early stages of a plot might not be enough, the difficulty of drawing those lines shows the need for clear Congressional action here."
2003.03-1027,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2068.109,2070.495,Declarations of war are just not written this way.
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2079.583,2080.616,That's correct.
2003.03-1027,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2080.616,2081.702,That's just not the tradition.
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2083.987,2085.187,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2107.853,2114.756,"Well, Endo was concededly loyal, and Duncan were civil crimes, a stockbroker who was embezzling, right?"
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2114.756,2115.623,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2130.866,2131.385,Right.
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2188.555,2202.331,"Our view would be that because of the difficulty of the question of determining, for example, as I believe Justice Kennedy asked earlier, how long would such interrogation be necessary?"
2003.03-1027,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2232.917,2240.606,"Well, that would be, of course, perhaps, desirable, but we are faced with a situation of the here and now, and what do we do?"
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2240.606,2241.289,--Your Honor--
2003.03-1027,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2241.289,2243.558,We just turn loose a ticking time bomb?
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2243.558,2244.858,"--No, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2359.599,2369.305,Are you... are you suggesting then that this case might be an exception to some more general rule because of the peculiar facts that you have just recited?
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2369.305,2370.657,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2383.215,2386.167,"Well, maybe there should be some more definite rule."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2393.755,2402.878,"This Court might very well decide to make such a venue rule, but I would note that the Government at this point in the case has waived their objection to venue by not pursuing it on appeal."
2003.03-1027,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2405.578,2408.949,"Well, but they have certainly challenged the proper custodian here."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2408.949,2410.166,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.274,2425.392,That doesn't change it from jurisdiction to venue.
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2486.263,2488.048,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2493.702,2500.773,"We are talking if we are using the jurisdictional label, it's personal jurisdiction, and not subject matter jurisdiction."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2500.773,2509.545,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and under this Court's decision in Strait, there was personal jurisdiction over Secretary Rumsfeld in New York because of his contacts with that forum."
2003.03-1027,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2557.878,2561.08,"But on the basis of the, of the Congressional authorization."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2564.948,2570.352,"--Well, he claims them both on the basis of inherent executive power and on the basis of the authorization."
2003.03-1027,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2570.352,2576.923,"Well, but since they are, since they are both the weakest... weakest claim is probably solely the executive."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2582.26,2583.477,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.131,2623.071,"The trouble is, I don't see how you can... I mean, I think I can understand your saying it doesn't give him any power except a battlefield power."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2635.628,2641.965,"We would say it does not apply off the battlefield, certainly to U.S. citizens on U.S. soil."
2003.03-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.65,2645.084,But it does apply to aliens.
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2649.971,2653.59,"--This Court need not decide that in this case, and I certainly don't--"
2003.03-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2653.59,2667.85,"I understand, but you are proposing to us an interpretation of the resolution, which I suggest makes no sense, unless you are willing to say that it also doesn't apply to aliens that are being brought... that are committing these acts within the country."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2667.85,2674.519,--I would agree that it does not... the authorization does not clearly indicate that it's applicable to aliens either.
2003.03-1027,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2674.519,2680.84,He might have the power to take up the aliens and arrest them any way because 4001 doesn't prohibit it?
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2680.84,2681.875,"Correct, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2681.875,2682.292,Is that your point?
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2682.292,2682.825,"Correct, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2698.385,2705.241,"Then I take it then you have no, assuming... assuming that 4001 has been superseded by the authorization."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2713.228,2713.996,"No, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2726.654,2729.006,So you would make no distinction between the two.
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2729.006,2731.34,"Correct, Your Honor, were it not for 4001."
2003.03-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2781.239,2790.395,So you say that has no application on the battlefield because of the principle of no extraterritorial effect of United States statutes?
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2790.395,2796.984,"Your Honor, certainly as to an overseas battlefield, 4001, because of the presumption against extraterritoriality, would not apply."
2003.03-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2796.984,2807.34,"Now, what if you capture an American combatant and bring him back to the United States, then 4001--"
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2807.34,2810.725,4001 would apply upon his return.
2003.03-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2810.725,2811.108,--It would apply?
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2811.108,2811.577,Correct.
2003.03-1027,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2849.533,2872.299,"Did Congress at the time of 4001 consider other systems that do allow for preventative detention, but then require the person periodically to be brought before a judge to make certain that the conditions still exist, like, as is alleged in this case, to need to get evidence?"
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2872.299,2877.936,"Your Honor, there certainly are many other systems that provide for that sort of judicial review."
2003.03-1027,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2905.789,2910.341,The reason... and this is why I've been harping on this thing of necessary and appropriate.
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,2955.369,2955.888,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3004.969,3013.808,"So I take it you would say that the resolution was inadequate to continue to hold your client in the manner in which he is being held, even on the day in which it was passed?"
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,3018.379,3019.562,"Yes, Your Honor, particularly--"
2003.03-1027,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3019.562,3022.014,I just want to make sure I understand you.
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,3028.418,3049.081,"--If there were a situation where an individual, not like my client, but an individual that were on the verge of engaging in imminent violent conduct, certainly the President would have the power, even under the Fourth Amendment, to seize that individual without a warrant and bring him into custody on the basis that they were about to engage in a violent act."
2003.03-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3061.989,3062.722,Let me interrupt.
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,3075.38,3078.767,"--For the initial seizure, we would say probable cause."
2003.03-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3078.767,3084.755,Reasonable suspicion based on confidential intelligence would not be sufficient?
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,3084.755,3096.294,"We would submit no, but it's possible that when that question came up, the quantum of evidence might be weighed against the danger that the executive perceived."
2003.03-1027,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3107.318,3109.87,"That's really a reasonable suspicion standard, then, isn't it?"
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,3109.87,3110.603,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3119.242,3120.594,You wouldn't just say two years.
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,3132.485,3133.585,--Yes.
2003.03-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3133.585,3136.937,"--That's the way the statute you're relying on reads, that he shall not be detained."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,3138.722,3139.356,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3139.356,3146.625,"The next day he should, I suppose, you know, hand him over to civil prosecution authorities."
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,3146.625,3150.196,"Yes, Your Honor, we would say at 48 hours under this Court's decisions."
2003.03-1027,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3175.745,3177.697,But we are not just talking about terrorists here.
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,3181.549,3182.667,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3263.85,3269.487,"So you say that Judge Mukasey's solution for this case was not adequate, then?"
2003.03-1027,1,31904,jennifer_martinez,,3269.487,3271.054,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-1027,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3439.297,3440.716,"Thank you, Ms. Martinez."
2003.03-1027,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3443.085,3445.251,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
