1974.73-1452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.622,"We'll arguments next in 73-1452, Oregon against Hass."
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,10.455,12.838,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,194.234,207.222,Is that the case in which we remanded to the -- one of the cases we remanded to the Supreme Court of California to ask them to state clearly whether they acted on the federal or the state constitution or was that another case?
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,207.222,210.354,I believe that was what was done in that case Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-1452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,216.846,225.767,You don’t challenge the right of the Supreme Court of Oregon interpreting its own search and seizure constitutional provisions to come to a different conclusion in this Court?
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,225.767,230.506,Oh! Certainly not Mr. Justice Rehnquist but my point incidentally this is not the search and seizure.
1974.73-1452,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,334.697,337.886,I gather Oregon does have a counterpart of the self-incrimination clause?
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,337.886,338.673,Yes.
1974.73-1452,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,351.93,356.85,"So, had they rested this decision on that provision you would not be here?"
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,356.85,364.964,Absolutely not but my point is they didn't and that is why we contend we have every right to be here.
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,886.008,891.962,Was that prior opinion in Brewton that was 1967?
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,891.962,892.873,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,892.873,895.292,Is that federally grounded or (Voice Overlap)?
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,895.292,896.751,Yes it is.
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,897.696,899.45,"The reason that, may I just ask?"
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,899.45,899.578,Certainly.
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,899.578,906.759,The reason I asked is that this apparently was a situation that arose before Miranda was decided.
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,906.759,908.696,"The trial had, yes."
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,908.696,917.78,"Well, what it says at page 29 whether or not Miranda's finding upon argument in courts with reference to trials concluded before the Miranda decision was published."
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,917.78,920.197,Yes.
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,920.197,921.864,Whether or not in either event --
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,921.864,923.64,Yes.
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,923.64,927.39,-- they applied what they did in Brewton as to impeachment?
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,927.39,931.239,If I may expand on that a little Mr. Justice Brennan.
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,937.943,942.509,"Well, that was the same day as rendered a week later."
1974.73-1452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,942.509,943.133,One week later.
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,943.133,943.763,That’s right.
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,943.763,965.92,"Well, perhaps they weren't aware of it because the Oregon courts had held that it's our holding that Oregon holding in State versus Nelly which was kind of anticipation of Miranda decided post Escobedo and pre-Miranda was retroactive to a greater degree than this Court subsequently held Miranda to be retroactive."
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,969.145,973.825,"Well, this was decided in 1967 but what date in 1967?"
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,973.825,975.134,Exact date --
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,975.134,978.341,When relation to the date we decided to Johnson.
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,978.341,981.607,I'm afraid I don't know but Johnson was in 1966 (Voice Overlap) --
1974.73-1452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,981.607,982.509,1966.
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,984.59,1012.958,"Both, but the Oregon rule was as I recall it that case, that Nelly and subsequently until we had a case somewhat later even Miranda would apply retroactively to cases which were not terminated, concluded and that included a 90-day period after a final judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court within which the defendant or the other side could petition for certiorari."
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1012.958,1025.397,"Well, the reason I asked is in the present case it would appear at page 15 that your court cited this case?"
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1025.397,1026.256,Yes.
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1026.256,1032.121,"You can read it I suggest this way, jointly on Brewton and Harris?"
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1032.121,1032.98,Yes.
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1032.98,1038.592,"And that Brewton was contrary to Harris and it followed Brewton, is that what they do?"
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1038.592,1041.125,"Yes, well, they distinguish also between --"
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1041.125,1053.071,"Well, they did later but if it can be read as based on the state ground even if it's also based on a federal ground and even though it's erroneous in its interpretation of federal ground."
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1058.259,1060.338,That would be true but my position is that this --
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1060.338,1066.387,"Yes, but don't we have to decide then whether the original Brewton was decided on the state or federal ground?"
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1066.387,1071.692,Yes I suppose that’s part of the decision you will have to undertake.
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1076.549,1083.621,(Voice Overlap) is that language I've just read to you that I wasn't clear of this precisely what it meant whether or not Miranda?
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1083.621,1093.726,"Yes, as I say I think it turns into what the Oregon Supreme Court had done with regard to its retroactivity rules about the application of Miranda and Nelly."
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1101.741,1109.871,"Well, certainly all that repercussion of 29 and 30 is in relation to the developing law under the Fourteenth Amendment as this Court had developed."
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1109.871,1118.205,"Yes, but again they are again also applying the Nelly case in the Brewton case and the Nelly case is not predicated."
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1118.205,1120.689,But what was the middle ground in Tate.
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1128.051,1140.841,I don't recall it all offhand.
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1170.142,1171.628,Do you mind if I interrupt you once again?
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1171.628,1172.795,Not at all.
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1172.795,1187.929,"In Brewton, Justice Perry dissented and next to the last paragraph at page 33, I know of no reason why this Court should go beyond the requirements of the Supreme Court of the United States and that's the rule and so forth."
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1187.929,1188.436,Yes.
1974.73-1452,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1188.436,1198.049,"Doesn't that suggest that he, at least he led majority opinion in Brewton is going beyond any decision of this Court?"
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1198.049,1213.816,"Well, it very probably does and but I submit that thinking that he is going beyond the requirements of this Court's previous decisions does not necessarily indicate at all that the case is predicated on state grounds rather than federal."
1974.73-1452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1225.936,1230.287,"Well, he relied on the Walter case as much as the Court did in Harris?"
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1230.287,1245.097,Yes he did and I found it rather strange I was not very frequently before the Supreme Court of Oregon at the time that the majority opinion doesn't event talk about Walter.
1974.73-1452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1245.097,1247.435,Is that -- this good one is now a federal circuit judge?
1974.73-1452,0,42617,thomas_h_denney,,1247.435,1254.518,"Yes it is unless there are no further questions, I'll reserve the balance of my time."
1974.73-1452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1254.518,1256.861,Very well Mr. Denney.
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,1259.032,1264.657,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1364.764,1369.429,Haven't we had a little qualification to that if they place it on their own law?
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,1369.429,1371.596,"Well, --"
1974.73-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1371.596,1376.945,Their own constitution or statutes presumably?
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,1376.945,1398.644,My reading of the case is I didn't believe that until Green versus California but it appeared to me that within as long as the state's interpretation even of the federal constitutional provision was more restrictive then there's no constitutional question before this Court because no one rights has been valid.
1974.73-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1398.644,1411.477,Why do you suppose we send -- we sent some of those cases back to the state Supreme Court to ask him to make it clear whether they were acting under the federal or under their state constitution if that's the case?
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,1411.477,1413.976,"Well, I wasn't aware of that Your Honor."
1974.73-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1554.058,1570.316,Are you contending for anything more than that the Supreme Court of Oregon or the Oregon legislature has a right under state law or state constitutional law to impose more rigorous requirements on the prosecution and being imposed by the federal constitution?
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,1570.316,1574.301,"Yes Your Honor that's exactly what I'm saying, what I attempt to say in my brief."
1974.73-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1574.301,1578.885,But are you saying anything more than that?
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,1594.512,1599.443,"Well, I wouldn't think it would really make difference."
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.123,1630.287,"Mr. McKeen, are you saying something like this that you're familiar with the differences among us of this Court on the question of the constitutionality of obscenity laws?"
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,1685.484,1702.889,It would still appear to me Your Honor to be an academic opinion of this Court if the Supreme Court of Oregon chose to violate no one’s constitutional rights and still make a finding difference in this Court.
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1710.415,1714.281,That makes federal constitution more restrictive.
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,1720.96,1726.694,That was my understanding and Your Honor the Supreme Court of Oregon said that.
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1750.673,1752.917,No question about that.
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,1754.548,1765.456,I understand Your Honor but in the next sentence was your question or we can interpret the Fourth Amendment more restrictively than interpreted by the United States Supreme Court.
1974.73-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1808.759,1814.514,"I noticed that neither you nor your friends have cited the Krivda case, are you familiar with that?"
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,1814.514,1815.719,"No, I'm not Your Honor."
1974.73-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1815.719,1821.594,That's I think perhaps the most recent case which we sent back that was California was it?
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,1848.222,1861.9,"Well, the Oregon Supreme Court from the text of their opinion in Hass case recognizes the importance of following the interpretation of the federal courts."
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.737,1926.112,"Excuse me counsel, would you have the same view if the police officer were sued for invading someone's constitutional rights and a word of damages has made against him based on the Supreme Court of Oregon’s holding and he said, “Well, that maybe the opinion of Supreme Court of Oregon but Supreme Court of United States says, that “I didn’t violate somebody’s constitutional right."
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,1928.951,1934.931,Wouldn't then there be a violation of the police officer's constitute federally constituted -- constitutional rights --
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.931,1940.659,"No, the Supreme Court of Oregon says that he’s at fault."
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,1942.766,1954.016,But in any areas Your Honor where the state Supreme Court is less restrictive and certainly not contending that the Supreme Court of the United States doesn't have jurisdiction.
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.016,1955.288,I understand.
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,1955.288,1967.14,But what the police officer if he's awarded -- if he's required to pay damages when his act was proper under the federal constitution then I don't think that he is properly before this Court on a federal constitution.
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.14,1971.056,"The Supreme Court of Oregon says, “It isn’t proper under the federal constitution."
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,1973.472,1977.494,"Well, I would think in that case you should have access to this Court. They don’t believe that’s --"
1974.73-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1977.494,1996.017,"Certainly, you have a wrong long line of cases that this Court has taken where there have been appeals by the state from a judgment of the State Supreme Court saying that the state couldn't impose a tax on a potential taxpayer either for Due Process or for Commerce Clause reasons?"
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,2001.429,2012.27,That the state can appeal in order that it effects their property interest the same as any person that has standing before this Court.
1974.73-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2012.27,2017.146,But does the state have property interest under the Constitution?
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,2017.146,2017.694,"Well, --"
1974.73-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.694,2023.002,Does it have any greater interest in collecting revenues that in enforcing the criminal law?
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,2023.002,2026.715,"Well, I believe that the distinction has been made by the Supreme Court of United States."
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.341,2093.504,"Well, what you're suggesting I suppose is at least in criminal prosecution while the Supreme Court of Oregon can't narrow the constitutional guarantees of the accuse as we interpret it."
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,2095.908,2098.092,"Well, yes Your Honor and it has been said --"
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.092,2105.346,What you're suggesting as I gather and the one the extensions do not have to be based upon the state constitution.
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,2111.661,2119.44,I would think so and of course I have the feeling that I'm not completely right on that but that's my understanding.
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2119.44,2121.415,"Well, you have some authority cited."
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,2125.763,2147.572,"Well, Cooper versus California says -- now, this was Cooper versus California was searched where the state had a statute also and the Supreme Court considered the case only as to whether or not the search was reasonable under the federal constitution."
1974.73-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2162.183,2208.449,Your response about reading the constitution -- federal constitution more expansively then the -- it's read up here would bring you right against the proposition Mr. Justice White suggested to you that if that reading then imposed a liability on a police officer for damages for violating the Fourth Amendment or any other provision in a way that we did not countenance then you I thought did say that the officer would have a claim that his rights under the federal constitution have been violated because he regarded and have been talked to regard this United States Constitution as the supreme law of the land.
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,2208.449,2217.056,"Well, that still Your Honor is the way that I would think it would be if I can follow the thread of the fact situation correctly."
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.598,2248.161,The other side of the argument is that (Inaudible)?
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,2248.161,2249.763,"Well, they did --"
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2249.763,2263.673,Do you say that it is (Inaudible)?
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,2263.673,2265.275,Absolutely not Your Honor.
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.18,2273.048,"I know, I know."
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,2285.978,2309.112,"Well, it's in my feeling that they're trying the case and through their record it's been submitted to the court the difference is clear between Harris and Hass because the Harris case was an unintentional negligent failure to say some magic words and there was -- that's all it was."
1974.73-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2442.26,2453.849,Are you referring to any state cases since Harris and which they sought to review here the state sought to review here or did the state just acquiesce?
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,2453.849,2472.569,I'm not sure if that was -- this was one of the cases cited in the appellant's brief as authority for the states that had followed ahead and followed Harris.
1974.73-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2477.332,2482.05,Do have a name or particular case in mind?
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,2482.05,2488.243,I just don't.
1974.73-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2505.36,2511.604,But there's no indication in a citation that the certiorari was sought and denied?
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,2511.604,2513.166,No.
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.585,2536.615,May I -- I'm not sure but I think the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is one Supreme Court it's kind of rather far in saying that it's adopting a state law and certain decisions of this Court and I have some recollection the owner is one of those.
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,2546.55,2550.461,"Well, Your Honor it is in the opinion of the state Supreme Court of Oregon regardless of how they based it."
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2550.461,2556.899,I know but (Voice Overlap) is rested on state law and federal law or which?
1974.73-1452,1,41726,sam_a_mckeen,,2556.899,2558.434,I don't know.
1974.73-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.358,2582.833,"Well, let's say it's attached to the petition the full opinion is attached to the petition, page 38."
1974.73-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2582.833,2584.544,"Mr. Denney, do you have anything further?"
1974.73-1452,2,42617,thomas_h_denney,,2584.544,2589.129,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, yes, two very brief points."
1974.73-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2631.032,2632.265,And you disagree with that?
1974.73-1452,2,42617,thomas_h_denney,,2632.265,2633.648,"Yes, we certainly do."
1974.73-1452,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2633.648,2635.078,And why are you --
1974.73-1452,2,42617,thomas_h_denney,,2635.078,2640.17,"This is Footnote 12, page 9 of the petition Your Honor."
1974.73-1452,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2643.31,2644.435,What view was that?
1974.73-1452,2,42617,thomas_h_denney,,2644.435,2648.367,It was just decided about a month after this case Your Honor.
1974.73-1452,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2658.859,2660.475,Was far as search and seizure?
1974.73-1452,2,42617,thomas_h_denney,,2660.475,2661.679,Yes it was a search and seizure.
1974.73-1452,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2661.679,2664.121,That was dicta in Florance.
1974.73-1452,2,42617,thomas_h_denney,,2664.121,2673.885,The Court -- the Oregon Supreme Court decided to follow this Court’s interpretation of the Fourth Amendment as enunciated in U.S. versus Robinson Your Honor.
1974.73-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2701.918,2703.376,And you would agree on the first --
1974.73-1452,2,42617,thomas_h_denney,,2703.376,2705.039,"Certainly, we agree on the first."
1974.73-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2705.039,2705.922,-- but not on the second?
1974.73-1452,2,42617,thomas_h_denney,,2705.922,2714.193,"No, and that mere fact that the Court in this case indicates that they think they're free to do it. I think shed some light on what they are doing in this case."
1974.73-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2714.193,2732.011,"Well, I don’t -- I thought your court in this case expressly put aside this whole issue that didn’t make any difference what this rule was that this was just a different case, completely different case and that they didn’t have to interpret."
1974.73-1452,2,42617,thomas_h_denney,,2736.905,2744.592,It seems to me Your Honor that they have a very fact that they have to distinguish to Harris case is some indication that they do this.
1974.73-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.592,2748.147,"Well, if some indication that they were deciding and on the basis of federal law that’s what you are going to say."
1974.73-1452,2,42617,thomas_h_denney,,2748.147,2749.002,"That was my point, yes."
1974.73-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2751.535,2757.778,"Well, they may be wrong but they are not plainly in this case that they have a right to be wrong."
1974.73-1452,2,42617,thomas_h_denney,,2757.778,2758.937,Not expressly.
1974.73-1452,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2762.77,2775.968,"Well, but if they fell an obligation as you just said to distinguish the Harris case, the implication would be that in this case that they thought they didn’t feel free to disregard Harris in other words."
1974.73-1452,2,42617,thomas_h_denney,,2775.968,2777.26,"Yes, that is correct."
1974.73-1452,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2777.26,2779.475,They felt an obligation to distinguish Harris.
1974.73-1452,2,42617,thomas_h_denney,,2779.475,2780.628,And that is why I'm saying which was based --
1974.73-1452,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2780.628,2795.688,Which would lead to the inference that they felt themselves not free to interpret the federal constitution in a different way from its interpretation by this Court?
1974.73-1452,2,42617,thomas_h_denney,,2801.426,2805.315,"On the contrary, because Harris is a ruling that is favorable."
1974.73-1452,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2902.228,2903.09,Thank you gentlemen.
