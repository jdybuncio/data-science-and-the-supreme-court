2012.11-889,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.154,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 11-889, Tarrant Regional Water District v. Herrmann."
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,7.237,10.022,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,103.9,129.099,"Mr. Rothfeld, we are told that in other compacts when they really mean to give one State the right to take another State's water, the provision in the compact is much clearer, much more definite."
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,148.696,155.25,"Well, the provision that we are relying on, I would say is not sketchy at all."
2012.11-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.716,181.251,What is the exact language?
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,184.62,190.773,"--It appears -- it is reprinted on page 8 of the blue brief in the indented text, and it says,"
2012.11-889,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,223.245,224.429,It doesn't say that.
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,244.774,245.926,"--Well, I have to disagree with that."
2012.11-889,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,245.926,247.06,Where does it say something about it?
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,247.06,253.949,"It says that -- the section is designed to allocate the water of the subbasin, and it says,"
2012.11-889,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,258.301,259.051,Yes.
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,259.051,260.02,"The second part of it then says,"
2012.11-889,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,263.388,263.655,All right.
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,298.811,300.361,--A couple points to say about that.
2012.11-889,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,302.68,314.587,"It's not at all complex when Oklahoma is going to say, Texas, go run the pipe to the south of the Red River, and Texas is going to say, I'm sorry, we can't get there, there's too much cactus."
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,337.186,337.603,Right.
2012.11-889,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,337.953,340.572,I would have thought a mechanism would be set up to do that and there is none.
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,340.572,341.005,--Okay.
2012.11-889,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,354.981,355.664,Fine.
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,384.167,387.135,What I say -- I guess I will say two things about that.
2012.11-889,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,391.27,393.522,Which language is it not consistent with?
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,393.522,395.489,--Equal rights to use of specified water.
2012.11-889,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,418.905,419.507,Excuse me.
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,419.507,421.34,--If I may just -- I'm sorry.
2012.11-889,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,421.34,421.874,"No, no."
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,422.376,434.349,"And I think to the extent that there could be any ambiguity in the -- in that language viewed in isolation, in the context of the rest of the Compact, there are places where the drafters of the Compact, in fact, did refer to State lines."
2012.11-889,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,445.907,472.974,"I think under your argument, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, that Louisiana could decide it doesn't want to wait for the flow of water to come to it, and it could just go right into Oklahoma, in which it shares no border, and I don't know how it's going to do that, and take its 25 percent."
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,476.176,476.959,"Well, I will--"
2012.11-889,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,476.959,483.246,"I mean, you're talking about Texas, but Texas shares a border and so it may be a little easier to cross the borderline."
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,485.115,486.432,"--Well, let me make two points about that."
2012.11-889,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,520.371,524.907,"Go back to the first one, because what you have done is you've pushed me back to the equal rights."
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,557.259,560.929,--If I may just finish with Justice Sotomayor and I will turn to that?
2012.11-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,573.72,574.853,How -- how does it do it?
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,577.022,578.54,It has to apply to whichever--
2012.11-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,578.54,579.69,To Oklahoma.
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,579.69,586.378,"--If it's going to Oklahoma, and this is partially responsive to Justice Breyer, it would have to apply to the water authorities within Oklahoma."
2012.11-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,608.576,612.611,Who -- who erects the facilities to accomplish this diversion?
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,612.611,614.813,Tarrant presumably will do that.
2012.11-889,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,624.403,642.215,"It's -- it's my understanding that there is a place where Texas can put a line into the river, and then a subset of that question is, the main stem of the river, through -- without going through Oklahoma property, other than perhaps just the bank itself."
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,642.215,645.733,That -- that I think is not correct as a factual matter.
2012.11-889,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,659.009,663.294,"But you say entirely within Oklahoma, just because of ownership of the banks?"
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,663.294,663.83,--Because--
2012.11-889,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,663.83,671.217,--or because of there's also some intervening property between Texas and the bank that Oklahoma owns?
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,671.217,679.073,"--The -- the border between Oklahoma and Texas is the south vegetation line of the Red River, so therefore it is out of the river past the bank to the vegetation line."
2012.11-889,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,686.36,690.028,Do -- do the current laws prohibit that--
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,690.028,693.915,"--Oklahoma's current laws would, I would think, prevent--"
2012.11-889,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,693.915,695.099,--At any point?
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,695.099,704.355,"--At any point, because the laws that Tarrant is challenging here are laws that are discriminatory Oklahoma laws that prevent any use of water originating in Oklahoma outside."
2012.11-889,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,704.355,708.925,"When you say Texas has the right to go into Oklahoma, just -- just think about that phrase."
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,714.346,714.813,Right.
2012.11-889,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,725.552,735.742,But you were saying that Oklahoma -- that Texas has the right to force Oklahoma to take private property in Oklahoma by eminent domain if necessary.
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,735.742,743.063,"No, I -- there is an -- there is an Oklahoma statute that says in order to -- someone who has a permit to obtain water can exercise eminent domain."
2012.11-889,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,745.465,748.55,How does -- how does Oklahoma apply its law in this situation?
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,768.047,772.432,"Well, Oklahoma cannot use more than 25 percent of the water within the subbasin."
2012.11-889,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,794.531,799.0,"But it's got to give Texas at least up to its 25 percent, right?"
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,799.0,810.707,"If -- if there is a request for that much water from a Texas user, and the Texas user has priority as a permit applicant against others who are seeking to take water from this particular--"
2012.11-889,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,810.707,817.896,"I guess what I'm asking is, does the Compact give Texas special priority apart from what Oklahoma -- Oklahoma's priorities would be?"
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,817.896,818.546,"--No, it does not."
2012.11-889,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,843.696,845.048,And what does that mean exactly?
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,858.807,866.377,"--It -- a permit applicant submits an application, which has to demonstrate that it satisfies the standards for obtaining the water."
2012.11-889,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,875.733,879.887,I'm really asking you to tell me what the Oklahoma board is going to do.
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,884.989,886.475,"--Well, that is their current policy."
2012.11-889,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,887.341,899.032,"What -- what -- what different kind of priorities do they have to use, and why do they have to use them, as I think -- somewhere along the lines of what the Chief Justice was asking?"
2012.11-889,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,899.032,900.967,I suppose there -- there are two points there.
2012.11-889,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,930.403,930.853,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,943.727,945.763,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-889,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,999.064,1007.004,"Well, I -- I am not quite sure I agree with your reading of the court of appeals' opinion."
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1036.439,1038.056,"Well, we agree with that."
2012.11-889,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1049.981,1058.769,"But that's the way I read the analytic approach of the court of appeals at 39A, when it starts talking about the point of -- Section 5.05."
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1058.769,1059.621,Right.
2012.11-889,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1088.139,1097.044,"Well, where, if you're relying on the Compact and its language, where do you come up with this idea that States first have to try to get their 25 percent from water within their borders?"
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1097.913,1110.804,"--Well, first of all, we think that that's an issue that, if the Court decided that -- that there are errors in the court of appeals opinion that should be corrected, we think that's something the court of -- that the lower courts could consider on remand."
2012.11-889,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1133.086,1136.538,"Well, it seems to me that you like some provisions of State law, but not others."
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1136.538,1137.121,No.
2012.11-889,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1163.106,1171.193,What do you do -- what do you do with a situation -- let's say there's Oklahoma water available to Tarrant that is closer than the water they would get from somewhere else in Texas.
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1177.179,1198.962,"Well, we think -- again, we think this is a -- an issue for the court of -- for the lower courts to look at on remand, but we think there's a -- there's a good argument to be made that, so long as Texas could access 25 percent of the water within its boundaries, then application of an Oklahoma law that would prohibit Texas from going through the Oklahoma permitting process wouldn't necessarily be preempted."
2012.11-889,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1208.551,1211.353,"Ms. O'Connell, isn't that a reason why we shouldn't accept your basic view?"
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1246.693,1268.339,"--Justice Kagan, I'd like to, if I could, go to the second point, which is on the -- the -- whether you read this as a 25 percent entitlement or a cap, and I would like to point the Court, not just to the language of the Compact, which we think weighs in favor of the idea that each right -- each State has an equal right and that the -- the equal right to use the water in the subbasin implies an equal right, not just an opportunity."
2012.11-889,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1387.952,1389.268,And what does that mean?
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1390.32,1400.843,"Well, the Oklahoma Water Resources Board would just apply its normal procedures and laws to determine whether this particular use of water could be put to beneficial use."
2012.11-889,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1409.382,1413.251,"Well, people keep on saying that, and I -- I guess I just still don't understand quite what it means."
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1413.251,1413.686,Well--
2012.11-889,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1413.686,1418.055,"I mean, let's say Oklahoma, the board is sitting there and it gets lots of applications from Oklahoma users."
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1429.029,1441.587,"--Well, I think just as -- as Petitioner's counsel pointed out, there's a -- a priority in water law, where whoever submits the application first would -- would get the water if it's available and they can put it to beneficial use."
2012.11-889,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1458.964,1459.815,"Well, I don't understand your answer."
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1474.224,1479.562,"--That -- true, to the extent that Texas was not receiving its water."
2012.11-889,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1497.174,1504.828,Is it correct that -- that there are reservoirs in Texas that flow into -- from which water is released into the Red River?
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1504.828,1505.528,Yes.
2012.11-889,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1505.528,1506.613,Okay.
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1506.963,1507.53,And in Oklahoma as well.
2012.11-889,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1507.53,1520.955,"--And what if Texas didn't -- what if Texas could get -- could -- could release that water and increase the flow of the river, but it chose not to do so, so it could take other water out of the river?"
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1520.955,1523.589,This -- this is the last point made in the Respondent's brief--
2012.11-889,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1523.589,1524.324,Yes.
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1524.324,1528.359,--and -- and the response to that would just be that all of the States would have the opportunity to do that.
2012.11-889,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1544.286,1549.54,"Well, we're only considering the instance where there isn't enough water to meet the 25 percent in Texas."
2012.11-889,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1567.751,1572.805,"Well, I -- it's -- we don't think it needs to be decided in this particular proceeding."
2012.11-889,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1589.184,1590.0,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1599.305,1602.841,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-889,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1636.998,1637.998,Are they licensed?
2012.11-889,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1637.998,1643.818,So I'm sure -- you're -- you're saying that the State of Texas can take water directly from the main stem?
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1643.818,1644.853,It can and does.
2012.11-889,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1644.853,1646.27,"That's my point, yes."
2012.11-889,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1646.27,1650.222,Anywhere close to of the 25 percent they claim entitlement to?
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1650.222,1650.84,"Well, who knows?"
2012.11-889,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1650.84,1652.74,I was hoping you did.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1653.626,1654.859,Who knows?
2012.11-889,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1660.696,1662.482,I'm talking about Subbasin 5.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1662.482,1667.284,"Subbasin 5, these are all -- excuse me -- these are tributaries that run into Subbasin 5."
2012.11-889,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1690.099,1700.505,"Just to be clear, in your view, Texas can, without going on Oklahoma property, take water from the main stem in Basin 5?"
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1700.505,1705.059,"--In Subbasin 5, there is only up from Denison Dam east to Shawnee Creek."
2012.11-889,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1724.186,1727.072,"But my question was, can they take it from the main stem--"
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1727.072,1730.257,Only in that -- that little slip of land to Shawnee Creek.
2012.11-889,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1731.659,1734.777,"--Is that the part that, under their allegation at least, is saline?"
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1734.777,1739.979,"--Well, again, they drink the water in Subbasin 5."
2012.11-889,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1739.979,1740.296,All right.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1740.598,1740.881,Yes.
2012.11-889,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1741.148,1741.465,--they are referring to--
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1741.465,1741.865,--Yes.
2012.11-889,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1741.865,1742.698,--when they say it's too saline?
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1742.698,1743.015,Yes.
2012.11-889,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1747.835,1749.371,Texans.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1749.371,1750.221,They're drinking it.
2012.11-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.226,1759.026,When they--
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1759.026,1760.609,"I understand they think it's salty, but they drink it."
2012.11-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1760.609,1769.348,"--When they take water from the main stream of the Red River, how do they know how much of that water is from Reach V?"
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1769.348,1771.617,"Well, the--"
2012.11-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.617,1775.569,They are -- they are entitled to -- to no more than 25 percent from Reach V.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1784.692,1792.131,"--So if you look at the -- if you look at the map in the red brief that's got all the -- the colors, and the pink is Subbasin 5."
2012.11-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.986,1803.338,Now what page are you looking at?
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1803.338,1804.638,This is 33A--
2012.11-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.638,1805.021,"Yeah, okay."
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1805.021,1805.457,--this map.
2012.11-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1805.457,1806.49,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1807.707,1813.777,"So they -- and then if you look at that -- that blue lake that looks like a dragon, that is also where they are -- they are taking water."
2012.11-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.777,1814.313,--What--
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1814.313,1815.279,That just happens to be in Reach I.
2012.11-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1815.279,1815.696,--Reach I.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1816.513,1825.085,But their water planning documents show that all the water in the pink on the Texas side is a very valuable source of drinking water.
2012.11-889,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1855.021,1856.156,"Well, it never -- it never says that."
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1882.873,1883.373,Right.
2012.11-889,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1915.011,1923.7,"Say that again, because we have a green brief that gives us samples of provisions for cross border."
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1923.7,1925.0,"--Yeah, under explicit right."
2012.11-889,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1929.854,1931.071,"Because there have been many, many--"
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1931.071,1937.842,"--Many with explicit statements and then the essential bells and whistles as to eminent domain, points of diversion, and which choice of law."
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1989.26,1996.964,"But there was a point, it seems to me, to favor them, which is go back to 1970 -- the '70s, when they drafted this."
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,1996.964,1997.498,--I'm there.
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1997.498,2004.902,"So they are in the room, and there are representatives of all four States, and as they argue, there is going to be more than 3,000 feet, what happens?"
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2030.137,2031.937,But with all due -- sorry.
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2031.937,2039.909,"--that would suggest that, hey, no, they all knew this and so they meant there must be some way for Texas to get the extra; otherwise, why were they saying 25 percent for Texas?"
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2041.109,2041.542,Justice Breyer.
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.394,2047.679,"--You know, this is an example I made up, because I think--"
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2047.679,2048.079,--Oh.
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2048.713,2049.465,--an imaginary conversation.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2049.465,2050.531,--Oh.
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2050.531,2051.498,But if in an imaginary conversation--
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2051.498,2052.065,"Well, okay."
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2056.785,2057.602,--Why?
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2057.602,2063.605,There's no -- because there's no evidence there was any discussion about any State and whether -- Texas never complained.
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2065.474,2069.692,Wouldn't that be a fairly easy thing to check going back to 1970--
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2069.692,2070.394,If you--
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2070.394,2073.996,"--to found out whether, you know, Texas was just on some little salt flat--"
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2073.996,2074.446,--Sure.
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2074.446,2075.346,--near the river and--
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2075.346,2076.032,We did.
2012.11-889,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2143.241,2144.426,So what do you think is the remedy?
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2145.409,2146.878,The remedy?
2012.11-889,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2146.878,2150.83,--I -- let me just posit the point; okay?
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2177.148,2178.064,Okay.
2012.11-889,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2178.631,2180.266,So that -- that it's not getting--
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2180.266,2180.9,Okay.
2012.11-889,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2180.9,2181.433,--25 percent--
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2181.433,2182.052,Yeah.
2012.11-889,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2182.435,2184.701,--as the Compact entitles it to.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2184.701,2185.086,--Okay.
2012.11-889,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2199.661,2201.046,It says
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2206.0,2206.45,Right.
2012.11-889,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2247.994,2249.06,You feel a lot of what?
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2249.06,2250.112,--Affinity for them.
2012.11-889,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2250.112,2250.562,Oh.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2250.562,2253.498,But listen to their proof for why there's an equal 25 percent.
2012.11-889,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2253.498,2253.981,You are representing Oklahoma.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2253.981,2256.266,"I am, but I used to work for them."
2012.11-889,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2279.715,2285.452,"Well, this is a -- a perfectly legitimate argument for you to make, but I want to go back to Justice Sotomayor's question."
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2303.664,2304.247,"The excess, yeah."
2012.11-889,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2304.247,2305.647,I want you to assume that.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2313.102,2318.006,"That is -- that is the United States' view, and they'd have to go above it."
2012.11-889,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2420.472,2420.889,But that's the same problem.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2435.131,2436.083,"Well, I have two points."
2012.11-889,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2505.912,2516.635,"--Ms. Blatt, does Oklahoma law in any circumstance permit an appropriation of water -- water in Oklahoma for out-of-State use?"
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2516.635,2523.856,"Well, it's -- if it's compacted water, you have to get legislative approval and--"
2012.11-889,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2523.856,2528.86,"Just here and now, does Oklahoma ever--"
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2528.86,2529.393,"--Yes, it can."
2012.11-889,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2529.393,2530.462,--permit out-of-State use of its water?
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2530.462,2531.995,It has not.
2012.11-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2633.21,2633.696,Where is this?
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2633.696,2636.648,This is on page 14A and 15A -- sorry -- of the red brief.
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2802.872,2808.026,"--In Subbasin 1, that's mostly in Oklahoma, but Texas gets a lot of the water or the other way around?"
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2810.543,2811.478,Which reach?
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2811.478,2813.662,Subbasin 1.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2816.882,2819.466,Are you talking about 401?
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2819.466,2820.418,"Yes, 401."
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2820.418,2820.751,Okay.
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2829.29,2830.14,Okay.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2830.89,2831.307,Yes.
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2831.307,2844.616,"--because of that and because during the time when, let's say, there's 5,000 feet of the -- of the 2,000 extra, you know, Louisiana has to get 500."
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2852.472,2855.174,"Justice Breyer, you have to trust me."
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2859.293,2860.393,"So, so -- in other words--"
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2860.393,2862.745,No measurements have ever been taken with respect to this.
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2862.745,2863.245,--Fine.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2878.956,2879.856,"Well, there are gauges."
2012.11-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.142,2916.046,"I -- I don't understand what you just said: They're riparian States, so they don't track diversions."
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2916.046,2916.83,--Okay.
2012.11-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2917.664,2918.381,Why does that follow?
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2918.381,2918.814,--Right.
2012.11-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2925.768,2926.537,Okay.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2926.537,2935.293,"Louisiana, if you are a landowner, you just draw from the water and it's a -- it's a voluntary reporting system, so you don't necessarily have to tell the State how much you took out."
2012.11-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2935.293,2936.143,Okay.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2936.143,2949.803,"So one is a permitting system, and in Louisiana and Arkansas -- and, I think, again, the minutes just talk about we hope Louisiana and Arkansas will develop their laws to do better tracking of diversions."
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2959.574,2967.264,"The relevant legal argument, I think, is look at what you just cited to us about this reach in the subbasin."
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2970.799,2971.249,--Right.
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2971.249,2971.932,Okay.
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2982.107,2983.44,Well--
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2983.44,2984.874,--than it would be here?
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2984.874,2985.342,--the--
2012.11-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2985.342,2990.028,"And that argues against you because your main point, really, is that this is all too complicated."
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,2990.028,3003.02,"--Justice Breyer, the disaster would be and the affront to sovereignty is throughout the Compact, not so much the measuring that's a problem: Oklahoma would be able to insist on crossing Texas's borders to draw that 40 percent."
2012.11-889,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3011.876,3019.53,"--Well, I thought that was what your -- the other side does envision, that it doesn't -- it's not bound by the borders but it's bound by the agreement, the Compact."
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3023.951,3024.567,Okay.
2012.11-889,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3112.492,3120.313,"Ms. Blatt, the solicitor general here today spoke of lots of different examples where the language of entitlement and rights was used."
2012.11-889,2,34185,lisa_s_blatt,,3122.614,3125.566,--So they -- you mean the two compliance rules they cited?
2012.11-889,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3245.878,3247.245,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-889,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3249.63,3251.399,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-889,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3288.305,3295.844,So how do you deal with all the provisions she was mentioning with respect to the 60/40 division?
2012.11-889,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3305.3,3306.684,"--Well, I don't think that it has to mean that."
2012.11-889,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3492.538,3493.99,"Thank you, counsel."
