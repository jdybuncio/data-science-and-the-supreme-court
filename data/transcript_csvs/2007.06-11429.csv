2007.06-11429,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.185,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-11429, Burgess versus United States."
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,9.903,29.909,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The rule of lenity requires that any penal statute the government seeks to enforce against an individual must clearly and unambiguous apply to him and, as the government acknowledges its brief in this case, this Court has applied the rule of lenity in numerous recent cases involving mandatory sentencing provisions."
2007.06-11429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,37.158,38.236,Is it time-honored since Granderson?
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,39.313,42.937,"--Well, the rule of lenity has been--"
2007.06-11429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,42.937,43.874,As to sentences?
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,43.874,44.295,--As to sentencing?
2007.06-11429,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,113.519,118.703,"Well, but if the rule of lenity depends upon of course some ambiguity in the term, the definition says"
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,127.449,131.948,"That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and if that's all you had on the statute books this might be an easier case."
2007.06-11429,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,170.106,179.026,"Well, obviously one is a definition of ""felony"" and the other is the definition of ""felony drug offense"" and the term that's at issue here is ""felony drug offense""."
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,179.026,182.898,"Well, in a sense it's our position that both are at issue here."
2007.06-11429,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,222.305,233.158,Could I... could I ask you what you think Congress might have been trying to do with the 1994 amendment under... under your reading?
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,303.616,306.116,I think there is an agreement between us and the government on this point.
2007.06-11429,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,328.652,330.51,But if I could just come back to that.
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,347.942,352.282,"--Well, that works on the language of the statute, Justice Alito."
2007.06-11429,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,352.282,355.688,But is it plausible that's the reason why Congress added this language?
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,362.154,368.558,"Well, I think it is quite plausible that the language that Congress added has very little practical effect."
2007.06-11429,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,463.41,478.029,"What would you do with someone who was convicted... had a prior conviction of... for importing 10 tons of heroin in New Jersey, for example, where there are no felonies?"
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,483.682,489.93,"--Well, we've cited a case in our brief in the Second Circuit that deals with that exact problem, at least with the New Jersey problem."
2007.06-11429,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,509.486,517.746,But what they did... what they did in the Second Circuit case was to say this is punishable... this offense is punishable by more than a year in New Jersey and therefore it's a felony.
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,517.746,522.245,"I believe, Justice Alito, this was a case before 1994, so that's--"
2007.06-11429,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,522.245,522.557,I know.
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,524.542,538.552,"--Right, because that is the Federal definition of a felony, and so that was the analogy that the Second Circuit was able to draw here and reach what we think is a commonsense way to deal with the unusual problem of New Jersey."
2007.06-11429,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,539.161,554.046,You say there are other examples where a... a noun that is nested in another definition is separately defined and the two are read together.
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,587.08,588.674,"--All three of them do, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-11429,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.674,590.687,Which ones are they?
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,591.141,592.311,They're pages 11 and 12 of the yellow brief.
2007.06-11429,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,669.327,678.215,"Just on that... just on that last one, are you saying that if it doesn't say ""debtor's residential structure"", you'd think it was somebody else's residential structure?"
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,678.215,678.792,--Well--
2007.06-11429,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,678.792,679.198,I don't understand the point.
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,679.198,683.087,"--Well, there might be, you know, a very rigid plain-text argument that might be made."
2007.06-11429,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,692.302,705.062,"Well, in a provision of the Bankruptcy Code that deals with debtors I don't think there's any question about whose residential structure they would be talking about, even though they don't repeat ""debtor""."
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,708.483,712.419,"--Well, then I think I'd refer you back to the employee example."
2007.06-11429,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.212,725.913,--And--
2007.06-11429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,725.913,726.21,--better example.
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,750.45,751.247,I think that's right.
2007.06-11429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,752.012,755.073,So it seems to me they're not comparable in that sense.
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,755.073,756.307,--Okay.
2007.06-11429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,767.35,771.988,May I ask you a question before going on with this line?
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,801.931,821.906,"For a time, yes, Justice Ginsburg, but... so when the statute was originally passed, 802(13) was the sole definition of '94 amendments, a definition of 841(b)(1)(A)--"
2007.06-11429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,821.906,822.484,Right.
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,822.484,826.481,--but that itself just used the word 802(13).
2007.06-11429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,828.919,833.979,Would you take a look at that provision that was in 841(b)(1)?
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,847.255,849.318,"--Are you looking, Justice Ginsburg, at the 1988 version of the statute?"
2007.06-11429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,849.318,849.91,Yes.
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,849.91,851.441,"No, because--"
2007.06-11429,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,851.441,853.299,--Where would we find this?
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,853.299,855.688,"--Oh, this is at 13a of the blue brief, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-11429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,877.664,880.117,But read... read the end of it.
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,885.489,886.427,--Right.
2007.06-11429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,900.264,900.952,"Well, what--"
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,900.952,902.888,--because there isn't the explicit classification requirement.
2007.06-11429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,902.888,905.56,--But it defines what the felony is:
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,915.712,918.351,"Well, I think the latter language, Justice Ginsburg, is defining--"
2007.06-11429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,918.351,919.163,Why would you need to look--
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,919.163,928.082,"--""drug offense"", whereas the word ""felony"" I think is not a self-defining term in that statute as it's written."
2007.06-11429,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,936.125,947.198,I don't... the definitional section contradicts... contradicts what's in (b)(1)(A).
2007.06-11429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,947.198,948.667,--Yes.
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,948.667,949.432,As of 1988?
2007.06-11429,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.432,949.854,Yes.
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,959.553,960.693,"Well, it says"
2007.06-11429,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,968.644,969.128,Which is
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,984.215,985.823,"That's right, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-11429,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,985.823,989.713,"So you have to say that there ""felony"" stands on its own, right?"
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,989.713,1001.067,"Well, I guess you could, but then you wouldn't have a definition; then you'd have to figure out how to define ""felony"", whether it was a classification or a one-year rule or something else."
2007.06-11429,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1011.221,1031.383,"Is the following true, that if you are right the reason Congress passed this new definition was it wanted to take those handful of States which have felonies as a year, the ones Justice Alito is talking about, and make clear that they are not covered?"
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1031.383,1031.977,--Yes.
2007.06-11429,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1031.977,1032.961,All right.
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1060.418,1067.072,"Well, we don't disagree with the government that the one-year rule does serve the purpose of helping iron out--"
2007.06-11429,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1067.072,1082.69,"No, it doesn't, because if you're right, then you first have to look to the patchwork quilt of laws in all the different States to see whether those different States define the conduct as misdemeanors or felonies."
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1109.679,1117.457,"--Well, I think, Justice Breyer, with due respect, if you look at the way different States treat drug crimes--"
2007.06-11429,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1117.457,1118.253,Am I right?
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1123.924,1139.482,"--That's what I'm trying to respond... different States treat drug crimes dramatically different, and this is so... I think it's common sense that States treat different crimes... treat... different States punish the same crime differently."
2007.06-11429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1216.964,1219.432,"Mr. Fisher, could I just go back to what you quoted."
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1222.509,1222.978,--Yes.
2007.06-11429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1222.978,1223.837,Not a statute.
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1223.837,1231.411,"Yes, I'm quoting the Sentencing Guideline, although in the Armed Career Criminal Act you can find another place where Congress dealt with this problem explicitly."
2007.06-11429,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.095,1249.529,"You think... you think it would mean something different if you just left out the ""regardless of"" clause?"
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1249.529,1251.248,"Well, Justice Scalia, with the problem--"
2007.06-11429,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.248,1252.043,The
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1259.463,1260.931,"--Not necessarily, but leaving that clause--"
2007.06-11429,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1260.931,1261.431,Not at all?
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1262.728,1270.319,"--Well, our position is, Justice Scalia, that, standing alone, I will grant you; but the problem as we see it in this case is that that is left out."
2007.06-11429,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1280.425,1290.42,"I would say that ""regardless"" clause is extraordinary and I would not want to have to deal with such prolix statutes on a regular basis."
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1290.42,1297.809,"--Well, I think there's a good reason why Congress put it in, and that's because it is a continually vexing problem, how to define what is a felony."
2007.06-11429,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1318.597,1325.671,"If it's such a vexing problem, why would Congress have incorporated the problem into the definition of ""felony drug offense""?"
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1325.671,1328.888,"Well, I'm not sure I follow the question."
2007.06-11429,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1328.888,1334.215,"Well, you seem to suggest that it's a vexing problem that ""felony"" is defined differently in different States."
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1356.488,1364.781,"Well, with all due respect, what Congress did is they left 802(13) on the books, which does turn on classifications."
2007.06-11429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1374.901,1378.728,"But, of course, they had to leave it on the books because they need a definition of ""felony""."
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1390.334,1393.55,"Well, again, Justice Ginsburg, I think that is right."
2007.06-11429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1476.454,1479.328,Can you tell me what happened in South Carolina?
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1487.121,1492.791,"Mr. Burgess's crime, possession of cocaine, was punishable by up to two years."
2007.06-11429,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1495.759,1498.617,"But he, himself, was eligible for the--"
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1498.617,1499.898,Yes.
2007.06-11429,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1536.977,1537.399,--Just one.
2007.06-11429,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1553.485,1553.86,No.
2007.06-11429,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1578.381,1578.834,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-11429,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1587.377,1600.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress answered the question presented in this case when it adopted an express definition for ""felony drug offense""."
2007.06-11429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1628.813,1632.313,"Is ""drug"" a nested term in that?"
2007.06-11429,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1635.734,1644.17,"Well, the term ""felony drug offense"", the ""drug"" component we understand to be the component that says ""an offense"" that prohibits..."
2007.06-11429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1651.9,1657.21,"Is there a place you would... is that a place you would look if you didn't know what they meant by ""drug""?"
2007.06-11429,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1662.895,1668.58,--There is a definition of 802.
2007.06-11429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1673.141,1676.187,"So that is nested in this definition, ""felony drug offense""?"
2007.06-11429,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1676.187,1680.67,"--The term ""felony drug offense"" has only the meaning that Congress gave to it."
2007.06-11429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1762.06,1779.318,"What do you do with your friend's argument that the classification... or the term, more than one year or less than one year, doesn't always have to do with how serious they view the offense, but they may impose a sentence of more than one year to allow time for rehabilitation?"
2007.06-11429,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1779.318,1782.332,"Congress chose the words that it did,"
2007.06-11429,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1843.011,1851.226,"Well, I suppose it might for countries that use that classification, for common law countries."
2007.06-11429,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1851.226,1854.319,There are countries that do use the felony-misdemeanor distinction.
2007.06-11429,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1876.31,1890.224,The... the information we have in the brief says that there are two States that have dropped those labels.
2007.06-11429,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1890.881,1893.489,New Jersey and Maine are the only ones that I'm aware of.
2007.06-11429,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1989.467,1991.809,Could you tell us just a little bit about the rule of lenity?
2007.06-11429,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2000.525,2001.541,The government--
2007.06-11429,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2001.541,2009.475,After we said in Granderson the rule of lenity applies without qualifying or modifying it at all.
2007.06-11429,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2009.475,2017.191,--The government's position is that the rule of lenity operates in the same manner in both the defining the offense context and in the sentencing context.
2007.06-11429,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2074.637,2077.01,"Thank you, Ms. Saharsky."
2007.06-11429,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2079.009,2082.804,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-11429,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2102.876,2104.327,"Well, but there has to be a real ambiguity."
2007.06-11429,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2110.403,2124.195,"--I think, Justice Kennedy, a fair way to ask yourself the question is, would the statute here rise to the level of a plain statement of a kind that is required to, for example, abrogate sovereign immunity or to realign the Federal State balance."
2007.06-11429,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2129.162,2132.348,"How many statutes exist like that, my goodness?"
2007.06-11429,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2142.766,2146.232,"--With all due respect, Justice Scalia, that's what the historical cases say."
2007.06-11429,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2146.232,2147.466,--That's what the rule of lenity means.
2007.06-11429,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2147.466,2147.763,Yes.
2007.06-11429,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2178.61,2182.047,Do our cases reflect what you're saying?
2007.06-11429,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2189.825,2209.941,"Well, I think this is very important, Justice Scalia, your cases, especially the historical cases and the modern ones, I think, waffle in different directions, but there are plenty of cases from this Court that are much more than a tie-breaker in the sense of the rule of lenity and say, we require clear and definite terms, that's the phrase Justice Frankfurter used to repeat."
2007.06-11429,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2214.72,2220.248,That was in a context where the question was whether or not the conduct was criminal at all not since.
2007.06-11429,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2220.248,2220.951,--That's right.
2007.06-11429,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2221.826,2231.449,"If you apply clear statement rule to the sentencing code, I don't think we are going to be able to get beyond the second sentence."
2007.06-11429,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2231.449,2238.65,"--Well, I think with due respect what you're going to do is actually reduce the number of cases this court hears, because once you have a clear statement rule, two things are going to happen."
2007.06-11429,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2314.026,2315.385,"Thank you, Mr. Fisher."
