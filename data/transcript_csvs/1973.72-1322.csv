1973.72-1322,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,43.101,47.566,"Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1973.72-1322,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,524.581,536.335,"Mr. Coleman, I realize you’re not relying exclusively on the 1972 Act by any means."
1973.72-1322,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,549.612,550.827,"Well, it never would’ve existed."
1973.72-1322,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,570.367,577.369,"So by the fortuitous circumstance that the final order is not entered, at least you have an additional ground for your position?"
1973.72-1322,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,577.369,586.64,"I wouldn’t use the word “fortuitous,” I say by the correct and saying that Congress did that that is an additional ground."
1973.72-1322,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,587.154,594.245,Is the statute capable of being applied to services rendered after its effective date?
1973.72-1322,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,602.983,603.583,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,667.854,669.764,"That’s a historic rule, isn’t it?"
1973.72-1322,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,669.764,669.877,That’s --
1973.72-1322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,669.877,672.569,That it is in the law applied to the case depending on the appeal --
1973.72-1322,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,672.569,674.407,That’s right.
1973.72-1322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.319,676.285,"Normally, that’s the rule --"
1973.72-1322,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,676.285,678.483,"Normally, that’s the rule."
1973.72-1322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.828,693.724,"Let’s assume, Mr. Coleman, there was a statute that permitted the awarding of 5% attorney’s fees or it had some standard in it that applied to the litigation as it was going on."
1973.72-1322,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,707.331,711.268,"Well, I would say that in the hypothetical you gave, Your Honor, yes."
1973.72-1322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,719.468,721.912,"Well, that’s a fortiori in your case, I guess."
1973.72-1322,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,721.912,722.203,Sure.
1973.72-1322,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,896.102,897.951,That’s Piggie Park --
1973.72-1322,0,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,897.951,902.642,"Piggie Park, there’s the Lee case in the Fifth Circuit."
1973.72-1322,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1114.119,1116.139,"Thank you, Mr. Coleman."
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,1119.919,1123.753,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1322,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1753.056,1753.861,Mr. Little.
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,1753.861,1754.155,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1322,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1754.155,1755.422,I’m not sure that I understood.
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,1761.42,1761.866,"In five circuits, sir --"
1973.72-1322,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1761.866,1768.468,"-- as far as 1972, allowing attorney’s fees in the school desegregation?"
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,1768.468,1774.282,"There had been any number of decisions allowing them sir, but always on the standard of what has been referred to as the conditional --"
1973.72-1322,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1774.282,1775.323,Obdurate obstinacy.
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,1775.323,1776.167,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1322,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1776.167,1776.34,Always.
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,1776.34,1795.37,"Without exception -- with the exception of the District Court in this case, no court in this country at the Circuit Court level or at the District Court level has ever made an award against the School Board other than on the obdurate obstinacy test, that is for services rendered pre-Swan."
1973.72-1322,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1795.37,1798.094,And pre-the legislation of 1972?
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,1798.094,1798.57,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1322,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1802.242,1807.078,"And there had been numerous judgments allowing such fees on that basis, hadn’t there?"
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,1807.078,1808.683,"Yes, sir, but only solely on that basis --"
1973.72-1322,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1808.683,1809.32,I understand.
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,1809.32,1814.733,"Without exception, which is a unique thing to be able to say with that many courts involved in that amount of litigation."
1973.72-1322,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1814.733,1816.751,"How many circuits, four?"
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,1816.751,1820.143,"Five, sir, the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Ninth."
1973.72-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1820.143,1822.455,I guess it's the standard of the statute?
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,1822.455,1823.503,"No, sir."
1973.72-1322,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2105.994,2107.191,"Where are you reading, counsel?"
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,2107.191,2114.428,"I’m reading, sir, from our brief of what is in Appendix 85a, 85a of the Appendix, sir."
1973.72-1322,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2114.428,2115.059,Thank you.
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,2115.059,2121.524,"Now, this is what the judge thought below was about buying buses in August of 1970."
1973.72-1322,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2448.699,2449.424,Mr. Little.
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,2449.424,2449.5,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1322,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2449.5,2456.925,"If Congress changed the witness fee that’s recoverable as an element of cost, say, from $10 to $20."
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,2466.702,2467.06,"No, sir."
1973.72-1322,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2485.532,2493.888,"Well, isn’t there some analogy between increase in taxable costs and making attorney’s fees recoverable?"
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,2493.888,2503.277,"Sir, I think that the way the analogy has to be the Section 718, what is it in that that gives rise to an attorney’s fees?"
1973.72-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2592.806,2595.97,"Well, this case was pending prior to the statute."
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,2595.97,2608.297,"No order -- the Fourth Circuit draws a distinction, Mr. Justice White, between there was no order compliance pending at the date this Act became effective because the last order --"
1973.72-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2608.297,2613.172,"At the time Act was passed, at the time it had -- let’s assume the Act was never been passed."
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,2613.172,2614.748,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2614.748,2619.841,And then the case was in the posture that it was when this Act was passed.
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,2630.236,2632.75,"If the -- No, I’m not saying that, sir."
1973.72-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.79,2635.747,But it wasn’t too late for the attorneys to request their fees?
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,2635.747,2637.578,"No, they had requested that right at the outset."
1973.72-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2637.578,2641.996,"Then that would have been, it seems to me, the case must be considered as pending?"
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,2641.996,2644.798,"Pending on the issue of attorney’s fees, it was, sir."
1973.72-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2644.798,2650.742,"That this is an unresolved issue of the case, and the question is the applicable law?"
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,2650.742,2651.47,"Right, sir."
1973.72-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2654.6,2656.924,How do you answer Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question now?
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,2656.924,2663.449,"That I say you have to, under the rule of Peggy Schooner and Thorpe that you start with a presumption against retroactivity."
1973.72-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2663.449,2668.699,Do you rely on the Schooner Peggy for the so-called rule of presumption against retroactivity?
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,2668.699,2669.013,"No, sir."
1973.72-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.288,2695.277,The rule of prospective application that’s -- within the rule of prospective application is the application to pending cases?
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,2695.277,2697.223,"What -- may I have that again, sir, I’m sorry?"
1973.72-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2697.223,2705.995,"Well, did you think it’s a violation that the rule in favor, if there is such a rule, in favor of prospective application to apply to pending cases?"
1973.72-1322,1,25641,george_b_little,,2705.995,2722.039,"No, sir, but I find this. I don’t -- I find it difficult to believe that, in Thorpe, this case intended to modify the normal rule of prospective application without even referring to the rule. I have great difficulty there."
1973.72-1322,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2877.9,2878.672,"Thank you, Mr. Little."
1973.72-1322,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2880.33,2884.541,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, Your Honor."
1973.72-1322,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2896.99,2898.278,"Used what rule, Mr. Coleman?"
1973.72-1322,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2898.278,2901.271,The obdurate obstinacy rule.
1973.72-1322,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2984.621,2999.508,"Mr. Coleman, in your view, was this obdurate obstinacy before or after the statement that Judge Marriage made about the uncertainties and unpredictability of the whole --"
1973.72-1322,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,2999.508,3010.843,"Can I come to that because this is something that Mr. Little, who’s a very skillful advocate, have said and he successfully convinced the Fourth Circuit of this."
1973.72-1322,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3039.906,3052.634,"I was just directing my input, Mr. Coleman, to the Judge’s -- the trial judge’s appraisal of the problem and, necessarily, the attitudes --"
1973.72-1322,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3052.634,3067.057,"He first indicated that because, since by 1968 anyone that could read or write knew that the Richmond School Board was violating the constitution and nobody did anything, these litigants were forced to come into court."
1973.72-1322,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3069.832,3075.08,Are you saying that his remarks were directed at the details of remedy --
1973.72-1322,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3075.08,3075.254,That’s right.
1973.72-1322,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3075.254,3077.609,-- and not at the fundamental complaint?
1973.72-1322,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3077.609,3078.875,"Sure, they had to do something."
1973.72-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3190.627,3192.33,Unless you got something that we assume?
1973.72-1322,2,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,3192.33,3192.885,"Well, that’s right."
1973.72-1322,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3289.143,3290.023,"Thank you, Mr. Coleman."
