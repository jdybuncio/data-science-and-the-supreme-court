2006.05-1240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,2.484,We'll hear argument--
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,7.263,12.137,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1240,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,98.101,101.975,"Mr. Flaxman, one starting point."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,116.328,121.156,"Well, that was one view of the core problem."
2006.05-1240,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,121.156,128.433,But at least this case involves no such concern about habeas.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,128.433,129.261,That's correct.
2006.05-1240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,155.312,174.617,"But only if, only if the challenged evidence, the challenge to the evidence, if sustained, would necessarily... and this is the crucial language... invalidate the criminal conviction."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,174.617,179.163,"That's what would have happened in this case, as the dissenting judge in the petition for rehearing--"
2006.05-1240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.163,180.787,Would necessarily have?
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,183.052,184.082,--Absolutely.
2006.05-1240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,188.628,191.548,You don't know what other evidence there might have been in the criminal case.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,193.219,196.092,--You do know because it's disclosed in discovery.
2006.05-1240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,201.919,204.48,"Well, but he did not know that for years later."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,210.556,213.18,"--Well, there is no statute of limitations for murder in Illinois."
2006.05-1240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,213.18,214.367,"Well, then they can wait a long time."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,217.678,227.298,"If he's incarcerated that whole time awaiting the filing of charges, then his cause of action would not have accrued."
2006.05-1240,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,230.532,242.058,"Well, is that... I mean, your friend on the other side says that the cause of action would have accrued at the moment at which he was bound over by the decision of an independent magistrate."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,272.061,278.466,"--If the claim was solely directed at the arrest, then Your Honor would be absolutely correct."
2006.05-1240,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,300.582,323.385,"But all of that occurred, as I... correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, but I thought all of that occurred prior to... I don't know what they call it in Illinois, but prior to a bind-over hearing or prior to the point at which the judiciary steps in, breaking the, as it were, the chain of causation between what the police do and the subsequent incarceration."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,323.385,328.039,"Under Malley versus Briggs, it doesn't break the chain of causation if we adhere--"
2006.05-1240,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,328.039,343.018,"No, but just as a factual matter is it correct... is it correct as a factual matter that the confession that was given was a confession that was given before there was any judicial intervention, before he was brought before a magistrate?"
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,343.018,343.721,--That's correct.
2006.05-1240,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,343.721,344.049,Okay.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,344.049,355.856,There was no other evidence presented to the magistrate or that could have been presented to the magistrate other than the confession to show--
2006.05-1240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,355.856,366.117,"Well, Mr. Flaxman, is your argument limited to that situation, where there is no evidence whatsoever against the criminal defendant other than the illegally seized evidence?"
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,369.163,376.708,"--If there's some additional evidence, we could not say was necessarily... would necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction."
2006.05-1240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,380.799,388.843,"Any additional evidence, even if it would be insufficient to support a conviction, takes... makes make this... would make this a different case."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,388.843,391.389,"I would not say... well, it would make it a different case."
2006.05-1240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,407.366,408.772,"What, what does necessarily mean?"
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,419.72,443.289,"What I think it means is that there's no conviction... what I think it should mean... and I'm not trying to debate the dictionary, what I think it should mean is that if there is no evidence other than after... that is excluded, to base a prosecution on, as in this case where the man is let go, because there is no evidence to prosecute him, that that does imply the invalidity of the conviction."
2006.05-1240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,443.289,445.664,"Well, in this case, let me just me more question on it."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,469.452,469.762,No.
2006.05-1240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,486.897,499.767,"Again, you didn't, you didn't know that at the time the arrest was made, or at the time the confession was extorted, or at the time he was bound over."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,514.15,518.556,"Well, that would have been very unfair if they withheld... they ambushed the defendant with--"
2006.05-1240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,518.556,520.086,"No, well... until the trial--"
2006.05-1240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.086,523.491,"Until the trial, until the process of trial began."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,523.491,529.348,"--Well, we didn't know that because there weren't any, because this man didn't commit that crime."
2006.05-1240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,545.139,550.949,"But, but you presume in your last answer that other than that, there is an absolutely fair prosecution."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,550.949,552.371,--Other than the fact--
2006.05-1240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,552.371,560.085,"I mean, why do we make that assumption when we start out with the allegation of a tort and a violation of the Constitution?"
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,560.976,569.035,"--Well, the tort is against the police officers who made an unlawful arrest and exploited it to get the evidence that was used to hold Mr. Wallace."
2006.05-1240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,586.779,592.916,"What about the fact... suppose that there were even a more serious battery here, a broken limb or something."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,599.382,600.116,No.
2006.05-1240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,608.425,609.394,"--Well, what about this case?"
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,609.394,612.768,This case would necessarily impair the validity of the conviction.
2006.05-1240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.439,621.531,But the conviction in Heck existed at the time of the alleged tort.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,653.955,666.466,"--Well, you had to wait because it would... it would be a fruitless act to file the case while the case... file a Federal case while the state criminal case was pending."
2006.05-1240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,666.965,669.587,"I'm still, I'm still puzzled about my question."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,674.805,676.617,--That claim would--
2006.05-1240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,676.617,677.663,But there's other evidence and so forth.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,679.927,682.427,--You can sue and you have to sue for the battery immediately.
2006.05-1240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,682.427,684.753,Why is that the situation?
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,684.753,685.722,Why is that different?
2006.05-1240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,687.315,694.141,And... or is it just because of the assumption that the conviction might stand anyway.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,694.141,700.029,--Well the conviction generally does stand with... the battery generally has nothing to with the conviction.
2006.05-1240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,700.029,701.717,"But if does, then you wait?"
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,701.717,704.043,"If it is an element of the offense, you wait."
2006.05-1240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,728.564,734.203,"But the point, the whole point of Heck was to avoid 1983 becoming an end run around habeas."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,740.325,747.792,"--Well, we don't know before the criminal case starts whether Mr. Wallace will receive a full and fair hearing on his Fourth Amendment claim."
2006.05-1240,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,768.314,772.968,Are there many cases in which the rule of Stone versus Powell is inapplicable for that reason?
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,772.968,775.328,--No.
2006.05-1240,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,780.715,783.574,What happens... I'm trying to think of what the problem is for you.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,825.542,828.884,The civil trial will be stayed pending the--
2006.05-1240,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,828.884,830.618,"That would work, I guess."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,840.254,844.282,--It would be on the district court's docket for ten years waiting the final--
2006.05-1240,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,844.282,844.923,But that would work.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,844.923,848.953,"--It would, well, it would be a horrible--"
2006.05-1240,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,848.953,850.468,A mess.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,850.468,852.53,--a horrible mess for the district court.
2006.05-1240,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,854.64,855.716,Suppose I modify it.
2006.05-1240,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,855.716,857.06,Why would it be a mess?
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,892.952,900.058,"--Well, the district judge will not allow a civil case to go forward because it would allow the criminal defendant--"
2006.05-1240,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,900.058,901.698,That's the premise of my question.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,906.118,916.208,"--Well, I mean, I, I shudder to think of 20,000 cases on district court dockets being stayed while criminal cases are being resolved."
2006.05-1240,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,916.208,917.567,"20,000 might make me shudder."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,919.675,920.769,We have one.
2006.05-1240,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,930.624,930.967,Well... explain that.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,930.967,932.482,It will impeach his bias.
2006.05-1240,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,945.744,959.659,"And don't you think that a civil action which necessarily has to be stayed, might be a basis for, for the court in the criminal case to limit that kind of cross-examination?"
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,959.659,962.094,--Not in the Circuit Court of Cook County.
2006.05-1240,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,965.531,968.359,Are there appeals from the Circuit Court of Cook County?
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,968.359,968.874,--There are appeals and.
2006.05-1240,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,968.874,972.373,"Okay, don't you... don't you think ultimately you could get that issue resolved?"
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,972.373,973.201,No.
2006.05-1240,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,979.729,980.494,Come... come back here.
2006.05-1240,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,981.448,984.822,Suppose it is complicated.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1040.767,1043.173,"Well, I have four answers."
2006.05-1240,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1058.854,1059.979,"All right, well, we could do it in this case."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1059.979,1062.945,"Well, I, I... the Court certainly can do it."
2006.05-1240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1069.1,1073.597,"Yeah, it would require overruling our cases that say for tolling, your borrow state law--"
2006.05-1240,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1073.597,1075.629,What cases require overruling?
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1075.629,1081.048,"--Unless state law is inconsistent with Federal Board of Regents versus Tomiano, I think the Court could say that."
2006.05-1240,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1097.838,1102.774,"Well, it seems to me identical to the rule you are advocating but with one difference."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1123.546,1124.233,--I think--
2006.05-1240,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1124.233,1125.077,There is no way to guess that.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1125.077,1138.509,"--I think tolling, a Federal tolling rule for this cause of action, while someone in custody although a criminal conviction is, has not been resolved in favor of the defendant, criminal defendant, would be an excellent solution."
2006.05-1240,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1138.509,1141.32,And is there anything that you are aware of that it would be contrary to?
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1151.847,1162.328,"No, I think the Court could say without overruling anything that there, in this the state law does not fully reflect or protect the Federal rights at stake here."
2006.05-1240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1162.328,1169.09,"--So then you deny the officers the purpose you have for the reason you have statutes of limitation, which is repose."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1176.026,1183.32,"Well, but the officers will also get the benefit of not being sued if there is a conviction based on the charge for which the person was arrested."
2006.05-1240,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1196.345,1211.62,I thought the Seventh Circuit said in... quickly in passing that the damages would run only from the time of the allegedly unlawful arrest until the time of arraignment.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1222.71,1230.971,"That's the Seventh Circuit's view about what the cause of action is, which goes back to what is the cause of action and when does it accrue?"
2006.05-1240,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1251.12,1253.79,You asked us to take that case and we didn't.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1253.79,1263.928,"Well, I asked you to consider damages but I think... as a question of damages, and there are many issues related to damages that would have been presented in question to--"
2006.05-1240,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1263.928,1274.594,"But if that's the boundaries of the false arrest claim, then why does one happen later matter?"
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1274.594,1285.387,"--Well, the common law false arrest claim would allow damages up until the time you were released from the imprisonment, which is not at the time of--"
2006.05-1240,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1285.387,1286.902,Even on the basis of innocence?
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1286.902,1289.806,--Not for a false arrest.
2006.05-1240,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1292.322,1305.223,The common law would give damages in a case like this in which the release was basically governed by a suppression which has nothing to do one way or the other with the innocence of that person?
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1305.223,1305.426,--That's correct.
2006.05-1240,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1334.039,1341.677,--What does somebody like Mr. Wallace do under your rule if he's in a jurisdiction where there's not a lot of discovery in criminal cases.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1348.393,1360.45,"But he's not going to file his civil rights claim until his criminal case is over, because he knows and his lawyer will tell him, that's going to hurt you in winning the criminal case, and you should be concerned about that."
2006.05-1240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1360.45,1367.635,"But he's never going to know, in the case where there's no statute of limitations, he's never going to know when his criminal case is going to be over because he may never know when it's going to start."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1367.635,1375.46,"Well, if Mr. Wallace had been arrested and released, he would have had two years from when he was released to bring a civil rights action, that being false imprisonment--"
2006.05-1240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1375.46,1383.473,So what happens if he files a suit after one year and then after one year and 350 days he's prosecuted?

2006.05-1240,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1405.526,1412.055,"So his action accrued and maybe it's even over, but then it turns out when they bring the prosecution, it should have never have been brought because it never accrued."
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1412.055,1413.977,"--No, I think he would have two actions."

2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1454.491,1458.286,A Federal tolling rule would solve these problems.

2006.05-1240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1478.792,1481.386,Suppose that they had beat him up two or three times.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1488.773,1499.66,"If the beating up is... if the beating up is related to, used to extort a confession and the confession is used against him, then there would be a cause of action when the confession is used."
2006.05-1240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1499.66,1501.004,So there would be two causes of action?
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1501.004,1502.815,"Multiple causes, yes."
2006.05-1240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1503.783,1505.658,Would he have to sue on the first one right away?

2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1543.377,1553.123,"But criminal cases are not commenced many, many years after the unlawful arrest, as a practical matter."
2006.05-1240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1553.123,1555.935,And two years doesn't seem to be unheard of.
2006.05-1240,0,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,1555.935,1559.713,"Well, if we're talking about complicated financial crimes, that's not unusual."
2006.05-1240,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.713,1561.432,You're willing to let those people go?

2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1580.502,1585.5,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1621.845,1630.842,"May I ask, just to get it straight at the beginning, what if the claim includes a Fifth Amendment claim for extorting a conviction and it's mixed up with a Fourth Amendment claim?"
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1631.686,1644.976,"--I believe that the rule for the Fifth Amendment claim, I believe the Court's view in Chavez is that a coerced confession claim has as an element of the claim, the use of that claim at trial."
2006.05-1240,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1654.051,1657.284,What about the beating of the defendant?
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1657.284,1657.94,--Exactly.
2006.05-1240,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1695.206,1714.995,"Miss Solomon, do I gather from your response to Justice Stevens about the Fifth Amendment claim, that under Chavez it wouldn't accrue until it is used at trial, is this case therefore a pleading slip on petitioner's part?"
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1729.645,1733.909,--He brought two claims in his criminal case.
2006.05-1240,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1754.588,1765.928,"That's a puzzling feature of it, too, because I thought at the end the second time around, the Court of Appeals held that the confession was no good."
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1765.928,1779.657,The Illinois Appellate Court overturned the conviction on the basis that it was obtained through use of a confession in violation of the Fourth Amendment only.
2006.05-1240,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1837.929,1858.282,"But if the Fifth Amendment claim were before us, do I understand you to have said before that the Fourth Amendment claim of false arrest would also be subject to litigation as part of the Fifth Amendment claim or under the umbrella of the Fifth Amendment claim, so that the statute would not have run on that?"
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1858.282,1859.139,I'm sorry.
2006.05-1240,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1879.662,1885.238,"Well then, my question is going to be along the same lines."
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1900.059,1907.636,Because the rule of accrual is that the act... the claim accrues when the plaintiff experiences an injury.
2006.05-1240,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1907.636,1909.776,"Well, we're making up the rule of accrual, Ms. Solomon."
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1912.119,1918.758,"Well, with respect, Justice Kennedy, I don't believe the Court is making up a rule of accrual."
2006.05-1240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1939.53,1942.545,Who is the defendant in a Fifth Amendment claim?
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1952.946,1956.71,"--Well, the prosecutor would be absolutely immune, of course."
2006.05-1240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.71,1956.976,Right.
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,1956.976,1959.366,And some of those cases are brought against the police officers.
2006.05-1240,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1990.618,1998.257,"But if he had also brought a Fifth Amendment claim, your view as I take it would be as follows:"
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2008.861,2009.689,That's correct.
2006.05-1240,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2009.689,2026.479,"Number two, I'm assuming, and this is what I want you to tell me whether my assumption is right... I am assuming that if a Fifth Amendment claim were brought by... no, strike the assumption."
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2050.094,2057.638,"We do... our position is that they do occur when they happen and they must be filed within the limitations, yes."
2006.05-1240,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2057.638,2066.822,"But you would agree that the court, if there's a criminal case going on, I take it you would agree that the court should not proceed to trial in the 1983 action."
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2066.822,2073.507,"If there is a Fourth Amendment claim being raised in the criminal case, and of course, it might not be, but that is a very easy--"
2006.05-1240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.507,2074.554,But that's the problem.
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2156.551,2157.66,"--Justice Breyer, that is correct."
2006.05-1240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2157.66,2157.91,All right.
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2192.864,2197.425,"I think those are essentially the two choices, with one caveat."
2006.05-1240,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2263.601,2275.048,"I suppose... correct me if I'm wrong... when the district court wants to determine if he should hold something in abeyance, this is not necessarily abstention; this is what courts always do when there are multiple actions."
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2279.781,2282.187,"That's exactly right, Justice Kennedy, and it's also--"
2006.05-1240,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2282.187,2286.045,"I suppose it would make a difference to the officers, a principle of equitable tolling."
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2297.697,2303.242,"--That is the second major advantage that we see to our rule, Chief Justice Roberts."
2006.05-1240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2303.242,2306.147,"If you do it with a stay, I mean, I see that disadvantage."
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2340.414,2347.317,"Accepting your earlier construct where there really are essentially two rules, we either delay accrual or we--"
2006.05-1240,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2347.317,2358.547,"--If you delay accrual by tolling, you do have the disadvantage that in some instances the policemen won't know for quite a while whether the case is being brought."
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2383.944,2397.156,"--The rule that we propose, which is immediate accrual coupled with a stay of some sort if the Fourth Amendment claim is being actively litigated in the state court at that time, has two advantages."
2006.05-1240,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2440.187,2446.839,They're not going to waste a lot of time figuring out whether to grant a stay or not when you have a criminal prosecution pending in state court.
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2467.362,2470.314,"--Well, that's correct, Your Honor, and we wouldn't have any objection to a rule that--"
2006.05-1240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2470.314,2472.813,But isn't there this practical problem?
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2490.977,2496.507,"--I think the assumption, Your Honor, should be that the number of cases is going to be the same either way."
2006.05-1240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2499.474,2508.408,"Well, if your opponent's rule is adopted, they wouldn't file unless... if they get convicted and the conviction stands up, the case would never be filed."
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2508.408,2526.837,"--Well, it's curious that they make that argument, because of course every victim of a Fourth Amendment violation has the right to damages for at least the invasion of their privacy, for the antecedent conduct between the time of arrest and charging."
2006.05-1240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.755,2551.139,"The thing I just want you to comment on is, my thought is every person arrested has a potential, and something follows and so forth, has a potential Fourth Amendment claim, even though he may not have one on the merits."
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2569.274,2577.129,"With respect, Your Honor, we'll take that chance for the benefits that the statute of limitations does bring to the officer."
2006.05-1240,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2616.379,2626.391,"I had missed Mr. Flaxman's point that this would an advantage to the prosecutor to say, aren't you going to make a lot of money about this case?"
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2650.444,2652.615,It may be not in a--
2006.05-1240,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2652.615,2658.347,But he has tried more of these cases than I have and he indicates this is a serious concern.
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2658.347,2663.595,"--He has tried way more of them than I have as well, and I can't speak to that specifically."
2006.05-1240,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2676.027,2676.261,"No, no."
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2677.87,2678.104,--Yes.
2006.05-1240,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2689.35,2699.439,"No, but he says the fact of the complaint the prosecutor's going to use in order to show that they're trying to profit from a false claim of a beating."
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2699.439,2707.889,"Well, but as I indicated, every victim of a Fourth Amendment rights, even those who are guilty, even those who are convicted... that's the Herring case."
2006.05-1240,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2710.465,2715.947,"No, but the point is if the complaint is filed then the prosecution can makes that point."
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2715.947,2725.585,"--I would imagine that it would cut both ways in many cases, Your Honor."
2006.05-1240,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2728.146,2736.55,Does your position in this case leave any reason at all for equitable tolling?
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2736.55,2738.159,"It does, Your Honor, absolutely."
2006.05-1240,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2832.244,2849.331,"Is there any remedy that Illinois law provides for a case like this where a person spends, what was it, eight years in prison and is ultimately released because the state never had enough evidence to try him in the first place?"
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2849.331,2855.5,"In many cases, the state law of malicious prosecution will provide a remedy."

2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2941.514,2947.041,"Well, in our experience the district courts don't tend to want to go ahead."
2006.05-1240,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2962.379,2968.096,"We haven't written about that other than in Heck explicitly and implicitly, and in Younger?"
2006.05-1240,1,18072,benna_ruth_solomon,,2968.564,2971.61,--In Heck and in Younger.

2006.05-1240,2,33817,kenneth_n_flaxman,,3414.633,3415.617,--Well--
2006.05-1240,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3415.617,3418.273,We're just throwing up our hands and saying there is statute of limitations statute of limitations.
