1992.91-2024,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,15.972,19.275,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-2024,1,30846,john_w_hoefling,,1641.251,1648.786,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-2024,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1754.976,1760.76,"Well, what policy of the district was it that Paster Steigerwald said he couldn't or wouldn't abide?"
1992.91-2024,1,30846,john_w_hoefling,,1760.76,1763.041,"It was... it was number 7, Your Honor."
1992.91-2024,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1763.041,1764.962,"Well, you don't have... I mean just state it generally."
1992.91-2024,1,30846,john_w_hoefling,,1766.865,1777.749,"Your Honor, the... the policy of the school district with regard to this particular use was that the premises would not be used for religious purposes."
1992.91-2024,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.749,1783.924,And that meant any sort of a presentation that had a religious connotation to it.
1992.91-2024,1,30846,john_w_hoefling,,1783.924,1813.113,"We submit, Your Honor, that that, as... as the school district has used that policy, means that to the extent somebody... someone is prepared to come forward and use the facilities for the purpose of proselytization or urging somebody to adopt a particular lifestyle which is based upon certain religious precepts, is an... an inappropriate use in our forum."
1992.91-2024,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1813.113,1821.31,"Well, would the policy permit someone to come in and urge the adoption of a particular lifestyle that was not based on any religious precepts?"
1992.91-2024,1,30846,john_w_hoefling,,1821.31,1821.438,"Yes, it would, Your Honor."
1992.91-2024,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.438,1835.84,"So you would allow lifestyle presentations, lifestyle proselytizing, so to... so to speak, of a secular nature, secularly inspired but not religiously inspired."
1992.91-2024,1,30846,john_w_hoefling,,1835.84,1836.679,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1992.91-2024,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1836.679,1839.381,You think that's consistent with our opinion in Widmar?
1992.91-2024,1,30846,john_w_hoefling,,1839.381,1840.582,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1992.91-2024,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.116,1867.018,But it seems to me what you're saying is that you have an open forum except for any religious viewpoint.
1992.91-2024,1,30846,john_w_hoefling,,1867.018,1882.209,"--No, Your Honor, I respectfully submit that what we've done in this case is establish certain specific uses to which the facility may be put and certain uses to which the facility is... is not allowed to be put."
1992.91-2024,2,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3490.38,3491.862,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-2024,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3541.134,3554.133,"Do you think... that all... that the only exclusion with respect to religion was religious ceremonies, actually religious services?"
1992.91-2024,2,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3554.133,3557.456,"In the context, Justice White, of this existing policy?"
1992.91-2024,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3557.456,3558.394,Yes.
1992.91-2024,2,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3558.394,3568.792,"I think it's the same argument, because a religious service does have a religious perspective, especially if the sermon is addressing the family issues that were... that... in the debate, so to speak."
1992.91-2024,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3581.86,3584.423,"Well, what if it wasn't a sermon about family values?"
1992.91-2024,2,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3584.423,3585.232,--I--
1992.91-2024,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3585.232,3594.268,"What if it was a... what if the... what if the only thing that happened was that they read from the Bible, they read from the scriptures?"
1992.91-2024,2,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3594.268,3606.456,"--I believe in that case the... the biblical admonition, whatever it might be, is still a religious perspective and probably, based on views of the Bible that people hold, would be valid as to civic, social, and recreational use."
1992.91-2024,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3626.602,3628.034,"Thank you, Mr. Sekulow."
