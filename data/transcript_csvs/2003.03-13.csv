2003.03-13,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.802,"We'll hear argument next in 03-13, the Republic of Austria v. Maria Altmann."
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,70.672,73.523,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-13,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,100.477,103.244,What... why would it change the legal consequences?
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,107.414,111.046,"No, in fundamental terms it would change the legal consequences."
2003.03-13,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,132.488,140.478,"Did the Tate letter have any coverage prior to '76, the so-called Tate letter from the State Department?"
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,140.478,150.221,--The so-called Tate letter changed the State Department's position with respect to commercial activities as of 1952.
2003.03-13,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,202.279,217.633,"But I thought that... well, first, I think you recognize that this suit could be brought inside Austria, and then one of the countries that don't follow the... the absolute rule."
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,236.209,246.24,"With respect, Justice Ginsburg, the... this issue of the adoption of the restrictive theory by any country is really a red herring here."
2003.03-13,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,259.409,271.586,"But I... as I understand this claim, it's not the original ex parte... expropriation is when Austria isn't even a country, because this happened in the Nazi period, right?"
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,271.586,272.329,"No, Your Honor."
2003.03-13,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,287.319,288.638,Then why was there a second republic?
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,288.638,304.158,"--The second republic was the reconstituted government of the state of Austria, but the United States' position, and it is the executive's position that has binding authority with respect to the sovereign status, the executive's position was that Austria was always a state."
2003.03-13,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,305.167,325.418,"But may I continue, because I thought that this claim, whatever you say about Austria's status in the, at the time of the Anschluss, that it's not necessarily about the stealing of the goods, it's about the retention of the goods."
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,325.418,329.587,--We don't believe that that's a correct reading of section 1603... 1605(a)(3).
2003.03-13,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,365.253,372.025,"So if you know that you've taken from an expropriator, that's all right under international law?"
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,372.025,373.798,It's not a question of whether it's all right.
2003.03-13,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.541,395.103,Is it sovereign immunity or is it the act of state doctrine?
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,395.103,396.422,"It's sovereign immunity, Your Honor."
2003.03-13,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.422,403.581,"Well, but, I mean, even... there... there are two things that happen here."
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,429.26,430.625,This Court determined--
2003.03-13,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,430.625,438.798,"So I... I wish you could tell me that it did have to do with the act of state doctrine, because that would be... that would be a substantive change and that should not be retroactive."
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,438.798,444.947,--The... the active state doctrine is an independent doctrine that is not before the Court today.
2003.03-13,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.303,514.133,"Well, in Hughes... in Hughes there were... there were other changes besides the... besides the jurisdictional one."
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,546.25,562.513,"The interest of the United States, Your Honor, in the... the administration of cases against foreign sovereigns has long been recognized by this Court as being a... a matter of great national interest."
2003.03-13,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,594.425,595.418,But none of that's in question.
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,595.418,596.056,--very narrow exceptions to the doctrine.
2003.03-13,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,596.056,596.244,None of that's in question.
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,612.757,613.5,And it--
2003.03-13,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.5,618.907,We're... we're not questioning the authority of the executive or the authority of the legislature or the importance of this matter.
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,623.736,641.902,"--And Congress in this Court has clearly articulated in... in Landgraf and in the... the several cases that followed it, exactly how we determined what it was that Congress did as it relates to the retroactive aspects of those changes in law."
2003.03-13,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,641.902,653.086,"And in... in our domestic jurisprudence, we are cautious about retroactivity because it destroys subtle expectations."
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,666.272,681.67,"We think when the issue of a concept of basic fairness so close to the root of our understanding of what constitutes fair treatment of any individual, that no less standard--"
2003.03-13,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,681.67,682.579,"Well, that's why--"
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,682.579,684.065,--no less rigorous standard than Landgraf should apply.
2003.03-13,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,684.065,686.294,--That leads to my... my next question.
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,716.759,741.568,"The expectation was that, based on the general concepts of international law and general concepts of comity, which are not just a question of whim or courtesy, but rather a question of fair treatment of one sovereign by another with the expectation that the sovereign who is declining jurisdiction would be fairly treated in the courts of other countries."
2003.03-13,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,741.568,760.515,"But still whether or not there would be immunity, Austria and all other countries knew, would be a later determination, so that the expectation they had was to that extent necessarily, it seems to me, diminished--"
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,760.515,761.258,The expect--
2003.03-13,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,761.258,761.796,--or qualified.
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,761.796,767.619,--Expectations are only one of a number of factors that the Court has referred to in Landgraf.
2003.03-13,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,767.619,770.098,So it's... so there are additional factors other than expect.
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,771.091,771.213,"Well, certainly."
2003.03-13,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,794.579,795.655,Let's just stick... stick with expectations--
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,795.655,796.11,--part of common sense--
2003.03-13,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,796.11,796.481,--for the moment.
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,839.456,841.313,--Our concepts of--
2003.03-13,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,841.313,842.466,"What expectation, you know?"
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,862.778,863.316,--Reliance--
2003.03-13,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,863.316,865.916,"I'm sueable here, but I'm not sueable in the United States."
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,866.743,872.892,--That kind of particularized reliance analysis has never been a part of this Court's retroactivity analysis.
2003.03-13,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,896.547,898.322,So you're... you're distinguishing reliance and expectation?
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,905.298,911.985,"--We are focused on the changed legal consequences, not the subjective intention of the party in any respect."
2003.03-13,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,911.985,924.123,"But is... do... do you articulate that in terms of the country's expectation, even though the country may not have relied upon that expectation when it acted?"
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,924.123,925.032,Not--
2003.03-13,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,925.032,925.775,Are you drawing that distinction?
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,925.775,926.684,--Not solely.
2003.03-13,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,944.889,975.066,"And the changed legal circumstance that I understand you're emphasizing here is that, at least prior to 1976, this particular possession of expropriated property, as well as the expropriation itself, would not have been cognizable in the court of any country unless possibly the country itself, which as an act of grace later, decided to... to make its own reparations."
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,980.267,981.26,--That's absolutely correct.
2003.03-13,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,981.26,981.715,Okay.
2003.03-13,0,41176,scott_p_cooper,,981.715,987.659,"If there are no further questions at this point, I'd like to reserve time."
2003.03-13,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,987.659,990.798,"Very well, Mr. McCoy... rather, Mr. Cooper."
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,992.822,1012.901,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-13,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1069.893,1076.869,"Is... is the friction that's feared in part based on changed expectations, or is that just irrelevant to the analysis?"
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1076.869,1098.25,"Changed expectations are relevant in, in the general sense, not the particular... particularized expectations of a particular state, but that it is a general rule and understanding of international laws set forth in the Vienna Convention on Treaties and elsewhere that changes in international law, including changes in sovereign immunity law, are not retroactively applied."
2003.03-13,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1108.281,1111.708,Is the absolute rule based on the act of state doctrine or on sovereign immunity?
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1112.33,1112.823,Sovereign immunity.
2003.03-13,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1115.423,1119.843,"--But as you stated the proposition, you're limited to appropriation claims."
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1119.843,1121.246,"--Well, that's what we're addressing here."
2003.03-13,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1137.593,1139.943,"And then that was the Tate letter, the--"
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1139.943,1141.224,--The Tate letter changed--
2003.03-13,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1141.224,1142.133,--In '52.
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1142.133,1149.276,"--With respect to commercial activity, but, of course, this is not a commercial... it's not even alleged the... within the commercial activity exception."
2003.03-13,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1151.012,1154.477,Why is it that retroactivity... retroactivity causes more friction?
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1155.303,1174.622,"Because it would be inconsistent with the understandings with which the United States and these foreign governments operated under with claims resolution agreements with numerous countries, not merely arising out of World War II, but out of communist government expropriations and numerous agreements regarding these types of--"
2003.03-13,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1174.622,1190.969,--But I thought part of the baseline of immunity law was that other... foreign countries such as Austria knew that from time to time we would confer immunity or not confer immunity depending on the decision of the executive.
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1196.336,1202.652,"--The... the case that... the doctrine of absolute sovereign immunity, there were no... there are no exceptions."
2003.03-13,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1233.655,1238.279,Would that be true of... would that be true of Austria itself if the tables were turned?
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1238.279,1253.967,"--It's unclear whether a... a court action could have been brought, at least we're not familiar with anything in the record that indicates whether a court action could have been brought in 1948, under, for example, the restitution law that Austria passed in 1947."
2003.03-13,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1253.967,1254.71,I think there was--
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1254.71,1262.223,"But that's irrelevant because it can't be... the retroactivity analysis has to be a term... determined on a section-by-section, or... or provision-by-provision basis."
2003.03-13,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1265.074,1266.643,"--Well, it was relevant to something that Mr. Cooper said."
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1282.618,1285.015,"Reciprocity is also an important consideration, Your Honor."
2003.03-13,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1292.9,1297.541,"Well, how... how does it work if in fact you treat the statute as purely jurisdictional?"
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1342.933,1344.215,"Well, prior to--"
2003.03-13,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1344.215,1345.041,--statement of interest.
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1380.911,1389.662,"--We believe that the... as we said in our briefs, and part of the reason we're here today is that there are foreign policy concerns implicated--"
2003.03-13,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1389.662,1392.262,"I know, and what I want to know is, what was wrong with what I just said?"
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1394.825,1395.446,"--Well, I'm not... understand."
2003.03-13,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1404.528,1406.842,--I understand that and I'm trying to get to the reasoning.
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1447.874,1458.155,"--Well, we don't perceive a meaningful difference between an amicus brief expressing foreign policy concerns, which is what we have filed, and a statement of interest expressing foreign policy concerns."
2003.03-13,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1458.155,1473.349,"Ah. Well, then the correct result in this case is to say yes, this statute applies, it applies to 1948 seizures, because they were in violation of international law."
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1483.434,1484.343,But the--
2003.03-13,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1484.343,1487.11,"I take it, by the way, you promised you wouldn't in this case, but nonetheless, all right."
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1498.461,1499.742,--Justice Breyer--
2003.03-13,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1499.742,1501.599,"I'm missing something, so you explain it to me."
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1501.599,1502.137,"--Well, several things."
2003.03-13,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1505.564,1506.845,I'm sorry I brought that up.
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1507.505,1515.845,--That has to do with a particular agreement entered into in 2001 and it is certainly our position that that agreement does not cover this case and that was the position we took.
2003.03-13,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1535.657,1550.518,"Some of them do not involve the act of state doctrine and you want us to hold that... that... that this would be a retroactive application of this jurisdictional statute no matter... no matter what claim is made, whether it's an act of state claim or not."
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1564.143,1567.82,"--In principles of retroactivity, the presumption against retroactivity require--"

2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1568.192,1568.935,--This is not a sub--
2003.03-13,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1568.935,1572.279,--It begs... it begs the question whether it is retroactive or not.
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1572.279,1574.302,"--This is not purely... no, Your Honor, this is not purely jurisdictional."
2003.03-13,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1593.993,1594.986,Give me an example.
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1612.447,1613.19,--We have--
2003.03-13,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1613.19,1617.814,There is jurisdiction but you are free to file act of state or--
2003.03-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1617.814,1618.929,--Wind it up.
2003.03-13,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1618.929,1619.672,--statement of interest.
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1619.672,1621.158,"--May I answer, Your Honor?"
2003.03-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1621.158,1621.53,Yes.
2003.03-13,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1621.53,1648.158,"The... we... there are currently cases pending against countries such as Japan and Poland, with which... which this country previously entered into agreements which both sides thought had resolved the issue entirely, and to now retroactively apply a substantive provision that this Court recognized in Ex parte Peru is a substantive, not merely jurisdictional, but a substantive legal defense, to apply that retroactively would be to change settled expectations, change the rules, and it should not be done."
2003.03-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1648.158,1648.817,"Thank you, Mr. Hungar."
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,1652.244,1662.397,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-13,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1679.198,1690.139,"Well, why doesn't it retro... why... why isn't it just as easy to say that it does operate retrospectively, because the question is, when should it exercise jurisdiction for a particular purpose?"
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,1708.837,1713.189,"Well, I'm... I'm not sure that I understand the question."
2003.03-13,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1713.189,1728.777,Why... why... why isolate jurisdiction when we all know that the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction is to exercise it for the purpose of adjudicating a particular kind of case and to apply a particular substantive law to it?
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,1728.777,1748.301,"Because the... the operative event, the event that's being regulated by a jurisdictional statute, as the Court has said, is that exercise of the Court's power, regardless of when the underlying acts took place, the Court has differentiated between the primary conduct of the parties and the secondary conduct, which is the exercise of the Court's power."
2003.03-13,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1773.193,1790.161,"Well, the Government of the United States has just said you're going to embarrass foreign relations whether the United States' position with respect to a consideration in interpreting this act is raised now or whether it's raised after jurisdiction is assumed and you get to the next stage."
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,1798.623,1808.365,"This would be a much different case if the foreign government had ever said that the prosecution of this case would interfere with foreign relations, as it has in all of these other cases."
2003.03-13,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1821.779,1825.66,But I thought it just told us that it would be an interference three minutes ago.
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,1825.66,1836.146,"--The concern, as I understand the Government's concern, is that in other cases that are pending against Japan and Mexico, et cetera, there might be foreign relation issues."
2003.03-13,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1836.146,1837.177,"Well, why... why should we look further?"
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,1841.664,1842.75,I don't... I don't think so.
2003.03-13,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1851.389,1852.908,"Well, those are not cases involving foreign relations."
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,1852.908,1855.259,"That... that's correct, and that's why the second issue is very important."
2003.03-13,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1924.982,1962.999,"What... what is it if... what do you reply to their, what I take is their argument, that if we say there is jurisdiction here, so that this covers pre-1952 expropriations, think of all the eastern European bloc, what used to be, millions of pieces of real estate, et cetera, and Japan, Peru, all over the world, South America, there have been expropriations, and suddenly our Court becomes... become places where you litigate who owns property all over the world, at least if you trace an interest to an American citizen, for expropriations that may have taken under Maximilian of Mexico."
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,1966.964,1967.214,Right.
2003.03-13,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1967.464,1968.495,What's the answer to that?
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,1968.495,1972.415,"--We're very sensitive to the Government's concern, the can of worms argument here."
2003.03-13,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1991.696,1992.689,"All right, statute of limitations."
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,1994.797,1995.79,--There--
2003.03-13,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1995.79,1998.019,--there might be instances where the statute hasn't run for all kinds--
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,1998.019,1998.219,--Right.
2003.03-13,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1998.219,1998.762,--of local reasons.
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,1998.762,1999.217,There's--
2003.03-13,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1999.217,2003.758,I don't know what the statute of limitations rule is in Peru and et cetera.
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2003.758,2007.845,"--I can think of at least five problems that cases, old cases, would have."
2003.03-13,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2025.595,2035.709,"Can they come in and file a letter, in your opinion, assume you have jurisdiction to say, look, Judge, we don't want you to litigate this case, it interferes with our foreign affairs, period?"
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2035.709,2036.163,Yes.
2003.03-13,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2036.163,2036.99,They can?
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2036.99,2038.355,They can file that.
2003.03-13,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2040.971,2042.457,"And they give a good reason, they give a good reason."
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2042.457,2049.023,--If there were a good reason why Austria's ownership of paintings would interfere with foreign policy--
2003.03-13,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2049.023,2052.367,But that's for a court to judge rather than the executive?
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2052.367,2055.339,"--Well, there's a certain amount of deference that would have to be given to--"
2003.03-13,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2055.339,2063.474,"But no, but you're saying that the executive could say and have... give a good reason, and the court could say, no, we don't... we don't approve of that?"
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2063.474,2077.424,"--I think under... under this Court's doctrine in foreign affair and policy... foreign affairs policy... there is an automatic deference given to the Government's suggestion that a particular case will interfere with foreign policy, but in most cases I think it would be quite clear."
2003.03-13,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2077.962,2083.739,"Well, what... what case is it that says that the court should decide rather than the executive in case like this?"
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2083.739,2100.708,"--Well, I believe, for example, in... in Sabbatino, the Court did not immediately accept the Government's position as to whether a case should or should not go forward and said that it was... now, I don't know whether that, whether Sabbatino, in that part of Sabbatino, it would still be good law today."
2003.03-13,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2101.534,2102.649,"It... we... it wasn't the Court opinion, was it?"
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2102.649,2103.559,Right.
2003.03-13,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2122.628,2124.651,Could... could I ask about the act of state doctrine?
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2155.116,2161.244,"Well, we haven't addressed the act of state because it hasn't been raised and it was an argument that was dropped."
2003.03-13,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2230.74,2242.257,"Whether it poses a problem or not, the suit is... is resting upon... is challenging an act of the state of... of Austria that... that occurred in Austria."
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2242.257,2243.166,That... that's correct.
2003.03-13,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2254.949,2255.205,Right.
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2257.655,2260.05,In the act of state context.
2003.03-13,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2260.05,2260.71,Yeah.
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2260.71,2262.196,"Well, I... I don't think--"
2003.03-13,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2262.196,2263.6,This is the act of state context.
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2265.54,2275.488,"--The act of state doctrine is a choice of law doctrine, as I understand it, and... and so it, again, is not something that really operates retroactively, I think."
2003.03-13,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2285.398,2288.12,How about the public acts?
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2288.12,2289.856,I'm sorry?
2003.03-13,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2289.856,2291.425,This is a public act.
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2291.425,2297.702,"Well, whether it's a public or private act to collect paintings, I'm not sure is so clear."
2003.03-13,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2297.702,2298.445,Let's assume it's a public act.
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2305.793,2308.598,"I... well, yes and no."
2003.03-13,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2333.035,2338.608,But we're told that at least in this country such acts were never adjudicated in foreign courts.
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2338.608,2341.292,I... I understood that to be the Government's position.
2003.03-13,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2387.277,2396.072,"No, but he... isn't the... the concern about the applicability of that case to this one is precisely the reason you said."
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2413.616,2426.248,"Well, I would... I would think that the act of state doctrine, which is what we were talking about, would... would be implicated even more strongly in a... in a suit involving multiple sovereigns than it would with regard to just an individual against a sovereign."
2003.03-13,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2467.57,2484.948,"Well, what... what I'm looking for, I'm beginning to understand his answer better... I think there should be a way, not in your case necessarily, but in general, for the Government to say, court, stay out of this case, because of the international implications."
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2567.592,2567.758,I--
2003.03-13,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2567.758,2570.443,--Do you see that that is the thing that has been floating in my mind--
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2570.443,2570.981,--I understand--
2003.03-13,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2570.981,2571.641,--and I'm trying to settle on.
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2571.641,2572.096,--I understand.
2003.03-13,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2576.554,2580.436,But you can explain to me what a statement of interest is.
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2580.436,2580.602,--Right.
2003.03-13,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2580.602,2590.261,And whether a statement of interest is a sufficient legal route to achieve the end that I think is necessary and that they're arguing for.
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2590.261,2610.529,"I believe if... if the Government were to file a statement of interest saying that the prosecution of this particular lawsuit would interfere with the foreign relations of the Government, I think a court would be proper in abstaining from adjudicating the case under the political question doctrine, very similar to this Court's holding last term in Garamendi, I think."
2003.03-13,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2610.529,2613.091,"But it wouldn't have to, in your view?"
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2613.091,2617.216,I would say it would... it would be very... it would almost always have to.
2003.03-13,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2643.927,2656.392,"But I... I take it that in no case, in no instance would you concede the appropriateness of... of the statement of interest being considered at the jurisdictional as opposed to the justiciability of--"
2003.03-13,2,23138,e_randol_schoenberg,,2656.392,2657.34,That's... that's absolutely correct.
2003.03-13,3,41176,scott_p_cooper,,3373.512,3375.62,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.03-13,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3618.676,3619.519,"Thank you, Mr. Cooper."
