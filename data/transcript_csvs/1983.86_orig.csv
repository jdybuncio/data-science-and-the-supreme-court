1983.86_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 86 Original, Louisiana against Mississippi and others."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,12.891,17.176,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.368,160.485,"Counsel, what page is footnote number one on?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,160.485,162.837,"Page 4, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,207.599,211.17,"Well, that's not inconsistent with the thalweg being live, is it?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,211.17,226.929,"Your Honor, we say to the Court that the thalweg or the boundary in this case consists in the upper part of the live thalweg and in the lower part of the so-called dead thalweg in the Giles Bend Cut-Off."
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,332.699,340.019,"Well, Mr. Palmer, on reading footnote one of the Master's report to which you refer, he says:"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,355.378,372.34,"Your Honor, the implication or the suggestion of the statement is that all we are concerned about is the location of the boundary with respect to that well, and that we say is the fundamental problem here."
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,375.709,376.526,Okay.
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,389.785,399.241,"Your Honor, a latitude line drawn through the bottom hole location in an east-west direction would intersect that portion of this boundary which is live."
1983.86_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,425.892,429.011,"May I ask, counsel, what is a bottom hole?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,430.528,436.932,"--Yes, sir, and that top hole is located in the State of Mississippi on the lands of our Co-Defendants, the Dille family."
1983.86_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,442.503,443.003,Sideways?
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,443.003,443.47,"Yes, sir."
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,449.074,453.376,What are the concerns other than the well?
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,472.939,477.157,--It would not be the boundary after 1982.
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,477.157,485.913,"Tell me, what are your concerns other than the location of the well for the period between '70-whatever it is and '82?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,485.913,489.901,"Your Honor, there are several consequences of this case in addition to--"
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,489.901,491.234,That's what I'm asking you.
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,491.234,493.019,--the oil well ownership.
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,559.628,571.603,"Well, I know, but setting the boundary at the end of '82 wouldn't settle your dispute, would it, because the thalweg isn't there any more."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,571.603,572.738,"It's not there, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,573.721,574.605,The boundary has moved.
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,580.392,583.946,"--I don't, and that would only be determined through the addition of more testimony."
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,602.907,620.202,"Well, I'm still interested in your reasons for wanting the... all of your reasons for wanting the boundary as of '82 fixed all up and down for that four-mile run."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,620.202,620.902,Okay.
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,658.927,663.998,"So long as the thalweg is live, you can't draw a metes and bounds boundary."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,663.998,672.171,"Your Honor, you can draw the metes and bounds boundary for every year for which you have evidence of its location after--"
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,672.171,674.637,"Well, what's magic about a calendar year?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,674.637,697.219,"--It's magic in the sense that we're determining not only the rights between the states, but you must remember there are private Defendants in this litigation, and to that extent in the lower court, in the action that precipitated this very lawsuit, the Dille family has complained of possible drainage of the oil from their land."
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,719.401,730.023,"Well, can't they get a witness to testify as to which side of the property they're claiming the thalweg is then running or is running at the relevant date for that case?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,730.023,738.713,"That is still basically a boundary decision, Your Honor, and Louisiana got this case removed to here because they say this is the only forum for determining that boundary."
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,738.713,741.831,"But no one doubts the boundary is the live thalweg, do they?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,741.831,744.767,"It is live at that one point, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,744.767,748.069,"Which is the point at which the Dille family is concerned, I would take it."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,748.069,752.373,"Well, that is the one point on their property boundary, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,779.69,780.106,"Well, why can't they do it?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,780.856,786.944,"Because they attempted to do that and Louisiana said: No, you can't do it at the lower federal level."
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.944,789.896,"Louisiana can't keep them from going into the lower federal court, can they?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,789.896,790.581,They did.
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,791.681,792.831,"Well, I know you're here."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,812.911,817.565,Which is exactly what we argued in our motion in opposition.
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,817.565,819.248,"That may be, but suppose we had turned it down?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,819.248,821.433,They would have had to go forward or be out of court.
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.433,823.635,"Well, they certainly could have gone forward with proof."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,823.635,825.002,"Yes, sir."
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,825.002,825.585,Well--
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,825.585,840.513,"Of course, this Court had that very same question posed to you in No. 92 Original, Arkansas versus Mississippi, when Arkansas was on the courthouse doorsteps going to trial and backed up and said: Wait a minute, that's not the right forum to determine a boundary dispute."
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.969,863.177,"--Well, if we reject your exceptions to the Master's report and accept his report, I take it the location of the bottom hole of this well is fixed, has been determined."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,879.554,881.671,"Your Honor, the only problem--"
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,881.671,884.792,--if they really have a live question about it.
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,884.792,890.327,"--Your Honor, the only problem with that is that the owner on the Mississippi side is the Dille family."
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.622,912.693,"There isn't exclusive jurisdiction, is there, in this Court just because a state is a party?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,912.693,917.846,"No, sir, and we suggested to you originally not to grant leave for that very reason."
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.846,919.529,"I understand, I understand that, I understand that."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,919.529,937.408,"Your Honor, we simply say that, since the Court has taken the case, we've tried it, the evidence is before the Court, the Master has labored diligently with several thousand words to describe one picture, why not just have him put his line on those hydrographs?"
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,958.737,975.183,"Well, if the thalweg is migrating, you can't get an accurate description of the boundary from the time it takes the surveyors to go out and see where the thalweg is on January 15th until the time they can come and testify before the Master on February 1st."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,979.068,981.252,Correct.
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,993.577,1001.25,Are you suggesting that there was only one metes and bounds description of the boundary between 1972 and 1982?
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1001.25,1008.754,--We're suggesting that there is a metes and bounds description for every year for which there is proof upon which a boundary could be determined.
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1008.754,1013.308,There may be a metes and bounds description for every week that would vary from week to week.
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1016.01,1022.996,"Your Honor, we have asked that you do what the Master did in No. 14 and simply have him draw it for every year."
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1070.792,1091.289,"Well, what if the Master, to get back to that, gave you a metes and bounds description of the dead part of the thalweg and then, with respect to the part of the boundary that was covered by a live thalweg, simply described what a thalweg is, the deepest point of the channel and so forth, and gave no metes and bounds."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1093.158,1114.504,"Your Honor, in Nebraska versus Iowa this Court plainly said that when you're talking about a boundary and the law of avulsion, which is what you're talking about with that dead thalweg, that that thalweg remains fixed unless and until the river comes back and reoccupies it."
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1116.606,1117.156,Okay.
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1140.972,1150.327,"Well, it would be better than what's recommended, to the extent that we at least have a portrayal of the southern part of those drilling units on the Louisiana side."
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1176.895,1181.466,"Well, but the utility isn't there, either, because the line could change next week."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1181.466,1182.866,--It could.
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1199.843,1200.81,"Well, what dispute?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1219.924,1229.362,There is no claim as between the two states except as they bear directly on taxation of those--
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.362,1231.148,"Well, just give me an example."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1237.635,1238.702,--There's been no claim made of that.
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.702,1245.991,"Well, what other kind of a concrete claim is there between you and Louisiana during those ten years?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1254.495,1255.097,Okay.
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.434,1264.803,"Well, what difference does it make for those ten years?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1264.803,1272.039,"--Well, as I mentioned a minute ago, it certainly would affect our exercise of police power."
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1272.725,1274.608,"Well, all that's all gone now."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1279.462,1291.453,"--Well, Your Honor, if the State of Mississippi were to do today what it has not done and establish drilling units on the Mississippi side of that boundary, then where do we draw the line?"
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1312.35,1313.885,"Well, you keep saying ""if""."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1315.335,1316.052,"--No, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.052,1336.399,"I think if you had come in to the Special Master and said, look, there's something else besides this well that we're in dispute on, we're about to establish these drilling units here and Louisiana says that they're on their side, I'm sure he would have solved that concrete dispute."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1344.386,1360.764,"Your Honor, my point has been that in the past this Court has not required some major controversy over and beyond the states' sovereignty over these lands as a predicate for granting leave to determine a boundary."
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.001,1367.917,"Well, that may be so."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1400.572,1401.422,That certainly has--
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1401.422,1402.038,No matter what.
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1402.038,1404.44,"--That certainly has been what you have done in the past, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1404.44,1405.642,"Well, that may be true."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1405.642,1408.328,"And if the Court wants to depart from that, so be it."
1983.86_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1408.328,1445.751,"But you would say really that you can have a Special Master and use this Court's original jurisdiction basically in the capacity of a surveyor; that both parties can agree that the thalweg of the Mississippi River is the boundary, there's no argument about accretion versus avulsion or that, you know, that there was an oxbow cutoff or something like that, but that nonetheless the Master is employed simply to plot the position of a live thalweg as of say January 15th, 1982, around the Natchez Bridge?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1450.769,1461.261,I think the Court is going to require that the states with some definition describe this disputed area in terms of miles or land size or whatever.
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.402,1513.811,"Mr. Palmer, just as a practical matter, how much... forgetting avulsion for the moment, because then a boundary can really change rapidly."
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1531.773,1543.848,"As I recall, from bits of the testimony, Your Honor, in one or two years the Mississippi witness contended the boundary moved as much as 200 feet or thereabouts."
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1548.45,1552.937,"But that's probably the maximum that it's ever moved, that it's moved at any point in any year?"
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1552.937,1554.837,I wouldn't say that that's the maximum.
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1564.494,1567.53,That may not have much to do with the thalweg?
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1567.53,1575.284,"--It may well not, but to suspect that that time of movement of the top bank would cause no movement of the thalweg we think is unreasonable."
1983.86_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.284,1575.969,Yes.
1983.86_orig,0,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,1575.969,1584.14,"But to the point of the basic evidentiary problems here, the thalweg doctrine is based on navigation."
1983.86_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1600.417,1606.321,Mr. Kimmel.
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,1606.321,1609.607,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.854,1658.79,In terms of where the thalweg is.
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,1658.79,1662.092,"--In terms of where the thalweg is, the live thalweg."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1678.953,1679.853,You mean rejected.
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,1679.853,1682.488,"Rejected, Your Honor, rejected."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.488,1683.205,"I mean, he didn't--"
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,1683.205,1684.871,He considered them.
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.871,1686.323,--He considered them.
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,1686.323,1686.89,That's right.
1983.86_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1740.475,1747.195,"Mr. Kimmel, there is discussion in the testimony about breaking down the tow."
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,1750.063,1750.68,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1750.68,1752.432,--and how it's relevant?
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,1752.432,1760.038,Breaking down a tow as you come through a bend means that you are to point your tow downstream.
1983.86_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1802.282,1805.9,Does the Coast Guard speak in terms of right and left on those occasions?
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,1805.9,1806.384,No.
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.775,1922.311,"Now, Mr. Kimmel, you say ""his particular thalweg""."
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,1938.754,1941.187,"I do, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1949.06,1950.176,For each year?
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,1950.176,1950.811,--For each year.
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1950.811,1952.611,"Not only '82, but for each year."

1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1980.831,1997.958,"But if the thalweg's been moving west during these ten years, or at least if in part of this stretch it's been moving west, Louisiana's been losing land to Mississippi, and you may not know how much."
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2011.95,2014.302,"That's quite possible, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.302,2028.145,"But at least you would know, if you fixed the boundary in '82, at least you'd know as of that date what land Mississippi could tax as compared to Louisiana."
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2028.145,2030.346,"Yes, I would have to agree with that, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2030.346,2039.369,"If so, why shouldn't... I would think you can never keep up with this problem, but at least you can chase it."
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2039.369,2045.373,"Louisiana's been chasing these particular problems for many years, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2046.873,2047.456,So has Mississippi.
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2047.456,2048.475,--So has Mississippi.
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2094.687,2104.312,"Well, if you drew it you'd probably know, at least on some stretches of the river, there'd be some land, there'd be some land in Mississippi that wasn't there in 1960."
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2104.312,2107.614,"--Yes, sir, that's possibly correct."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.614,2109.38,"Well, you know it's correct."
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2109.38,2109.78,Yes.
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2109.78,2117.869,And I don't know... I would think it would be... it might be helpful.
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2117.869,2134.247,The only real issue in this case... and I doubt whether suit would have ever been filed had it not been for the ownership of this particular bottom hole of this well.
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2145.639,2147.055,Just because it hasn't made much difference where the boundary is.
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2147.055,2147.522,That's right.
1983.86_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2167.733,2199.387,"But that's treating this as if it were a quiet title action and you simply rule, in this case rule for the Plaintiff or rule for the Defendant and, you know, say that's all I need to decide, because you're talking about who owns this land and I've now decided that, whereas perhaps the concept of original jurisdiction is a broader thing, that you ought to do something by way of deciding the actual location of the boundary line."
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2199.387,2203.072,"To which we agree, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.118,2220.784,"Yes, you certainly did."
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2221.384,2228.474,"Understanding, of course, that the live thalweg, the problems incidental in establishing--"
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.474,2231.342,"Well, Mr. Kimmel, would there have to be more evidence taken to draw a boundary?"
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2231.342,2232.142,"--No, sir."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2234.294,2240.531,And what kind of a skill would it take to look at these hydrographs and draw that boundary?
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2240.531,2246.351,It would just take an engineer or a surveyor in plotting a particular line on a map.
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2246.351,2249.22,Depending on what expert you believed.
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2249.22,2250.353,"That's right, or depending--"
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2250.353,2256.391,"If the Master says, look, believe this expert and don't believe that one--"
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2256.391,2257.024,--That's right.
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2257.024,2257.743,--he could draw it?
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2257.743,2258.209,That's right.
1983.86_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2262.628,2265.23,Is your typical hydrograph in evidence dated?
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2265.23,2271.467,"Yes, sir, the hydrographic surveys are dated, yes, sir, for each individual year."
1983.86_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2271.467,2287.993,"So then the Master could presumably, taking the relevant sets of hydrographic... of hydrographs of a given date, the ones which he credited, could as of that date determine what the metes and bounds of the thalweg was?"
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2287.993,2289.262,"Yes, sir, that's correct, that is correct."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.262,2291.679,"Well, the hydrographs are the same for both sides, aren't they?"
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2291.679,2292.88,"Yes, sir, the hydrographs--"
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2292.88,2301.736,"It's just a question of an expert interpretation of those hydrographs, and the Master has indicated which expert he believes."
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2301.736,2302.936,"--Experts, yes, sir."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2302.936,2303.619,Experts.
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2303.619,2304.188,Yes.
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2304.188,2305.471,He believed yours.
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2305.471,2307.64,"Right, that's correct."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2307.64,2311.342,So I guess you wouldn't object to having it drawn.
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2311.342,2315.996,We're not putting up a strong argument over that.
1983.86_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2315.996,2321.65,"Mr. Kimmel, does the live thalweg have to connect with the dead thalweg at each end?"
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2321.65,2324.0,"In my opinion it does not, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2324.0,2326.185,"Do both parties agree, then, on that--"
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2326.185,2327.168,"No, ma'am."
1983.86_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2327.168,2328.904,--or is that an outstanding legal issue?
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2328.904,2337.492,"If there's a legal issue involved in that, I don't know what it is, because the boundary... in my opinion the boundary does not have to connect."
1983.86_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2353.419,2357.989,"Well then, maybe you're wrong in thinking that the lower thalweg is dead."
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2357.989,2364.727,"No, sir, the lower thalweg is dead as a result of a cutoff."
1983.86_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2380.002,2393.412,"Well, if the Act admitting Mississippi to the Union provides that the boundary shall be such and such, or the Act admitting Louisiana, I dare say neither of those acts contemplated an interrupted boundary."
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2393.412,2395.698,"No, sir, they did not contemplate--"
1983.86_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2395.698,2400.983,"Then how could it subsequently have become interrupted, given the law of avulsion and accretion?"
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2400.983,2404.47,"--It is not technically interrupted, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2425.467,2430.102,But a minute ago you said you thought the boundary didn't have to be continuous.
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2430.102,2430.871,It does not.
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.871,2432.004,It can't be if--
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2432.004,2435.323,"Well, it does not have to be determined."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2442.845,2443.645,--No.
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2443.645,2444.345,That's true.
1983.86_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2456.902,2460.473,"Well, is that all that Louisiana prayed for in its complaint?"
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2460.473,2462.223,"Yes, sir."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2492.676,2502.8,"Well, Mr. Kimmel, isn't discontinuous boundary, isn't that problem just inherent in the concept of avulsion on the one hand--"
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2502.8,2504.033,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.033,2506.035,--and erosion and accretion on the other?
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2506.035,2506.852,"Yes, sir."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2506.852,2514.608,"Because when there's an avulsion, if you say, if the law is the line is fixed, then the river's running someplace else."
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2514.608,2515.691,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
1983.86_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2528.516,2538.037,"Well, is there enough evidence that would permit the Master without taking any more to connect the live thalweg with the dead?"
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2538.037,2540.223,"No, Your Honor, there is not."
1983.86_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2541.039,2552.131,There is only enough evidence to permit the drawing of the thalweg as of given dates in time within a range of the live thalweg?
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2552.131,2552.831,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1983.86_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.987,2573.73,"The states must have had some experience with this in the past, on avulsions and accretions, and where the dead thalweg ends and the live thalweg begins."
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2578.098,2582.668,"It's not... Your Honor, it is not a new problem, especially for Louisiana."
1983.86_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2585.87,2589.072,Mr. Kimmel go ahead and finish your answer.
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2589.072,2594.726,--But it is not a new problem and the state is familiar with the dead thalweg issues.
1983.86_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.118,2617.323,"Well, Mr. Kimmel, does the concept of a discontinuous boundary, which apparently makes sense to my brother Justice White, make any sense to you?"
1983.86_orig,1,21078,david_c_kimmel,,2617.323,2626.864,"The only way it makes sense, Your Honor, is that in order... to connect to the 1964 thalweg is just not necessary."
1983.86_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2687.82,2691.89,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Palmer?"
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2691.89,2698.627,"Yes, Your Honor, several points that the Court very perceptively raised just a moment ago."
1983.86_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2738.436,2747.624,But the connection between the live and the dead I would think in many occasions couldn't possibly be completely in the river.
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2747.624,2759.598,"Your Honor, the upper terminus of a dead thalweg is fixed at a point in time, generally, according to the rules of this Court, when there is no flow in that dead channel."
1983.86_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.032,2762.634,Right.
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2762.634,2770.137,"Now, there is an accepted engineering technique for connecting that upper terminus to the migrating live terminus."
1983.86_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2776.374,2776.974,Right.
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2776.974,2778.226,That was done here in this case.
1983.86_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2780.178,2781.078,That's by your witness?
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2781.078,2782.778,--It was discussed by our witness.
1983.86_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2793.203,2806.061,"Unless you've got your dead thalweg in a concrete-lined canal, the point at which the live thalweg goes into the dead thalweg is going to migrate, too, is it not?"
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2806.061,2809.513,The point of connection between the live and the dead is going to be fixed.
1983.86_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2816.583,2817.3,Yes.
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2817.3,2818.369,That's the way it's done.
1983.86_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2818.369,2825.106,And so part of that perpendicular line is going to be... may very well be going over dry land.
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2825.106,2829.641,"It could, but that would be highly unlikely, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2830.891,2832.241,May I ask you one question?
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2832.241,2833.008,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2833.008,2835.544,"Your client, of course, was the Defendant in the case."
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2835.544,2836.894,I beg your pardon?
1983.86_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2836.894,2840.179,"Your client, the State of Mississippi, was the Defendant in the case."
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2840.179,2840.696,"Yes, sir."
1983.86_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2840.696,2845.733,"Did you file any kind of a counterclaim or prayer for any kind of relief, affirmative relief?"
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2845.733,2846.416,"We did not, Your Honor."
1983.86_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2851.487,2855.889,Did your affirmative defenses pray for a declaration of the boundary?
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2855.889,2856.624,"Yes, sir."
1983.86_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2921.15,2922.366,"Well, let me ask you."
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2947.801,2954.787,"That's correct, because by definition the terminus of the southern end would be the live thalweg."
1983.86_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2954.787,2955.238,Exactly.
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2956.823,2957.573,"Yes, sir."
1983.86_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2957.573,2968.547,And so you have... the boundary line would be traversing a section of the stream that wouldn't be in the live thalweg.
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2968.547,2975.285,"That's correct, and that's why, as was testified to at trial, the accepted technique is to draw the perpendicular line through the live thalweg."
1983.86_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2975.285,2976.151,Perpendicular?
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2976.151,2977.987,Because on equitable principles--
1983.86_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2977.987,2981.872,You mean just perpendicular to the banks there or east and west?
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2981.872,2983.474,--Perpendicular to the live thalweg.
1983.86_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2983.474,2984.241,I see.
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2984.241,2985.774,As Mr. Smith testified--
1983.86_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2985.774,2991.811,"So if the live thalweg happens to be running, at that point be running east and west, you draw it north and south?"
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2991.811,2996.548,"--It depends on where the upper end of the dead thalweg is, but you could, yes, sir."
1983.86_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2996.548,2997.064,Okay.
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,2997.064,3002.602,The point is that if you didn't draw it perpendicularly you would be unfairly favoring one state or the other.
1983.86_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3002.602,3003.135,Yes.
1983.86_orig,2,32337,j_i_palmer_jr,,3003.135,3007.339,"The standard of review in this case, as the Court well knows, is de novo."
1983.86_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3007.339,3011.224,"Thank you, gentlemen."
