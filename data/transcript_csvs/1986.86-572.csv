1986.86-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.539,"Mrs. Warren, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,11.539,14.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.327,150.196,"Mrs. Warren, you refer to this as a preliminary hearing?"
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,150.196,151.662,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,151.662,154.248,I take it from the way you describe it.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,162.17,165.372,"No, Your Honor, I meant preliminary only in that--"
1986.86-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,165.372,165.972,Pre-trial.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,165.972,169.324,"--it's a threshold, I'm sorry Justice White, I didn't hear your comment."
1986.86-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,169.324,169.943,Pre-trial.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,169.943,171.61,Pre-trial.
1986.86-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,183.184,185.452,"And it could happen before the trial, it could happen during the trial."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,186.002,186.485,During trial.
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,265.655,272.308,"--Mrs. Warren, may I ask if you would take the same position if the defendant were representing himself?"
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,272.308,283.116,"Your Honor, if the defendant is representing himself, then clearly he has a right to counsel and there would need to be a balancing of interests and a special showing of necessity."
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,289.103,289.503,"No, I understand."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,292.739,293.105,I would--
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,293.105,295.674,--agree that he had a constitutional right to be present during this--
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,295.674,298.559,--To represent himself and that necessitates being present.
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,299.343,300.495,"--But as a lawyer, not as--"
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,301.645,302.178,Yes.
1986.86-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,302.178,302.947,Not confrontation?
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,302.947,304.113,"That's right, Your Honor."
1986.86-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,304.113,312.802,"Mrs. Warren, assuming that you didn't have a separate hearing to qualify the witnesses and you did it at the regular trial,--"
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,312.802,313.552,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,313.552,315.254,"--you couldn't exclude him then, could you?"
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,315.254,316.77,That's correct.
1986.86-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,316.77,324.36,"So if this is merely for the purpose of excluding him, there would be a problem wouldn't there?"
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,324.36,326.193,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1986.86-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,331.28,335.501,"Well, is this always done in Kentucky?"
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,335.501,338.553,That a defendant is not permitted to attend a competency hearing?
1986.86-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,338.553,338.953,No.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,343.588,349.059,"Your Honor, I'm not aware of any case in which they were not qualified prior to the hearing."
1986.86-572,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,349.059,353.895,"But there is no law on it at all, it's just practice?"
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,353.895,365.187,"There are a number of cases that say when the child is young enough, or when the defense challenges competency there will be a competency determination outside the presence of the jury."
1986.86-572,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,398.474,401.376,What about a due process concern?
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,419.988,423.274,"--In the typical proceeding, that should not be the case."
1986.86-572,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,447.341,461.999,And you don't think that a defendant might be in a position to suggest appropriate questions or question certain responses with the attorney that would be helpful even at that qualification hearing?
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,461.999,465.553,"--Your Honor, the defendant might suggest--"
1986.86-572,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,465.553,468.505,"There's no evidence in this case perhaps, I mean--"
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,468.505,468.988,--That's true.
1986.86-572,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,468.988,470.271,--it might be harmless error.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,476.174,484.18,"Your Honor, there are a number of remedies for that concern and we acknowledge that a defendant may have certain facts."
1986.86-572,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,537.315,554.96,"What if the state used a video tape for example in these situations, do you think the defendant would have no right to be in a position to view the video taping with the lawyer so that he could participate."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,554.96,558.228,The video tape statute in Kentucky applies to testimony.
1986.86-572,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,607.161,608.978,Your rule doesn't apply just to strangers.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,622.171,622.471,Yes.
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,622.471,627.223,--criminal charge against the parent of the child for this very thing we have in this case?
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,627.223,628.559,"That's right, Your Honor."
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,628.559,630.861,But you would say that that parent could also be excluded xxx.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,630.861,631.411,That's right.
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,633.812,644.334,"So, you would say they would be excluded even though it might be quite likely that they would have suggestions to make to the lawyer that might help find out whether the child was accurate in what he was saying."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,644.334,650.922,--Those suggestions can all be made at trial where honesty or credibility is an issue.
1986.86-572,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,650.922,653.474,Is competency also at issue in the trial.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,663.765,664.482,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,694.951,697.319,xxx to being given?
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,697.319,698.421,"--During trial, yes Your Honor."
1986.86-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,701.29,702.673,And the court could of.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,702.673,704.825,--And the court certainly could of.
1986.86-572,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.825,709.294,Based on the conduct of the witness.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,709.294,715.198,The information that came out at trial that would suggest that that initial assessment was inaccurate.
1986.86-572,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,715.198,721.953,Would counsel necessarily be permitted to ask competency type questions at trial?
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,721.953,722.686,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-572,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,726.638,729.724,Because the jury has to make it's own assessment of competency as well.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,740.748,747.869,"--Or, certainly the jury could reject that the child is a credible witness and could reject the evidence given by the child."
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,749.021,750.338,Let me be sure I understand you.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,771.117,774.569,"The answer to your first question is, may they ask the same questions?"
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,777.871,783.441,If they had not been excluded from the first hearing they might not found it necessary to ask them a second time.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,783.441,785.024,--Those questions are typically asked.
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,844.249,848.284,"Well of course, if that's a concern you could find a bigger room I suppose."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,850.153,856.223,"--That's right, Your Honor, but nonetheless you are requiring the child to confront the defendant one more time."
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,876.051,892.98,"--Do you deny the possibility, and I'm not suggesting it's true in this case, that the presence of the adult defendant might enable the lawyer at the time of the initial competency examination to suggest questions that might be relevant and helpful to making the right decision?"
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,892.98,899.817,"Your Honor, certainly the presence of the defendant could suggest questions."
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.989,909.905,But you may not know what the child can attest to until he's heard the testimony.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,917.428,924.915,"Your Honor, again I see the questioning going to the issue of credibility or honesty rather than pure competency."
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,930.569,935.64,Well then you are saying there's just no possibility that the adult could suggest any useful question.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,935.64,939.842,"No, Your Honor, and I'm not suggesting that it might not be helpful to him to be here."
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,959.737,967.492,"In other words, what you're saying is, even if it's highly prejudicial, it's just too bad because he has no confrontation right except during the trial."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,969.527,979.233,"--Your Honor, I'm saying that any potential prejudice, and again, if he's able to show prejudice his due process right to presence is going to get him there."
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,993.893,994.827,Well wait a minute.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,998.262,998.712,--Right.
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,998.712,1005.117,Then you just say as a matter of due process he has to make an affirmative showing of actual prejudice in the case in order to prevail.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1005.117,1008.652,Show reasonably substantial relationship to his ability to defend.
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1008.652,1022.829,"I assume you're also saying that, well I'm not sure, at least it's very unlikely that there can be substantial prejudice, if not impossible that there can be substantial prejudice in as much as he can do the same thing at trial."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1022.829,1023.546,"That's right, Your Honor."
1986.86-572,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1023.546,1024.679,If what you've told us is true.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1026.198,1026.698,That's right.
1986.86-572,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1026.698,1029.333,"--at trial, it's very difficult to imagine how there could be substantial prejudice."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1029.333,1030.983,"That's our position, Your Honor."
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.983,1033.484,"If that's true, I don't know why you even need the lawyer there."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1041.489,1045.541,"Your Honor, no one has ever questioned the right of counsel at that point."
1986.86-572,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1048.243,1050.294,But if there is a right of counsel--
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1050.294,1050.894,--if counsel is there.
1986.86-572,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1050.894,1054.814,--If there's a right of counsel it's because it is a critical stage of the proceeding.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1054.814,1058.433,"Your Honor, critical stage tor purposes of right to counsel--"
1986.86-572,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1058.433,1058.883,Right.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1058.883,1065.254,"--and critical stage for purposes of confrontation, critical stage for purposes of compulsory process all attach at different times."
1986.86-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1068.872,1070.606,"Well, can the first--"
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1085.299,1086.083,"That's right, Your Honor."
1986.86-572,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1091.219,1101.427,"Well, I suppose if the witness is found not to be competent, the child as a witness, then the witness would not be permitted to testify at trial."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1101.427,1102.643,That's right.
1986.86-572,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1102.643,1104.379,"So, it could be quite critical."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1110.216,1111.183,It is xxx--
1986.86-572,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1111.183,1114.568,As was the case here.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1114.568,1117.203,--In this case there were three children.
1986.86-572,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1117.203,1118.722,"Well, take them one at a time."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1118.722,1119.972,If I might clarify--
1986.86-572,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1119.972,1122.257,I assume there were three separate charges.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1122.257,1127.91,--That's right and there's been no challenge to the third child as to presence.
1986.86-572,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1127.91,1134.831,"Significant to a defendant, to be able to persuade a judge that a witness is not competent."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1134.831,1142.004,"Certainly, Your Honor, there are many important decisions made prior to trial and after trial."
1986.86-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1142.004,1156.495,"Well, Mrs. Warren, supposing that the child was initially determined competent under these Kentucky procedures and then the same questions were asked in open court and the judge was persuaded to change his mind."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1156.495,1157.347,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1157.347,1160.566,Would the child's testimony then be stricken from the record?
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1160.566,1163.084,"Yes, Your Honor, if the child were incompetent."
1986.86-572,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1174.356,1183.997,"But did I hear, did you say earlier, Mrs. Warren, that the trial judge might nevertheless not decide it himself, but let the jury decide the question of competency."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1183.997,1185.064,"--No, Your Honor, the trial court--"
1986.86-572,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1185.064,1185.881,He would.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1185.881,1188.216,--It is the decision for the trial judge.
1986.86-572,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1195.139,1198.424,So it's really two separate questions we're dealing with.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1204.161,1215.968,"It is important, but no different than many other important decisions, such as the Grand Jury decision to indict, or the witness's decision in a lineup, that this is the person."
1986.86-572,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1426.034,1440.761,"Mrs. Warren, do you know if most states, you could conceivably do this by dispensing with the preliminary hearing entirely and just bringing the child on at the trial and conduct the competency inquiry then."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1445.482,1449.6,--Certainly our legislature and our courts have not adopted a xxx--
1986.86-572,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1449.6,1450.552,What do other states do?
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1455.938,1457.84,--I believe the majority do.
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.513,1484.44,"Mrs. Warren, could I ask you on another issue, the Kentucky Supreme Court as I recall it said, their Section 11 or Article 11 of your state constitution was the basis for its decision as well as the Sixth Amendment."
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1496.931,1503.603,"Your Honor, there was a decision within three weeks of this case, Commonwealth v. Willis, which is cited in our brief."
1986.86-572,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1520.13,1521.148,--No difference between the two.
1986.86-572,0,38412,penny_r_warren,,1521.148,1523.448,So they are construed identically.
1986.86-572,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1539.944,1543.061,"Thank you, Mrs. Warren."
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,1548.215,1554.953,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-572,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1628.501,1634.905,"Mr. Posnansky, the constitutional right is the right to confront the witnesses against him."
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,1648.748,1649.331,"No, certainly not."
1986.86-572,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1649.331,1650.867,When they are testifying against him.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,1660.139,1664.091,"Your Honor, the child, we submit, is testifying."
1986.86-572,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1675.065,1676.248,Not yet a witness.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,1680.969,1707.786,"Well, the Kentucky Supreme Court in their decisions regarding child competency use the term that when the competency of an infant is challenged the procedure is that the court will conduct, the duty of the trial court is to carefully examine the witness in order to ascertain whether he or she is sufficiently intelligent to observe, recollect and narrate the facts and has the moral sense of obligation to speak the truth."
1986.86-572,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1729.267,1734.787,The factor though is whether the child shall be or shall not be a witness.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,1744.56,1746.411,--There isn't time to confront the witness.
1986.86-572,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1802.448,1803.298,Counsel did that here.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,1805.717,1806.567,He did challenge it.
1986.86-572,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1806.567,1808.235,So it can be raised at the trial proceeding.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,1808.235,1825.495,"But it, it can be raised, Your Honor, but it's very impractical to expect that in that situation, that the judge is going to declare, after a witness has given live testimony in front of the jury on these very important, inflammatory points, that he's going to strike the testimony of that witness."
1986.86-572,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1844.574,1855.882,"You don't doubt, Mr. Posnansky, do you that Kentucky could go the way of some other states and not have a preliminary competency determination out of the presence of jury?"
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,1855.882,1859.518,I believe that that's possible that they could go that way.
1986.86-572,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1921.841,1925.126,"Even your client's lawyer was allowed to question, too, wasn't he?"
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,1925.126,1926.645,"Yes, Your Honor, but without the presence--"
1986.86-572,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1926.645,1927.445,Both lawyers were.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,1927.445,1928.995,"--Without, right."
1986.86-572,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1940.136,1941.238,Well what?
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,1941.238,1943.588,"He could, the competency hearing, Your Honor,--"
1986.86-572,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1943.588,1947.142,"I mean, what questions were in fact asked at the competency hearing."
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,1947.142,1956.913,"--The questions at the competency hearing on the two little girls went to only Sunday School, do you go to church, do you believe in God, what happens if you tell a lie, that sort of thing."
1986.86-572,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1956.913,1965.186,"And you're saying that the defendant could have furnished valuable information to his lawyer in what, cross examining these girls in their answers to those questions?"
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,1965.186,1968.471,That is possible certainly.
1986.86-572,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1969.921,1972.44,How would that be possible?
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,1972.44,1978.094,"--If the children were lying about some of these things, the defendant may very well have been in a position to know."
1986.86-572,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2004.144,2004.878,xxx.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2004.878,2009.715,"--The facts of the crime are admissible to get into there, certainly, because it says that--"
1986.86-572,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.715,2014.417,"They weren't asked about the facts of the crime, and I think they never are in these competency hearings."
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2020.538,2029.527,"--Justice Scalia, in this very case, the two little girls, they didn't get into the facts, but the little four year old boy, they did, in the competency hearing."
1986.86-572,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2041.084,2044.888,"Well, he was subject to cross examination on his testimony before the jury, too."
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2044.888,2052.141,"He was subject to cross-examination in front of the jury, but as I said the competency issue is a separate proceeding and it is not sufficient."
1986.86-572,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2052.141,2056.161,"Well, the fact that his testimony may have been damaging doesn't mean it should be excluded."
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2060.565,2068.92,"That's certainly correct, Your Honor, however the issue is whether or not the child's testimony was admissible to begin with."
1986.86-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2068.92,2077.025,"But counsel, isn't the real trouble, the prosecutor could ask him any question he wanted to while talking to him."
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2090.766,2093.286,The prosecutor was present at the competency hearing.
1986.86-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2093.286,2100.975,But couldn't the prosecutor of held a competency hearing in his own office and talked to the person?
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2100.975,2102.392,Certainly.
1986.86-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2102.392,2105.26,"So, your objection was that it was done in the court room."
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2105.26,2107.712,It was done in front of the judge.
1986.86-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2108.246,2110.248,That's your only complaint.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2110.248,2114.282,--It doesn't make any difference whether it's in chambers or whether it's in the court room--
1986.86-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2114.282,2115.734,It was done by the judge.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2115.734,2119.119,--it was done by the judge and the judge was--
1986.86-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2119.119,2121.388,A part of the judicial proceeding.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2121.388,2122.238,--Correct.
1986.86-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2122.238,2123.421,Well that's xxx--
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2123.421,2124.105,And that's exactly right.
1986.86-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2124.105,2125.94,--prosecutor is doing this.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2147.354,2154.609,"Justice O'Connor, I think in this case we have to look to the testimony of these children later in front of the jury."
1986.86-572,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2154.609,2165.398,"Yes, I've read it and I just don't understand how the presence of your client would have made any difference in this case."
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2168.619,2181.01,"In this case, just as in any case, the defendant is in a position, is likely to be in a position to bring out certain facts to the attorney."
1986.86-572,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2181.01,2187.331,I have a transcript now and there are no suggested additions that your client would have made.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2197.119,2200.571,There was no avowal made as to specific questions.
1986.86-572,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2231.36,2238.18,But your client has not suggested a single thing that he would have done that would have altered this result.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2238.18,2239.632,--I don't think in this case--
1986.86-572,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2239.632,2247.802,Don't you think he has an obligation to suggest how he might have altered the outcome or how his presence might have made a difference?
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2247.802,2253.856,"--Your Honor, not in a case where it's involving the presence of the defendant."
1986.86-572,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2262.562,2271.937,What if we think it is not a Sixth Amendment violation and all you are left with is a due process argument?
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2271.937,2287.029,"--I know of no cases where a due process violation has occurred where a person has been kept out of the court room, where witnesses are testifying, where a harmless error analysis has been made."
1986.86-572,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2336.796,2352.656,What if the judge were to determine that the physical presence of the defendant would have so frightened the children that they would not make proper responses and that therefore he was to be excluded?
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2358.225,2364.863,I believe that the proper standard should be the same standard as it is under Illinois v Allen.
1986.86-572,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2388.479,2391.347,--What about the question I asked?
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2406.44,2416.748,"--In that situation, Your Honor, I think that there are alternative remedies available short of absolutely barring the defendant."
1986.86-572,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.88,2519.247,Excuse me.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2522.415,2525.533,"--No, Your Honor, the judge is the trier of fact as to competency."
1986.86-572,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2526.933,2532.021,Not the trier of fact on the charge?
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2532.021,2538.258,"Not the trier of fact as to guilt or innocence, but the issue is competency and it is a factual determination."
1986.86-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2559.771,2562.823,Does the jury know about this?
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2562.823,2563.742,I beg your pardon?
1986.86-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2563.742,2567.277,Did the jury know that they had been found competent?
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2567.277,2569.896,"No, the jury is not informed of that, Your Honor."
1986.86-572,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2572.681,2576.3,But they don't know anything about that other hearing?
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2576.3,2578.3,"No, Sir."
1986.86-572,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.358,2615.208,Excuse me.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2644.61,2645.41,"Well, Your Honor."
1986.86-572,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2645.41,2645.91,"To admissibility, right?"
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2645.91,2653.55,Certainly the judge would have the opportunity at the trial to excuse the witness then.
1986.86-572,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2656.585,2659.204,"And again, you asked the judge to do that."
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2659.204,2661.239,"--Yes, you have to ask the judge to do that at that point--"
1986.86-572,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2661.239,2662.622,And that happened in this case.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2662.622,2663.089,--Pardon me?
1986.86-572,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.089,2664.19,And that happened in this case.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2664.19,2667.142,"It happened in this case as to the little boy, yes it did."
1986.86-572,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2730.633,2732.085,That's done in a lot of states.
1986.86-572,1,36475,mark_a_posnansky,,2734.768,2739.656,"I believe that is the federal practice, Your Honor."
1986.86-572,2,38412,penny_r_warren,,3353.453,3355.869,"Your Honor, one very brief clarification."
