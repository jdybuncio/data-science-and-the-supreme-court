1985.85-434,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,65.108,"Mr. Pincus, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,65.108,68.827,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-434,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,127.433,135.955,"I take it, Mr. Pincus, if it weren't for this provision, there would be little question that it had waived that liability by virtue of the Federal Tort Claims Act."
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,135.955,137.555,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1985.85-434,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,380.177,393.585,"Mr. Pincus, at the time it was enacted, I guess the federal government was not liable for personal injury suits; it was before the Federal Tort Claims Act had been passed."
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,393.585,394.12,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-434,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,394.12,408.01,And there is some indication from the language of the full statute and the history that Congress was worried in Section 702 about property damage claims.
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,413.664,425.922,"Well, Your Honor, it didn't specifically refer to personal injury, but it did specifically state, wrote quite broadly, it said no liability of any kind, and it specifically wrote any damage."
1985.85-434,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,442.134,449.939,It just seemed to me that the legislative history didn't paint the clear picture that you say it did here.
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,449.939,476.591,"--Well, Your Honor, we think in light of the broad language of the statute that the question really is whether Congress somehow intended a more limited meaning to be given to the provision, and that in light of this Court's cases, there would have to be a clear indication that that was so in order to read the language narrowly, and the legislative history does have quite a bit of discussion of the injuries that were caused by the 1927 flood and--"
1985.85-434,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,476.591,489.914,"Well, and then you have the concern that even if the language should be read broadly as you suggest, then what is the effect of the subsequent passage of the Federal Tort Claims Act?"
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,489.914,510.745,"--Well, Your Honor, we... even Respondents don't contend that the Tort Claims Act is an implied repeal of Section 702(c), and we think that the proper result would be to read the statutes together, and that section... that the Tort Claims Act would waive sovereign immunity in the areas not covered by Section 702(c)."
1985.85-434,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,519.918,531.408,"It is kind of curious, isn't it, that the Congress didn't make this an exception when it was making out its exceptions for the Tort Claims Act?"
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,531.408,543.199,"Well, Your Honor, we just don't know why Congress might not have done that, but this... it may well be that they knew the statute was on the books and felt it wasn't necessary."
1985.85-434,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,623.335,632.357,"Mr. Pincus, the Millwood project was constructed, as I recall, and a statute enacted in what, 1946?"
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,632.357,634.143,"Yes, Your Honor, 1946."
1985.85-434,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,634.143,638.963,And there was no provision in it comparable to Section 702(c).
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,638.963,640.68,"No, Your Honor, there isn't."
1985.85-434,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,640.68,651.754,And how do you reason that 702(c) applies to subsequently authorized dam projects?
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,651.754,654.372,"Well, for several reasons, Justice Powell."
1985.85-434,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,664.162,672.834,Are there any other provisions of the Act of 1928 that apply to all subsequent water control projects?
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,672.834,675.87,"--No, Your Honor, and we think that is one of the striking differences."
1985.85-434,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,693.197,697.633,But is there any other provision in the 1928 act that applies to all subsequent?
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,697.633,698.068,"--No, Your Honor."
1985.85-434,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,698.935,702.937,And may I ask one other question in this connection?
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,727.42,727.971,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-434,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,737.36,739.312,That specifically address the question I have asked you.
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,739.312,740.612,"--Yes, and they all hold--"
1985.85-434,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,740.612,742.18,All apply 702.
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,742.18,754.405,"--that 702(c) applies to all statutes, and in fact, there are many other Court of Appeals decisions that do not address the question expressly but that apply 702(c) where it is clear that the project was not authorized under the '28 Act."
1985.85-434,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,869.178,874.748,What reason does the Court ascribe for its reluctance?
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,874.748,887.991,"I think the Court has said that where Congress... well, generally, it promotes a settled interpretation of the law, and also, where there is a settled interpretation, Congress can be assumed or in some cases as been made expressly aware of the interpretation."
1985.85-434,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.991,897.097,"Have we ever said that it simply can be assumed that Congress knew about it without any indication, that Congress in fact did know about it?"
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,897.097,905.203,"I don't think you have said that, but there is an indication in this case that Congress did know about the construction of Section 702(c) to which we refer."
1985.85-434,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,930.068,934.222,And was this claim one for property damages or one for personal injury?
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,934.222,944.844,"This was a... this was a property damage claim, but the Court of Claims did not distinguish between property damage and personal injuries."
1985.85-434,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,944.844,947.13,I just wanted to ask another.
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,960.789,962.872,"Yes, Your Honor, that's a summary."
1985.85-434,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.944,974.029,There's another reason for granting immunity to the government?
1985.85-434,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,975.179,975.563,Right.
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,1368.966,1374.354,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1460.476,1466.43,"Do you think the majority of the Court of Appeals would have agreed with this position of yours, Mr. Ward?"
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,1466.43,1468.816,Possibly.
1985.85-434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1488.593,1499.668,"Yes, and in... the decision cast in those terms would not really be an affirmance of the reasoning of the Court of Appeals."
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,1499.668,1504.489,"--That is correct, not of the reasoning; of the result only."
1985.85-434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1569.845,1575.232,"Well, but isn't... isn't there a recreational aspect to almost all flood control projects?"
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,1575.232,1579.101,"Well, there is now, Your Honor, but that was not true in 1928."
1985.85-434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1615.376,1619.411,"Well, but it is still the control of flood waters, isn't it?"
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,1619.411,1621.88,"Well, the recreational use doesn't have anything to do with flood waters."
1985.85-434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1621.88,1628.2,"Well, you... though you get a recreational use by virtue of backing up waters behind a dam, to keep up the waters."
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,1628.2,1630.136,"To that extent, yes, sir, I agree with that."
1985.85-434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1630.136,1633.354,So that there is a considerable relationship between the two.
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,1633.354,1642.276,"Well, they have a common place, that is true, Your Honor, that they conduct... they conduct both activities at the same premises, that is--"
1985.85-434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1642.276,1647.078,"Well, you wouldn't have the recreational use if you didn't have the flood control dam."
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,1647.078,1649.113,"--I agree, yes, sir."
1985.85-434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1738.088,1743.825,"Well, Mr. Ward, when you... it's hard to think of a statute cast in more sweeping terms."
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,1759.101,1760.936,"If that's all we looked at, I would agree, Your Honor."
1985.85-434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1760.936,1767.107,"Well, why, when the legislative history... when the legislative history is clear, why do you look any further?"
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,1767.107,1782.117,"I suggest to Your Honor that if you look at the situation such as Justice O'Connor described, that at that time that the government enjoyed complete immunity from tort claims, then the statute in effect is rendered meaningless at the time of its enactment."
1985.85-434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.594,1824.879,"Well, are you saying that there was an implied repeal of 702(c)?"
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,1824.879,1825.529,"No, no, Your Honor."
1985.85-434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1877.462,1878.698,Where do you get that from?
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,1878.698,1880.799,Cases that we have cited there in our brief.
1985.85-434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1880.799,1882.249,"Well, name one of them."
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,1882.249,1885.184,Nixon v. Fitzgerald.
1985.85-434,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1885.184,1892.44,"Well, but that's a kind of an immunity that is created... announced by this Court."
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,1894.157,1901.213,"No, no, Your Honor, but I believe it still stands for the proposition that in any immunity doctrine, you're still talking about the function."
1985.85-434,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2098.39,2103.627,"How could the statute have been more expansive in its absolute terms, Mr. Ward?"
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,2103.627,2105.21,"I do not believe it could have, Your Honor."
1985.85-434,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2105.21,2105.777,How?
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,2105.777,2108.762,"I say I don't believe that it could have been more expansive, I agree to that--"
1985.85-434,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2108.762,2110.964,"Well, didn't it bar all liability?"
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,2110.964,2111.364,--If--
1985.85-434,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2111.364,2112.816,Isn't that the language of the statute?
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,2112.816,2122.022,"--That is the language of the statute without going further, yes, Your Honor, and we are suggesting though for other reasons that the scope of the immunity should be more narrowly construed."
1985.85-434,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2237.13,2246.32,"Well, Mr. Ward, I guess the District Courts, though, did find that the damages were caused by flood waters."
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,2246.32,2247.102,They found that one of--
1985.85-434,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2247.102,2257.877,"They didn't find that damages were caused by operation of the ferry boat on flood waters, they found that here these people were drowned by the flood water."
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,2257.877,2259.51,"--That is correct, Justice O'Connor, and--"
1985.85-434,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2259.51,2264.197,"So I think that answers part of your argument, I must say."
1985.85-434,1,43483,t_john_ward,,2264.197,2273.303,--They also found that the negligence in failing to maintain the buoys was a proximate cause of the injuries as well.
1985.85-434,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2803.831,2805.9,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Pincus?"
1985.85-434,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2805.9,2810.535,"A few things, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.85-434,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2902.126,2924.908,"So, Mr. Pincus, if a federal employee was out on the reservoir in a motor boat to carry out his duties and negligently ran over some swimmer, and the swimmer then drowned in the flood water, the government is immune?"
1985.85-434,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2924.908,2935.216,"--Yes, Your Honor, as long as the, as long as the flood waters were a legal cause of the, of the damage, which might be--"
1985.85-434,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2935.216,2946.422,"Well, the water in the reservoir filled the lungs of the swimmer, and the swimmer died as a result of being run over by the federal officer."
1985.85-434,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2946.422,2960.664,"--Yes, that's our position, if the two causes were completely unrelated, leaving aside, for example, the intentional tort exception to the Tort Claims Act, if the federal employee shot someone in a boat--"
1985.85-434,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2960.664,2962.966,"No, my example was negligence."
1985.85-434,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2962.966,2964.216,"--No, no, I understand."
1985.85-434,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3022.938,3023.272,Very well.
