1961.81,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,13.449,"Number 81, Thomson Griggs, Petitioner, versus County of Allegheny."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,14.712,19.24,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,593.23,595.968,"Mr. Blair, were any of these matters contested?"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,595.968,596.326,No sir.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,599.818,603.33,Any question as to the actual damage --
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,603.33,604.092,No sir.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,604.092,605.318,-- to your client?
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,605.318,610.229,"No, the County offered no testimony at --"
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,610.229,612.309,Where did the controversy get down to?
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,612.309,629.087,"The controversy gets down to one question whether or not the County is liable, as an owner and operator of this public airport for taking of an easement over the plaintiff's over the petitioner's property and that's the sole question before you whether or not, there was a taking after which the --"
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,629.087,633.058,"Well, is there any question that there was a taking?"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,633.058,633.219,Yes sir.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,633.219,634.941,Or was there a question of who took?
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,634.941,640.436,"Yes and well, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania doesn't say there was or wasn't a taking."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,640.436,641.465,Alright.
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,645.069,650.883,"Well, they placed upon in the State Supreme Court I don't know well how that was -- that's in contest."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,662.254,670.791,"But the -- your Supreme Court said, even if there were -- assuming there was a taking, the County is not liable."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,670.791,671.403,That's what they say.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,671.403,672.174,That's the issue.
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,672.174,673.206,That's the issue.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,673.206,674.079,And that's the only issue --
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,674.079,675.829,And that's the only issue involved in this case.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,675.829,684.095,But we're not here to -- we're not here reviewing a denial by your Court that property was taken.
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,690.215,705.404,"That's exactly the question, Your Honor and we so state it in our brief and that was basis on which it went up to the Supreme Court whether or not, the County was liable for a taking under the circumstances that exist in this particular situation."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,705.404,709.775,"And your burden here is, to disprove the conclusion of the Supreme Court --"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,709.775,709.985,Yes sir.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,709.985,714.236,"-- that if there was a taking, you're not the County who is responsible."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,714.647,715.783,I beg your pardon?
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,715.783,729.294,"Your burden is to undermine the conclusion of the Supreme Court -- forgive me, that assuming there was a taking, the County didn't do the taking, the County isn't liable."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,729.294,730.269,Yes sir.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,730.269,731.485,And what do you say to that?
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,731.485,737.755,"I say to that that this first, the County selected the location of the airport."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,804.778,800.59,Could you sue the airlines?
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,806.052,822.11,"Well, we might sue the airlines but if we did so, we would be running counter to the Federal in the stand to the counter of the Air Commerce Act which say, these airlines are flying exactly where there are required to fly."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,822.11,827.511,"And then in your view, the airlines were not tortfeasors, were they?"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,827.511,836.336,"In our view, the airlines are flying where they are compelled to fly under the regulations of the Civil Aeronautics Board."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,836.336,840.211,"But you could not sue them under your view, is that right?"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,844.771,845.151,No sir.
1961.81,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,852.395,858.393,"If the airlines were liable too, they wouldn't be liable for a taking of your property --"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,858.393,858.719,No sir.
1961.81,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,858.719,860.515,-- they will be liable for injuring at --
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,860.515,875.292,"That would be liable under trespass problem and because of the repeated trespasses, we would be given power and the law of Pennsylvania could go in and restrain their operation over our property."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,875.292,879.513,"Well if there should be -- if they are trespasses, you could sue them in damages, couldn't you?"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,879.513,899.829,"Well, we could sue them in damage if Your Honor please but we could never prove damages where we haven't -- we included in our record here a part of the testimony taken that this hearing before the Board of View showing the utter impossibility of locating or determining which claim cause damage or how much."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,904.811,907.113,How many airlines come in over this?
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,907.113,921.224,"Well, if Your Honor please, that's not over the -- the suggestion of our Supreme Court is that we sue the commercial airlines, but there are more planes in commercial airlines were scheduled, planes that go over our property."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,926.169,930.297,I'm not suggesting that you haven't got a case against the County.
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,944.569,945.278,Yes.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,945.278,957.902,"And the suggestion that I thought you were making is that even assuming if the airlines are liable, the County is also liable and they both as if were joined towards tortfeasors but you reject that."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,957.902,962.4,"Now, well there can't be a joint -- joint tortfeasors here."
1961.81,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,994.57,998.687,Suppose they would come in on under instructions from the tower that --
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,998.687,1000.327,"They all do so, if Your Honor please."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1014.127,1016.559,"Well then, why don't you sue the United States then?"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1016.559,1019.68,Because United States is not liable for this.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1020.183,1030.964,But if -- you just answer Justice Douglas with what they had did to your damage was under the orders of the United States and you said the United States can't give orders that takes away your property.
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1030.964,1033.217,That is exactly right.
1961.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1066.727,1069.682,Has the Government appeared in this case in any way?
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1069.682,1071.058,No sir.
1961.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1074.479,1075.345,Who notified it?
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1076.79,1077.705,No sir.
1961.81,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1102.419,1105.461,"What is the County – it's the county of the lessor, is it?"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1105.461,1105.901,No sir.
1961.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1115.755,1119.702,Did I understand you to say that they have to get consent of the Government to build it?
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1119.702,1120.226,No.
1961.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1121.668,1122.197,To operate it?
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1122.197,1138.866,But since they wanted to participate in the National Airport Plan and they wanted an adequate transport -- air transport facilities they have to conform to a certain regulations of the Federal Government to ensure safety.
1961.81,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1146.25,1148.261,"They also got a subsidy, did they not?"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1148.261,1153.585,They got a subsidy of 5 or $6 million in order to help to build this plane.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1168.016,1180.027,"But did I understand you to say that the flights, the height to which they went -- the bonus, all were in conformity with some orders from Washington."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1180.027,1183.602,They all fly – they all follow a pattern of flight and --
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1183.602,1187.511,"And they couldn't -- and they couldn't deviate from that, could they?"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1187.511,1190.753,"Well, if they did, they'd be violating the air commerce, the Board's instructions."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1190.753,1200.128,"Therefore, what they did can fairly and accurately be called conduct under authorization of Federal Government --"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1200.128,1213.002,"The – the airlines always say that they are privileged, that they are privileged to fly where they are flying and they are not only privileged but they have to fly here in order to comply with the regulations."
1961.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1249.144,1251.561,How many -- how many miles do they have to buy?
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1251.561,1255.29,"Well that's merely two miles at 10,000 feet."
1961.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1255.29,1257.671,That's your -- your place is that far?
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1257.671,1261.377,"No, our place is three piece of a mile about 32,00 feet sir."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1261.377,1290.782,"Mr. Blair, would you even have to explain to me the difference between the responsibility of the Government when negligent conduct by the fellow in the signal tower out here at the airport and the responsibility of the Government in authorizing indeed requiring flights under the circumstances you've narrated which makes those in roads upon what you deem your property rights."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1290.782,1308.354,"One -- there are one, whether it's negligent operation, there we would have to sue the person who committed the negligence and that because he would not be performing his duties according to the requirements of law."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1321.593,1332.109,"Well, if it's for the benefit of the country to make these flights even lots of takings for the benefit of the country but Uncle Sam has to pay for it."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1332.109,1332.484,That's right sir.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1332.484,1348.477,"And if Uncle Sam thinks it's for the benefit of the country to make those in roads to be appreciate or to take -- physically to take if you will, your property buying the duty of compensation exist."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1348.477,1369.185,"Well, in the first place, if Your Honor please, there can't be any blanket condemnation of air space unless there is some authority for it and there were had -- there's no act which permits the blanket condemnation that's faced by the Federal Government in any – in any particular instance."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1369.185,1380.06,"But of course if we didn't say you must condemn it, what the Court decided was that there is an implied taking under the Fifth Amendment and therefore compensation has to be paid."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1380.06,1380.543,That's right.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1380.543,1389.606,"And why is it not true here so far as United States is concerned, as the efficient creator of this situation?"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1389.606,1395.555,Whether the United States that the Civil Aeronautics Board does not have authority to take.
1961.81,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1395.555,1404.907,"Well, isn't the answer Mr. Blair that the United States did locate the airplane, the airport three miles from your property, didn't it?"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1404.907,1405.37,No sir.
1961.81,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1407.523,1408.489,The County did that.
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1411.225,1418.39,"All that United States says is if you erect an airport, you must do it in conformance with its safety requirements of the Federal --"
1961.81,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1418.39,1420.749,"And operate it under such and such regulations, isn't it?"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1420.749,1421.245,That's right.
1961.81,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1426.038,1429.881,"Now if it's the case, we have an actual Government owned --"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1429.881,1431.755,And that's the distinction for it.
1961.81,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1432.66,1433.814,-- airport (Inaudible)
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1433.814,1442.221,"But Mr. Blair, the mischief is not the location of the airport but what is the use to which it is put."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1442.221,1442.904,Yes sir.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1442.904,1446.073,And as I -- I have no information of it other than you give me.
1961.81,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1458.951,1461.159,They don't have to fly airplanes there.
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1463.779,1464.643,And that's --
1961.81,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1464.643,1466.135,Or orders of the Federal Government.
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1466.135,1477.025,There's no mandate in the Federal Government to do anything except to fly in safe way and that's for the protection of the public and for the traveling public and the people on the ground.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1477.025,1495.743,But is there any requirement or authorization that the United States should compel a use of an airport only under such conditions that it takes away a neighbor's property?
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1495.842,1506.613,"No, I don't think the United States says that the -- and the owner of the airport or of any other subdivision of the State has got to take the property."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1523.476,1535.425,"But the Civil Aeronautics Board has made safety regulations that would've not disadvantaged you or taken away any of your property rights, could they?"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1535.425,1535.859,No sir.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1538.165,1539.699,Not at all.
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1539.699,1546.473,They have to travel in certain levels and to get out in there under this approach on two miles out.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1571.725,1584.073,"As I understand, now you're saying that all that the Government did was to say that if you're going to use an airport, you've got to use it -- the only way to use the airport is under these conditions."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1584.073,1584.351,That's right.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1584.351,1588.39,"And if that entails taking somebody's property, that's your concern and not ours."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1588.39,1589.828,That is correct Your Honor please.
1961.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1603.864,1606.914,"They go a long way towards furnishing (Inaudible), haven't they?"
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1606.914,1609.669,[Attempt to Laughter] that may be but I don't know of that.
1961.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1609.669,1619.189,"Don't they require the operator – is there nay way to avoid this dilemma except not to build an airport or to pay your people, or advice you to cooperate."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1619.189,1642.82,"Well, [Attempt to Laughter] that may be the -- that's unfortunate that you understand these people and at the beginning lived in this country atmosphere out here where they were in a quiet surroundings know that they didn't want to leave this place or to give or to surrender these properties to have the airfield there, that didn't benefit them."
1961.81,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1645.055,1647.839,(Inaudible) of money could even be worse.
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1647.839,1649.425,That could be. I think I --
1961.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1649.425,1652.287,They can go straight up and come straight down.
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1652.287,1652.919,Sir?
1961.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1652.919,1654.394,They can go straight up and come straight down.
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1654.394,1656.077,"Oh, well that's what they say."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1658.83,1675.539,How do you differ this -- how do you differ this kind of laws from the laws that comes to your private interest where no road is shut or road is closed or the road is open and it means depreciation in property sometimes --
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1675.539,1675.781,Well then --
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1675.781,1677.687,-- a very large percentage?
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1677.687,1680.343,"Well that's a little different, if Your Honor please."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1729.407,1751.026,"But it's the -- it's the commonwealth, if your commonwealth or your County leases a tract of land to an approach to another building would necessarily the lessor of the State, the County be liable or trucks to go over somebody else's property but was merely the lessee."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1751.026,1751.676,Well.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1751.676,1765.746,"What's -- what's the difficulty of your Supreme Court with this case is that all the damage was done was done not by the County, but by those they gave these rights to fly over your land."
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1765.746,1768.135,"Well, that's what our Supreme Court says."
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1768.135,1768.911,Yes.
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1768.911,1770.856,But that is not what we say.
1961.81,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1770.856,1777.53,And you say that this County is liable because they gave the airlines opportunity to inflict damage.
1961.81,0,43821,william_a_blair,,1777.53,1784.074,Not in (Voice Overlap) and that the County has the interest of having the airlines serve the County.
1961.81,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1826.046,1827.857,Mr. Louik.
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,1827.857,1833.681,If the Court please.
1961.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1929.067,1952.048,"Mr. Louik, if those four criteria mean that the County for these four reasons didn't need to acquire the easement of this man's property, wouldn't they equally stand for the proposition that the county didn't even need to acquire the land on which the runway were."
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,1955.982,1975.07,"Your Honor, the reason the Supreme Court, our the Pennsylvania Supreme Court although there were four findings here actually based their conclusion only on 29 and 30 is so far as the County's liability."
1961.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1983.053,1987.307,"Well, but my point of view is that -- let's just then confine it to 29 and 30."
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2009.9,2011.297,"Now well, that --"
1961.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2011.297,2014.099,Even the actual land on which the airport is located.
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2015.557,2023.344,The property on which the airport is located is actually physically used by the County.
1961.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2140.207,2142.34,"Why do you limit it to 2,500 feet?"
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2152.994,2169.955,"Well, the reason I say 2,500 feet is because that the tightest contention is that we have taken his property by reason of the fact that he is in the approach zone limiting to the allegations in this case."
1961.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2169.955,2178.003,In the own -- where the constant passage of the plane annoying so much that the amounts to taking within the cause of case.
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2182.22,2193.768,"On the basis of the plaintiff's complaint that because he is in the approach zone, and I'm saying if that is true, then we have taken everything in the approach zone which extends up to 2,500 feet."
1961.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2193.768,2205.608,"How far could you get out of Pittsburgh and why could you put one outside the Pittsburgh, it would save you taking all the property within two to three miles by reason of the noise."
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2205.608,2208.232,"Well, you couldn't, Your Honor."
1961.81,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2234.788,2236.415,Doesn't a zoning ordinance --
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2236.415,2236.885,Pardon me.
1961.81,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2236.885,2241.982,Do you have this -- does the County have any zoning ordinance with connection with this airport?
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2241.982,2245.175,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, we do have a zoning --"
1961.81,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2245.175,2249.128,What is the provision with regard to this property and I'm thinking of this.
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2264.5,2286.906,"Well, we have a zoning ordinance which of course is not involved in this case, but it is a zoning ordinance which prohibits certain heights of buildings and certain types of structures with a minimum -- I believe that's 25 feet that you can build anything that's 25 feet above the ground."
1961.81,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2295.826,2298.129,But the landing of the airplanes and then taking off.
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2298.129,2299.483,That is correct.
1961.81,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2299.483,2300.646,Yes.
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2300.646,2303.153,"Now, the basis of this case --"
1961.81,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2303.153,2310.836,"And the County to that affect, to that extent has affected this -- the use of this land, has it not?"
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2310.836,2317.661,As any community was affecting use of land by reason of any zoning ordinance.
1961.81,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2337.673,2346.669,"And that has -- whether it's reasonable not, has nothing to do with the ownership of property of the governmental unit, does it?"
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2346.669,2348.916,That is correct.
1961.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2362.34,2380.826,"If it is then -- why if it is the taking by somebody, either by the Government, or the County or somebody here, to me it is a taking, why would the County (Inaudible) taking?"
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2380.826,2385.465,"Well, assuming that it is a taking, --"
1961.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2385.465,2390.957,But it wasn't -- do you have to assume in under the Causby case?
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2390.957,2394.458,"Your Honor, we have to assume that in this sense."
1961.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2427.012,2429.535,"I think the dissent insisted on something like this, but --"
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2429.535,2430.682,Yes.
1961.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2430.682,2431.704,-- it was in --
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2431.704,2437.898,"I think in your dissent, Your Honor, you pointed out exactly the problem that we have now."
1961.81,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2467.933,2469.147,"It was leased, was it?"
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2469.147,2472.899,It was leased from a municipality.
1961.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2535.391,2542.347,Was it not also the entity that which is responsible for the rules that required the low flying.
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2542.347,2570.401,"In the Causby case also, the Court -- this Court did not indicate the basis upon which the decision was founded in that whether the United States was held liable by reason of the fact that it promulgated the regulations or by reason of the fact that it operated the aircraft, but those two facts did remain or do remain in that case."
1961.81,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2612.574,2639.69,"But what do you say to Mr. Blair's suggestion that your Supreme Court relegated the petitioner here or (Inaudible) be the petitioner to a suit against the airlines but that perhaps his choice that Mr. Blair as the Court gives his client that you, whom you will sue and for what."
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2645.94,2650.265,"Well, Your Honor please and I answer that in this way."
1961.81,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2929.146,2939.497,Did I understand Mr. Blair to say that this is unnecessary flight pattern that you're going to have any flight there at all?
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2939.497,2939.749,Well --
1961.81,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2939.749,2950.649,"You have to fly that low with reference to his property, -- with reference to his property, the lowness of the flight is inevitable and therefore damaging."
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,2950.649,2958.165,"Well, certainly, at one stage of the flight of the flight is going to be low."
1961.81,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2986.03,3009.003,"But that's something -- I don't think that answers the claim that if they have to be necessarily low of course to interfere with the property interest of land owners, you can't fly otherwise but if you do fly, you have to pay for the necessary damage for your necessary flight."
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,3016.143,3067.677,"Well, Your Honor, there are some other very perplexing problems on this -- in this matter but which are not in this case at this time and that is the whole problem of what constitutes navigable airspace and what the Federal Government has done by saying that there is an absolute freedom of transit in the navigable airspace of the United States and whether the United States by reason of the passage of that act has taken property or whether that property, whether this was a property right that has never belonged to a property owner has always been on the public domain."
1961.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3112.329,3114.72,I do not quite understand that.
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,3160.169,3173.646,"Well, the County would not be liable if we built a road or we build a road and the road was used and caused damage to adjoining property."
1961.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3173.915,3175.2,"Well, suppose it got over the land."
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,3175.2,3193.299,"Well, now, when it goes over the land, the question comes up as to whether there is ownership in that airspace in the plaintiff, in the property owner for which he is entitled to any damage."
1961.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3193.299,3195.682,Has any Court treated it just that way?
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,3199.626,3210.476,"Well, in the Causby case, they said that there was a taking by reason of the flight."
1961.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3257.301,3271.871,"Well, you have to assume do you not if they're flying in that space causes him the same kind of annoyance that the people in the Causby case was caused by the flying of the planes there."
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,3274.635,3299.903,"Yes, Your Honor that's in the case but our position which was not adopted by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in this case although it was followed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the Gardner case was that when these planes were flying over the plaintiff's property, they where flying within the navigable airspace."
1961.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3311.18,3315.491,"I think the argument such that were rejected, was it not, in the Causby case?"
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,3315.491,3316.303,No.
1961.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3366.704,3385.746,"There must -- there must be a limit so that the Federal Government couldn't simply by legislative or administrative fiat say that the -- all the airspace of the United States more than 10 feet off the ground is -- belongs to the Federal Government, is that it?"
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,3385.746,3387.857,"Well, I don't think --"
1961.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3387.857,3392.346,-- (Inaudible) down eventually it's going to land.
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,3394.171,3402.348,"Whether or not the Government is liable, it's not a position that I have to take Your Honor."
1961.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3444.498,3453.045,I thought the change in the regulations to redefine navigable airspace was a point in your case.
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,3453.045,3488.912,"Well, our Supreme Court made at this point, they said that they were not -- that our arguments had the rationale of reality but they couldn't accept it by reason of the Causby case and then they pointed out that there have been changes since the Causby case but their decision rested on this other matter that the acts complied of, that is the drafting of master plan, drawing of grant agreement, did not constitute and enacted them in the domain by the County but that the plaintiff had other remedies."
1961.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3488.912,3500.742,But you're here defending the judgment and you're entitled to defend it on any basis you want to either on the grounds upon which the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania relied or any other grounds.
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,3500.742,3503.793,We have so presented that in our brief.
1961.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3503.793,3508.413,The change in the regulations of defining navigable airspace certainly would be relevant consideration.
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,3508.413,3515.015,-- and the decisions of the lower courts in connection with that.
1961.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3625.165,3630.555,The same it would be true if you got new airplanes that needed a thousand more feet of landing strip.
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,3631.964,3635.775,"Well, we would -- but then that would be an act of the County."
1961.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3667.706,3675.111,I'm a little surprised that you have not taken a little bit difference with the opinion to this effect.
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,3747.464,3752.901,"Your Honor, I will say that we have touched upon that in our brief."
1961.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3769.245,3781.633,"There's allegation here, is there, that the County as these things have operated in any manner, it's not perfectly legal under the law which is the supreme law of the land that of the United States Government in this respect."
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,3781.633,3788.681,"As I've read these findings, the findings arguably that they operated strictly in accordance with the Federal --"
1961.81,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3788.681,3793.231,Your argument gets down to the colloquial who done it.
1961.81,1,36227,maurice_louik,,3793.231,3794.917,And that is right Your Honor.
1961.81,2,43821,william_a_blair,,3803.104,3812.385,"Before I begin Your Honor, if the Court please, we have a request permission to file supplemental citation at your brief."
1961.81,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3828.308,3830.995,"You may do so and if there are any others, you may file them, Mr."
1961.81,2,43821,william_a_blair,,3830.995,3837.866,And the all three disagree with the opinion of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in this case.
1961.81,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3837.866,3839.629,But I suppose you wouldn't have filed them otherwise.
1961.81,2,43821,william_a_blair,,3839.629,3840.887,Sir?
1961.81,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3840.887,3843.187,"You wouldn't have filed them otherwise, would you?"
1961.81,2,43821,william_a_blair,,3843.187,3845.194,"Well, that's possible."
