2007.06-1457,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,3.702,I'll repeat myself.
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,28.583,46.629,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in this case reasonably denied Respondent's request to modify the wholesale contracts that the purchasing power companies had entered into in 2000 and 2001."
2007.06-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,84.154,94.462,"But FERC thought it could live with the Ninth Circuit's decision, because the government recommended that we deny cert in this case; isn't that so?"
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,94.462,114.873,"--That is... that is correct, and FERC thought that perhaps the decision could be limited to the circumstances arising out of the California energy crisis in the years 2000 to 2001, and that it could channel its concerns about contract stability through those other factors."
2007.06-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.972,150.714,"Wasn't it clear to the government that the Ninth Circuit, which is what, about 10 percent of the country, was going to continue this interpretation of the act, and that was not a matter of any consequence to FERC or to the government?"
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,150.714,157.452,"It was of consequence, but FERC still believed it had some interpretive authority after the decision."
2007.06-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,165.222,170.524,"But, Mr. Kneedler, this is a decision, the Ninth Circuit decision, that empowers FERC."
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,193.105,200.193,"--Well, two decisions of this Court and 50 years of intervening FERC, before that Federal Power Commission, practice."
2007.06-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.193,201.145,"Well, wait, wait, wait."
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,212.869,213.203,Right.
2007.06-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,250.476,251.828,I thought... let's go back a step.
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,261.6,262.0,"Well, FERC--"
2007.06-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,262.0,272.288,"So it's not what FERC... FERC independently interpreting the statute to reach the conclusion, which it might, to reach the conclusion the Ninth Circuit did."
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,277.925,278.609,--No.
2007.06-1457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,395.169,414.148,"What happens if that approval is given and then a seller enters into contracts and then it's later discovered that, contrary to what FERC thought when it granted the approval, the seller has exercised market power or has otherwise manipulated the market?"
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,416.6,426.789,"Well, what the Commission determined in this case is that there was... there was no manipulation or exercise of market power identified with respect to these specific contracts."
2007.06-1457,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,468.635,483.394,"Just so I understand your answer to Justice Alito's question, the Commission has retroactive authority to alter the permission to engage in these contracts only if there is fraud--"
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,483.394,484.627,No it can... I'm sorry--
2007.06-1457,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,484.627,485.977,--or something similar?
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,485.977,492.547,"--Once it has granted market based rate authority, FERC can revoke that."
2007.06-1457,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,495.416,496.083,Retroactive?
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,496.083,496.633,--Pardon?
2007.06-1457,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,496.633,497.183,Retroactively?
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,497.183,498.118,No.
2007.06-1457,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,499.718,514.061,"But Justice Alito's question, I think as I understood it, or at least a question in my mind that followed upon it, was whether or not... what's the basis for any retroactive revocation of that or--"
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,514.061,515.496,"--No, it wouldn't be retroactive."
2007.06-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,519.114,534.124,"Would it be a public interest finding, a finding that because of the market manipulation by the seller that affected this very contract, the public interest demands that we not hold the--"
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,534.124,534.474,Yes.
2007.06-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,538.343,540.212,--I didn't say fraud.
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,541.378,543.83,Or market manipulation.
2007.06-1457,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,543.83,556.906,"Isn't the remedy for the finding of market manipulation the abrogation of the contract, which is a separate process from, from the revocation of market based tariff?"
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,556.906,557.34,There are.
2007.06-1457,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,559.189,560.958,"The same reason may support each, but--"
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,560.958,561.341,--Right.
2007.06-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,587.009,590.044,Did the companies who were involved in this case make those reports?
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,602.184,606.553,"--There was, and the Ninth Circuit found that in the Lockyer decision."
2007.06-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.996,624.098,"Mr. Kneedler, I'm not entirely understanding you."
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,643.695,645.011,"No, that is certainly correct."
2007.06-1457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,652.567,653.117,--I understand.
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,667.794,672.096,"And we don't think it should, except to the extent the public interest standard is met."
2007.06-1457,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,672.096,675.65,"--Maybe I think I led us into this, Mr. Kneedler."
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,724.496,724.813,Yes.
2007.06-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,738.973,740.29,"Mr. Kneedler, I do have one question."
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,774.329,780.833,"This is such a challenge, but what FERC has concluded is that the public interest standard has to be satisfied in that situation."
2007.06-1457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,788.906,795.827,And how did FERC monitor the rates vigorously to make sure they were reasonable?
2007.06-1457,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,795.827,813.854,"--There was extensive staff studies and monitoring in subsequent decisions that are, that are shown and that are in the joint appendix, in April... in January and April and June when FERC came up with its final program to mitigate the problems in the spot market."
2007.06-1457,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,813.854,821.294,Mr. Dellinger.
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,821.294,833.185,"Justice Stevens, good morning, and may it please the Court: Justice Ginsburg began by asking whether the Ninth Circuit decision did not in fact empower rather than restrict the authority of the Commission."
2007.06-1457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,943.237,960.933,"Well, those decisions are puzzling transposed to this setting, because in those decisions it was the seller who had made a bad bargain; the price was too low; and the seller wanted to get out, right?"
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,960.933,961.468,Yes.
2007.06-1457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,961.468,963.385,And now we are transposing that.
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,985.166,985.633,"Well, yes."
2007.06-1457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1043.02,1046.99,That's the same order where they said we are going to monitor the rates for reasonableness.
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1046.99,1047.79,That is true.
2007.06-1457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1088.733,1089.617,Can I ask this question?
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1110.514,1130.31,"No; and it's very important that not be a basis, because if that were the case, parties would know and parties... both... all parties were aware that there was volatility, and the Commission had announced that the conditions were conducive to manipulation of the spot markets."
2007.06-1457,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1167.268,1171.804,Is volatile the same as dysfunctional?
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1171.804,1176.356,"Justice Kennedy, I don't know precisely what the Ninth Circuit means by dysfunctional."
2007.06-1457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1187.697,1202.757,"Mr. Dellinger, does that mean that it is your position that no matter how dysfunctional the market was, just complete turmoil, as long as the contract was made in good faith without any fraud or abuse of power, it's a binding contract?"
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1202.757,1214.398,"--That is correct, unless... and this is an important unless... the Commission reviews those contract terms and finds that the public interest necessitates a revision of the contract."
2007.06-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.504,1225.539,For example--
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1225.539,1226.122,--For example--
2007.06-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1226.122,1233.81,"--For example, if the prices down the road turn out to be so high for the utility, that the utility would go out of business?"
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1233.81,1238.264,--That is an example that the Court gave in Mobile and... and Sierra.
2007.06-1457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1337.027,1361.828,"You said the Commission is on the job, but one of the pieces of information here is that the Commission staff said that the dysfunction in the spot market carried over into the forward market, such that prices in the forward market were inflated."
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1361.828,1363.545,--That is correct.
2007.06-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1410.091,1413.443,"I don't understand what that statement means, anyway."
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1422.149,1422.799,--Right.
2007.06-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.318,1430.055,"Does it mean that because of the current dysfunction, you can't predict for sure what the rates are going to be down the road?"
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1434.374,1435.376,--Yes.
2007.06-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1436.059,1439.078,And isn't that why you enter into long term contracts?
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1439.078,1439.778,--Yes.
2007.06-1457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.145,1443.982,Because given the current dysfunction you have no idea what the price is going to be down the road.
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1443.982,1444.765,That's exactly right.
2007.06-1457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1444.765,1450.218,"Mr. Dellinger, wasn't the staff saying something more than that in that... in that report?"
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1450.218,1465.145,"I don't... I don't know what you're intimating, but what the conclusion was of the Commission was, for example, that there was no basis to support a finding that the Respondents exercised market--"
2007.06-1457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1465.145,1468.53,"But the Commission didn't... didn't respond to the staff report, right?"
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1471.632,1481.055,"--Well, the Commission expressly said with respect to the... to the staff report that there was no evidence of any manipulation."
2007.06-1457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1481.055,1483.624,Did they say it with respect to the staff report?
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1487.492,1488.26,Yes.
2007.06-1457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.536,1554.403,All right.
2007.06-1457,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1554.403,1555.286,--unless there are further questions.
2007.06-1457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.94,1561.307,Mr. Wright.
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1561.307,1581.287,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start off by picking up on Justice Ginsburg's observation that FERC understood itself to be without discretion here, and add the point that this is an extremely unusual case where FERC thought it lacked discretion to apply the statute."
2007.06-1457,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1593.978,1603.217,"Among your arguments, and the arguments of the Respondent, seems to be in some tension... seems to me in some tension to FERC's market based rate program."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1611.306,1616.793,--I... there is much that we don't disagree with about the market based rate program.
2007.06-1457,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1677.765,1705.9,"Isn't it... isn't it a central requirement of a market based rate program that FERC cannot, except perhaps in very limited circumstances, go back and undo contracts that had been entered into under that program, based on a retrospective determination that the rates are not just and reasonable, in the same sense that <FERC> [= FERC] would have applied that term if the utility had simply filed a tariff?"
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1705.9,1710.421,"Justice Alito, all rates must be just and reasonable."
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1739.271,1741.807,"No, but I guess this is what's bothering us."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1785.5,1786.086,--Yes.
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1806.95,1811.068,"Well, how do we know when we're only in the second worst?"
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1811.635,1812.235,--Well--
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1812.235,1815.688,"Well, but I mean the problem is--"
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1815.688,1816.055,"--No, no--"
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1816.055,1835.7,"--And I don't see any... and I realize that you're giving me limiting principles to what seems to me in effect a general rule that says no contracts are enforceable, if they are made during periods of market volatility, however sensible they may be given the premise of that volatility."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1847.441,1855.28,"--Well, Your Honor, of course the Federal Power Act instructs a Federal agency to ensure that rates are just and reasonable."
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1858.832,1859.265,Look--
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1859.265,1860.998,"--The FERC, FERC needs to grapple with this."
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1860.998,1869.521,"--That's a good... I mean that's a fine general phrase, but the question is, is it possible to make an enforceable contract under these circumstances?"
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1869.521,1869.871,Well--
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1869.871,1871.556,I haven't heard a limiting principle yet.
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1872.623,1873.408,--I have three others.
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1891.386,1899.892,Did these... did... did the Petitioners here... do you claim that the Petitioners here were guilty of failure to report?
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1899.892,1902.359,--Yes.
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1911.367,1915.152,That's... that's a different issue.
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1934.046,1938.717,--Our... our basic argument is the rates weren't just and reasonable--
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1938.717,1939.967,That's what I thought.
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1939.967,1943.519,--And the rates weren't just and reasonable on the day the contracts were signed.
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1943.921,1947.473,"Okay, but here I just want to make sure I understand."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1971.171,1989.55,"--My third is, as Commissioner Massey stated in his dissent, without contradiction by the majority, that if the just and reasonable standard were... would be applied, these rates would be declared unlawful, because they were multiples of traditional prices."
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1989.55,1995.72,"Okay, but that seems to me consistent with the problem that I have with your argument."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2026.356,2046.069,"The fourth one is, as Justice Ginsburg has noted, that FERC said in December 2000, before all of the contracts at issue were negotiated, that it would monitor and... and would... deems rates above $74 suspect."
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2060.277,2075.018,"Okay, I can understand... under your fourth point, I could understand the position if the argument were this is above $74, and therefore it is suspect; but the claim you're making, as I understand it, is a much broader claim."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2084.225,2085.444,"Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2088.746,2092.531,"And when you get there, you're saying abrogate this contract."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2092.531,2095.317,"We are saying reduce the rates, and--"
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2095.317,2099.804,Are you saying... have you at any point said reduce the rates to $74?
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2099.804,2104.523,--I'm sure different... there are many different parties on my side.
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2109.727,2114.13,"I will... I will stop the cross examination, but I just wanted to get the four points."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2114.13,2116.832,--I appreciate the cross examination.
2007.06-1457,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2119.95,2127.77,"If... if your theory prevails and you go back to the Commission, does the Morgan Stanley contract, where the lower rate seller was, does that get reevaluated, too?"
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2131.072,2145.648,"--Well, I... does Morgan Stanley's... well, Morgan Stanley actually... a number of parties in Morgan Stanley's situation chose to file protective actions, and Morgan Stanley didn't."
2007.06-1457,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2151.485,2159.675,"Let me say that, consistent with your theory, that everybody... that this whole unwinding process backs up all the way down to the original seller?"
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2159.675,2160.058,Right.
2007.06-1457,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.892,2187.844,"Well, good for them."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2195.981,2200.752,"We're not, Your Honor, but I would remind you this is a plain language case."
2007.06-1457,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2208.674,2212.726,But how would you... how would you go about determining in this case?
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2224.433,2225.2,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2007.06-1457,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2283.972,2288.376,--Didn't your clients know that the market was chaotic at the time they entered into this long term contract?
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2306.087,2310.039,"Your Honor, we had a sort of a Henry Ford choice."
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2325.365,2334.688,You were saying that the most... the most reasonable thing for us to do was to enter into a long term contract in order to mitigate the effects of the chaotic spot market.
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2336.107,2342.86,"--In large part, because FERC had told us they were going to monitor these contracts and use the $74 benchmark."
2007.06-1457,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.86,2344.962,"In fact, you did very well under these contracts."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2358.403,2363.107,"Your Honor, it's our position that we have to prove these were just and reasonable on the day they were entered."
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2381.818,2385.72,"Mr. Wright, may I go back to your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question?"
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2458.3,2468.94,"Your Honor, we think that FERC could, and it seems clear that it will, distinguish between the spot market and long term contracts on these bases."
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2487.035,2499.343,"Yes, but with respect, doesn't that, in effect, mean... going back to your answer to Justice Ginsburg... that what you really want is to say there wasn't effective competition."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2519.004,2531.73,"Well, Your Honor, again, I don't think we should prevail, and it's not our position that we prevail, unless we show that we didn't have just and reasonable alternatives at the time we entered into the contract."
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2533.747,2540.17,"No, but I mean... that's where I don't think that, at least with me, helps your argument."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2633.445,2639.649,"--Well, Your Honor, let me make clear what... what we mean by ""chaos"" or ""high volatility""."
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2650.807,2656.025,"Are you entitled to relief if there was manipulation, but these people were not engaging in the manipulation?"
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2665.983,2679.574,--We... we don't think that a statute that protects consumers and says that consumers get just and reasonable rates was enacted to prevent... to overcome contracts only when there is fraud in the contract.
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2679.574,2695.752,"The trouble is that justness is a relational category, and you are... I think you are saying we don't have to consider justness to the parties who were doing... we will assume for the sake of the question... the best that they could under bad circumstances."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2701.156,2703.942,"Again, Your Honor, we don't need the statute."
2007.06-1457,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.74,2744.75,"Mr. Wright, I really don't understand why you would... why you say, you know, if... if the chaos is due to the weather or maybe, you know, an Arab oil embargo or whatever, that that's perfectly okay."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2785.006,2794.914,"It... on the equities, if the local utilities end up bearing the brunt of making bad judgments about the weather, that's one thing."
2007.06-1457,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2819.362,2821.381,I'm still puzzled by your answer to Justice Scalia.
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2838.759,2846.546,"--Well, I guess the ultimate distinction is that there isn't somebody making a whole lot of money on account of market manipulation somewhere."
2007.06-1457,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2846.546,2854.452,"No, but in each case the rates would be higher than they otherwise would, and you'd have to say they're high enough to be no longer just and reasonable."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2854.452,2864.291,"Well, ""just and reasonable"", again, has always... has traditionally first meant a sort of cost of service inquiry and more recently means a market inquiry."
2007.06-1457,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.283,2879.586,"Even if infected by an act of God, it seems to me the same consequence."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2879.586,2890.808,"--I guess consumers bear the brunt of acts of God, but don't... shouldn't bear the brunt of market manipulation that was unlawful and now is--"
2007.06-1457,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2890.808,2894.762,I think you could argue that it should be just the obverse.
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2894.762,2931.119,"Aren't you really arguing... no, but aren't you really making the argument that the notion of justness does have an equitable component that looks to the source of the trouble; and if the source of the chaos in the market are the very people who are trying to make a profit on your contract, that is a reason to say that that market based rate is not a just one, because they created the conditions that gave them the leverage to get you to make the deal that you made?"
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2939.991,2948.23,"--We don't know because FERC hasn't looked at it, what... who Morgan Stanley paid and what they paid and who made the money here."
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2948.23,2952.115,"No, but just as a general premise, in your answer to Justice Scalia weren't you assuming something like that?"
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2952.115,2969.594,"We certainly think that the best result would be that whoever was manipulating the market ought to be the one who ends up getting their return cut; and that the local utilities and any innocent middlemen should be made whole, too."
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3043.758,3058.218,"And, to the extent that you make that argument, that's an answer, sort of, to the question that I put to you a couple of times: Why, why isn't your argument anything less broad than the fact that you can't make a contract in a chaotic market?"
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3080.9,3082.0,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2007.06-1457,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3170.939,3172.824,Just and reasonable when?
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3172.824,3174.874,On the day they were made.
2007.06-1457,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3174.874,3176.609,On the day they were agreed to.
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3176.609,3183.763,"And we think they weren't, because they were the product of market manipulation that made all of the rates available--"
2007.06-1457,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3183.763,3185.032,They were just and reasonable--
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3185.032,3189.801,"--that made all rates unjust and unreasonable on that date, Your Honor."
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3189.801,3204.676,"But I think... and here I want to be clear on this... you're saying they were not just and reasonable on the date they were made, number one, if the market manipulation that caused the chaos was manipulation by these Petitioners."
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3223.09,3224.206,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3224.206,3224.973,Okay.
2007.06-1457,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3224.973,3229.175,"And even that argument is much narrower than what the Ninth Circuit held, isn't it?"
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3245.719,3254.908,"Your Honor, we certainly agree that the test can't be dysfunction; that FERC has to grapple with this issue and give it a concrete meaning."
2007.06-1457,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3278.441,3295.2,"--If you are relying on the narrowest ground that Justice Souter mentioned, namely, manipulation by the seller, wasn't it incumbent on you to demonstrate that there was manipulation by the seller?"
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3297.169,3299.687,"We are relying on both, Your Honor."
2007.06-1457,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3306.775,3308.21,Because of manipulation by somebody.
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3308.21,3310.077,--were the result of manipulation.
2007.06-1457,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3310.077,3310.427,Okay.
2007.06-1457,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3310.427,3315.214,"Well, didn't the ALJ find there wasn't manipulation in this market, the forward market?"
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3315.214,3322.168,And the ALJ found that the spot market... the ALJ found that the spot market manipulation didn't affect the forward markets.
2007.06-1457,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3328.871,3335.808,FERC disowned... did FERC reject the finding of the ALJ as to manipulation of this--
2007.06-1457,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3335.808,3337.977,FERC said it was irrelevant.
2007.06-1457,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3371.65,3387.176,"Mr. Kneedler, in your rebuttal, will you address the state of the record with respect to evidence or findings about possible manipulation by these Petitioners?"
2007.06-1457,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3387.176,3387.493,Yes.
2007.06-1457,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3436.876,3438.926,--know that's a premise in the debate.
2007.06-1457,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3446.949,3451.252,--FERC has great discretion in deciding how to apply the public interest standard.
2007.06-1457,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3500.983,3517.878,"May I ask, I am sure you understand that a finding that there was no manipulations that affected these contracts is not the same as a finding that there was no manipulation by these sellers in the market."
2007.06-1457,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3517.878,3518.961,Right.
2007.06-1457,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3518.961,3524.115,And there is no such finding that there was no manipulation?
2007.06-1457,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3524.115,3525.182,That's correct.
2007.06-1457,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3525.682,3528.084,And there is no finding that there was by these sellers.
2007.06-1457,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3528.084,3528.551,--That's correct.
2007.06-1457,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3549.832,3552.066,"--But, in fact, it didn't get that articulate."
2007.06-1457,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3564.176,3564.959,That's correct.
2007.06-1457,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3573.032,3577.9,"Well, then what do you say about the standard of justness?"
2007.06-1457,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3594.461,3600.949,"The manipulation in the spot market, we think FERC properly concluded, did not have to be taken into account--"
2007.06-1457,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3600.949,3602.199,I'm not talking about what FERC said.
2007.06-1457,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3618.661,3619.744,--I think that's something that FERC would have to decide in this case.
2007.06-1457,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3625.447,3627.43,--I'm not asking what claim has been made.
2007.06-1457,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3639.238,3643.123,--I think that's the best way to read FERC's decision in this case.
2007.06-1457,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3644.273,3646.058,Is that the best way to read the government's position.
2007.06-1457,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3646.058,3646.475,--Yes.
2007.06-1457,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3646.475,3648.177,Here and now in this courtroom.
2007.06-1457,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3648.177,3664.454,"That FERC... our position is that FERC was not required in the public interest, which looks at the market as a whole not just the two parties to the contract, it looks to the consequences for the market as a whole in unraveling particular contracts because there might have been manipulation somewhere else."
2007.06-1457,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3675.575,3676.775,The case is undertaken.
