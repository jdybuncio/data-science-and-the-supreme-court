1990.89-1717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.903,"We will hear argument now in No. 89-1717, Florida v. Terrance Bostick."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,10.559,13.34,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1717,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,79.282,86.608,Did they explain what their mission was?
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,86.608,96.791,"--It is unclear from this record as to whether or not they went through what is usually gone through, which is saying that we have a drug problem in South Florida."
1990.89-1717,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,106.069,114.206,And is it also unclear whether they told the person that he need not consent?
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,114.206,123.733,Officer Nutt told Mr. Bostick at the time that he requested the consent for the search of the blue bag that he had the right to refuse.
1990.89-1717,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,123.733,126.154,Is that clear or is that disputed?
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,126.154,128.091,"I don't believe that is in dispute, Your Honor."
1990.89-1717,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,128.091,135.729,So we may judge this case on the basis that he was told that he had the right to refuse?
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,135.729,137.556,Right to refuse the search.
1990.89-1717,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,141.492,142.289,"Yes, all right."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,142.289,144.803,But the encounter between Mr.--
1990.89-1717,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,144.803,152.269,But he could have... you think it is clear enough that we judge the case on the basis that he was told that he could refuse the search?
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,152.269,154.159,"--Yes, absolutely."
1990.89-1717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,208.668,209.746,And then the bus would go off?
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,209.746,210.901,--That is correct.
1990.89-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,233.329,237.484,Does that beg the question?
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,265.427,275.078,"Justice Souter, I think the answer to that question is that, it is whether or not there was a restraint of Mr. Bostick's liberties, so as to rise to the level of a seizure."
1990.89-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,275.078,285.966,"And that isn't, the answer to that question is not synonymous with the answer to the question whether the conversation, the verbal interaction between them could have been ended, is it?"
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,285.966,290.01,"If the verbal conversation had ended, the officers would have moved on."
1990.89-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,305.614,306.192,"Well, yes, if."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,310.94,311.393,Yes.
1990.89-1717,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,311.393,314.922,"And we don't have anything to go on but assumption, do we?"
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,314.922,319.67,"We have, I believe, the officer's testimony which is that he would have moved on."
1990.89-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,319.67,325.824,Why do you say it would have been a seizure if the officer continued to question him?
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,338.553,340.772,At some point that may have given rise to a seizure.
1990.89-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.552,349.768,"I mean, I can see how maybe, you know, he would be guilty of harassment or something, but how it is a seizure?"
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,349.768,351.533,I am not--
1990.89-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.533,353.189,He just talks to me when I don't want to be talked to.
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,359.779,360.496,--No.
1990.89-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.946,370.962,"And he says, I don't want to leave you alone."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,375.46,377.507,"If you are free to go about your business, you haven't been seized."
1990.89-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,378.787,380.444,"I mean, I have been annoyed, but I haven't been seized."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,380.444,380.848,--Right.
1990.89-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,400.731,401.762,How do we know that?
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,404.48,406.932,We don't know for certain what would happen.
1990.89-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,409.197,418.631,"Would the fact that he said no in FtLauderdale give probable, reasonable suspicion to an officer in Palm Beach to say, I would like to ask you the same questions--"
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,418.631,420.193,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1990.89-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,423.676,427.892,--There is no communication between different branches of the different police departments?
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,427.892,430.314,"--There is nothing in this record, and there is nothing to my knowledge."
1990.89-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,430.314,432.266,I thought one of the opinions referred to something like that.
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,432.266,436.437,There is some language in one of the D.C. opinions that says that the officer had said that.
1990.89-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,458.895,467.924,Have we ever said in our cases that the exercise of your rights is grounds for additional suspicion on the part of officers?
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,467.924,469.252,"No, we have not."
1990.89-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,477.562,478.125,"Well, you are not."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,490.199,490.916,"--Yes, sir."
1990.89-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,490.916,506.769,"Would it be consistent with your position for the police to call ahead to the next city where the bus comes in, and suggest to them that without basing any reasonable suspicion, that they just reinterrogate the same person?"
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,508.143,514.39,I am not sure that they would have a basis for doing that.
1990.89-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,514.39,523.356,"Well, the fact that he... unlike so many thousands of people who are willing to let their bags be searched, unlike so many, he just wouldn't let them search his bag."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,528.105,528.37,Right.
1990.89-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,539.021,543.442,"Problems they are not aware of until the officer has confronted them on the bus, I suppose."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,543.442,545.862,--Or they may well be aware of them because it is all over the media.
1990.89-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.446,586.002,"Why would it then... are you urging a ""no harm in asking"" rule?"
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,591.172,592.578,No.
1990.89-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.422,594.343,So why would there be--
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,594.343,595.343,That is merely a citizen encounter.
1990.89-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.343,597.06,--Why would there be any question about calling ahead?
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,601.793,603.589,Right.
1990.89-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,610.743,617.538,"Well, that could be police harassment, but it has nothing to do with whether it is a violation of the Fourth Amendment, I would assume."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,617.538,618.207,--Okay.
1990.89-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.129,619.895,"I mean, consistently, with the rest of your case."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,619.895,621.644,Correct.
1990.89-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,643.511,645.9,Was there any showing that the bus departure was delayed?
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,645.9,649.867,--In the bus driver's deposition he stated that they left 20 minutes late.
1990.89-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,654.444,664.644,"Suppose the police did delay the bus 20 minutes in order to conduct this sort of investigation, would that have any bearing on the case or would it change the case?"
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,664.644,666.175,I don't think it would.
1990.89-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,672.501,676.156,"Well, suppose the police delay the bus for an hour and a half, that has nothing to do with whether there is a seizure?"
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,676.156,682.904,--I think you have to look to what they are doing with each individual person on the bus.
1990.89-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,682.904,687.387,"Well, suppose they are conducting this investigation that was conducted here, but it took them an hour and a half?"
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,696.602,702.101,Are you saying this investigation with Mr. Bostick alone or with everyone on the bus?
1990.89-1717,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,702.101,704.255,"Well, it is the same facts as you have here."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,704.255,710.158,"I think that that is a factor that should be considered, but it does not necessarily give rise to a seizure."
1990.89-1717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,718.531,731.555,"Supposing, Ms. Fowler, that the bus has an accident on the highway between FtLauderdale and Palm Beach and the sheriff comes and says, I want to investigate the accident."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,741.193,742.707,"No, because that is regular police business."
1990.89-1717,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,754.921,760.139,"Ms. Fowler, backing up a little, why did they go straight to the back of the bus?"
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,760.139,768.011,What we have learned from the officers is that they try to approach as many people on the bus as they can within the time allotted to them.
1990.89-1717,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,769.197,770.572,"Well, why didn't they start in the front?"
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,770.572,776.273,--Their practice is to start in the back because then when they get to the front they can exit the vehicle.
1990.89-1717,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,776.273,777.008,"They had some reason, didn't they?"
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,777.008,777.367,Pardon me?
1990.89-1717,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,777.367,783.912,"Wouldn't it appear that they had a reason, to start at the back instead of the front?"
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,783.912,791.939,"I think that the reason, the only reason that I have been given is that it is just their standard practice because they do exit the vehicle when they get to the front of the bus."
1990.89-1717,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,809.4,810.993,How do you know what the drug dealers do?
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,810.993,813.851,--That is something that police officers have told me.
1990.89-1717,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,816.6,826.753,"And it is always interesting to me that all of the drug pushers, when you ask to search them, they say, oh, come on."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,838.404,840.232,Because they are guilty.
1990.89-1717,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,845.48,846.134,"No, no."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,852.336,854.679,--You are cooperating with the police officers.
1990.89-1717,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,854.679,855.335,That is right.
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,858.771,860.615,I think a reasonable person would do it--
1990.89-1717,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,860.615,862.379,They are just good people.
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,862.379,863.442,--Because they are trying to be cooperative.
1990.89-1717,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,863.442,865.034,They are just good people?
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,865.034,866.518,Yes.
1990.89-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,866.518,870.266,It is the reasonable dope dealer we are talking about.
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,871.703,874.42,But the test that we need to be looking at is that of a reasonable citizen.
1990.89-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,875.575,880.481,"But as Justice Marshall points out, the cases always are people who are not reasonable citizens."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,886.118,891.461,--It is standard practice to approach as many people and request consent for the search of the bags as possible.
1990.89-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.461,892.289,--I see.
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,894.506,898.427,"On this bag, excuse me, on this bus they never got past Mr. Bostick."
1990.89-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,917.293,920.12,They may not be a very bright bunch of people perhaps.
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,920.12,921.838,"--Yes, that is probably very true."
1990.89-1717,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,921.838,923.493,"Which is a good thing, I suppose."
1990.89-1717,0,30293,joan_fowler,,923.493,926.695,"Yes, I would like to save the rest of my time for rebuttal."
1990.89-1717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,926.695,927.961,"Very well, MsFowler."
1990.89-1717,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,929.459,934.365,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1717,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,988.639,1000.962,"General Starr, would you comment, in view of that argument, on the statement in the brief amicus for the Americans for Effective Law Enforcement, Professor Envow's group, which has uniformly supported the Government in all of these cases."
1990.89-1717,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1011.333,1016.191,It is only unusual in the sense that it is relatively new.
1990.89-1717,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1098.033,1099.548,General Starr?
1990.89-1717,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1099.548,1100.142,Yes.
1990.89-1717,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1100.142,1105.78,"If there had been a shooting match on that bus, there would have been a whole lot of people killed, wouldn't there?"
1990.89-1717,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1105.78,1107.764,There certainly might have been.
1990.89-1717,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1107.764,1109.498,And who would have been responsible for it?
1990.89-1717,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1109.498,1113.855,"Those who began the firing, I would think."
1990.89-1717,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1205.913,1214.83,"Well, General Starr, is the cramped setting of a bus that is about to leave a factor to be considered in the totality of the circumstances?"
1990.89-1717,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1214.83,1216.346,"--Yes, it is, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1717,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1242.695,1273.136,"Whether the consent it tainted, it isn't a question of whether he can leave, is it?"
1990.89-1717,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1273.384,1274.509,"--I agree, Justice White, if I may."
1990.89-1717,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1289.801,1301.438,--whether his will was overborne by this show of authority when he consented?
1990.89-1717,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1301.438,1305.03,"I think in the ordinary case, that would be presented."
1990.89-1717,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1320.273,1327.896,Rather that whether that constitutes such a threat that his consent should be held invalid.
1990.89-1717,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1330.505,1345.514,"--By virtue of what the Florida Supreme Court has determined, erroneously in our judgment, to have been an illegal seizure, we believe there was not a Fourth Amendment event here, by virtue of the cooperation of this individual--"
1990.89-1717,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1345.514,1349.591,"The consent was invalid because it was a product of an illegal seizure, is that correct?"
1990.89-1717,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1349.591,1351.605,--That was the theory of the Florida Supreme Court.
1990.89-1717,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1361.743,1376.376,"General Starr, if I understand your argument, you think it is irrelevant to this case that Officer... not irrelevant, but unnecessary at least to the case, that Officer Rubino advised Mr. Bostick that you have the right to refuse?"
1990.89-1717,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1378.282,1379.017,Absolutely right.
1990.89-1717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1386.997,1389.137,"Thank you, General Starr."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1391.215,1393.964,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.799,1494.346,Why is that critical?
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1500.125,1503.296,"--Justice Scalia, it is one thing, I think, to have a gun concealed."
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1511.636,1514.479,"The gun was in a pouch, as I understand it."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1514.479,1525.225,"It was in a pouch, and the testimony is ambiguous, as to whether or not at some point during the encounter, Officer Nutt put his hand into the zippered pouch and put it on the gun."
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.225,1528.083,But how else would he have carried the gun?
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1538.016,1539.719,You can wear a shoulder holster.
1990.89-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1567.129,1577.469,"Would it be objectionable, Mr. Ayer, if on a uniformed police with a gun in his shoulder holster or side holster did the same thing?"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1577.469,1583.873,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the point is not, that I am trying to make is not that it is, per se, objectionable."
1990.89-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1596.93,1601.038,"You think a reasonable person might have concluded that if he didn't consent, the officer would shoot him."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1602.051,1602.317,--No.
1990.89-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1605.457,1607.145,"Well, what is a likely conclusion then?"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1607.145,1613.33,"--Well, I think you have to look at all of the circumstances, and then I think if I can have a moment, I will try to explain how I think they fit together."
1990.89-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.758,1716.772,But he was told that he need not consent?
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1716.772,1722.879,"Well, again, it depends upon this Court's fact-finding on this record."
1990.89-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1748.165,1749.977,Wasn't there any finding at all?
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1749.977,1754.116,"--There is no fact-finding, Justice White, whatsoever, by the trial court except the ruling on the motion."
1990.89-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1754.116,1768.626,"Well, in Judge Lett's dissenting opinion in the district court of appeals, he says that there is conflict in the evidence about whether the defendant consented to the search of the second bag, and whether he was informed of his right to refuse consent."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1775.826,1785.54,"I think certainly on the issue of consent, that is true because that fact, even though there were no fact-findings, that fact was necessarily decided by the trial judge."
1990.89-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1802.644,1810.593,"Well, wouldn't it be fair to say that the Florida Supreme Court assumed for the sake of argument that he was advised of his right to refuse consent?"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1810.593,1812.764,--They did not make anything of the contrary.
1990.89-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.053,1831.085,B1--
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1831.085,1832.927,--Page B1 of the... I am sorry.
1990.89-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.259,1866.524,"--In their theory, whether he was advised or not was irrelevant."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1866.524,1872.38,"Well, I don't seek to make a great deal of whether he was advised or not either."
1990.89-1717,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1939.337,1946.475,"But isn't the fact is, the reason he didn't want to leave is he didn't want to get off the bus, not because he didn't want to talk to the officers necessarily."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1946.475,1950.255,"Well, I don't think we know that, Justice Kennedy."
1990.89-1717,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1952.754,1957.673,"Well, the reason we don't know it is because your client didn't exercise his rights."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,1959.719,1975.542,"--Well, if you assume, if you assume that everyone who is on a bus that is laying over temporarily in an intermediate city does not want to get off that bus, I think as an initial matter, you can probably say, yes, that is right."
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2040.125,2040.906,"Well, now, wait."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2057.149,2057.945,That is correct.
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2057.945,2075.391,"So the mere fact that it is a lot of trouble to leave, that he would have to take his baggage out of the baggage compartment of the bus; that he would have to chuck away half of his ticket, all of that is irrelevant to whether he thought that force was being applied against him to prevent his leaving?"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2077.485,2077.891,We agree.
1990.89-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2202.512,2205.228,But what if a person is asleep?
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2211.726,2213.366,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2232.015,2242.325,"Well, would it have been preferable for Fourth Amendment purposes in your view if the police had simply admonished him to wake up in a loud voice?"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2242.325,2244.058,I don't know if it would be or not.
1990.89-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2246.512,2256.288,"Well, then how... then in your view, how, consistently with the Fourth Amendment, should a police officer who wishes to interrogate a sleeping passenger on a bus go about it?"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2256.288,2266.362,"Well, I guess I think that there, if you have no reasonable suspicion of someone and he is asleep--"
1990.89-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2266.362,2267.674,You can't--
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2267.674,2272.329,"--I would certainly not say that there is a, per se, bar on doing it at all."
1990.89-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2272.329,2277.967,"--You say a lot about things that are not a per se bar, but apparently a lot of things are factored in."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2291.336,2299.552,"Well, I think that it tends to make the encounter feel more like a command performance."
1990.89-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2308.673,2311.515,"But you can't say, would you agree to wake up?"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2315.888,2322.105,"--I will put it this way, I think certainly if they had tapped him on the foot, and they had said, we have a couple of questions we would like to ask you."
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2331.648,2335.725,"But, Mr. Ayer, correct me if I am wrong, we don't know in this case that he was asleep."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2335.725,2336.459,"No, we don't."
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.459,2338.582,And we don't know that he was touched on the foot.
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2338.582,2339.113,That is true.
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2343.3,2345.424,"Well, what are we talking about it for?"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2345.424,2347.533,--We are talking about it because--
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2347.533,2348.984,"I mean, it is a factor that we don't know existed in this case."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2351.421,2360.167,--The Court is going to have to make a determination as to what facts it believes has occurred in order to decide whether the situation is a Fourth Amendment violation.
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.167,2362.214,We are going to determine whether he was touched on the foot?
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2362.214,2365.9,"Not necessarily, only if you think you have to in order to decide the case."
1990.89-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2537.518,2549.529,Why shouldn't we be satisfied or why shouldn't you be satisfied with our deciding this case on the basis of the facts which the Supreme Court of Florida recited as being the facts of the case?
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2549.529,2551.357,"I think that would be fine, Your Honor."
1990.89-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2554.699,2565.742,So we don't know whether he... on A2 they say the facts in this case are succinctly stated by Judge Letts in his dissenting opinion.
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2567.646,2568.428,Yes.
1990.89-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.895,2589.154,"And so the evidence disputed about whether the defendant consented or whether he was informed of his right, but the conflict must be resolved in favor of the State--"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2589.154,2592.449,"Well, I--"
1990.89-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2592.449,2596.979,"--That we don't know whether... on these facts, you don't know whether they touched the man at all."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2596.979,2598.197,--That is correct.
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.789,2602.148,"Mr. Ayer, the problem is even worse than that."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2639.586,2662.187,"I would... I haven't looked into this too far, but I would suggest that perhaps it raises a question to simply ignore the facts of this case, or for this Court to simply decide the case, ignoring the facts of this case, simply on the basis of a very brief statement of a question, certified in the Florida Supreme Court."
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2662.187,2673.322,"Well, I gather that it was irrelevant to the Florida Supreme Court what the facts were, so long as the situation came within that rephrased question, they were going to find for the defendant."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2673.322,2683.584,"I would not reach that conclusion, Justice Scalia, based on what follows on page A2, the discussion quoting directly from the dissent in the district court of appeals."
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2683.584,2689.879,"At the end of the opinion they refer back again, the very last paragraph:"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2699.344,2705.358,"Well, we are certainly not asking this Court for a rule of law that you can't have bus searches."
1990.89-1717,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2840.599,2864.277,"Then, Mr. Ayer, how do you square your argument with what this Court held in the Delgado case, where the immigration officers had basically closed off the doors to the work area and the employees were not free to leave and they were being questioned?"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2870.572,2878.975,"--Well, I think Delgado is distinguishable on the ground that the setting is entirely different in the sense of confinement."
1990.89-1717,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2890.783,2892.719,"But they weren't free to leave it, were they?"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2892.719,2893.11,No.
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2933.531,2948.368,"Mr. Ayer, I thought you said earlier, I thought you acknowledged earlier that it is not the confinement; it is only the confinement by reason of authority, so that the mere fact that you are on a bus or anymore than the fact that you are on an elevator doesn't make it an arrest."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,2966.767,2969.126,"Number one, I don't see how he could move even three seats away here."
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2987.743,2988.227,"Oh, no."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3010.452,3012.03,--I would agree with that.
1990.89-1717,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3037.019,3037.8,That is a good point.
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3046.266,3048.405,Our argument really is that here he had no where to go at all.
1990.89-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3048.405,3071.708,"If we understood the Supreme Court of Florida as saying that in no case, under no circumstances may police board a bus and inquire from passengers about their luggage, you would not defend that rule?"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3071.708,3073.786,My view is that--
1990.89-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3073.786,3074.645,You say you are not asking for it?
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3074.645,3075.629,--We are not asking for that rule--
1990.89-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.629,3079.441,"And furthermore, would you defend it if we understood that to be the rule?"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3079.441,3081.517,--I think that is broader than the rule should be.
1990.89-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3083.579,3093.481,"Well, give me the circumstances under which police may board the bus and ask a customer or a passenger, may we search your luggage?"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3093.481,3095.356,"--Well, I think if the police--"
1990.89-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.356,3098.823,"If a small person, that couldn't block the aisle--"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3098.823,3113.691,"--If the police go out of their way to negate what I believe to be the normal inference that a person would draw from the rather unusual, to most passengers, occurrence of an officer coming on a bus, that is to say, he is here for a reason--"
1990.89-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.691,3116.566,"--So if they say, don't get us wrong, you are quite free to leave the bus."
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3120.392,3125.718,"--I think they shouldn't say that, but I think if they say, you are free to leave."
1990.89-1717,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3133.465,3137.54,"And if the Florida Supreme Court would not accept that, you think it is wrong?"
1990.89-1717,2,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3137.54,3139.931,"--I think that is going too far, Your Honor."
1990.89-1717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3141.133,3141.602,Thank you.
1990.89-1717,3,30293,joan_fowler,,3145.851,3146.945,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.89-1717,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3166.17,3175.838,"I take it, you think that the Florida Supreme Court based its ruling on the particular circumstances of this case: The fact of the gun, the fact of blocking the aisle."
1990.89-1717,3,30293,joan_fowler,,3180.539,3181.352,"--No, Justice White."
1990.89-1717,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3185.476,3187.131,"Justice Scalia, please."
1990.89-1717,3,30293,joan_fowler,,3187.131,3188.1,"--I am sorry, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1717,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3230.848,3235.112,"We are a little bit in the dark about some of the facts, are we not, Ms. Fowler?"
1990.89-1717,3,30293,joan_fowler,,3235.112,3235.565,"--Yes, we are."
1990.89-1717,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3235.565,3239.125,In view of the... the trial court did not make specific findings.
1990.89-1717,3,30293,joan_fowler,,3239.125,3239.844,That is correct.
1990.89-1717,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3247.669,3249.981,Which quotes from Judge Letts' dissent?
1990.89-1717,3,30293,joan_fowler,,3249.981,3250.215,Yes.
1990.89-1717,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3270.441,3273.128,Would you know how to open it?
