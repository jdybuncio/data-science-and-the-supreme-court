2002.02-306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.16,"We'll hear argument now in Number 02-306, the Beneficial National Bank versus Marie Anderson."
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,54.166,56.823,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,120.863,138.071,"Mr. Waxman, normally when the Federal Government creates a cause of action that preempts State causes of action, it attaches an element to that cause of action that does not exist under some of the State causes of action."
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,183.19,193.107,"Justice Scalia, with respect, I don't think that I would concede the premise of your question, that is, that a Federal cause of action ordinarily has an additional element."
2002.02-306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,193.107,193.212,All right.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,193.337,194.222,But leaving that aside--
2002.02-306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,194.222,197.721,--Leaving... in my hypothetical... create one--
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,197.721,213.135,"--Your... your hypothetical actually is an example of a very peculiar instance in which, with respect to nuclear incidents, Congress has imported in... has federalized the cause."
2002.02-306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.393,215.466,--Right.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,215.466,222.58,--and said expressly that State law standards will apply and it will be the law of whatever State the incident occurred.
2002.02-306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,222.58,223.792,But take my hypothetical.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,226.359,227.244,If... if--
2002.02-306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.244,227.892,Yes or no.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,227.892,233.767,--If... if any... I hope I can remember your hypothetical.
2002.02-306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,234.189,243.838,The hypothetical is you plead a State law cause of action that does not claim all of the elements which are necessary for the Federal cause of action.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,246.966,249.607,--It is definitely removable.
2002.02-306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,260.0,266.806,It's very strange to say that you can remove something that on its face does not constitute a Federal cause of action.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,266.806,274.639,"--Justice Scalia, there may... in preemption cases, there are line-drawing problems at the margins about whether something is or isn't preempted."
2002.02-306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.864,331.166,"Right, but the question is whether the consequence of that is that the State law cause of action must be dismissed by the State court because it's preempted, or rather, the consequence is that you can remove into Federal court a pleading that plainly on its face does not... does not claim a Federal cause of action."
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,331.166,332.745,"--Well, the--"
2002.02-306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,332.745,334.596,It just seems very strange to me.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,334.596,342.557,--The... the pleading... the complaint in this case on its face does satisfy the Federal cause of action and--
2002.02-306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.557,343.25,I understand that.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,349.371,349.824,--I think--
2002.02-306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.824,350.956,That's... what's... what I'm concerned about.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,357.714,371.855,"--It has to be one that if well pleaded... I mean, a... on a removal... on a notice of removal, the Federal court is obligated, like any court determining its own jurisdiction, to read the complaint as if it were well pleaded."
2002.02-306,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,417.202,425.697,"Mr.... Mr. Waxman, is what you're saying essentially there is a Federal claim or there is no claim?"
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,433.104,434.23,Yes.
2002.02-306,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,434.23,437.442,And that's what makes it removable.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,441.868,442.721,Indeed.
2002.02-306,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,484.786,485.726,If they had--
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,485.726,487.194,And no one has... I'm sorry.
2002.02-306,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,487.194,491.5,"--If they had pled it correctly, they could still be in State court, but the defendant could remove."
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,500.642,501.223,Correct.
2002.02-306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,550.335,578.756,"Mr. Waxman, one thing that troubles me about... about the proposal that you make and that the Government makes is that it seems to me in the LMRA case that established this principle and in the ERISA case, which is the only other case that has... has held to the same effect, those cases refer to this as being an extraordinary, an unusual event."
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,630.134,630.231,No.
2002.02-306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,666.028,669.647,"Well, was... was that true in the Farmers' and Mechanics' case?"
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,679.571,680.922,"--No, it wasn't a removal case."
2002.02-306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,685.595,686.842,There wasn't Federal... there wasn't Federal question jurisdiction.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,686.842,687.871,--there may not have been removal.
2002.02-306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,687.871,690.696,"But it is not a white horse case for you, that one."
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,690.696,699.63,"I think it is a... if I understand the reference, I think it is a white horse case in the sense... in this sense, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.02-306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,777.702,784.041,But... but certainly under the... the statute itself did not preclude the possibility of that action having been brought in State court.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,784.041,784.774,Not at all.
2002.02-306,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,793.952,795.654,So can 3... 301 suits.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,811.063,812.574,"--That... that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.02-306,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,817.556,820.784,And... and I suppose one reason... I was surprised when I went through.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,832.813,834.456,Correct.
2002.02-306,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,836.499,837.219,Which is... which is not this case.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,837.219,842.428,"The Copyright Act certainly is an example of complete preemption, but there's a statutory provision that--"
2002.02-306,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,842.428,848.631,"Okay, why didn't we express this... this principle before instead of... instead of adhering so narrowly?"
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,863.969,864.792,"--Here's... here's why, Justice Scalia."
2002.02-306,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,959.666,963.617,I started to call you General Waxman.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,963.674,964.63,Thank you.
2002.02-306,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,964.63,965.619,Like the old days.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,965.619,966.562,R-18.
2002.02-306,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,966.562,974.376,"Assume... assume that I... I agree with you that... that on... on complete preemption, this... this case passes muster."
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1009.497,1009.969,Yes.
2002.02-306,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1040.726,1041.109,Okay.
2002.02-306,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1060.628,1078.715,"--You... you have to find out what Congress had in mind, but I think this Court has made clear in Metropolitan Life that it is going to be the rare, rare, rare day when the Federal courts will infer from congressional silence that a Federal cause of action is to be exclusive."
2002.02-306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1096.048,1097.372,"Very well, Mr. Waxman."
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1098.704,1108.232,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1126.956,1129.829,Can I ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Waxman?
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1142.331,1150.211,--A failure to state a claim on which relief is granted does not deprive the Federal court of jurisdiction over the claim.
2002.02-306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1162.442,1162.979,"Well, it's not colorable."
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1164.774,1166.385,--If... if the claim was not colorable--
2002.02-306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1166.385,1172.588,It... it claims usury when... when what they charged was 3 percent and that would not violate the Federal statute.
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1172.588,1176.012,"--Well, here... here we... we don't have that situation, Your Honor."
2002.02-306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1176.012,1176.801,I understand that.
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1177.374,1178.929,That--
2002.02-306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1178.929,1183.655,"--We... you're... you're asking us to set forth a new general proposition, which we haven't set forth before."
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1207.022,1222.297,"--When it's removed, the Federal court decides whether there's jurisdiction under Federal law, whether there's arising-under jurisdiction, and decides whether the... the complaint is properly pleaded, the true nature of the complaint states a claim under Federal law."
2002.02-306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.87,1225.232,"So if it doesn't, then it stays in State court."
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1225.232,1236.467,"--If it doesn't, then it can remand the State... the case back to State court, but it would have decided, in essence, that the claim should be dismissed at the same time by deciding--"
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1236.467,1250.651,"What happens... what happens if the cause of action is for misrepresentation under State law, and the misrepresentation is that the interest rate was lawful and the plaintiff alleges it was unlawful because it was usurious?"
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1250.651,1268.45,"--Well, to the extent that the State claim requires the decision that a... a determination that there were excessive interest charges by a national bank, then the claim would fall within the scope of the cause of action."
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1273.391,1276.328,"Well, in... in my... would this removable?"
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1277.966,1279.01,--The complaint--
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1279.01,1289.134,It seems to me this might be like Gully in that it... the... the nature of the cause of action was really a State cause of action even though it involves an inquiry into what the Federal law--
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1289.134,1291.468,--The State cause of action is just misrepresentation.
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1291.468,1292.216,--That's it.
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1292.216,1294.925,Then that would not be removable.
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.925,1299.02,"It's unlawful, and the only misrepresentation is it's unlawful and it's unlawful allegedly because it's usurious."
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1299.02,1302.468,Yes.
2002.02-306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1305.356,1309.29,There were related claims here that were strictly State claims.
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1309.29,1310.062,That... that--
2002.02-306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1310.062,1310.749,But they fell into--
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1310.749,1319.732,"--Yes, but the existence of pendent State claims doesn't defeat removal jurisdiction just as it doesn't defeat original jurisdiction."
2002.02-306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1323.3,1325.164,--And they'd come up under 1367.
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1326.845,1327.962,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2002.02-306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1338.323,1345.285,"--But if you had this same complaint and it didn't have the usury claim and it just had those State law claims, then there's nothing removable."
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1345.285,1346.76,"That's... that's right, Your Honor."
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1365.404,1368.703,"Mr. Roberts, can I go back to your answer to Justice Scalia's question?"
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1391.152,1404.04,"What... what... I tried to distinguish between failure to state a claim, which I agree the simple failure to state a claim is... is not a ground for lack of Federal jurisdiction, Your Honor."
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1404.04,1406.74,"If you fail... you failed to state a Federal claim, but you do state an Alabama claim."
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1406.74,1410.891,There is no Alabama claim because the only claim can arise under Federal law.
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1418.356,1418.493,"And the Federal court would dismiss, yes."
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1418.493,1418.727,Yes.
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1433.165,1434.912,"Well, that's my... my hypothetical."
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1441.297,1444.282,The critical... you have to know--
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1444.282,1447.211,I've given you all the facts.
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1447.211,1448.873,--There still... there still could be a colorable claim under--
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1448.873,1451.723,"Well, is it a colorable claim or isn't it when it doesn't allege a--"
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1451.723,1453.07,--We don't know what the rate--
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.07,1454.602,--percentage rate that's usurious under Federal law?
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1454.602,1467.077,"--You don't know what the rate is, Your Honor, under Federal law without... without more facts about the complaint because the National Bank Act provides the... the possibility the national bank can charge any of three rates."
2002.02-306,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1468.54,1469.031,And one was a State rate.
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1469.031,1477.62,--the fundamental... the fundamental point is that... that it's removable if there's jurisdiction in the original jurisdiction of the Federal court.
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1477.62,1478.347,"Well, I still don't understand your answer."
2002.02-306,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1491.029,1491.906,I want to remove it.
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1493.677,1505.87,"If... if there is... if the claim properly pleaded states a claim over which there's Federal jurisdiction, if it was pled as a claim under the National Bank Act--"
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.87,1508.355,"No, it's... that is a matter of State law in usury and--"
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1508.355,1508.976,--No.
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1508.976,1510.926,--and you say there is no such animal.
2002.02-306,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1514.097,1515.488,"I don't think there's authority to remove it, if--"
2002.02-306,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1515.488,1516.971,"--The answer is yes, isn't it?"
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.971,1517.832,You can remove it.
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1517.832,1518.74,You can--
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1518.74,1522.894,He might be able to remove it because he doesn't have confidence in what the State judge will do.
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1522.894,1523.85,"--No... no, Your Honor."
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1546.757,1549.402,I... I still don't know whether you're telling me yes or no to my hypothetical.
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1549.402,1552.954,--I'm telling you that if the... if there's no colorable claim--
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1552.954,1554.301,"Well, I've told you what the claim is."
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1555.369,1557.18,--Well--
2002.02-306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.18,1557.729,He says 3 percent.
2002.02-306,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1567.653,1571.3,The question... can I ask you a standard on this?
2002.02-306,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1596.082,1599.23,"--Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,1713.379,1719.957,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-306,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1742.558,1747.31,"Oh, but it's a claim of usurious interest charged by a national bank."
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,1747.31,1748.166,--It is a--
2002.02-306,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1748.166,1752.652,"So under the theory of the Government, that is a Federal claim."
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,1752.652,1760.181,"--Under the theory of the Government, it... the claim, as pled, is under Alabama Code section 8-8-1."
2002.02-306,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1780.525,1783.434,"This is not a Federal defense, Mr.... Mr. Clark."
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,1810.45,1821.669,"--Are you talking about where the... where the... a... a complaint is pled by... by an... by a Georgia plaintiff against an Alabama corporation, it will be removed because--"
2002.02-306,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1821.669,1822.693,--Plaintiff is from Alabama.
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,1822.693,1823.13,--because there's diversity?
2002.02-306,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1823.13,1825.165,Plaintiff says defendant is from Alabama.
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,1825.165,1825.554,Right.
2002.02-306,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1825.554,1828.731,"Defendant removes because defendant is, in fact, from Georgia."
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,1828.731,1829.305,Right.
2002.02-306,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1851.421,1852.684,You're not allowed to choose a theory that doesn't exist.
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,1852.684,1853.408,--Well--
2002.02-306,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1853.408,1859.3,The notion is that there simply is no claim under State law for usury against a national bank.
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,1879.233,1884.326,--The argument that they are making is that there's no claim is... is misstating.
2002.02-306,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1914.122,1914.455,Of course.
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,1931.183,1934.327,That's an ordinary... ordinary preemption case... case also.
2002.02-306,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1934.327,1938.202,That... that distinguishes between a claim for relief and a defense.
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,1940.412,1941.161,"Right, and--"
2002.02-306,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1941.161,1942.348,The defense of preclusion.
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,1942.348,1946.986,"--Right, and that's exactly what they have in this case, a mere defense in this case."
2002.02-306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1947.259,1947.84,Because?
2002.02-306,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1947.84,1956.977,Do you... do you disagree that section 86 of the National Bank Act provides the sole source of the cause of action?
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,1956.977,1968.69,"--It does not provide the sole source of the cause of action that the plaintiffs have pled in this case, and that's the difference here is... is the source of sort of organic law as to where the... where the complaint comes from."
2002.02-306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1995.062,1995.228,Wait.
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,2022.541,2027.195,"--Why isn't... Your Honor, why isn't... why isn't the... the cause of action we've brought--"
2002.02-306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2027.195,2046.391,"Why, in your opinion, is the State cause of action that you brought... you say it is not true that Congress intended the Federal cause of action as the exclusive vehicle, excluding your kind of claim."
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,2046.391,2046.74,--Well--
2002.02-306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2046.74,2048.44,They say it did.
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,2070.63,2075.858,"--As this Court stated in the Caterpillar case under note 4, the question of the breadth of the--"
2002.02-306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2075.858,2080.402,I don't see what Caterpillar could possibly have to do with it since it isn't a bank case.
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,2080.402,2082.301,"--Well, but the question of the breadth--"
2002.02-306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2082.301,2082.398,Is it?
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,2082.398,2084.377,--of the remedy provided--
2002.02-306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2084.377,2085.391,I'm not asking you that.
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,2087.342,2087.933,--Right.
2002.02-306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2087.933,2091.783,I want to know is it the case in your view... you concede it.
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,2111.758,2111.832,Under Supremacy Clause--
2002.02-306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2111.832,2113.515,Is the answer to my question yes or no?
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,2113.515,2115.086,"--That is... yes, that is what those cases hold."
2002.02-306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2115.668,2115.957,Okay.
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,2116.179,2116.928,--however--
2002.02-306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2116.928,2118.207,--then you can't make the argument you just made.
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,2118.207,2130.296,"--However, the question of whether or not a claim is preempted ordinarily is a... a wholly different question from whether or not there's jurisdiction in the Federal courts."
2002.02-306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2130.296,2130.449,All right.
2002.02-306,2,17530,brian_m_clark,,2138.124,2141.551,We... it appears that there is no... there is no State claim on the usury.
2002.02-306,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2141.551,2141.64,All right.
