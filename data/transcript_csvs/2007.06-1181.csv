2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.466,"We'll hear argument next in case 06-1181, Dada v. Mukasey."
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,7.388,19.977,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress has provided that certain aliens, including those with good moral character, are eligible for voluntary departure."
2007.06-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,69.706,96.524,"Can we consider that in your case, given that the application to reopen was made when there were only two days left to run for the termination of the voluntary departure time... in other words, it was your delay, not the Government's, that made it impossible to decide this in the requisite time?"
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,96.524,102.928,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and I have two responses, one relating to this particular case as well as the cases in general."
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,149.8,153.469,How many of those are... are granted?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,153.469,154.703,How many--
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,154.703,161.95,What percentage of motions to reopen are granted in favor of the alien?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,161.95,166.323,"--We've looked for that statistic, and we have not been able to find the statistic."
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,172.836,177.023,So how many... do you know how many are filed on an annual basis?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,177.023,178.006,"Yes, I do."
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,195.109,203.636,"So there would be no reason not to file one of these if you were subject to voluntary... if you elected voluntary departure, and it extended your time to stay, right?"
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,207.963,208.775,Not necessarily.
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,218.756,221.224,We're dealing with people who have already broken the law.
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,227.331,233.656,"--Well, two responses: First, there are sanctions for frivolous filing under the immigration proceedings."
2007.06-1181,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,248.993,257.834,"If an alien has not been diligently pursuing his or her rights, you would argue the person was still entitled to equitable tolling if the alien files a motion to reopen?"
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,257.834,263.785,"--When you say that they're not diligently pursuing their rights, I am not clear--"
2007.06-1181,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,263.785,270.688,Isn't that generally a requirement for equitable tolling: A person has to have been diligently pursuing his rights?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,270.688,273.249,"--Generally, yes."
2007.06-1181,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,273.249,275.639,But you don't advocate the adoption of that here.
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,280.419,280.919,Yes.
2007.06-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,288.148,298.802,Why isn't... why isn't it fair to say: You have the short time frame by statute to leave the country if you've left in voluntary departure.
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,319.216,320.433,--That--
2007.06-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,320.433,323.509,Isn't that a perfect reconciliation of the two?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,323.509,325.712,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,350.358,355.466,"But you raised the question, as I remember, when you put it in the cert petition."
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,369.07,371.35,"Yes, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,371.35,388.671,"Counsel, another way to reconcile the two that I think would be beneficial to your client, but I'm not sure it's open to us, is to address the Government's view that, when you voluntarily depart, your motion to reopen is automatically withdrawn."
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,419.44,425.094,"Well, that regulation is subject to litigation."
2007.06-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,430.187,431.483,"But it wasn't directly challenged here, was it?"
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,431.483,432.451,--Excuse me?
2007.06-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,432.451,435.294,That regulation was not directly challenged in this case?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,435.294,444.072,It was not directly challenged because the Fifth Circuit is one of the circuits that says that the motion... that regulation is valid.
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,444.072,449.413,"So if we don't address it here, there's going to be another case in a year or 18 months where that's going to be raised?"
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,449.413,459.408,"Your Honor, as to voluntary departure recipients, this Court can construe the statute to avoid the conflict here."
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,487.257,500.158,"Well, in all these cases, if you think you have a good case on the motion to reopen, all you have to do is give up the benefits that you have availed yourself under voluntary departure, and then the motion to reopen is not automatically withdrawn."
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,500.158,503.797,"--With respect, that's not an option to our client."
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,506.811,510.45,"No, I mean he... you should not elect voluntary departure in the first place."
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,510.45,515.198,"Well, the problem is because of the very nature of the motion to reopen."
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,538.658,541.516,What were those circumstances here?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,541.516,548.341,--The circumstances here is that previous counsel had failed to submit an application and supporting evidence.
2007.06-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,552.356,555.371,But it existed?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,567.804,578.956,"It was a file for adjustment of status, an application for adjustment of status and supporting documents, as well as the supporting evidence showing that this was a bona fide marriage."
2007.06-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,608.756,614.582,"Mr. Meade, why was your client not allowed to withdraw the voluntary departure option, withdraw from it?"
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,614.582,617.347,"Justice Souter, that's unclear."
2007.06-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,628.781,636.575,So all we have on the record is just an IJ's determination that he would not accept it?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,636.575,638.387,"--Well, it wasn't the IJ."
2007.06-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,651.287,656.457,"But at the time he filed, he had not overstayed, because he filed on Friday afternoon, right?"
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,656.457,657.067,--Yes.
2007.06-1181,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,657.067,677.09,"So... so maybe the point is we didn't have time to rule on it simply because he filed it on Friday afternoon and he had to leave on Sunday, and therefore, we should not take that as a determination that had he filed in time for timely action by the court he would have been denied."
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,677.09,691.505,"The agency has never given a reason for why they did not accept the withdrawal, although there is some irony in the fact that the proposed solution going forward would give aliens exactly what my client asked for if the agency--"
2007.06-1181,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,691.505,698.956,"If the voluntary withdrawal had been withdrawn successfully, he would then have been subject to the alternate order of removal?"
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,698.956,699.425,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-1181,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,699.425,700.268,And he could have been removed immediately?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,700.268,700.783,That's correct.
2007.06-1181,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,700.783,704.032,"And that would have mooted the motion to reopen, wouldn't it?"
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,704.032,705.625,It wouldn't have mooted the motion to reopen.
2007.06-1181,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,714.637,717.277,Would it remain pending once he had left the United States?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,717.277,719.432,Not once he had left the United States.
2007.06-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.162,732.082,"No, but he's not in the same circumstance."
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,778.566,781.204,"I have three responses, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,816.159,818.486,"Still and all, it's part of the deal."
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,822.266,823.141,One final--
2007.06-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,823.141,833.449,"It's just, part of the deal he gave up this little ability to reopen, and that's... that's the choice he made when he accepted voluntary departure."
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,833.449,856.97,"--One final response is that in the government's proposed regulation, an alien is permitted to file a motion to reopen notwithstanding having been granted voluntary departure, which indicates that the government itself does not think that the bargain includes... or that Congress did not intend the bargain to include a waiver of the one motion to reopen which all aliens are entitled to file."
2007.06-1181,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,856.97,868.966,"Going back to the question that Justice Alito put to you, that he would then be, and you agree this is what you asked for first, like any other removable alien."
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,885.21,885.6,Yes.
2007.06-1181,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,905.717,920.619,"If you say that tolling is automatic, which I assume is your position, would it be possible under the statutes to say that tolling is not automatic but can be permitted in the discretion of the hearing officer?"
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,920.619,921.852,--I--
2007.06-1181,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,921.852,925.445,Or are we then just inventing something that's not in the statute at all?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,925.445,933.393,"--Well, the problem, Justice Kennedy, is that the agency would need to act within the short time period."
2007.06-1181,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,934.472,935.018,No.
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,939.876,942.499,"--That's true, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,974.034,980.735,"Well, presumably it doesn't take them much time because when someone elects voluntary departure they don't have to address it."
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,990.654,994.432,--It's a discretionary determination to the single Board member.
2007.06-1181,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1019.657,1020.423,Is there appeal?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1028.247,1029.09,--Yes.
2007.06-1181,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1029.09,1031.042,Okay.
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1031.839,1037.118,"Well, the denial of a motion to reopen, at that point there would be a final order in effect."
2007.06-1181,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1037.118,1039.445,Right.
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1050.036,1051.253,That's correct.
2007.06-1181,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1051.253,1052.832,And how long do those take on average?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1052.832,1063.139,"One difference, though, between petitions for review and motions to reopen is that petitions for review can be decided from outside the country under the 1996 amendments."
2007.06-1181,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1070.918,1072.088,I'm not interested in the problem.
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1086.723,1091.406,--Petitions for review take longer.
2007.06-1181,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1098.797,1105.7,"And then, and then do you in addition ask for cert or is it not in addition?"
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1107.261,1110.213,"--Your Honor, I don't have those exact statistics."
2007.06-1181,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1110.213,1112.822,Or would you just guess on the basis of your experience?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1113.712,1118.68,There might be cases where alien seek cert as well.
2007.06-1181,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1120.399,1120.633,All right.
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1144.154,1167.005,"--Well, one of the answers on that question on the petition for review front is exactly what the government has proposed in its rule going forward, which is that an alien who has voluntary departure can file a petition for review, but by doing so the voluntary departure grant terminates and they're in the same position as other aliens, on the same level playing as other aliens."
2007.06-1181,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1180.998,1183.715,I'm not sure I understand it.
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1192.962,1197.071,"Just for the motion, just for the time that the motion to reopen is decided."
2007.06-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1197.071,1197.961,That's what I thought.
2007.06-1181,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1197.961,1200.164,"Well then, that's the answer to my question."
2007.06-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1200.164,1206.051,But in your discussion with Justice Breyer you seemed to be saying that he can hang around right through the appeal.
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1206.051,1207.456,"Thank you for the correction, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1207.456,1215.532,"Well, is your position that the right to appeal is taken away, just as under the current regime the motion to reopen is taken away?"
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1215.532,1218.343,"No, Chief Justice Roberts."
2007.06-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1241.708,1246.003,"That's by regulation, though, that he can't, he cannot pursue that from out of the country."
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1246.003,1246.878,"Yes, that's true."
2007.06-1181,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1257.67,1277.381,"If your client or some other client, assuming the government wins in this case, leaves within the 60-day period and the petition for rehearing is forwarded, can he take all these affidavits and apply for an adjustment of status, or is that much longer?"
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1277.381,1277.678,No.
2007.06-1181,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1293.203,1294.719,Even with voluntary departure?
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1294.719,1296.031,Even with voluntary departure.
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1323.176,1337.936,Do you have to argue that the... my understanding is that once the... let's say it's the government's proposed regulation and the motion for... or the voluntary departure is withdrawn to enable you to consider the motion to reopen.
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1341.498,1342.357,Absolutely.
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1342.357,1348.73,"So you... you almost have to be arguing that the motion to reopen tolls the time for deportation as well, right?"
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1348.73,1350.681,No.
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1357.304,1360.614,"Well, under your position, I guess, is what your position is on that."
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1360.614,1362.207,--Right.
2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1378.873,1385.089,"In other words, the government cannot enter a deportation order during a voluntary departure period."
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1385.089,1385.417,Yes.
2007.06-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.334,1399.349,So I'm not following this.
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1428.025,1429.759,"--I'm sorry, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1456.576,1467.228,"And that, that involuntary deportation would effectively cancel the, the petition for reopening, right?"
2007.06-1181,0,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1467.228,1473.32,If the agency acted quickly enough and involuntarily deported someone within that time--
2007.06-1181,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.32,1490.703,"Why are you willing to leave the involuntary deportees in that position, whereas you're not willing to leave the voluntary deportees in that position, that their reopening petition just vanishes?"

2007.06-1181,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1511.008,1511.678,"Thank you, Mr. Meade."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1519.129,1533.747,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The filing of a motion to reopen does not automatically suspend the obligation of an alien to leave the United States within the time that was specified in the Board's order granting permission to depart voluntarily.
2007.06-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1553.943,1561.019,"Mr. Kneedler, I think, I think that your, your opposing counsel gave a good answer to that."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1597.051,1600.469,"--Well, let me make one--"
2007.06-1181,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1600.469,1602.266,"That's a very strange statutory quid pro quo, it seems to me."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1602.266,1604.843,--Let me make one point clear at the outset.
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1633.722,1634.285,"Well, that may be."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1697.026,1698.697,"With all respect, that's not correct."
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1698.697,1699.416,Why?
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1699.416,1710.333,"Again, both prior to 1996 and after 1996 Congress specified that an alien who overstays the voluntary departure period is ineligible for three forms of discretionary relief."
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1761.734,1767.075,"Okay, but isn't the question in this case whether what Congress did was as modest as you say?"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1790.238,1790.722,Well--
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1790.722,1791.863,And it seems strange that it would have.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1791.863,1793.611,--Two responses to that.
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1804.982,1817.275,"Well, it was... was the regulation... was the current regulation in place at the time of the '96 Act, that the... that the departure of the alien, whatever the term is, waives the motion to--"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1817.275,1822.226,--That regulation has been a fundamental part of motions to reopen going back at least until the 1960s.
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1822.226,1823.427,"--So, we assume that Congress knew that."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1823.427,1823.802,Yes.
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1833.938,1862.444,"Okay, then Congress knew at the time of the '96 Act that, if in fact the motion to reopen was filed in the normal course, it probably couldn't be heard prior to the date at which (a) the alien either will overstay and be in trouble for that or (b) will have departed and, under the existing regulatory regime, have forfeited his right to reopen."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1872.235,1872.954,No.
2007.06-1181,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1940.602,1964.998,"Mr. Kneedler, why did the Government advise this Court not to grant cert on question number 1, which was: I want to apply to reopen and simultaneously, I want to withdraw my voluntary departure and be just like any other removable alien, take my chances just like anyone else?"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1971.869,1975.79,Because that had not been... led to widespread litigation in the courts.
2007.06-1181,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1994.658,2005.606,"And it seems that this litigant said, number one, I don't want to take advantage of the status of I have to get out, but I can do so voluntarily."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2036.937,2043.356,"--But the Court rewrote the question presented so as not to... not to address that, so I think it's not before the Court right here."
2007.06-1181,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2061.022,2068.05,"What is the basis for the rule that an alien can't withdraw, can't seek to withdraw a request for voluntary departure?"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2068.05,2071.706,"--The regulations do not provide for it, and it's inconsistent with the--"
2007.06-1181,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2071.706,2074.188,There is no regulation that prohibits it.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2075.234,2093.696,"--As far as I'm aware there is no regulation that prohibits it, but the order is a grant of voluntary departure, and the Board of Immigration Appeals order says you're granted permission to depart voluntarily within 30 days; if you do not, the following consequences flow from that."
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2138.225,2141.346,"I'm having a lot of trouble understanding the case, because it's so complicated."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2156.826,2158.185,"Right, but the people--"
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2158.185,2158.638,Okay.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2165.619,2166.4,--Yes.
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2166.4,2166.791,Okay.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2180.16,2181.066,Well--
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2181.066,2183.08,I'm not talking about reopening.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2184.096,2191.655,"--Well, if he... if he leaves the country, I believe he can still appeal to the BIA."
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2191.655,2193.733,"And can you go to court, too?"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2193.733,2195.31,Yes.
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2204.728,2205.197,Okay.
2007.06-1181,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2212.148,2215.427,Does not he lose his right to have the motion to reopen ruled upon?
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2215.427,2217.49,"That's what I'm asking, I'm getting at."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2217.49,2218.769,--If I could just correct.
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2223.361,2225.298,I'm not talking about motions to reopen at all.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2225.298,2225.923,"--No, I understand that."
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2228.062,2228.515,Okay.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2231.186,2232.421,That's where you go after--
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2232.421,2232.858,Okay.
2007.06-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.107,2236.199,I don't understand your answer.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2238.699,2241.869,"--I've been informed that you... that if you leave the country, you cannot pursue."
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2241.869,2242.088,--Cannot.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2245.634,2247.788,"No, you can't... you can't go to the BIA."
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2247.788,2249.132,You can't go anywhere.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2249.132,2251.975,You can't... you cannot go to the BIA.
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2251.975,2256.394,"So you lose all your appeals, not just your motion-to-reopen appeals if you leave the country?"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2256.394,2259.347,Your administrative appeals.
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2265.25,2265.812,Oh.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2267.406,2268.187,Yes.
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2278.73,2282.056,"Yes, but you can't get to court if you haven't been to the BIA, right?"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2282.056,2285.821,I believe... I believe that's true unless--
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2285.821,2291.818,"And, again, we are talking about a short period of time, like 30 days."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2306.468,2319.26,"--I think that... I think that would be correct unless... I don't think this has ever come up that I'm aware of, about whether you could go to court from an immigration judge's decision where you've left the country and therefore can't appeal to the BIA."
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2319.26,2321.759,There's no reason to assume that you could.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2321.759,2343.187,"I just don't know the answer... I just don't know the answer to that, because I'm not sure that scenario has come up, because usually, if somebody wants to contest, they're not going to leave the country before they have to, and if you appeal from the immigration judge to the Board of Immigration Appeals, that suspends the finality of the order of removal or the order of voluntary departure that the immigration judge has entered."
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2353.074,2362.242,And by doing that you do preserve your right to appeal; and you will preserve your... will you also preserve your right to go to court if you lose in front of the BIA.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2362.242,2362.445,Yes.
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2362.883,2363.211,Okay.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2363.976,2364.398,Yes.
2007.06-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2365.804,2382.626,"So why, if you want to have a petition for reopening, why don't you just file an appeal and then file a petition for reopening and the appeal will enable you to stay in the country until your... your petition for reopening is--"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2382.626,2389.763,"--If you appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, a motion to reopen arises only after the Board has issued a final order on your appeal."
2007.06-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.713,2400.867,--You're appealing the immigration judge's decision.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2400.867,2401.555,--Right.
2007.06-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2401.555,2404.46,"The immigration judge's decision, you're appealing that to the BIA."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2404.46,2404.82,Right.
2007.06-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2404.82,2407.678,And that... that enables you to stay in the country--
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2407.678,2408.022,Yes.
2007.06-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2408.616,2412.94,--And at the same time you file a petition to reopen the... the administrative law judge's--
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2412.94,2413.676,--With the immigration judge.
2007.06-1181,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.676,2414.425,--Yes.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2414.425,2424.373,"I... I suppose you could do that, but the... but the appeal... it would be like a motion to reopen in the district court while you've got an appeal to the... to the BIA."
2007.06-1181,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2494.065,2495.813,May I ask one question?
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2515.025,2515.635,--That... that's true.
2007.06-1181,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2515.774,2520.507,While you have an appeal... while you have an appeal from what was in the record.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2520.507,2521.195,"--Right, although--"
2007.06-1181,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2521.195,2526.145,"If you don't have the motion to reopen then the... then the new material is not subject to the appeal, or am I wrong?"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2526.145,2526.52,--No.
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2584.824,2589.339,"--So your basic is... don't tell me if I'm right if I'm wrong, please."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2609.596,2610.689,That... that--
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2610.689,2623.48,"And if we decide against you, then you're thinking, well, what will happen in every case is after there is a final order, the alien will move for a motion to reopen because he will get a few extra days."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2623.48,2624.464,--It's more than a few extra days.
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2624.464,2626.37,He gets a... several--
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2626.37,2627.339,It's an automatic tolling period.
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2627.339,2629.666,"--Have I got it right, what your point is?"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2629.666,2629.978,Yes.
2007.06-1181,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2675.086,2682.239,"Why isn't the solution to withdraw, relinquish the voluntary departure?"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2682.239,2692.314,"--That would be... that would be one... as the Attorney General said in his proposed regulations, that would be one way to administer the program, but the Act does not compel that."
2007.06-1181,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2693.485,2697.235,"If you do that, the alien is still subject to deportation, right?"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2697.235,2697.438,--Yes.
2007.06-1181,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2699.171,2701.248,With the provision that he can get a stay.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2701.248,2719.756,"Yes, he could get... he could get a stay of removal, and the same... same thing is true here, if the... if the alien remains in the country, his voluntary departure period expires, he could file for a stay of removal with the Board or he could file for a stay of removal with the court of appeals if he wants to file a petition."
2007.06-1181,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2719.756,2727.987,"But then because he would then be back... if he stays here after the period is run, then he has relinquished the voluntary departure."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2729.612,2730.003,Right.
2007.06-1181,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2735.938,2740.045,--But not to stay... but he would not be hanging on to his voluntary departure.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2740.467,2742.544,"No, that... that is correct."
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2742.544,2751.415,Is there any reason he could not unilaterally relinquish the voluntary departure status as distinct from having to get approval from the Board or bureaucrat?
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2751.415,2760.304,"Well, as I say, the way that... the Board's order grants him permission to voluntary depart and says the following consequences will attach if you do not."
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2764.66,2767.316,"Well, I know it doesn't... it doesn't address the issue, and my question is--"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2767.316,2768.675,"Well, I think it probably forecloses it."
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2768.675,2769.83,--Why?
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2769.83,2779.577,"Because it's the... it's the content of the Board's order that... that says you have 60 days to depart and if you do not, the following consequences attach."
2007.06-1181,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2779.577,2792.135,"No, but the Board is saying, look, I'm granting your request... we are granting your request for a voluntary departure status and there are certain consequences that that status carries."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2806.362,2811.188,I... I... the statute and regulations just don't provide for it.
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2811.188,2817.483,"Well, if they don't provide for it, and they don't say you can't do it, why isn't it arbitrary not to let him do it?"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2819.701,2821.091,He... he requested it at the outset.

2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2851.953,2852.343,"--Yes, I--"
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2852.343,2856.467,What I don't see is to say once you ask for this you can never get status adjustment.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2856.467,2857.264,--Yes.
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2865.698,2866.962,So why not apply them to this person?
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2866.962,2870.555,--As they are now drafted they would apply prospectively.
2007.06-1181,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2885.361,2897.044,"Which you say... you say that under the current regime, the voluntary departure application, granted, is irrevocable."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2897.716,2901.028,--I think essentially... I think essentially yes.
2007.06-1181,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2901.434,2903.448,--The regulations don't say that.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2909.664,2910.461,--Yes.
2007.06-1181,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2976.121,2977.778,But the order didn't say he couldn't withdraw?
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2977.778,2979.542,"No, it didn't."
2007.06-1181,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2979.542,2981.464,So what about this?
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3013.735,3044.643,"I think... I think if the Court wants to get into the question of whether he could withdraw it, the proper thing for the Court to do would be to reject the Petitioner's argument that there is an automatic tolling rule, because that's fundamentally inconsistent with Congress' deliberate intention to impose a short deadline and not let the agency extend that, but to remand to the Board of Immigration Appeals for an explanation as to whether he could withdraw his request for voluntary departure."
2007.06-1181,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3068.837,3077.646,In one of your... in one of your arguments earlier you said the whole idea of voluntary departure is to expedite the proceedings and so forth.
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3084.269,3086.721,It is--
2007.06-1181,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3086.721,3087.393,"In other words, it... or am I wrong?"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3087.393,3088.485,--No.
2007.06-1181,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3097.027,3103.806,"Yes, but the removal... at the outset, you don't elect voluntary departure at the outset of the hearing?"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3103.806,3104.447,--You can.
2007.06-1181,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3112.569,3112.756,"No, no, no."
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3114.115,3114.444,--Right.
2007.06-1181,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3127.047,3131.593,"Mr. Kneedler, do you know what percentage of these motions to reopen are granted?"
2007.06-1181,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3131.593,3132.015,I do not.
2007.06-1181,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3324.187,3325.545,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2007.06-1181,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3337.604,3345.646,The government's arguments on the statutory interpretation in this case are undermined by its own proposed rule for at least five reasons.
2007.06-1181,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3387.129,3396.751,Do you agree with counsel for the government as to how long it typically takes for these motions to reopen to be disposed of?
2007.06-1181,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3400.437,3409.995,"My understanding is that the time, that the time is actually relatively short, that they are generally decided within 90 days."
2007.06-1181,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3426.895,3433.346,Do you have any estimate about how many more motions to reopen will have to be considered if your client prevails in this case?
2007.06-1181,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3433.346,3439.001,"--I do not think that there will be many additional motions to reopen, if that happens."
2007.06-1181,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3470.05,3480.952,"No, I don't understand that, because my... as I understand it, it would in every case grant an effective extension of the time which you would have to depart if you had filed a motion to reopen."
2007.06-1181,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3480.952,3483.03,"No, that's not correct, with respect."
2007.06-1181,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3505.317,3507.114,Isn't it your position that the statute requires tolling?
2007.06-1181,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3507.114,3513.173,--Our interpretation is the statute is subject to multiple interpretations.
2007.06-1181,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3536.242,3539.693,You answered my question with respect to the government's proposed regulation.
2007.06-1181,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3553.658,3560.343,The motions to reopen are subject to statutory and regulatory limits.
2007.06-1181,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3561.826,3562.372,The answer is yes?
2007.06-1181,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3562.372,3572.431,"--I'm saying that there... aliens could choose to do so, but I disagree that there would be a... many additional motions to reopen."
2007.06-1181,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3572.431,3578.538,"--Your answer is yes, but the Attorney General's rule would prevent that... proposed rule would--"
2007.06-1181,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3578.538,3578.929,Yes.
2007.06-1181,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3591.189,3595.39,"Not if it has 10,000 of these a year, as you told me in your opening argument."
2007.06-1181,2,19630,christopher_j_meade,,3601.231,3602.216,--No.
2007.06-1181,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3644.965,3646.246,"Thank you, counsel."
