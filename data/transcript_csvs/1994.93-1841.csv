1994.93-1841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.539,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 93-1841, Adarand Constructors, Inc., v. Federico Pena, Secretary of Transportation."
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,12.724,15.426,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1841,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,87.706,90.141,Do we know that that was the reason for the rejection?
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,90.141,92.193,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
1994.93-1841,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,108.819,115.375,Does that clarify that it was the presumption that was crucial in this case?
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,115.375,115.925,--No.
1994.93-1841,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,144.542,150.446,Did the judge take that... make that a finding that that was an undisputed material fact?
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,150.446,155.083,"There... Justice Souter, there were no genuine issues of material fact remaining in the dispute."
1994.93-1841,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,174.247,180.568,"But you said the statute, and there are several statutes under which one can be certified."
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,187.054,188.537,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.93-1841,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,225.096,233.285,"But you're not challenging what has been called the 8(a) certification, or are you... does that enter into this case?"
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,233.285,241.122,"No, Justice Ginsburg, it does not, simply the presumption under this Federal highway set-aside, which is a direct funding program."
1994.93-1841,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.122,259.935,"May I ask, Mr. Pendley, the plaintiff is not suing for the... for damages or any backward-looking relief for this particular contract, as I understand it."
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,259.935,262.603,"We... no, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-1841,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.805,268.708,"Well, but that was not sought, and is not sought in this suit?"
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,268.708,276.712,"--We seek such other... such other relief as may be just and equitable under the premises, and that's on page 24."
1994.93-1841,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,276.712,281.766,I thought you were seeking an injunction and forward-looking relief.
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,281.766,284.885,"We are seeking both, Your Honor."
1994.93-1841,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,284.885,301.263,"The Solicitor General takes the position that the petitioner lacks standing for a failure to show that the presumption was applied here, or if it was, that it was applied incorrectly."
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,301.263,310.868,"Well, Justice O'Connor, we believe that there is plenty of evidence, that they know of no other basis that anyone in Colorado was certified as a DBE, except for the presumption."
1994.93-1841,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,340.554,353.112,"And what did the petitioner show would be his future damages, or the injury to be suffered in the future?"
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,353.112,363.383,"His injury, Justice O'Connor, is the fact that he cannot compete on an equal footing, as this Court held in the Jacksonville case, that that is the harm, that is the harm, direct harm--"
1994.93-1841,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.383,368.537,"Well, in Jacksonville, was there some backward-looking relief being sought?"
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,368.537,370.387,"--I don't believe so, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-1841,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,402.259,407.079,Had he issued about 83 bids over a period of some 9 years?
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,408.496,411.281,"--Yes, Your Honor, Justice Kennedy."
1994.93-1841,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,444.566,451.156,"Of those 83, or, I guess 64 where there were subcontractors, had your client bid on all of those?"
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,451.156,454.608,"He bids on every one that has a guardrail, depending on the bid."
1994.93-1841,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,454.608,459.762,"Mr. Pendley, I'm still trying to get clear on the significance of what we have for the standing issue."
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,475.855,481.657,"The... excuse me, Your Honor, the floor as to the--"
1994.93-1841,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,481.657,482.759,"No, I... flaw--"
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,482.759,483.542,"--Oh, flaw."
1994.93-1841,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,483.542,484.142,--The constitutional infirmity.
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,485.044,485.694,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1994.93-1841,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,485.694,487.461,It's my regional accent.
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,489.746,493.448,It's my hearing.
1994.93-1841,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,497.784,500.903,And you asserted that in the complaint?
1994.93-1841,0,45882,william_perry_pendley,,500.903,502.505,"--I believe that we did, Your Honor, yes."
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1488.948,1492.685,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1538.98,1556.442,"General Days, why couldn't Congress have done this without a presumption, and just said that if the DBE can show factual economic disadvantage, it gets the benefit, but not use any presumption?"
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1556.442,1584.944,"Mr. Chief Justice, Congress could have done that, but I think what the record reflects here is a review by Congress over a number of years, looking at the degree to which Federal contracting dollars were going to contractors who had participated in some way or reinforced discrimination against members of certain racially and economically disadvantaged groups and decided that this was the appropriate way to do it."
1994.93-1841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1584.944,1588.146,So it's really a matter of administrative convenience?
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1591.265,1594.3,"Well, I wouldn't characterize it as administrative convenience."
1994.93-1841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1604.006,1614.898,"And Congress, then, was indifferent to the fact that perhaps people who had not been in fact economically disadvantaged might, because of the presumption, nonetheless get the benefit of it?"
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1614.898,1626.688,"--Congress was, I think, concerned about that, but was aware that the administrative scheme that was in place or set up after the statute was amended would deal with those particular problems."
1994.93-1841,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1657.208,1669.717,"General Days, as a practical matter, how does a third party go about challenging the economic disadvantage presumption as applied to a particular contractor?"
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1669.717,1695.416,"What a contractor, a subcontractor would do in a situation like this in Adarand's case is bring to the attention of the contracting officer or, if it were appropriate, to the SBA, the fact that it felt that a company that claimed to be a disadvantaged business enterprise was not a disadvantaged business enterprise."
1994.93-1841,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1703.521,1706.14,How does he know that the company is claiming that status?
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1712.977,1713.377,Yes.
1994.93-1841,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1732.541,1733.641,But how would you know which one?
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1739.112,1739.495,Yes.
1994.93-1841,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1739.495,1753.621,And how does someone like petitioner know that from that long list a particular one is going to be trying to get the certification and therefore that's the one that should be challenged?
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1753.621,1758.025,"Well, it can be done at the time that that subcontractor comes forward."
1994.93-1841,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1781.289,1785.425,How would the petitioner know that Gonzales had been identified?
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1785.425,1792.929,"--One of the ways that Adarand would know, in fact, is that Gonzales has been involved in a number of contracts, and they're generally aware--"
1994.93-1841,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1792.929,1803.221,But there's no mechanism to let the petitioner know in a particular situation that this is the one to focus on?
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1803.221,1813.16,"--I think that once the subcontract is let to Gonzales, Adarand can come in and say Gonzales does not qualify appropriately as a DBE."
1994.93-1841,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1813.16,1817.064,"That makes it much harder to upset, I suppose, after the fact."
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1822.967,1824.267,Yes.
1994.93-1841,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1824.267,1826.086,--one of these certifications?
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1826.086,1826.502,"Yes, I am."
1994.93-1841,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.218,1854.37,Who determined that?
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1854.37,1857.905,--This was determined by the Small Business Administration.
1994.93-1841,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1857.905,1861.19,"In response to somebody's challenge, or on its own initiative?"
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1861.19,1863.225,"It's not clear exactly how that was done, but--"
1994.93-1841,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1863.225,1872.747,"Do you have any example where somebody in the position of Adarand successfully challenged, brought... an individual successfully brought a challenge?"
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1873.514,1876.299,"--It's very hard, Justice Scalia, to identify that, because--"
1994.93-1841,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.299,1878.215,You don't know of any.
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1878.215,1886.588,"--That's correct, but the record does reflect that there have been many situations where that has happened."
1994.93-1841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1886.588,1889.623,"When you say ""that"", what do you mean?"
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1889.623,1898.728,"Well, by that I mean that there have been challenges to the certification of agencies as disadvantaged business enterprises."
1994.93-1841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1898.728,1902.597,By competing subcontractors?
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1902.597,1903.999,"I think the point, Mr. Chief Justice--"
1994.93-1841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1903.999,1906.318,"You can answer that yes or no, General Days."
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1906.318,1923.094,"--No, I don't think that we have precisely pinned down, but the point is that the SBA and the State contracting agencies get information from a number of sources, and they are open to claims from any source, and then investigate those particular situations."
1994.93-1841,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.094,1935.136,"Well, Adarand says that as a practical matter that's a fantasy, that there's not enough time, there's not enough information, and besides which you blackball yourself by identifying yourself as a litigious individual."
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1957.434,1959.286,"Well, it is not, Justice Scalia."
1994.93-1841,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1986.353,1996.959,"I might be wrong about this, but I... correct me if I... but my impression was under section 8(d), which is... I take it is what they're challenging, it's the procurement officer who makes the challenge."
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2003.815,2004.215,That's correct.
1994.93-1841,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2004.215,2008.867,"--to that officer, and I take it that could be confidential, or not, I don't know on that."
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2008.867,2009.636,"Well, I don't know--"
1994.93-1841,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2009.636,2012.754,And I take it it's the procuring officer himself who undertakes the burden.
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2014.338,2014.854,--That's correct.
1994.93-1841,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2014.854,2016.006,The contractors go to the officer.
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2016.006,2022.359,"That's correct, and as I indicated, this information can be received from any source."
1994.93-1841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2022.359,2037.386,Is it open to one who challenges the certification to show that the individual that owns the certified firm has not him or herself been the victim of societal discrimination?
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2037.386,2046.559,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, but that I think is done in a practical sense through challenging economic disadvantage."
1994.93-1841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2075.494,2087.469,"But under the act, at least it's theoretically possible to challenge the determination that this person has not in fact been subject to racial discrimination?"
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2087.469,2098.877,"I think, Justice Kennedy, it's not correct to say that there can be a challenge to someone who says, I am an African American, that they in fact are not African American."
1994.93-1841,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2146.805,2160.748,"General Days, I believe Mr. Pendley said he's not challenging the 8(a) certification program, and it does seem that there's a big difference when you get to economic disadvantage, that it's not automatic under 8(a)."
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2161.765,2162.25,that's correct.
1994.93-1841,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2162.25,2171.123,"--that there's a presumption under 8(d) that if nobody challenges it just sticks based on minority status, but that's not so for 8(a) certification?"
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2171.123,2171.956,That's correct.
1994.93-1841,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.62,2233.161,"General Days, what is the limit of... if there is any, of the Government's ability to use race as a... as the basis for a presumption in some of its programs?"
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2261.347,2261.797,I--
1994.93-1841,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.797,2266.917,"--very serious, critical need for perfection in this program, and the Government says, we're just going to adopt this presumption."
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2274.671,2286.748,"--Justice Scalia, I think that the difference between this situation and the situation that you posed is a question of whether Congress is acting for remedial purposes, and what we have here is--"
1994.93-1841,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2286.748,2288.264,I don't know what that means.
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2292.133,2311.946,"--No, but what I'm talking about is Congress either explicitly or by way of the operation of a statutory scheme is attempting to remedy the effects of prior racial discrimination, relying upon its authority under section 5 of the Fourteenth, or other provisions of the Civil War Amendment."
1994.93-1841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2311.946,2322.937,"Well, but how can section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment give Congress authority to lessen the effect of that amendment on congressional actions?"
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2330.508,2330.808,Correct.
1994.93-1841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2330.808,2334.812,"It could make the standards more stringent, but not less stringent."
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2341.216,2343.251,That Congress can make the rules--
1994.93-1841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2343.251,2343.618,Yes.
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2343.618,2344.085,--less stringent?
1994.93-1841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2344.085,2355.392,"Yes, that the equal protection component, let's say, of the Fifteenth... of the Fifth Amendment would be less demanding on Congress."
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2355.392,2390.331,"I think what this Court has indicated in a number of decisions is that Congress possesses a unique and comprehensive power to legislate under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, or section 2 of the Thirteenth, or of the Fifteenth Amendment, to remedy the effects of racial discrimination, or denial of equal protection, but particularly where racial discrimination is concerned, and the example that Justice Scalia gave indicates nothing about the desire of Congress to deal with discrimination and to remedy it."
1994.93-1841,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2390.331,2396.302,"It can do that, but can it do it by adopting race-based presumptions?"
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2398.252,2398.669,Yes.
1994.93-1841,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.669,2404.039,"--that it can act to eliminate the effects of discrimination, but can it do it by simply adopting a presumption on racial lines?"
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2404.039,2405.241,"Yes, it can."
1994.93-1841,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2429.69,2437.344,"Congress made the determination in Fullilove, I suppose, that 10 percent was the adequate remedial number."
1994.93-1841,1,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,2437.344,2437.644,Mm-hmm.
