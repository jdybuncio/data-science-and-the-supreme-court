1955.129,0,33716,john_j_yowell,,17.317,18.214,Mr. Yowell.
1955.129,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,18.214,19.196,Yowell.
1955.129,0,33716,john_j_yowell,,19.196,22.486,May it please the Court.
1955.129,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,647.742,650.707,"Is the company operating them, Mr. Yowell?"
1955.129,0,33716,john_j_yowell,,650.707,655.979,"At this moment, it is not, Your Honor, but it was at the time the suit was filed and for some little time after."
1955.129,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,664.258,664.508,Yes.
1955.129,0,33716,john_j_yowell,,664.508,670.829,"-- “We like to do it and will you please tell us whether we can do it or not, the case, we should go ahead and do it.”"
1955.129,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,779.397,781.712,Is there any response to that letter?
1955.129,0,33716,john_j_yowell,,781.712,785.155,"There was not, Your Honor."
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,2951.05,2954.324,May it please the Court.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3087.912,3092.444,"Mr. Wine, please forgive me to interrupt you in asking you, what declarative order to meet?"
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3092.444,3092.687,Yes.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3153.997,3158.533,To reclaim power is vague by waiting to see what Illinois (Voice Overlap) --
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3158.533,3159.585,"No, they did not."
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3159.585,3160.448,They threw it out.
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3160.448,3162.305,They did.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3162.305,3163.905,And they couldn't -- can handle this at all.
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3163.905,3164.877,They did.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3164.877,3166.422,Are you defending that?
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3166.422,3172.937,"Yes, for reasons which -- but not entirely on the grounds designed in the opinion."
1955.129,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3194.847,3196.417,They remitted your --
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3196.417,3198.289,"I mean remitting the parties, not the cause."
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3270.19,3295.281,"Would you at this moment and based to what you have indicated, the Court would have to remit it or remand to the District Court, tell him to be ceased of jurisdiction directing the District Court to assert jurisdiction which is now disavowed and having a sense of jurisdiction to this Fourteenth Amendment of a judicial argument."
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3295.281,3296.751,I think so.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3296.751,3304.302,"We'll have to go through that form because this Court can't enter 10 cases as now in all three, he -- he entered this kind of a judgement --"
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3304.302,3304.492,Well --
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3304.492,3305.251,-- here in the jurisdiction.
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3305.251,3329.166,"I -- I think -- I think that's -- that's correct, but that the reasons why I'm knowing for well what's in Your Honor's mind in having had the benefit of Your Honor's colloquy with Mr. Yowell, the reason why I'm still so earnestly asking this will become apparent when I'm through with my narration of the facts, which will put the case, I think, in a different light from what it is now."
1955.129,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3364.149,3366.99,Was the Illinois bank charged against cashing checks?
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3366.99,3368.081,I beg your pardon?
1955.129,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3368.081,3370.927,Illinois' bank charged in cashing the checks?
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3370.927,3375.215,They don't charge an Illinois bank.
1955.129,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3390.968,3393.446,And people go to these exchanges and pay for it?
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3393.446,3394.508,They do.
1955.129,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,3519.269,3524.448,"Mr. Wines, you're taking the position in the McDougall case, did passed on the constitutional (Voice Overlap) --"
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3524.448,3529.684,Only by way of a dictum and not in the light of the considerations urged in this case.
1955.129,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,3536.044,3547.603,"Well then, on that theory, why would it not be appropriate or in accordance with the precedent for the federal court to require them to pass on it before the federal court does?"
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3547.603,3548.634,"Oh, I think it is."
1955.129,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,3549.468,3550.194,They should --
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3550.194,3550.318,Yes.
1955.129,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,3550.318,3551.335,-- they should leave it open to the --
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3551.335,3551.392,That's correct.
1955.129,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,3551.392,3552.473,-- to simply pass on.
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3552.473,3553.936,That's correct.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3553.936,3564.045,"It has to be that the District Court, the Northern District, they will hold this case and subject to a declaratory judgment?"
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3564.045,3567.624,They could say that.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3568.179,3569.634,"Well then, because clearly --"
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3569.634,3569.847,I thought --
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3569.847,3576.31,"-- what this Court meant, the District Courts had jurisdiction for mentioning the other cases."
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3576.31,3578.599,"The Fieldcrest case, yes."
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3578.599,3584.528,"And in those cases, I have said about the other conclusions and certainly held (Inaudible)"
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3584.528,3607.119,"Yes, but don't you see this difference, Your Honor, if -- that's Your Honors holding it, but it was this three-judge District Court, if these plaintiffs bring their suit in the Illinois and they go to the Illinois Supreme Court, and the Illinois Supreme Court decide adversely to the very direct appeal here, they don't have to face the problem of this Court's discretionary grant of certiorari."
1955.129,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3664.653,3670.111,"They might -- they might uphold it just for three years, it might be the Supreme Court -- Court of Illinois would have decided on it."
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3670.111,3670.428,We can start --
1955.129,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3670.428,3678.479,"I'm thinking the Magnolia Petroleum case, we held our direction to hold it under (Inaudible) they could an action, they could."
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3678.479,3680.652,"Frankly, I don't see that it makes much difference --"
1955.129,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3680.652,3680.895,I don't see --
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3680.895,3691.173,"-- where they dismiss it or hold it because the case will come here on direct appeal or certainly, they would dismiss it for failure to exhaust that right."
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3700.27,3702.35,It doesn't make a difference does it?
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3739.436,3740.318,Yes.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3740.318,3742.856,"-- and therefore, this is civil intermediary set."
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3742.856,3743.642,Yes.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3743.642,3751.362,"He's got jurisdiction in the sense that he has power including the appropriate relationship in federal and state court, we don't think he should exercise it."
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3754.776,3757.231,That's right.
1955.129,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3784.373,3791.119,I think Mr. Yowell was cut short in -- in attempting to talk from the record if I remember it correctly.
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3797.842,3799.119,I think that may be true.
1955.129,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3799.119,3800.046,I beg your pardon?
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3802.572,3806.974,I shouldn't -- I -- I didn't -- I withdraw that.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3807.35,3809.255,What is the point of -- what is the point --
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3809.255,3809.579,He has said --
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3809.579,3810.045,(Voice Overlap) --
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3810.045,3811.999,-- that the American Express Company is not --
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3811.999,3812.8,(Voice Overlap).
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3815.297,3816.361,Yes.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3816.361,3818.104,There is no jurisdictional difference.
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3818.104,3818.823,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3818.823,3823.522,It would have an effect that says error in respect to both --
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3823.522,3825.796,I have finished my argument on the jurisdictional.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3825.796,3840.52,"(Voice Overlap) that this is a case for which the state court might divulge that the exception has been cut out, and therefore, that rule speculate the things, (Inaudible) is that right?"
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3840.52,3841.246,That's right.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3841.246,3851.823,"And are you going to argue that -- that the exemption is a proper one, it's not -- it doesn't offend the Equal Protection Clause, is that right?"
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3851.823,3854.201,"I wasn't going to come to that point yet, Your Honor."
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3854.201,3855.046,"So, when are you coming?"
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3855.046,3860.653,I'm coming to the point that -- mystery in -- in which the facts have not yet been stated.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3860.653,3863.098,But is that -- to what -- to what proposition?
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3863.098,3872.081,That the facts alleged in the -- in the complaint amount to a confession that the plaintiffs are using the mails to defraud and that they come into equity without clean hands.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3872.081,3874.154,(Inaudible)
1955.129,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3874.154,3874.65,When our --
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3874.65,3875.622,(Voice Overlap) can make that judge.
1955.129,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3875.622,3882.077,And you may have two -- you may have two more minutes to argue the facts of the case to -- to Mr. Yowell.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3885.887,3886.107,(Voice Overlap) --

1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3891.498,3893.415,"Well, that is your -- and this Court knows that but you didn't --"
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3893.415,3897.058,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3897.058,3900.921,"And did it exists, the court order to look into that."
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3900.921,3902.551,"In this case, yes."
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3903.791,3912.485,"And not to mean to shut anybody off, I -- just that exemption to allege into the (Inaudible) whether his argument were irrelevant facts."
1955.129,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3912.485,3915.707,"Well, both of you may have some time to discuss that."
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,3915.707,3925.593,"If Your Honors will be good enough to look at the exhibits, photo static exhibits on pages -- on page 224 of the transcript of the record."

1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4295.131,4296.471,I'm confident with this.
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,4296.471,4296.825,Yes.

1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,4299.481,4300.627,Yes.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4300.627,4308.704,"In your motion to affirm, you say 10 reasons why the judgment below should be affirmed."
1955.129,1,46556,william_c_wines,,4352.751,4353.291,I'm very sorry.
1955.129,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4353.291,4355.769,When we come in -- I'm not saying it's improper.
