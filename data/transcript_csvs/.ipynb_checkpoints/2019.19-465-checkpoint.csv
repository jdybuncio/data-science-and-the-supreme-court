2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.04,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 19-465, Chiafalo and others versus the State of Washington. Mr. Lessig."
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,12.04,26.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court: The cases -- the question in these cases is straightforward: Do the states have the power to control through law how an elector may vote? They do not."
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,136.52,143.28,"Mr. Lessig, do you object to the pledge itself? Assume there's no fine or any other sanction."
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,151.16,165.2,"Absolutely, Your Honor. A pledge, understood the way Ray understood a pledge, having no legal obligation but a moral obligation, is perfectly fine pursuant -- as part of the appointment power of the state."
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,165.2,171.92,"Well, then -- so -- so the addition of a sanction makes no difference?"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,171.92,174.4,"No, the sanction makes all the difference."
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,200.04,209.72,"So, if there were a fine of one dollar, you would say that violates the Constitution, but if it's simply a pledge, no violation at all?"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,209.72,214.44,"That's right, because a fine is a legal obligation."
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,220.48,233.96,"So your argument is not that the sanction must have coercive effect, it's simply a -- if it's only a symbolic requirement, it still violates the law?"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,233.96,236.24,"No, Your Honor."
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,255.04,264.84,"So, by legally coercive, you mean something different than simply coercive? In other words, if you add one dollar, that becomes legally coercive?"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,264.84,286.0,"That's right, just as, with the Speech and Debate Clause, if you fine a Congressperson one dollar for his speech or his vote on the floor of Congress, that violates the Speech and Debate Clause. But there's no problem with saying to that Congressperson, to be a member of the Republican party, you must pledge to support the platform of the Republican party."
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,286.0,290.24,"Under your view, there would be no way to enforce the popular vote referendum?"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,290.24,295.8,"The national popular vote compact, is that what you mean, Your Honor?"
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,295.8,296.76,Right.
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,303.28,330.0,"Well, Your Honor, that obligation requires the states to pick a select slate of electors that fits with the winner of the national popular vote, and that slate of electors then would have the same discretion, legal discretion, that we believe any elector has. But, of course, if there's a national popular vote compact, the number of electors for the winner would be so significant, it would be very hard to imagine any discretion affecting the ultimate result."
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,330.0,331.64,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?"
2019.19-465,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,331.64,337.08,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Mr. Lessig, just a preliminary question."
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,354.56,358.84,"Your Honor, I think you can ask the question both ways, and it's the same answer both ways."
2019.19-465,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,392.56,396.84,So when -- when you make your -- I'm curious.
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,409.2,412.36,"The federal function establishes the discretion, Your Honor."
2019.19-465,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,450.12,459.84,How do we determine what the contours of this federal function -- of the federal function would be?
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,459.84,462.36,I would -- I would look just to the text.
2019.19-465,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,489.4,494.28,But does the -- does the Twelfth Amendment mention discretion?
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,494.28,494.52,No.
2019.19-465,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,523.16,538.36,"You know, can the State remove someone, for example, that's -- I just wonder what limits -- what authority the State actually has here. Can the State remove someone who openly solicits payments for his or her vote?"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,538.36,548.72,"You can certainly -- of course, this Court has said in Burroughs and in Fitzgerald v. Green, the state can certainly regulate corruption, and bribery would be corruption."
2019.19-465,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,552.04,552.52,So -- but where --
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,552.52,553.72,The question that --
2019.19-465,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,553.72,558.16,-- so where's the authority? Where does that come from?
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,558.16,589.16,"Well, it's interesting, Burroughs itself, Burroughs versus the United States, of course, found it inherent in the federal power to be able to protect federal elections from corruption. In Fitzgerald versus Green, they saw it as incidental to the power to appoint electors to be able to assure that the election, in that case the vote by the people, was consistent with law. Either of those could create the authority to avoid corruption, but, of course, corruption, like bribery, is independent of the vote."
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,602.0,602.92,Justice Ginsburg?
2019.19-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,602.92,613.72,"Mr. Lessig, I was surprised with the answer you gave to the Chief about Ray."
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,625.28,626.32,"No, Your Honor."
2019.19-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,676.6,693.12,"It's somewhat hard to understand the concept of something I am pledged, bound to do, I have made a promise to do something, but that promise is unenforceable."
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,693.12,699.72,"I understand, Your Honor. And -- and it is -- it is -- it's difficult until we recognize how familiar it is."
2019.19-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,750.04,752.76,Thank you.
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,752.76,754.92,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,754.92,757.36,Thank you.
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,773.04,773.96,Of course.
2019.19-465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,773.96,774.64,Of course.
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,782.2,783.28,Yes.
2019.19-465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,783.28,783.84,Yes.
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,811.04,811.96,"Yes, we believe they can because --"
2019.19-465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,811.96,812.68,"They can, all right."
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,812.68,813.76,-- it's a requirement --
2019.19-465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,813.76,837.2,"What's the difference between that and this situation, where they say, you must promise to vote for the person who wins the most votes, and then he gets to the room, and in that room, he doesn't live up to that requirement, just as he didn't live up to the requirement that he be a resident of the state?"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,837.2,842.28,"Your Honor, the difference is the line between the appointment and the voting."
2019.19-465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,876.36,887.44,"If, in fact, he changes his residence 10 minutes before he casts his vote, then you could remove him?"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,887.44,887.88,Prior to the --
2019.19-465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,887.88,911.2,"But, if you say he can't -- they can't, the State, when, in fact, he actually casts the vote, but surely a person who casts a vote for Jones instead of Black has, in fact, changed his mind 10 minutes before, and so can you not, in fact, remove him because of that preceding change of mind 10 minutes before?"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,911.2,915.76,"No, because the pledge is a pledge made prior to the appointment."
2019.19-465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,915.76,918.36,There's not a pledge in my hypothetical.
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,939.6,945.84,"But, again, Your Honor, the Constitution gives the states no power to regulate the vote."
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,965.76,977.48,Justice Alito? Justice Alito?
2019.19-465,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,977.48,977.64,Yes.
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1000.84,1023.0,"Your Honor, we believe that prior to the vote, the State's power is -- the incidental power exists to assure that the person who shows up has not engaged in criminal -- is not engaged in a criminal activity. It's difficult to imagine how that plays out, though, because, of course, the claim someone has bribed -- been bribed is a charge. It needs to be proven."
2019.19-465,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1046.16,1047.08,"Well, I thought your --"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1047.08,1047.16,-- if you give --
2019.19-465,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1047.16,1057.8,-- argument was that -- your argument must be either that the electors cannot be removed by the State -- the State says that at least some removal power goes along with the appointment power.
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1081.24,1092.24,"Your Honor, we -- we have said the bribe is different from a pledge because, of course, the bribe is proven differently from -- separately from how one votes."
2019.19-465,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1121.16,1125.76,So the State cannot create a vacancy by removing an elector who has been bribed?
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1125.76,1141.0,"Yes, unless the bribery statute makes as a -- a penalty a removal from office and there's a conviction prior to the actual time at which the vote has been taken, but that's, of course --"
2019.19-465,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1141.0,1144.68,Let me ask you one other question if I can.
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1185.56,1186.64,We deny it's a good possibility.
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1220.08,1220.88,Justice Sotomayor?
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1220.88,1226.44,In the ordinary close election --
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1226.44,1229.12,Justice Sotomayor?
2019.19-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1229.12,1240.6,"Counsel, you compare in your brief the Electoral College to a jury, arguing that they are structurally similar under the Constitution."
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1315.64,1324.36,"Well, Your Honor, you've identified the core immunity that a juror has, and that is the immunity in the vote to convict or not."
2019.19-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1369.8,1416.6,"Now you rely a lot on history in your argument, but doesn't McPherson undermine your position very directly, just like Ray does in some extent? In those cases, the -- in -- in those cases, the Court made clear that whatever the framers expected -- and, here, you make a good argument that some of the framers originally expected electors to have discretion -- that historical practice since the founding offered a practical interpretation of the Constitution. That's what Ray said. And McPherson said experience soon demonstrated that the electors were chosen simply to register the will of the appointing State."
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1419.0,1419.56,Your Honor --
2019.19-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1419.56,1427.48,-- that same principle undermine whatever you think some of the framers expected that historical --
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1427.48,1428.04,Your Honor --
2019.19-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1428.04,1443.92,"-- practice, at least since the Twelfth Amendment, has shown that states have imposed not just pledges but have imposed fines and some removal of electors who are faithless?"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1443.92,1455.28,"Your Honor, first, no state has ever, prior to 2016, imposed a fine to remove an elector. But number two, our argument has nothing to do with expectations."
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1472.2,1472.72,Justice Kagan?
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1472.72,1475.28,-- the question --
2019.19-465,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1475.28,1478.04,"Mr. Lessig, so let me ask you about those words."
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1522.68,1536.12,"Well, Your Honor, we believe, as Chief Justice Roberts has described, that the best way to understand these words, the best dictionary is the Constitution itself. The Constitution speaks of elector in two contexts."
2019.19-465,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1592.6,1593.96,"If that's right, Mr. --"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1593.96,1594.84,-- these were in --
2019.19-465,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1594.84,1627.28,"-- if that's right, Mr. Lessig, if -- if -- if your reading is -- is very deeply contextual, then shouldn't we look to what happened in the very first elections under the Constitution, where, you know, immediately, right away, electors associated themselves with a political party, pledged their votes ahead of time, and -- and it's that practice that has continued for over 200 years? So, if your reading isn't demanded by dictionary but is instead demanded by context and history, doesn't the context and history suggest the opposite?"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1627.28,1633.8,"Your Honor, we believe the context and history supports the idea, absolutely, that electors were to pledge themselves."
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1668.52,1668.8,Thank you --
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1668.8,1669.12,-- amendment --
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1669.12,1671.32,-- counsel. Justice Gore -- Justice Gorsuch?
2019.19-465,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1671.32,1688.96,"Counsel, could a state, for example, ask an elector to make a sworn statement as to his present intention to vote for a particular candidate, make the pledge an oath?"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1688.96,1690.56,Yes.
2019.19-465,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1690.56,1701.28,And could a state later prosecute that elector for perjury if that statement under oath -- if there's evidence that that was a false statement?
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1701.28,1703.04,"In principle, absolutely, Your Honor."
2019.19-465,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1720.0,1731.72,"And could a state say that we'll pay your expenses and give you a per diem for your service, but only if you carry out your promise to vote in a particular way that you pledged initially?"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1731.72,1731.96,No.
2019.19-465,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1738.48,1743.44,Why -- why couldn't it do that if it could do the other things?
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1743.44,1761.64,"Well, again, Your Honor, the difference is between a legal consequence or a legal penalty based on your judgment, your vote, a federal function of balloting, which is free of state control, and the other incidental powers relative to appointment. And so, in appointment, I want to make sure you're an honest person --"
2019.19-465,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1761.64,1782.36,"I'm sorry for interrupting, but I'm not sure -- I'm not sure I understand where -- where you're going, so I just want to cut -- cut to it if we can. So a state -- and my -- my last hypothetical is just simply saying, we'll pay your -- your -- your lunch, your -- your -- your travel and your per diem if -- if you conform to your pledge under oath."
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1790.52,1790.72,"Well, that --"
2019.19-465,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1790.72,1792.76,-- certain about that.
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1792.76,1798.52,"Well, that's right, Your Honor, because perjury involves a false statement at the time the pledge is made."
2019.19-465,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1803.92,1806.12,I'm -- I'm not asking about your client.
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1809.76,1810.04,Okay.
2019.19-465,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1833.12,1843.4,"And -- and with respect to the perjury example, could a state remove that individual and -- and not count his vote?"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1843.4,1847.44,"Your Honor, the perjury example does not allow them to remove the individual, no."
2019.19-465,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1860.56,1870.48,"Well, I'm sorry, I thought you indicated to earlier questions that you thought it was fine for a bribed elector to be removed from office prior to voting."
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1870.48,1878.8,"Yeah, I said that if you convict and convict the person prior to the actual voting, then you could remove them if it was --"
2019.19-465,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1878.8,1879.04,Okay.
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1882.96,1890.28,"If you could structure the statute and -- and succeed in the conviction, but, of course, the perjury requires at the time a false statement."
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1890.28,1893.2,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh?"
2019.19-465,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1893.2,1897.48,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Lessig."
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,1930.6,1956.32,"It's a good thing to consider, Your Honor, and what we've said is yes, on the one side, you might worry that there's a increased risk of ""chaos"" if electors have the discretion we believe they've always had. We suggest that the likelihood of that -- that is tiny given it requires electors who are the loyal of the loyal to band together in dozens or, you know, three dozen in the last election and flip sides."
2019.19-465,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2002.4,2002.6,Okay.
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,2004.6,2004.84,Sure.
2019.19-465,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2004.84,2026.4,"-- get to another question. You set this up appropriately as, in essence, the states versus the electors in some sense, but isn't it also appropriate to think of this as the voters versus the electors and that your position would, in essence, potentially disenfranchise voters in the state?"
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,2026.4,2035.32,"Your Honor, of course, in our case, the action of the electors was to further enfranchise the voters in the case -- in this case."
2019.19-465,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2035.32,2035.92,As a general theory --
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,2035.92,2036.92,They are trying --
2019.19-465,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2036.92,2042.36,-- as a general theory -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- wouldn't your position potentially lead to that?
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,2042.36,2045.64,"It's potentially true. That's -- that's right, Your Honor."
2019.19-465,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2045.64,2045.92,Okay.
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,2067.36,2094.28,"Well, Your Honor, first, of course, the State doesn't invoke the Tenth Amendment, but, if it did, it would fail because, whereas, in the Thornton case, for example, Justice Thomas could point to traditions that allowed the states to exercise the power that they wanted to exercise there, there is no tradition in America, maybe in the Soviet Union, as Justice Kagan -- Kagan suggests, but not in America, of a government exercising control over a voter, over an elector."
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2101.92,2102.24,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,2102.24,2105.12,-- there's no Tenth Amendment power either.
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2105.12,2106.48,"Counsel, thank you."
2019.19-465,0,34782,lawrence_lessig,,2111.16,2116.96,"Thank you, Your Honor. The question here has got to both be the constitutional and the pragmatic."
2019.19-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2160.0,2165.32,"Thank you, counsel. General Purcell."
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,2165.32,2174.84,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Constitution gives states the power to appoint electors."
2019.19-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2299.96,2301.36,General --
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,2301.36,2303.48,"Now, if you're --"
2019.19-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2303.48,2306.88,-- could the legislature appoint whomever they want to be an elector?
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,2306.88,2316.0,"Your Honor, there are certainly some limits on -- on the discretion. Other constitutional provisions, such as the Equal Protection Clause, impose limits, of course."
2019.19-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2325.36,2337.32,"Well, let's say after -- they don't appoint electors in any way before the -- the national vote, and then they select the electors that they would like after that vote."
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,2338.72,2342.12,"I don't think that's all right, Your Honor."
2019.19-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2412.72,2414.36,Say the State --
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,2414.36,2417.12,-- the State can do about that --
2019.19-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2417.12,2442.68,"-- let's say the State law for electors say that they have to vote for the slate of the party that sponsors them and that they will be certified as electors, unless the circumstances after the election have changed to the extent that the legislature thinks the electors ought to be changed. In other words, not unbridled discretion with the legislature, but a condition known to the electors before they were selected. Would that be all right?"
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,2442.68,2467.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that raises the same challenge as your earlier hypothetical, that while the legislature in the first instance has the power to set, you know, any condition that complies with the Constitution, once the legislature has given to the public the power to vote in a presidential election, they cannot override that vote, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause and this Court's cases. So -- so, you know, your hypothetical, I think, pushed up against that principle."
2019.19-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2485.48,2492.56,"So that all they have to do is tell the public that when it comes to electors, we're going to follow Mr. Lessig's view?"
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,2492.56,2499.4,"I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't understand that."
2019.19-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2501.8,2521.52,"Well, the question is you're -- you're suggesting that the critical factor is whether the State's conduct is based on a condition prior to the selection of electors, and if the electors know that they have the discretion or that the State -- excuse me, that the State has the discretion to replace them and the people know that, shouldn't that be enough?"
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,2521.52,2538.68,"No, Mr. Chief Justice. My -- my -- my -- the critical point is that if the condition is constitutional, then the condition can be enforced by removal or by sanction, just as it has been since before 1800. So, if the condition is you have to show up for the meeting of the Electoral College, the State can enforce that."
2019.19-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2548.72,2552.64,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?"
2019.19-465,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2552.64,2572.72,"Yes, thank you, Chief Justice. General Purcell, just to -- to clarify, could you give us precisely some of the limitations on the restrictions that the State can impose on elect -- on the electors? I understand you can require them to show up for the vote."
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,2583.24,2594.92,"Well, I think those are meaningful limits, Justice Thomas, and those are the limits -- this Court has said that the power of states over appointment is exclusive, is plenary. Obviously, as I said, the Equal Protection Clause imposes limits."
2019.19-465,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2620.56,2621.68,Yeah.
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,2636.72,2645.56,"Your Honor, I think there's three crucial problems with the other side's federal function argument. The first is that it's just not even supported by the cases they cite."
2019.19-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2731.4,2734.32,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Ginsburg."
2019.19-465,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2734.32,2752.2,"What do you make of the fact that Congress has never failed to count an anomalous electoral vote, not once? It has always accepted the anomalous vote."
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,2752.2,2765.04,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that highlights Congress's view that it should defer to states about the votes that they certify to Congress to count. Of course, in every example that the other side's given, the State had certified those votes as the State's votes."
2019.19-465,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2785.88,2790.24,Thank you.
2019.19-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2790.24,2792.76,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2792.76,2812.48,"Thank you. Counsel, I'd like you to assume, whether this is Mr. Lessig's argument or not, assume this is my argument for present purposes. The only thing a state cannot do is to punish the elector for the way he actually casts his vote."
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,2893.92,2906.28,"Well, Justice Breyer, there's a lot there and I want to start by addressing your last question about what can Congress do. Congress cannot solve this problem because Congress cannot appoint an elector for a state."
2019.19-465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2974.32,2976.28,But there is a difference between the two.
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,2986.24,2987.28,"Well, two points."
2019.19-465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2987.28,2994.52,And that is what I think the -- the other side says is the one thing the State cannot do.
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,2994.52,3001.32,"First of all, Justice Breyer, we -- Washington's revised law now removes the person before they can vote, just as Colorado's law does."
2019.19-465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3050.4,3055.44,Thank you very much.
2019.19-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3055.44,3055.84,Justice Alito?
2019.19-465,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3055.84,3071.24,"Thank you. Counsel, does the Constitution impose any limits on a state's power to attach conditions to the appointment of an elector?"
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,3071.24,3081.56,"Some, Justice Alito. The -- the ones I was referencing earlier. Obviously, the State cannot impose conditions that themselves would be unconstitutional, such as race-based conditions, for example."
2019.19-465,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3081.56,3081.64,Okay.
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,3081.64,3083.84,"But our big -- sorry, go ahead."
2019.19-465,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3083.84,3085.56,What else?
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,3085.56,3091.36,"Well, as -- as I said before, the State can't impose conditions that would violate the Presidential Qualifications Clause."
2019.19-465,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3109.8,3126.44,Could a state require electors to cast their votes for the candidate chosen in a resolution passed by the state legislature after the popular vote is cast?
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,3126.44,3126.92,"No, Your Honor."
2019.19-465,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3138.72,3142.52,"Well, I didn't quite understand that answer."
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,3147.48,3148.16,"No, Your Honor."
2019.19-465,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3177.56,3204.04,"Why -- why is that so? Could Washington say we're going to choose five wise people -- I -- I'm sorry, 12 wise people to be our electors and we are going to allow the -- the public to advise them through a -- a -- a popular vote, to give them the sense of what the people of Washington want? Would that be unconstitutional?"
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,3204.04,3220.12,"If the legislature made clear that the public vote was entirely advisory, then -- then -- then, you know, I think that presents a tough question, but I think they probably could do that. You know, the -- the key compromise of the Constitution as to electors was to leave it to states to decide exactly what authority they would have."
2019.19-465,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3231.96,3233.16,What -- what is the difference --
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,3233.16,3234.64,-- of states do now.
2019.19-465,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3234.64,3241.84,-- between -- what is the difference between that setup and the setup that Mr. Lessig says is required?
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,3241.84,3269.76,"Well, Your Honor, the -- the -- the crucial difference is that Lessig is saying there's nothing the states can do to remove or -- or sanction electors after appointment for any reason, and we are saying that we know from history and we know from Ray, and the other side even admits, that this condition of -- of pledging to support the candidate preferred by the State's voters is a conditional condition."
2019.19-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3318.0,3319.84,Justice Sotomayor?
2019.19-465,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3319.84,3327.6,"Counsel, I'm curious about your views on the Tenth Amendment. The other side points out that you never raised it."
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,3350.52,3368.76,"Well, Your Honor, we didn't explicitly argue the Tenth Amendment, but we don't -- we don't think we need to rely on it, and we -- we support our colleagues in Colorado in making that argument. We think that the -- the -- the fundamental premise of the Constitution is that, you know, states have -- the federal government is one of the enumerated powers; states have powers unless they're taken away."
2019.19-465,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3411.84,3461.56,"Now you rely on a default rule in your brief, which you haven't mentioned yet, which is the power to appoint includes the power to remove. But all of the examples that you rely on are vertical appointments, when an official within one branch of government appoints a subordinate in the same branch for an indefinite period, and the idea is, I -- if I appoint you, I should be able to get rid of you if, in your service to me, you are doing something wrong. But, here, the State is appointing a voter to do something that most people think of as requiring judgment and -- and -- judgment and some measure of freedom, which is the power to cast a ballot."
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,3500.68,3505.16,"Justice Sotomayor -- Sotomayor, there's really three fundamental problems with the electors' argument on that front."
2019.19-465,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3507.6,3509.36,"Well, I don't think it's their problem."
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,3511.16,3517.48,"Well, like I said, they -- none -- none of the cases say anything like what they're -- they have drawn this vertical appointment language."
2019.19-465,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3599.2,3599.88,But there is a --
2019.19-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3599.88,3601.28,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan?"
2019.19-465,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3601.28,3607.4,"General, what do you view as your best textual argument?"
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,3607.4,3624.64,"Well, Your Honor, we think the best textual argument is just that nothing in the Constitution limits state authority over how to appoint electors or what -- or whether states can impose conditions and enforce them. We think there's a direct grant of authority in the appointment power, as -- as this Court has repeatedly recognized."
2019.19-465,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3665.44,3683.04,"If I -- if I understand you correctly, you're really saying you don't have an affirmative textual argument. What your -- what your argument is, is that the Constitution doesn't say and in -- in -- in that -- if the Constitution doesn't say, we should presume that states were meant to decide?"
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,3683.04,3685.36,"Well, let me be more precise, Justice Kagan."
2019.19-465,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3728.64,3743.4,"Isn't the idea that the power to appoint includes the power to remove highly contextual, that it depends on a certain understanding of control, which is exactly the question here? It does -- you're sort of assuming the conclusion by saying that."
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,3743.4,3750.68,"I disagree, Your Honor. The Court has said repeatedly that the power to appoint includes the power to remove, unless there is text limiting that power."
2019.19-465,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3839.04,3842.68,"Thank you, General."
2019.19-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3842.68,3844.24,Justice -- Justice Gorsuch?
2019.19-465,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3844.24,3923.52,"Counsel, I understand your argument is that a thousand dollar fine doesn't diminish or negate the fact that the elector here is voting and has in some real sense a right to vote and it -- it's being honored. But what about the new law that both Washington's adopted and I know Colorado has too, the Uniform Faithful Presidential Electors Act, and I know you're going to tell me it's not before us, but put that aside for the moment if you will for purposes of this question, that as I understand it, and you can correct me, that if a -- a -- an elector renders a faithless vote, that automatically removes him from office as a matter of law, and, in fact, votes aren't even counted until the Secretary of State has collected the requisite number of ballots, marked for the right people, based on preexisting pledges. Is that consistent with the Constitution's prescribed order of appointment, meaning in voting, it seems like the voting comes first and then the appointment under the uniform law, and is it also consistent with the federal Electoral Count Act? If -- if -- if you could just speak to me about those questions, I'd be grateful."
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,3923.52,3923.84,"Certainly, Justice Gorsuch."
2019.19-465,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4002.52,4004.72,Thank you.
2019.19-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4004.72,4005.4,Justice Kavanaugh?
2019.19-465,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4005.4,4010.2,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, General Purcell."
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,4040.08,4096.76,"Yes, Justice Kavanaugh. Thank you for that question. So the framers did not spend a whole lot of time talking about the exact role of electors, and they certainly did not agree on exactly what role they would play, but one thing that they were clear on was they did not want Congress choosing the President. And so they specifically prohibited members of Congress from serving in that role. But other -- but they left it to states to decide whether electors would serve as kind of -- you know, as Hamilton envisioned them, as the kind of sage chooser on behalf of the states or, as many other framers wanted, the electors to be agents of the people, to -- to -- to act on the people's behalf and for the people to choose them and for them to be bound to that outcome, to be bound to the people's preference. So -- so, yes, they imposed that limited limitation on who could serve, and -- and that is, you know, another example of a constitutional condition limiting states' authority."
2019.19-465,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4104.84,4118.48,"Mr. Lessig says that the framers considered various modes, obviously, and you agree and history shows they considered the states doing it directly, or at least that was an idea out there through the legislatures or governors."
2019.19-465,1,62975,noah_purcell,,4174.28,4206.64,"Your Honor, the number -- the framers had a number of concerns about direct elections that included logistical concerns and concerns about the impact on the influence of southern states, but, ultimately, they settled on an approach that left it to the states to decide, as this Court said in McPherson, the broadest possible power of determination as to how to appoint electors and what role they would play. And -- and the -- the options open to states certainly included both leaving electors with discretion, as some states still do today, and states choosing electors specifically because they have pledged to support a particular candidate."
2019.19-465,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4260.4,4262.56,Thank you.
