1984.83-2143,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.896,We will hear arguments first this morning in the State of Tennessee v. Harvey Street.
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,14.402,22.165,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-2143,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,339.273,341.946,"This was not a joint trial, was it?"
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,341.946,343.765,"--It was not, Your Honor."
1984.83-2143,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,352.882,361.317,"And after it had been denied by state officials, categorically denied."
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,361.317,363.908,Your Honor is speaking of the introduction?
1984.83-2143,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,363.908,366.299,Before it was introduced.
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,369.411,370.703,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2143,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,370.703,373.365,"So it had been adequately denied, hadn't it?"
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,373.365,376.647,"Your Honor, our position is that that did not make it adequately denied."
1984.83-2143,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,376.647,378.007,"But it had... well, it had been."
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,378.007,383.252,"It had been denied, but it became a swearing contest at that point between the defendant and the sheriff."
1984.83-2143,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,383.252,385.854,"Well, the Court of Appeals doesn't agree with you on that."
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,385.854,387.006,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-2143,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,387.006,390.959,"Specifically, specifically, the Court said no."
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,405.69,419.306,"We believe, Your Honor, that the conclusion of the Court of Criminal Appeals below rested on a faulty assumption that because of its appraisal of Bruton and Douglas, they felt that it always had to be--"
1984.83-2143,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,419.306,422.088,"Well, let me read you one sentence."
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,442.321,443.573,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-2143,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,443.573,444.935,Then the Court was wrong.
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,444.935,445.795,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-2143,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,445.795,447.156,Factually.
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,447.156,454.399,It was wrong assuming those facts and interpreting them the way they did as a matter of federal constitutional law.
1984.83-2143,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,454.399,474.663,"Do you agree with this statement, that in this case, while admission of the confession was not technically used to prove its truth, the state actually placed before the jury testimony incriminating the defendant made by one not available for cross examination."
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,476.295,478.085,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-2143,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,516.7,522.654,How did the subject of a confession first come into the record of the case?
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,522.654,524.735,As to Peele's confession?
1984.83-2143,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,524.735,533.81,How did the subject of a confession first get into the record and called to the attention of the jury?
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,533.81,546.88,"Your Honor, the subject first came in in the defense attorney's opening remarks to the jury in which he pointed out that a co-defendant, Peele, had confessed and had implicated Street in the murder."
1984.83-2143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,625.971,629.164,May I ask a factual question to be sure I have this right?
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,642.584,643.624,That is correct.
1984.83-2143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,643.624,646.726,But the actual text was not... there is no real dispute about that.
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,646.726,647.417,That is correct.
1984.83-2143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,647.417,647.747,Okay.
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,648.846,656.833,"As to the first factor, there were legitimate and compelling reasons justifying the state's use of such evidence in this case."
1984.83-2143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,779.081,785.526,"Mr. Grunow, are there any limits in your view on the use of such evidence by the state?"
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,798.045,804.339,"I will address both the limitations as well as the possibility of redaction, Your Honor."
1984.83-2143,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,829.334,836.3,"Oh, yes, assuming it is relevant, are there any limitations by virtue of the prejudicial nature of the evidence?"
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,836.3,853.289,"It is quite possible that the prejudicial impact in certain occasions may outweigh its probative value, and we simply say that this is not that type of case, and we do not want this Court to give a broad ruling to that effect."
1984.83-2143,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,879.978,883.481,But didn't the Court of Criminal Appeals say to the contrary?
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,883.481,888.256,"--They did, Your Honor, but they did not offer any suggestion as to how it might be--"
1984.83-2143,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,888.256,896.641,"But they did hold, did they not, that there might have been redaction without destroying the state's impeachment use, didn't they?"
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,896.641,898.071,--They did hold that.
1984.83-2143,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,898.071,900.685,And you disagree with that.
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,900.685,901.917,"I disagree with that, Your Honor."
1984.83-2143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.049,948.529,--Would it have impressed the Court of Appeals or your court below if you had called the person who had already been convicted and was close by in jail?
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,952.723,954.813,"No, we did not, Your Honor."
1984.83-2143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,954.813,956.566,Yes.
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,959.238,969.963,"The reason for that, Your Honor, is that his testimony would have only gone to the veracity of his confession, and that was wholly immaterial to the use for which the state was introducing the evidence."
1984.83-2143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,980.301,983.223,"Well, what if you had called him and he had been in the courtroom?"
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,987.357,990.128,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1984.83-2143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,994.062,998.914,"--That's what the court, that's what your Court of Appeals said."
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,998.914,1004.888,"--Yes, Your Honor, but on issues totally immaterial to the limited purpose for which the state was introducing this evidence."
1984.83-2143,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1004.888,1006.16,And that's not what your Court of Appeals said--
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,1006.16,1008.281,"--Your Honor, that is not what they said--"
1984.83-2143,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1008.281,1009.813,--He could have been cross examined.
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,1009.813,1011.163,That is correct.
1984.83-2143,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1011.163,1014.646,Could the defendant have called him as a hostile witness and cross examined him?
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,1014.646,1016.558,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1984.83-2143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1016.558,1024.994,--Is it your position that the Court--
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,1024.994,1026.664,The Court of Criminal Appeals.
1984.83-2143,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.664,1036.481,--The Court of Criminal Appeals... that the Court of Criminal Appeals would have come out the same even if the confessor had been in the courtroom?
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,1036.481,1043.937,"I believe they would in the sense, Your Honor, that the question was whether the defendant was in fact subject to cross examination on the stand."
1984.83-2143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1059.067,1062.77,May I ask a question about an alternative way of handling the problem?
1984.83-2143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1072.107,1081.704,"After reading the confession, as I understand the record, the officer was asked were these facts as in the confession you just read, and he denied as to each of those facts."
1984.83-2143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1081.704,1090.721,"Why couldn't he have been asked those questions without reading the confession, and then had the confession in the courtroom in order to verify whether or not the testimony was true?"
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,1095.105,1118.119,"Your Honor, the reason why the state found it important to do more was that it was not only the omissions in Peele's statement that made the parroting claim incredible; there were numerous differences, only slight differences between similar events that both narrated that would show that it was impossible for them to have merely been the result of a parroting claim."
1984.83-2143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1118.119,1123.472,"So you would agree that if you were focusing on the omissions, and that were the whole point, it would not have been necessary to read the confession."
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,1123.472,1124.694,That's correct.
1984.83-2143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.694,1128.327,So your point is there is a little difference in the style and the language and so forth?
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,1128.327,1132.649,"Yes, Your Honor, that it was for the jury's benefit to see both--"
1984.83-2143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.649,1136.141,"Well, but why wouldn't the impeachment have been adequate just with the omission point?"
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,1151.301,1167.162,"--It may be the more persuasive, Your Honor, but we are here arguing whether the defendant's confrontation rights were violated, and we believe that because of weighing the factors that I mentioned initially, those factors tipped the scale in favor of the state's introduction of the complete statement in this case."
1984.83-2143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.162,1170.855,In the closing argument did the prosecutor make much of the difference in style?
1984.83-2143,0,39403,robert_a_grunow,,1173.399,1174.01,"He did, Your Honor."
1984.83-2143,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.01,1174.307,He did.
1984.83-2143,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1174.307,1184.616,Mr. Schwartz?
1984.83-2143,1,32896,joshua_ira_schwartz,,1184.616,1188.887,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-2143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1334.884,1341.747,But isn't the argument also available that the burden really was on the defendant to prove his parroting claim?
1984.83-2143,1,32896,joshua_ira_schwartz,,1348.192,1351.415,"Well, this case has a peculiar fact in that regard."
1984.83-2143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1404.54,1410.755,"Well, I am suggesting have the confession in the courtroom so that the defendant then would have had the opportunity to show he was lying."
1984.83-2143,1,32896,joshua_ira_schwartz,,1410.755,1417.258,"--But if that statement went to the jury, I am not sure, which would ultimately have to assess whether he was telling the truth."
1984.83-2143,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1417.258,1419.32,I'm not suggesting it would have to go to the jury.
1984.83-2143,1,32896,joshua_ira_schwartz,,1429.594,1442.534,"Well, that may be, but we suggest that if there was a controversy, the jury would be the judge of that, and that to one side, there were significant additional factors in terms of assessing the document as a whole."
1984.83-2143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1450.749,1452.372,Did they see the documents?
1984.83-2143,1,32896,joshua_ira_schwartz,,1452.372,1455.233,--It was introduced as an exhibit.
1984.83-2143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1457.464,1461.658,Do they take exhibits to the jury room in Tennessee?
1984.83-2143,1,32896,joshua_ira_schwartz,,1461.658,1463.528,--I'm probably the wrong person to ask that.
1984.83-2143,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1467.419,1468.39,All right.
1984.83-2143,1,32896,joshua_ira_schwartz,,1468.39,1489.415,"On the question which was the only question material to the state's purpose in putting the statement before the jury on rebuttal, whether the declarant had actually made the statement, the purpose and requirements of the confrontation clause were satisfied, Sheriff Papantoniou, through whose testimony the statement was put before the jury initially, was available for cross examination."
1984.83-2143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1562.001,1567.815,Do you mean that in Kentucky when you put a witness on the stand you can ask him anything?
1984.83-2143,1,32896,joshua_ira_schwartz,,1571.328,1573.361,--I don't believe I said that.
1984.83-2143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1573.361,1577.442,"Well, you said you couldn't limit the examination."
1984.83-2143,1,32896,joshua_ira_schwartz,,1577.442,1581.887,"Oh, I do not speak as the expert on Tennessee."
1984.83-2143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1581.887,1587.71,"If he put a witness on the stand in Tennessee, couldn't the defendant ask him anything?"
1984.83-2143,1,32896,joshua_ira_schwartz,,1587.71,1595.724,"Well, there may be procedural rules about scope of cross examination, but we would suppose that if the scope had limited its examination, that may--"
1984.83-2143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1595.724,1604.459,"Well, isn't that the normal way to produce evidence, if you have got a witness and a written statement, isn't it normal that you put your witness on?"
1984.83-2143,1,32896,joshua_ira_schwartz,,1604.459,1606.18,--But if the purpose of--
1984.83-2143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1606.18,1609.362,Isn't the normal way to do it that way?
1984.83-2143,1,32896,joshua_ira_schwartz,,1609.362,1613.586,--Not if one's purpose is to prove that the statement was made rather than--
1984.83-2143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1613.586,1615.727,"You mean, not if you don't want cross examination."
1984.83-2143,1,32896,joshua_ira_schwartz,,1615.727,1622.813,"--If the purpose... if the defendant's purpose was to be able to examine Mr. Peele, that purpose could have been fully satisfied."
1984.83-2143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1663.91,1666.6,I thought the respondent didn't want this in there at all.
1984.83-2143,1,32896,joshua_ira_schwartz,,1666.6,1670.213,But it is the respondent's complaint that--
1984.83-2143,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1670.213,1672.404,Don't... please don't tell me you are doing him a favor.
1984.83-2143,1,32896,joshua_ira_schwartz,,1674.104,1690.907,"--No doubt the respondent would have preferred not to have that statement in, but we do not believe the law affords him the choice of saying that his... of testifying that his was a coerced imitation of Peele's confession and still not having the jury have a look at that statement."
1984.83-2143,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1798.586,1803.621,Mr. Rogers?
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,1803.621,1807.292,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-2143,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1863.528,1866.561,"Mr. Rogers, could I interrupt you for a minute and get it out on the table the thing that troubles me?"
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,1885.904,1889.197,"--No, we didn't want the parts that accused him of taking an active part--"
1984.83-2143,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1889.197,1895.942,"But you brought it out on direct examination that the confession implicated him, and that's why, according to your theory, there was this parroting."
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,1895.942,1904.787,"--Well, we think an inference is a little bit less prejudicial than the words from a virtual eye witness to the crime as far as jury--"
1984.83-2143,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1904.787,1911.482,Was it not your theory at trial that the reason your client confessed was that this other man had said he was guilty of the crime?
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,1911.482,1914.234,--And because the sheriff forced him to.
1984.83-2143,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1914.234,1921.788,"Right, but wasn't it part of the whole theory that you were trying to develop was that there was another confession that implicated your client?"
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,1924.88,1929.445,"No... well, it was our point, but we thought at the time that the--"
1984.83-2143,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1929.445,1932.997,Then how can you redact the heart of your point?
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,1932.997,1938.1,--We can redact the part that accuses Joe Street of actually participating in the crime.
1984.83-2143,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2039.255,2062.341,"Counsel, I am really a little puzzled by how the confrontation clause should require the state to call the declarant when the statement of the declarant is not introduced for purposes of proving the truth of the contents of the statement."
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2062.341,2063.66,"Well, it is our position--"
1984.83-2143,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2063.66,2069.534,"That's such a basic rule of evidence, it is hard for me to understand how the confrontation clause comes in at all."
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2069.534,2082.504,"--Well, we think that the heart of the Bruton decision is that a jury is simply unable to disregard the dramatic impact of an accomplice's confession, particularly--"
1984.83-2143,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2082.504,2090.669,"Well, that might invoke a due process concern, but it is very hard for me to see how it raises a confrontation issue."
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2090.669,2104.457,"--Well, I think it was labeled a confrontation issue in Bruton because Evans was not available for cross examination regarding that statement, and I think we can say the same thing about Clifford Peele."
1984.83-2143,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2104.457,2111.462,"But he was available certainly to the defense if they had chosen to call him, wasn't it?"
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2111.462,2128.974,"If we could have called him and gotten him... and labeled him a hostile witness, we still would have been faced with the situation where the state had already accomplished what they had wanted to accomplish and gotten the confession before the jury because as I see it, the confrontation clause has two prongs."
1984.83-2143,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2144.044,2161.405,"Yes, but as I understand it, the trial judge's theory of admitting that was that it was independently admissible of the truth to rebut your client's contention that his confession was just kind of a parrot job on Peele's confession."
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2161.405,2166.097,"Right, because it was not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, a hearsay--"
1984.83-2143,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2166.097,2174.705,"And there you don't have... if it's a legitimate hearsay exception to the confrontation clause, you don't have those two requirements, I don't think."
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2174.705,2197.208,"--I still think that under Bruton, labeling it hearsay... I don't think there's any distinction between telling the jury don't use this confession against this defendant, use it against that defendant, and don't use this confession for the truth of the matter asserted, but do use it against the defendant."
1984.83-2143,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2205.023,2210.567,"Well, was there any independent grounds for admissibility in Bruton such as there was here?"
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2210.567,2218.754,"Not against Bruton himself, no, there wasn't, but I don't believe that that's the critical... I don't think that's critical to the decision in Bruton."
1984.83-2143,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2218.754,2240.836,"Well, isn't this much like or analogous to the situation in the Harris case where it was held that you could properly admit for impeachment purposes statements that were inadmissible under Miranda, not for the truth of those statements but for impeachment, and isn't this the same thing?"
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2240.836,2243.578,"No, I don't believe it is, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-2143,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2300.246,2313.045,"Is it the fact that your client today sought to introduce the same statement himself earlier in the trial, Mr. Peele's statement?"
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2313.045,2314.213,"Yes, that's a fact."
1984.83-2143,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2314.213,2317.195,"So the argument rings just a little bit hollow, doesn't it?"
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2317.195,2343.415,"Well, at that point in the trial the state had given every indication that they were going to call Clifford Peele on direct examination, and so as a tactical matter, there was an interest in trying to diffuse what we thought would be his potentially incriminating, indeed, devastating testimony against Joe Street, and also to introduce it for whatever relevance it would have on the parroting point."
1984.83-2143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2478.693,2505.879,"What if... what if Peele had been there and the state had put him on the stand and they had... they asked about his confession and he confirmed that he made those statements and he says they are still correct, what... could the state use that confession then against... to prove your client's guilt?"
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2505.879,2511.135,"If they called Clifford Peele on direct, yes, they could."
1984.83-2143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2511.135,2519.619,"And if they had called him and he had been in the courtroom, could they have used it for impeachment?"
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2519.619,2526.323,I think it would also be relevant on the impeachment.
1984.83-2143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2526.323,2529.194,"And it would have been admissible, his confession would have been admissible."
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2529.194,2529.805,Yes.
1984.83-2143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2529.805,2531.057,For impeachment purposes.
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2531.057,2531.648,Yes.
1984.83-2143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.648,2535.138,And to prove the guilt of the defendant.
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2535.138,2538.951,"Yes, if he had been there in the courtroom personally."
1984.83-2143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.951,2540.774,Are you sure they could have impeached their own witness?
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2543.766,2545.446,"I'm sorry, I have misinterpreted Tennessee law."
1984.83-2143,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2545.957,2546.896,"--I have tried a lot of cases where I couldn't do it, I know."
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2546.896,2548.048,"--Yes, I'm sorry."
1984.83-2143,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2617.506,2631.855,"Well, Mr. Rogers, are you suggesting that any time you have the sort of competing interests that you say could have been balanced here, the question of how they are balanced is a question that a state court has to look to the federal constitution on?"
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2631.855,2659.354,"I think that there they could look to either the federal or state constitution on the issue, but when there is a confrontation problem involved, I think it is important to look at the balancing and competing interests precisely because of the reasons, when I responded to Justice O'Connor's question regarding the sword/shield cases."
1984.83-2143,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2719.412,2721.753,Is that entirely correct?
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2731.41,2743.648,Only to the extent that Clifford Peele's confession corroborated certain things found at the scene.
1984.83-2143,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.648,2754.785,"But there was... even without Peele's confession, you say there was nothing in the Defendant's confession that was corroborated by physical evidence like, for example, the rope and things like that?"
1984.83-2143,2,35027,lance_j_rogers,,2754.785,2764.342,"Well, yes, I think items like that, but I meant there weren't... there were extensive tests, hair, fingerprints, things like that, and none of these were found in this case."
1984.83-2143,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2775.118,2778.33,"Do you have anything further, Counsel?"
1984.83-2143,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2780.503,2782.734,"Mr. Attorney General, could I ask one?"
1984.83-2143,3,39403,robert_a_grunow,,2807.351,2811.202,"By a side bar conference, there could be, but there's no formalized procedure that way."
1984.83-2143,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2811.202,2813.263,But it could be done that way.
1984.83-2143,3,39403,robert_a_grunow,,2813.263,2814.164,"I suppose it could, yes."
1984.83-2143,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2814.164,2816.224,"I'm looking to the future, that's all."
1984.83-2143,3,39403,robert_a_grunow,,2816.224,2822.639,"In response to the question about taking the confession into the jury room, there is no indication in this record that that was done."
1984.83-2143,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2838.661,2839.973,"Thank you, gentlemen."
