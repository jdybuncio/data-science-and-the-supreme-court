2007.06-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.605,"We'll hear argument next in Case 06-43, Stoneridge Investment Partners v. Scientific-Atlanta, et al.."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,9.009,33.611,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text of section 10(b) as well as the rule 10b-5 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission prohibit the use of any deceptive device by any person, indirectly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of a security."
2007.06-43,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,88.715,94.478,The transaction was not wholly without benefit to Scientific-Atlanta.
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,107.957,112.878,"Well, I would agree, Your Honor, that they received free advertising."
2007.06-43,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,121.61,126.998,And was the price four to five times higher than the normal rates for advertising?
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,126.998,128.779,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.715,189.754,"Mr. Grossman, is there any reason why, in principle, the elements for a cause of action under 10b-5 have to be the same as the elements for a cause of action by the agency under 10(b)?"
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,235.282,237.734,"Well, I think there are two reasons, Your Honor."
2007.06-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,269.018,277.156,"But it's not like under the Sherman Act, where we have reason to think Congress intended the Court to go about the business of construing and developing antitrust law."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,303.925,318.749,"Well, this Court, Your Honor, as recently as 2002 in Wharf (Holdings) said there is a private right of action for violation of any of the subdivisions of rule 10b-5: a, b, or c."
2007.06-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,334.554,335.757,"Well, that's kind of my point."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,340.567,352.844,"--But when Congress enacted the Private Security Law Reform Act, everything it did in connection with that statute was directed to the private right of action that this Court had previously implied under 10(b)."
2007.06-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,358.701,362.685,I'm not... my suggestion is not that we should go back and say that there is no private right of action.
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,373.976,376.928,"--Well, I would agree, Congress has taken it over."
2007.06-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,411.634,423.41,"Is it... is it a necessary part of your theory that the deceptive practice that Scientific-Atlanta went in, that they knew that that was also... that Charter would carry that forward?"
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,442.123,442.623,No.
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,486.574,489.995,Intended or known?
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,502.083,510.783,"Oh, it would be enough if they committed a deceptive act and they knew it was in furtherance of a scheme."
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,510.783,516.655,"Well, when you say ""in furtherance of"", you... you import intent."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,527.479,528.791,I think that would be reckless.
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.791,530.65,That's what I thought your position was.
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,530.65,531.806,"Yes, but my position is also--"
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.806,533.946,So it's not an intent necessarily.
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,535.43,536.96,--It certainly needs scienter.
2007.06-43,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,539.364,540.974,"I mean, it's more than knowledge."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,550.267,551.859,"Exactly right, Justice Souter."
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.102,573.43,Sure.
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,590.328,590.828,No.
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,624.907,646.696,What facts... what has to be alleged short of... on information and belief the defendant knew that... that this information would appear on the balance sheets and be used to improve the status of the stock?
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,646.696,650.773,"--Well, of course if you just... if you just allege it on information and belief, you're out of court."
2007.06-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,677.356,678.372,Why shouldn't we be--
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,699.785,716.733,"--Well, I think if Congress intended under 20(e)... certainly the private actions similar to this... it would have said that only the SEC has the authority to bring a claim for substantial assistance whether or not it involves deceptive conduct."
2007.06-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,722.823,726.977,"But they were... they were addressing a very specific decision from this Court, the Central Bank decision."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,744.018,745.126,Secondary actors.
2007.06-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,745.126,746.048,--who put the--
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,755.014,757.122,We are not asking any extension.
2007.06-43,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,770.289,779.722,Is your theory dependent on the proposition that Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola deceived Arthur Andersen?
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,779.722,782.439,That certainly is a large part of it.
2007.06-43,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,782.861,787.672,But didn't you allege exactly the opposite in your complaint?
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,787.672,788.374,No.
2007.06-43,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,808.976,817.27,"Well, I'm looking at paragraph 218 of your amended complaint, 109a of the joint appendix, subsection 4."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,843.102,851.817,"No... no, Your Honor, they knew that they were paying the vendors higher prices, but they didn't know why."
2007.06-43,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,867.484,887.116,Who told... who told Charter that it was necessary for them to have a time spread between the contract... the $20 above the contract price and the advertising payment?
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,887.116,888.069,--Arthur Andersen.
2007.06-43,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,888.069,909.513,"Well, if it told them that, didn't it have... it sounds to me from that that the accountant says, look, if you want to make this appear on the balance sheet as though the advertising revenues were just ordinary advertising revenues, you better separate these two."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,913.652,914.058,No.
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,941.126,943.797,But that's exactly the thing they told them to separate.
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,943.797,945.686,"Well, not for that reason, Your Honor."
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.686,947.186,What other reason?
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,947.186,948.919,The reason is as follows.
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,998.277,999.871,I understand what you're saying.
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1015.363,1015.801,No.
2007.06-43,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1035.247,1051.177,"All right, just... just to be clear on this... if Charter and Arthur Andersen and Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola all sat down and cooked up this scheme together and they all knew exactly what was going on, would you have a claim against the Respondents here?"
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1051.177,1051.786,--Yes.
2007.06-43,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1063.47,1068.967,Then I see absolutely no difference between your test and the elements of aiding and abetting.
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1068.967,1072.825,The difference is here we would have conceptual--
2007.06-43,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1072.825,1078.229,Because you just said that it's not necessary for there to be an actual deceptive act on the part of the Respondents.
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1078.229,1079.729,--There has to be a deception... there is deception.
2007.06-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1088.445,1093.022,But that's... but that's not the fraud that was imposed upon the market.
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1112.123,1114.357,There was no way... no way--
2007.06-43,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1120.98,1121.963,But you're saying--
2007.06-43,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1121.963,1141.845,"But there are... there are any number of kickbacks and mismanagement and petty frauds that go on in the business, and business people know that any publicly held company's shares are going to be affected by its profits, so I see no limitation to your... to your proposal for liability."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1141.845,1144.61,"--Well, I think the limitations are as follows, Your Honor."
2007.06-43,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1156.496,1167.399,"Well, I agree with Justice Scalia's earlier comment, I don't think that Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola really cared anything of... one way or the other about the investors."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1167.399,1171.896,"--Well, that may be that they didn't care about the investors--"
2007.06-43,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1171.896,1173.755,"For them the scheme made a certain amount of sense, they didn't really care."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1173.755,1177.16,"--Well, they may not have cared, but that would be reckless because they certainly--"
2007.06-43,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1177.644,1180.753,But that's far different from having a purpose.
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1182.706,1183.267,--That's correct.
2007.06-43,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1200.245,1209.24,"Which goes back to my earlier question, that most people that engage in frauds on business know that if it's a publicly held corporation, it's going to hurt the price of the shares or affect the price of the shares."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1209.24,1213.411,"--Well, they shouldn't engage in schemes to defraud, that's what Congress intended by section 10."
2007.06-43,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1213.411,1236.135,"--But as I understand your argument, it is the difference between aiding and abetting liability on the part of the Respondents and liability as, in effect, as first line principles, is their intent, or at the very least in knowledge that they were committing a deceptive act as part of this--"
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1237.87,1239.729,That they have to commit the deceptive act--
2007.06-43,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1239.729,1240.088,Yes.
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1240.088,1241.307,--with the requisite intent.
2007.06-43,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1241.588,1255.676,"Now, how many times are parties of the position of Respondents ever going to engage in those acts except with exactly the state of mind that on your judgment makes them principals, rather than aiders and abettors."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1255.676,1257.237,It is not on my judgment.
2007.06-43,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1261.267,1261.595,No.
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1280.26,1290.318,"No, there are cases, I think, Your Honor, where they can engage in deceptive conduct, and there would not be the purpose to defraud shareholders."
2007.06-43,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1317.994,1326.539,"In other words, it's deceptive but not deceptive in relation to, or for the purpose of, deceiving the... someone like the Petitioner."
2007.06-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1326.539,1326.851,"Well, wouldn't it--"
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1326.851,1330.787,But don't aiders and abettors have to have that purpose as well?
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1338.659,1341.703,--You have to engage in a deceptive act under 10(b).
2007.06-43,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1343.937,1351.058,I thought you were telling me that in each case there may be a deceptive act but not a deceptive act in relation to somebody like the Petitioner here.
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1351.058,1351.605,Exactly.
2007.06-43,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1351.605,1354.855,"But that's a different answer, I think, from the one you were just giving Justice Scalia."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1354.855,1355.355,No.
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.116,1372.989,So any aiding-and-abetting through a deceptive act makes you a principal?
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1385.686,1386.232,--No.
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1387.154,1387.748,You cannot?
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1387.748,1391.73,"You, yourself... you, yourself, have to engage in the deceptive act."
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1391.73,1392.37,Yes.
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1392.37,1393.214,Your own deceptive act.
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1393.214,1399.743,"Yes, but... but if you do, or if you should have known, you are not an aider and abettor."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1400.789,1408.193,"You may be a principal if you satisfy the other elements of our test, which are serious elements that you have to plead with--"
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1414.597,1423.265,Is it fair to say that all aiders and abettors who commit deceptive acts are principals?
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1423.265,1423.765,--No.
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.765,1424.528,What's the difference?
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1425.903,1426.278,There are tests.
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1435.65,1436.916,Don't you need that to be an aider or abettor?
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1436.916,1440.226,An aider or abettor?
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.147,1445.007,"If I'm entirely innocent, and I don't--"
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1445.007,1455.769,"--An aider... certainly... certainly, the primary violator in the situation that we are discussing where there are deceptive acts is aiding and abetting."
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1472.746,1480.54,"--You see, I really thought the difference was that the principal is the one who makes the deceptive representation and obtains money from it."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1488.428,1489.037,--No.
2007.06-43,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.037,1497.767,"And you say if you facilitate knowingly and intentionally or even grossly negligently, you are not an aider and abettor, but you're a principal."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1500.907,1505.452,"If you facilitate with a deceptive act, then you're a primary violator."
2007.06-43,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1512.589,1529.349,"Mr. Grossman, before you finish, there is one statement made by the other side that you are trying to use this... small in comparison to all the fraud that was involved here in order to collect on the entire loss."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1538.891,1539.156,Yes.
2007.06-43,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1546.028,1547.2,So what are you seeking?
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1549.168,1553.417,"--We would measure the damages, number one, that flow from this particular scheme."
2007.06-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1573.175,1579.187,"--Mr. Grossman, I'm conscious of eating into your time but a question... how many chains of this connection can you have?"
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1598.32,1605.068,"Well, I... I think you can go so long as the person's deceptive conduct has the purpose of furthering a scheme to defraud."
2007.06-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1613.58,1614.94,"Thank you, Mr. Grossman."
2007.06-43,0,41422,stanley_m_grossman,,1614.94,1615.642,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2007.06-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1615.642,1620.358,Mr. Shapiro.
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1620.358,1634.884,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: My friend has just asked the Court to expand an implied cause of action by diluting traditional requirements such as the reliance requirement and by eroding this Court's precedent in the Central Bank case."
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1659.765,1675.351,"That's if you equate this with aiding-and-abetting, and I think the question is is there a middle category between Charter, who is clearly primarily liable, and Central Bank, that didn't do anything deceptive?"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1675.351,1688.284,"The Central Bank case, I believe, answers that by saying to be a primary violator you have to satisfy all the prerequisites of 10(b) liability, including reliance, loss causation, the ""in-connection-with"" standard."
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1693.782,1701.06,"But you are saying... I thought your argument, unlike the government's argument, is that there was no deceptive device."
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1705.401,1706.839,--Yes.
2007.06-43,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1731.562,1734.156,"Well, I thought... I agree with Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1752.758,1756.584,--We don't make these arguments without reference to each other.
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1766.44,1768.361,You don't defend the position--
2007.06-43,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1768.361,1769.767,"Would you say that there was deception, standing alone?"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1769.767,1778.279,"--Well, we have... we have suggested that that is not true when you're speaking with somebody that knows the facts such as Charter."
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1794.805,1799.178,"But Charter said... vendors, I need you to consummate this fraud on the public."
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1810.313,1817.124,"Well, we believe even placing that most pejorative characterization on these facts, which we don't agree are the true facts, that still--"
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1817.124,1818.513,But you must assume that they are now.
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1818.513,1828.681,"--Assuming that they are, that this is a 20(e) situation where it is alleged that the vendors gave substantial, knowing assistance to somebody who was committing a fraud."
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1838.053,1840.677,That's if they are... that's if they are aiders and if there are only two--
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1862.168,1867.822,"Well, you know that's an exact description of Central Bank because there it was alleged that the trustee entered--"
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1867.822,1868.307,No--
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1868.307,1869.368,--into a secret agreement.
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1869.368,1873.21,"--In Central Bank, it was conceded that the bank engaged in no deceptive act."
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1873.21,1873.647,"Well, the--"
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1873.647,1877.553,Here there is the charge that it did engage in deceptive acts.
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1877.553,1897.028,"--What was conceded was that the bank made no statement to investors, but what was alleged in the complaint and argued in the briefs was that the bank entered into a secret side agreement that enabled the use of a fraudulent prospectus that unleashed securities that were worthless on investors, and investors said, we were depending on our trustee to prevent that from happening."
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1897.028,1898.356,"--Now, I take it, though, you--"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1905.885,1910.726,"Well, we... we think that for reliance purposes, there--"
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1910.726,1912.132,"Well, do you--"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1912.132,1913.71,--the defendant has to communicate with investors.
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1913.71,1914.49,--Would you answer my question first?
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1919.802,1925.393,It has to be communicated to the investors and it has to be attributed under the case law to the speaker.
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1925.393,1932.795,You mean the statement as such or a statement which could not have been made but for the statements of the Respondents must be communicated to the investors?
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1933.248,1935.388,That... that kind of but-for causation is not sufficient.
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1937.965,1944.119,"So are you... so you are saying that there can be no causation and hence, you know... and I think you're going further."
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1952.43,1958.815,"--That is one of our submissions, but we also say that the substance of these statements was never communicated to investors."
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1959.768,1961.799,Because the whole purpose of it--
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1961.799,1962.705,--spoke to the investors and never summarized these.
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1962.705,1964.143,"--Mr. Shapiro, if--"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1964.143,1964.533,Yes?
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1964.533,1979.51,"--If it was communicated to investors that there had been $20 per set box over the regular price, if there had been advertising that was paid for by the very money that Charter gave, then the whole thing would have failed."
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1996.036,2000.332,"But the... the communication, Your Honor, has to be to the market and to investors."
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2012.89,2013.733,Was there any--
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2013.733,2013.92,"--1st> [""]."
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2013.92,2017.435,--Was there any economic substance to this?
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2017.435,2017.81,"Oh, of course."
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2030.743,2037.411,"Is it true that the price that they were charging, they did not charge to other customers... the $20 hike?"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2037.411,2042.332,"Well, it's true because they weren't concerned with that because they weren't paying for it."
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2046.596,2047.799,But it was--
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2047.799,2048.346,--that Charter had a big interest.
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2048.346,2055.656,"--a sham then, because they said the reason they upped the price $20 a box was--"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2065.074,2072.648,"Well, Your Honor, from the vendors' perspective, this was a transaction that appeared to be a way to increase cooperative advertising."
2007.06-43,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2094.453,2095.342,"Well, but that's--"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2095.342,2096.108,--if that's what the rules required.
2007.06-43,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2096.108,2097.717,--that's not the allegation of the complaint.
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2103.606,2105.088,"Yes, they... they do allege."
2007.06-43,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2107.494,2110.868,But I mean that... so that your answer doesn't seem to be... get us very far on a legal point.
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2110.868,2128.408,"--Well, we say that if you take the complaint at face value and you don't even consider the Barford indictment that they cite, that it still is a classic example of knowingly giving substantial assistance to someone else that is making misstatements to investors, because these vendors didn't make any misstatement to investors."
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2136.825,2138.278,That's the essence of the scheme.
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2154.272,2164.018,"But Congress's policy judgment here is that the SEC, an expert agency that is impartial, should evaluate a claim of that sort and decide whether to proceed."
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2164.018,2167.674,"That's if they are aiders and abettors, which is what Congress covered."
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2182.855,2183.074,Well--
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2183.074,2193.445,It's either the company whose stock is in question or you're an aider and abettor.
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2193.445,2206.954,"--You are only a primary violator under... under Central Bank if each and every element of 10b-5 liability is satisfied, including reliance on your statement, including the ""in-connection-with"" test, and including loss causation."
2007.06-43,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2220.497,2221.246,If we accept--
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2221.246,2222.636,--if Congress wanted the SEC to address--
2007.06-43,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2222.636,2235.257,--If we accept your theory of the case and we then get another case in which an accountant or an attorney who prepares the statement for publication to the investors and then gives it to--
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2245.72,2247.11,--It really depends on--
2007.06-43,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2247.11,2247.72,"And if so, what would--"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2247.72,2248.266,--on the circumstances.
2007.06-43,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2248.266,2249.422,"--And if so, what would be the rationale?"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2249.422,2261.558,"Some attorneys are control persons within corporations, and in-house counsel that drafts the disclosure statement which contains a falsehood may be liable as in the McConville case, which the Court recently considered."
2007.06-43,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2262.776,2272.866,How about outside accountants and attorneys who deliberately and directly participate in negotiating... or in drafting the false disclosure statements?
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2272.866,2273.366,--I--
2007.06-43,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2273.366,2278.801,"Could they be liable and under your theory of the case, but your client not liable?"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2278.801,2280.051,--It... it's possible.
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2280.879,2281.738,Well what about in this--
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2300.511,2300.979,--Absolutely--
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2300.979,2302.057,--whereas your client cannot?
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2302.057,2302.744,"--Yes, sir."
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2304.04,2304.978,And the difference is?
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2304.978,2319.941,"--The reason is they issued opinions that were circulated to investors, that were attributed to them and which were authorized by them, and if a lawyer does the same thing, if Steve Shapiro writes an opinion letter and circulates it to investors and it's full of falsehoods--"
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2319.941,2320.425,But--
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2320.425,2321.582,--I can be held liable for that--
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2321.582,2322.377,--What if Arthur Andersen--
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2322.377,2322.706,--as a speaker.
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2322.706,2328.952,"--What if Arthur Andersen has a footnote in there saying, this is okay because we have--"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2347.367,2349.992,Only people who speak to the market--

2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2351.193,2352.475,--and induce investor reliance.
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2352.475,2360.69,"--Yes, but doesn't... doesn't the Respondent in that case know that it is likely that the auditor is going to indicate the basis for its statement, that the transaction is okay--"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2360.69,2361.205,Well--
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2361.205,2366.655,"--and, therefore, isn't it reasonable to suppose that they anticipated that their statement would be communicated to the market?"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2366.655,2371.841,"--That is just aiding and abetting, and in fact Congress dealt with that squarely in section 303--"
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2371.841,2373.34,But there's a communication to the market there--
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2373.34,2373.981,"--Oh, yes--"
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2373.981,2376.043,--and there's a reason to expect that communication.
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2376.043,2376.48,--Yes.
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2376.48,2377.277,Doesn't that make any difference?
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2377.277,2378.057,That is not sufficient.
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2394.411,2395.628,"Is the word ""only"" in there?"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2395.628,2396.16,Pardon me?
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2396.16,2397.613,"Is the word ""only"" in there?"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2397.613,2398.799,"The word ""exclusively"" is in there--"
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2398.799,2399.221,In the statute?
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2399.221,2399.596,--and my--
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2399.596,2404.438,So you have an independent defense quite apart from... from the construction of 10b-5?
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2404.438,2407.827,--We rely on 20(e) and 303 of--
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2410.234,2412.889,Which I thought speak about aiders and abettors.
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2412.889,2416.558,--It's talking about an aider and abettor that misleads an auditor and then--
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2416.558,2417.214,But is usually--
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2417.214,2418.558,--the auditor issues a false certification.
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2418.558,2426.882,--aider and abettor... then again we get back to the question: If there's nothing in this world other than the company that puts out the false statement and the aider and abettor--
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2426.882,2429.084,"Well... oh, no--"
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2429.084,2429.881,--and is there something in between?
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2429.881,2435.144,"--Your Honor, there are other persons that are control persons within a company who are liable."
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2435.144,2435.566,But we're taking those out.
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2437.628,2443.798,Independent actors that don't speak to the markets and cause direct reliance on their own statements are aiders and abettors.
2007.06-43,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2471.083,2487.295,"Do you know, Mr. Shapiro, if in the law of torts and the restatement of torts or in other areas of the law there is some third classification that's between aider and abettor in principle?"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2487.295,2490.044,I don't know the answer.
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2522.235,2524.265,Let's assume there is reliance and loss causation.
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2535.386,2537.853,"No, I don't think there can be."
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2537.853,2538.165,Why?
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2538.165,2545.054,Because Congress intended in section 20(e) to have an expert agency address these cases and not to have the trial--
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2545.054,2549.473,Congress intended an expert agency to address solely aiding-and-abetting cases.
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2567.326,2572.714,--We believe they are separate categories and that Central Bank tells us exactly who the primary violator is.
2007.06-43,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.992,2585.444,Could you amend that to--
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2595.751,2596.033,--Absolutely.
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2598.235,2615.634,"For example, for example, let's assume in this case that Charter said we've, we've got to let the investors know that our cost of doing business is going up, and we want to you make an announcement that you're jacking up your price 20 percent."
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2618.102,2618.821,Absolutely.
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2618.821,2621.945,Why in that case is there not also aiding-and-abetting?
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2634.204,2639.077,"Well, it's primary because there is the communication to the market that's missing here."
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2639.077,2639.53,We know it's primary.
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2640.936,2644.263,You can call it... both of those things.
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2644.263,2648.387,"If you can call it, why isn't there the kind of overlap which raises the question that Justice Ginsburg has raised?"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2648.387,2654.229,"You can't have primary liability, which they are asserting here, without the statement to the market."
2007.06-43,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2658.383,2664.662,So you are saying there can be an overlap but there is no overlap that helps the Petitioner in this case?
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2664.662,2665.037,"Oh, yes."
2007.06-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2738.757,2746.926,"Does the SEC distinguish this kind of situation where silence is the essence of the thing for the deceiver, silence not speech?"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2750.253,2760.92,"--Well, the SEC's view is the one rejected by the Solicitor General, and that's this purpose-and-effect standard that's been advocated, which we think is hopelessly vague."
2007.06-43,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2770.369,2772.9,"Mr. Shapiro, what is your strongest case, in your view, for the reliance requirement?"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2772.9,2774.212,Central Bank itself.
2007.06-43,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2774.212,2775.867,Central Bank itself?
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2775.867,2801.279,"Because the Court there said that even though the bank did something that was a secret agreement that facilitated the issuer's distribution of a false prospectus and caused all the harm to the shareholders, it was a direct sine qua non cause of all of that harm, that that was merely aiding and abetting, because there was no reliance on anything that the bank stated or anything that the bank had a duty to state because of a fiduciary relationship."
2007.06-43,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2821.755,2827.864,"Mr. Shapiro, in your judgment, is the reliance requirement an element of the violation or of the private cause of action?"
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2827.864,2829.3,--It's the private cause of action.
2007.06-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2855.258,2856.43,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
2007.06-43,1,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,2856.43,2858.131,We thank the Court.
2007.06-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2858.131,2859.6,Mr. Hungar.
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2859.6,2876.452,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals erred to the extent it held that section 10(b) applies only to verbal misrepresentations or omissions."
2007.06-43,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2900.802,2903.457,"Mr. Hungar, I want to be sure I understand one part of the government's position."
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2906.815,2910.329,"--We haven't taken a position on that question, Your Honor."
2007.06-43,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2916.81,2919.107,Were the other elements present?
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2919.107,2927.027,"As I say, we have not taken... I mean, materiality, for instance, the ""in connection with"" requirement, scienter, we haven't addressed those questions and have not taken a position."
2007.06-43,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2927.027,2930.385,Do you have an opinion as to whether there was a violation of 10(b) in this case?
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2930.385,2931.04,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-43,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2931.04,2932.196,You don't have an opinion?
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2932.196,2933.071,"We haven't taken a position, and--"
2007.06-43,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2933.071,2934.477,I know you haven't taken a--
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2936.883,2937.147,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-43,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2955.858,2959.232,You have not reached opinion as to whether there was a violation of the statute?
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2959.232,2959.67,Correct.
2007.06-43,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2959.67,2963.48,Has the SEC publicly taken a position on that question?
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,2963.48,2968.62,"I'm not sure of the answer to that question, Your Honor."
2007.06-43,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3040.481,3046.808,Could the SEC get any monetary recovery for the investors on your theory?
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3054.914,3055.508,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-43,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3055.508,3060.286,Private suits; obviously they are seeking damages for the decline in the share price.
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3067.081,3073.687,"The SEC is entitled to obtain civil fines, as well as disgorgement remedies."
2007.06-43,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3073.687,3077.888,But there is no disgorgement here because the vendors didn't get anything.
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3079.591,3085.729,"Well, I don't know... I believe in the, not in this case but in the Adelphia case, which is addressed--"
2007.06-43,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3085.729,3088.822,"Well, but this case, disgorgement would not be a remedy."
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3092.446,3110.423,"--If I may... yes, yes and no, I think is the answer to that question; because under the fair funds provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, section 308 of Sarbanes-Oxley, the SEC is authorized to take fines and distribute those... add those to disgorgement relief... and distribute them to investors."
2007.06-43,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3110.423,3112.657,But there would be no disgorgement relief.
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3112.657,3115.67,"Well, I'm not sure I can agree with that point."
2007.06-43,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3117.747,3119.777,What profits did the vendors get?
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3123.839,3125.932,"--Well, they obtained... at least--"
2007.06-43,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3147.72,3151.141,But did they receive something that they then disgorged?
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3151.141,3153.561,--I believe the allegations were similar to those presented here.
2007.06-43,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3183.753,3193.997,"Do you agree, do you agree with Mr. Shapiro, what I understood to be his argument, that 20(e), the aider and abettor statute, more or less occupies the field here and there is no--"
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3196.59,3240.213,"Well, I wouldn't say that it occupies the field per se, but what it does do is... given the timing of this Court's decision in Central Bank in 1994, followed by Congress's considering the question whether to provide for secondary liability in private actions, and its decision not to authorize such secondary liability... what it does clearly suggest is that this Court ought not adopt the expansive view of the implied right of action that Petitioner is urging, but instead both because the Court is appropriately cautious in expanding liability under implied rights of action, and because Congress has now looked at this question, not once but twice, and has declined to provide secondary liability for secondary actors under the cause of action."
2007.06-43,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3240.213,3245.087,You think that you are either a principal or an aider and abettor?
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3245.087,3253.709,You can... it's possible for someone to be both but in order to be both they must have... they must have satisfied all of the elements.
2007.06-43,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3253.709,3256.504,"For the same act, I'm talking about... for the same act."
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3256.504,3256.816,Yes.
2007.06-43,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3303.563,3307.219,"And I take it in your view they cannot establish the ""in connection with"" argument?"
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3307.219,3309.904,We have not taken a position--
2007.06-43,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3309.904,3313.544,"Prior to the statment, there is no reliance, but that there is ""in connection with""--"
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3313.544,3321.196,"--Your Honor, I would hesitate to say that, Your Honor, because the SEC and the United States do not have to establish reliance in criminal or--"
2007.06-43,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3357.291,3366.256,"It's at least a little awkward for you to say we should wait for a case in which it's been fully presented when the argument you're making here wasn't fully presented, or at least not decided below."
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3366.256,3367.693,"--I think it was, Your Honor."
2007.06-43,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3380.922,3387.374,I understood the court of appeals' decision to be based on its determination that there was no deceptive act because there was no statement or omission.
2007.06-43,2,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3387.374,3401.836,"But on page 10a, they also talk about reliance, Your Honor; and what's important here to understand is that Petitioner's theory of reliance rests on a misstatement, because they say the market... it's a basic presumption of reliance based on the fraud-on-the-market theory case."
2007.06-43,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3425.641,3426.25,I don't see--
