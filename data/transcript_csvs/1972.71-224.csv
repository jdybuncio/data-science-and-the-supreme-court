1972.71-224,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,22.944,"We’ll hear arguments next in Swenson against Stidham, 71-224."
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,29.837,38.659,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,437.475,450.648,"Is the basic issue in this case and the basic question, what was the law of Missouri in 1955 with respect to procedure in handling alleged course confessions?"
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,450.648,455.992,"No sir, to the extent that might be the conclusion to be drawn from my questions, presumably that’s it."
1972.71-224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,485.511,502.669,"Even though you suggest the judge very clearly had complied in 1955 was what the Jackson against Denno decided many years later, you said the Eighth Circuit would have said, it wouldn’t make any difference because the law of Missouri didn’t require to do that."
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,502.669,503.325,Right.
1972.71-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,503.325,516.904,"Well, Mr. Romines isn’t also perhaps equally a fundamental issue in the case of the proper application of this Court’s holding in Jackson against Denno to whatever in fact happened in the Missouri Trial Court?"
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,516.904,518.136,"Yes sir, that’s what I --"
1972.71-224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,518.136,518.914,That you say it is the basic issue.
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,518.914,519.932,That’s right.
1972.71-224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,542.566,560.713,"Because that preliminary, that inquiry that what you interesting intellectual inquiry as to what was the law of Missouri in 1955 should I suppose you would agree normally in our judicial process be left for the determination by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit."
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,560.713,562.302,I think that’s correct.
1972.71-224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,562.302,565.118,We are not in business here to decide what the state law is.
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,565.118,583.756,"No, in a particular case where the law is perhaps unclear as the Court indicates at least two members of the Court indicated they felt this was, perhaps that is a proper inquiry but I think on the particular reason that we’re here today that that’s not the proper inquiry."
1972.71-224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,808.621,812.533,Now could I ask the question please.
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,833.604,834.475,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,834.475,839.784,"Now after he was convicted he was given another full hearing in the state court, was he not?"
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,839.784,841.461,That’s true.
1972.71-224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,841.461,846.767,And there are no new witnesses called or anything I take it?
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,846.767,849.383,"No, there was some changing of testimony but --"
1972.71-224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,849.383,865.464,"Changing of testimony but there was a full opportunity for a hearing and the counsel per same for some -- for all intensive purposes the case was submitted on practically the same evidence, is that right?"
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,865.464,866.704,"That’s true, Your Honor."
1972.71-224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,866.704,873.594,And the state trial judge that was conducting that collateral hearing denied relief?
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,873.594,875.036,That’s true.
1972.71-224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,875.036,883.534,"Now if that were a determination that the confession was voluntary, it really wouldn’t make any difference what the procedure was at the trial would it?"
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,883.534,884.392,"No, it wouldn’t."
1972.71-224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,907.137,910.163,So he went on and said there is plenty of evidence to support that.
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,910.163,911.229,"Right, he did."
1972.71-224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,911.229,920.303,"Well, if he thought the -- if he thought the judge the term that voluntary said there was plenty of evidence to support it, do you think that’s a determination of voluntariness?"
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,920.303,930.88,"I think it certainly is and we argue that, we also have argued that the determination that the Supreme Court made on appeal was sufficient on the judges, on the reinstated appeal."
1972.71-224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,930.88,935.226,"Yes, yes, because there, the court did say it was voluntary."
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,935.226,936.643,Right.
1972.71-224,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,939.501,940.324,The trial judge could have --
1972.71-224,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,940.324,944.459,Did the trial judge say it was voluntary or did he say it was not involuntary?
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,944.459,952.159,"Those words, all of the words in there or Mr. Hennelly’s words, the judge only rules, he did not say voluntary nor not involuntary."
1972.71-224,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,952.159,953.364,That’s right.
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,953.364,954.728,He doesn’t say anything.
1972.71-224,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,973.133,978.645,"The trial judge could have determined that is a matter of law that it was involuntary, could he not?"
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,978.645,979.535,He could have.
1972.71-224,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,979.535,981.724,And then he would not have admitted it?
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,981.724,982.848,That’s correct.
1972.71-224,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,995.522,1013.339,"Did you say that his words coupled with his actions make it clear that he was ruling, that he regarded the confession as voluntary subject only to the juries right to reexamine that as to credibility and other attacks?"
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,1013.339,1017.385,"That's Probably -- that’s correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1017.385,1033.542,"Mr. Romines, if the case had come here on direct appeal or certiorari from the affirmance on direct appeal by the Supreme Court of Missouri and we have concluded that this colloquy between Mr. Hennelly and the trial judge did not satisfy Denno."
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,1047.833,1050.437,That’s true.
1972.71-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1136.839,1140.316,"14,075 petitions to show cost."
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,1140.316,1140.758,That’s right.
1972.71-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1140.758,1141.951,To federal habeas?
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,1141.951,1145.042,In three years.
1972.71-224,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1149.592,1151.635,Was it that just the Western District?
1972.71-224,0,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,1151.635,1157.415,That takes in the Western and the Eastern District.
1972.71-224,1,35989,mark_m_hennelly,,1301.755,1306.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-224,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1363.008,1368.55,Am I correct that this is the seventh time that this case has been before for some court?
1972.71-224,1,35989,mark_m_hennelly,,1368.55,1382.058,It’s the seventh time it’s been before some type of court Your Honor and as I again I say that’s the result of this man’s insistence that he was illegally convicted.
1972.71-224,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1403.74,1405.598,Do you have a citation of the record so we could follow along?
1972.71-224,1,35989,mark_m_hennelly,,1405.598,1421.969,"Yes, this is on page 26 of our brief at the appendix 686 page 26 of our brief."
1972.71-224,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1448.371,1455.075,Well did not he go on in the next paragraph and say that it was resolved in the Trial Court in the first instance that you went ahead with this case.
1972.71-224,1,35989,mark_m_hennelly,,1455.075,1460.598,"Yes but he went on further than that too Your Honor, I will read the whole thing that he said."
1972.71-224,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1495.771,1500.045,What year was he speaking that date isn’t here.
1972.71-224,1,35989,mark_m_hennelly,,1500.045,1503.546,It was two years ago Your Honor.
1972.71-224,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1564.501,1565.534,Mr. Hennelly.
1972.71-224,1,35989,mark_m_hennelly,,1565.534,1565.733,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-224,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1565.733,1578.315,"On the proceeding page that you quoted from and then quoted another pair of page, 86-85 and I take it this is still the opinion of the Missouri habeas judge."
1972.71-224,1,35989,mark_m_hennelly,,1599.026,1604.026,"No, Your Honor all that he is doing is restating what the court did in the first instance."
1972.71-224,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1618.813,1625.062,"But he is at least characterizing the finding of the original Missouri trial judges, the finding that it was not involuntary."
1972.71-224,1,35989,mark_m_hennelly,,1625.062,1626.623,"No, I don’t think that he is."
1972.71-224,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1836.371,1841.009,What’s the consequence now of the holding of the Eighth Circuit?
1972.71-224,1,35989,mark_m_hennelly,,1841.009,1846.028,The consequence is that it’s now here --
1972.71-224,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1846.028,1847.732,"Well, other than here?"
1972.71-224,1,35989,mark_m_hennelly,,1847.732,1848.698,"Well, the consequence --"
1972.71-224,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1848.698,1850.727,"If it had not come here, what fashion --"
1972.71-224,1,35989,mark_m_hennelly,,1850.727,1877.68,"If had not come here and if the State have not applied for cert, it would have gone back for another hearing to determine the voluntariness of the statement and I presume that some other judge realizing that he had to conform with Jackson versus Denno and the Sims case would have said “I have heard this evidence, I find it to be voluntary” and that would have been it."
1972.71-224,2,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,2685.404,2691.321,"I think I told the Court that he was impressive trial lawyer, he is."
1972.71-224,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2794.331,2803.818,"Well, they did also say, didn’t they that we have examined the transcripts and other relevant materials that found several of Stidham’s allegations have not been contradicted in the record."
1972.71-224,2,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,2803.818,2804.376,Right.
1972.71-224,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2804.376,2805.498,The majority of this.
1972.71-224,2,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,2805.498,2817.939,They requested a letter from me sometime in early April specifically referring to the fact that they have not had anything to eat or drink and requested transcript references.
1972.71-224,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2874.108,2883.594,"Well, what is there that would give you a right not to believe the facts he said about his cell in death row?"
1972.71-224,2,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,2883.594,2885.765,You mean what do I know or what does the record believe?
1972.71-224,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2885.765,2887.666,What did the Judge know?
1972.71-224,2,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,2887.666,2888.767,The judge at the case --
1972.71-224,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2888.767,2891.733,Why would the judge not accept that as being true?
1972.71-224,2,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,2891.733,2897.449,"Okay, one of the officers at the 27 to 26 testified, all of the police officers are high and prominent --"
1972.71-224,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2897.449,2897.804,Oh!
1972.71-224,2,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,2900.295,2908.086,"Oh, yes, he said that the cell did not contain water but when we went there was a bunk that the man did not look like he was hungry."
1972.71-224,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2921.497,2924.653,How long was he in solitary?
1972.71-224,2,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,2924.653,2927.907,I believe that the record indicates that he had been there 20 months.
1972.71-224,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2927.907,2928.641,20 months?
1972.71-224,2,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,2928.641,2930.868,"Right, before escape."
1972.71-224,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2930.868,2935.381,And is there any evidence said there weren’t cockroaches in there?
1972.71-224,2,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,2935.381,2937.675,"No, there is nothing that indicates there are no cockroaches."
1972.71-224,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2942.333,2943.778,"Well, that’s on contradiction."
1972.71-224,2,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,2943.778,2945.195,Right.
1972.71-224,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2945.195,2948.481,And you have no reason to deny it?
1972.71-224,2,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,2948.481,2959.124,"Oh, if I were to bring it, I think the first question I would asks somebody if I could find somebody would be that question but there is nothing in the record that we have here today that indicates that there were no cockroaches, that is right."
1972.71-224,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2959.124,2974.726,"Well, is the rule in Missouri as it is elsewhere that the finder of fact is entitled to disbelieve an interested witness without the necessity of contradicting testimony if that is the conclusion of the trial of fact that he is not telling the truth?"
1972.71-224,2,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,2974.726,2977.546,"That is the law, Your Honor."
1972.71-224,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3025.238,3034.723,"(Inaudible) His claims were having this business of being lifted off the floor by his handcuff, isn’t that it?"
1972.71-224,2,33972,kenneth_m_romines,,3034.723,3036.241,"That is right, behind his back."
1972.71-224,3,35989,mark_m_hennelly,,3059.375,3059.81,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-224,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3059.81,3062.827,Thank you for your assistance to your client and your assistance to the Court.
1972.71-224,3,35989,mark_m_hennelly,,3062.827,3066.422,Thank you.
1972.71-224,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3066.422,3068.364,The case is submitted.
