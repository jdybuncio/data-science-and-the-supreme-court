1964.38,0,45630,william_j_mounce,,11.962,15.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,95.237,97.847,How did Simmons acquire the title in 1952?
1964.38,0,45630,william_j_mounce,,97.847,98.813,By quitclaim deed.
1964.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,98.813,100.937,By quitclaim deed from --
1964.38,0,45630,william_j_mounce,,100.937,108.203,From mean grantees of the original purchasers.
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,844.035,854.546,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1314.67,1326.598,Does that mean that if you -- if you continued to fail to pay the interest and the State never divested itself in favor of another party --
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1326.598,1329.009,"Well, that is so --"
1964.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1329.009,1331.732,-- that you could continue that in that at the end of the --
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1331.732,1337.762,"Mr. Chief Justice, you mean when you're taking generally or in this particular case?"
1964.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1337.762,1340.509,"Well, I'm talking about what would happen in this particular case."
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1340.509,1342.841,"In this particular case sir, it was tendered."
1964.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1363.967,1369.398,"Well, but I -- I'm wondering what would happen if the -- if the State did not sell to the city."
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1369.697,1371.431,If the State did not sell it to the city.
1964.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1371.431,1373.154,Could you indefinitely have --
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1373.154,1373.984,Well --
1964.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1373.984,1380.073,-- failed to pay the interest and still maintain your property?
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1380.073,1383.163,"Well -- oh, you mean after it had been forfeited back to the state?"
1964.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1386.953,1387.727,Right.
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1387.727,1391.008,"Yes, yes, and if -- that's right."
1964.38,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1476.304,1481.61,You are arguing in the contrary (Inaudible) the settler and vendee.
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1481.61,1486.551,"A vendee under this statute has identically the same -- yes sir, yes Your Honor."
1964.38,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1503.059,1528.122,(Inaudible)
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1528.122,1531.107,That's right and it's done -- been done and the books are full of it.
1964.38,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1537.051,1549.125,(Inaudible)
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1549.125,1554.681,"Well, if it was questioned, lots of times it didn't question."
1964.38,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1580.94,1612.351,(Inaudible)
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1612.351,1622.558,"Well, Mr. Justice Gold -- yes Mr. Justice Goldberg, it's covered right here in the statute which is the terms of the contr -- obligation of the contract itself."
1964.38,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1658.471,1660.475,"That have been changed though, was it?"
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1660.475,1665.033,"The statute -- yes, statute has been changed -- yes, yes Your Honor -- Mr. Justice Clark."
1964.38,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1665.033,1670.418,"The State forfeited the land for nonpayment in 1947, is that right?"
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1670.418,1671.694,Yes.
1964.38,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1671.694,1678.216,Then you can earn your money under the Act in 1953.
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1678.216,1679.934,"1952, yes, Your Honor."
1964.38,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1679.934,1682.85,"And that was two days later or something like that, wasn't it?"
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1682.85,1683.941,Well it was --
1964.38,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1683.941,1685.074,-- according to the --
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1685.074,1691.965,"I mean according to the -- evidently according to something it was yes -- yes, I --"
1964.38,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1691.965,1694.391,He was qualified in 1941 with that statute.
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1694.391,1704.957,"I know that, but that statute was passed if you're speaking of, it was passed, it was passed some 30 years after this contract was made."
1964.38,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1704.957,1706.358,I understand that.
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1723.363,1726.863,"Well, here it is and the obligation of the contract right here."
1964.38,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1727.426,1729.11,"Well, I understand that."
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1729.11,1736.885,"And then in 1941 and 1951, yes, those acts were -- they were amended but they have been amended several times since then."
1964.38,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1756.912,1765.903,Those statements say that they had the right to amend the statute with reference to forfeiture for nonpayment.
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1787.462,1793.039,The State didn't own the prop -- any property subject to the obligation of this statute.
1964.38,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1806.052,1807.771,They didn't sell it until '55.
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1807.771,1812.614,They -- they didn't tell it -- sell it until the settler himself had paid everything he owed.
1964.38,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1838.395,1848.263,Suppose the central opinion might have been a subsequent statute limitation exercise of your right to redemption?
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1848.263,1849.579,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor."
1964.38,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1849.579,1859.399,"I suppose the substance in what Texas has done here is to, by enacting the statute, is the subsequent statute is to impose that the statutory limitations on the --"
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1859.399,1875.146,"They imposed a -- a statute limitation, nothing but a remedy, nothing but a remedy in the world that -- that five-year limitation, but you can't even impose a remedy, if you have contracted in the terms of the obligation."
1964.38,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1875.146,1889.181,"What you have in other words suppose the State would believe that in fact promulgated the contract to somebody else, and you say when they intervened with the statute set you also may not have your land back in which they amended in certain time, they couldn't do that."
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1890.151,1900.229,"Yes we're saying that that impaired after this contract was made and while this was customary down in Texas, there's -- there's this any unusual thing that they'll try to pull of it."
1964.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1906.578,1907.101,I think you did.
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1919.098,1920.471,"Well if you -- they -- yes, that's right."
1964.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1920.471,1921.514,Is that what you're saying?
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1921.514,1923.64,That's how it is -- that's exactly what we are saying.
1964.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1927.826,1938.862,"And what the State is saying is “No, we may also interpose in the fact that time period within which after the new statute, you have to commend in and if you didn't, we keep it.”"
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1939.714,1940.462,Yes but we're saying --
1964.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1940.462,1942.678,-- that was two days after the time it went out and you say we keep it.
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1942.678,1953.901,That's right and we say you can't put that on because not because it -- I mean because that you have contracted back there and these people have lived on this land.
1964.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1989.397,1995.244,How long have they been in default actually at the time they came back and tendered the arrears?
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,1995.244,2005.144,"Well your -- Your Honor please, they had five -- I think maybe five years and maybe one or two days there's a discussion there about when they received it, and what day it was, and that's I think --"
1964.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2005.144,2009.591,"Is that all these cases involved here, there were just a couple of days over five years in arrears?"
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,2009.591,2011.445,Well these two cases are the same.
1964.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2023.188,2031.927,What do you do with the case of Aikins versus Kingsbury in 247 U.S.(Voice Overlap) on the theory of cases the counsel drew along that line?
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,2031.927,2034.69,Well excuse me Mr. -- excuse me Mr. Chief Justice.
1964.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2034.69,2041.58,I say how do you handle the Aikins versus Kingsbury in 247 U.S. and the other cases that counsel cites along the line?
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,2041.58,2049.9,"Well, the Court of Appeals, of course, they cited that case and that's the first time that this -- this city had ever presented that case."
1964.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2157.363,2159.839,But isn't that what happened in Aikins?
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,2159.839,2160.942,Well yes.
1964.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2193.731,2200.218,"Well, they purchased it at the -- in the lights of the statute in California, didn't they, in Aikins?"
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,2200.218,2200.851,I beg your pardon.
1964.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2200.851,2206.052,"They purchased to them the light of the statute in Aikins, did they not?"
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,2206.887,2209.722,I think they probably invest (Voice Overlap).
1964.38,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2211.369,2217.778,This is the language that I wanted -- what you -- what you -- how would you handle it.
1964.38,1,26153,greenberry_simmons,,2247.082,2257.526,"That's the language and -- and the obligation of this contract is that whether this is a remedy or whether this is substance, or even procedure."
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,2705.167,2707.474,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.38,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2733.668,2742.289,"Would you trace through the actions of the State from -- from the time that they first defaulted on the interest, what was done?"
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,2742.289,2756.289,"Yes sir, the first default on the interest, the State mailed a letter to the last known address of these particular purchasers, advice them of the fact that they had not paid the interest on November 1, 1956 whenever it was --"
1964.38,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2756.289,2757.372,It's not 1956 --
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,2757.372,2776.58,"I'm sorry, it's 1946, 1946 whenever it was due and advice them that if the payments were made -- not made by the 21st of July 1947, that the lands would be forfeited."
1964.38,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2821.238,2825.684,"Well then, what -- what was the next action the State took?"
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,2825.684,2839.578,The next action that the State took after the forfeiture was in -- again in July of 1952.
1964.38,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2871.11,2877.29,"Now, when did -- when did Mr. Simmons buy -- become the federal owner of the property?"
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,2877.29,2879.611,In June of 1952.
1964.38,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2879.611,2881.461,"In 1952, just before --"
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,2881.461,2886.927,"Yes, after six weeks before the five years had gone up."
1964.38,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2886.927,2892.914,And when -- when was the author made to repay the interest?
1964.38,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2892.914,2896.567,Apparently two days after the five-year period.
1964.38,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2896.567,2900.865,Before the -- in election of the State?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,2900.865,2907.805,Well two days af - after the five years had elapsed.
1964.38,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2914.868,2918.874,And then when was this action filed?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,2918.874,2924.642,"This occurred in 1952, the action was in July 1952."
1964.38,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2931.528,2936.214,Who was in possession with property in the meantime?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,2936.214,2943.211,"Well, there really wasn't much possession taken and I'd be quite frank with you."
1964.38,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2970.9,2972.313,"Yes, it does."
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,2972.313,2973.362,Thank you.
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3024.407,3028.874,Were the obligations the same in Aikins?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3028.874,3048.937,"Well as far as the -- as far as I can tell from any decision, I haven't seen the particular contract involved in Aikins but the decision says that the only obligations were, one, that the purchaser would pay the purchase price and two, upon payment in full that the State would issue a patent for the land."
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3073.448,3074.955,What about the interest?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3074.955,3078.157,"And the interest, yes."
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3084.138,3090.617,Was it -- do you view the new law as not changing the obligation of that contract?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3090.617,3091.613,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3093.928,3094.1,Why?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3100.352,3103.117,I believe it is under an obligation at that time.
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3103.117,3105.389,But didn't they like to do it?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3105.389,3108.784,I don't believe that that was the contract.
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3108.784,3108.969,Why?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3108.969,3111.347,I mean -- sir?
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3111.347,3112.551,Why?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3114.144,3129.838,"Well, they had a contract whereby he would pay for the land and want to repay for the land and statement sell it but I don't think the method by which the State terminated this contractual relationship with him was necessarily a part of the contract."
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3129.838,3132.96,But why was it necessary to change the law if the contract wouldn't change it?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3132.96,3137.071,"Well, to change the procedure, why by which --"
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3137.071,3140.711,To resolve the procedure but what did it resolve in so far as he was concerned?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3140.711,3145.168,"Well, as far as he was concerned, it terminated his contractual rights at the end of the five-year period."
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3145.168,3153.504,Terminated the contractual rights which he would have had but part of the passing to the law?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3153.504,3162.704,"If the law had not been in effect, and under these circumstances, I believe that he would have still had a right to purchase the land."
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3162.796,3165.218,Under the contract?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3165.218,3165.35,Under the --
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3165.35,3166.897,He might not accept the contract.
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3166.897,3169.527,Under of the contract and the policy then in effect by the State of Texas.
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3169.527,3170.68,I'm not talking about the policy.
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3173.657,3177.794,"Well, I don't think this was necessarily a contractual provision and --"
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3177.794,3179.221,But what is it if not a contractual provision?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3179.221,3187.956,I think there's more policy and a remedial provision remedy by which the State terminated this con -- terminated or did not terminate the --
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3187.956,3188.381,Obligation?

1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3190.069,3197.524,"Well what if -- what if round up with, whatever you call it, what if he had a contract which was absolutely good."
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3209.156,3213.968,"Well except the -- well at one premise that I think you're wrong, all the contracts are absolutely good."
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3216.664,3220.384,"Oh, he was in default, didn't it provide what you have if he's in default?"
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3220.384,3221.119,Yes it did provide.
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3221.119,3222.393,What did it provide?

1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3240.843,3244.335,"No, there's no procedure or any right for by the statement to do that."
1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3244.335,3246.756,I don't see how you say it.

1964.38,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3261.7,3265.972,Have you read the second facet of that Aikins case about the obligation?
1964.38,2,45630,william_j_mounce,,3265.972,3275.553,"Well, they don't -- well on the obligation of the contract but they do say this that at the title of the contract, the way the State would terminate these contractual rights was this."
