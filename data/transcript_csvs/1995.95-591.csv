1995.95-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.227,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-591, the United States v. International Business Machines Corporation."
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,10.429,13.54,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,97.366,103.658,"Well, Mr. Minear, we're dealing here with the Export Clause, not the Import-Export Clause, isn't that right?"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,103.658,104.789,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,104.789,111.925,And it certainly is possible that the Export Clause has different purposes than the Import-Export Clause.
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,111.925,117.909,"That is possible, but we do not think it is borne out by either the language or the content of the clause itself."
1995.95-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,117.909,126.585,You do concede that if we do not overrule the Thames case that you lose?
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,126.585,127.755,That is correct.
1995.95-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,129.297,135.31,And it obviously would require ultimately overruling more than just Thames & Mersey.
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,139.482,140.273,"But relatively few, Your Honor."
1995.95-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.814,145.996,"Well, why should we do that at all?"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,148.417,155.243,"--The harm that it does is, it results in a lack of coherence in this Court's overall approach to the problem in this area."
1995.95-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.243,157.613,"Well, occasionally one has that."
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,182.882,187.273,"Your Honor, I'd like to answer both of the questions, both of the points that you made there."
1995.95-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,225.268,226.43,"Well, why are they synonymous?"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,228.55,232.034,The Framers frequently used synonymous terms to express the same idea.
1995.95-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,252.637,263.597,"Well, I don't think that carries you very... to provide and maintain a Navy, you're providing ships, whereas to raise and support armies, you're conscripting troops."
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,263.597,272.729,"But this... the overall content of those phrases, they convey the same general meaning, and that's the point that Chief Justice Marshall made in 1827 in the case of Brown v. Maryland."
1995.95-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,282.727,284.597,"Yes, even though the case itself hasn't been followed."
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,284.597,288.08,The case itself has been followed in significant part.
1995.95-591,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,312.787,330.248,"Are you concerned that the original package doctrine has to be introduced, or something like it, if we attempt some halfway solution where we rule in your favor saying there cannot be a tax on the export, but that if there is an indirect tax, then the discrimination rule applies?"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,330.248,330.609,Yes.
1995.95-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,340.734,348.38,"Mr. Minear, you mentioned Washington Stevedoring, which involved the cost of loading, and--"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,348.38,348.67,--Yes.
1995.95-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,350.891,365.221,"--And I thought that the whole idea of that is that that was a discrete item, that you could separate the stevedoring, the loading of the vessel from the goods, and I was struck by your brief that you don't make any lesser argument."
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,379.289,382.352,"Well, we believe that that's a separate problem with Thames & Mersey."
1995.95-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,384.763,385.935,But you've conceded that.
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,386.996,387.597,But that is--
1995.95-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.597,389.757,"So that problem's over the falls, right?"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,391.047,396.142,"--The bigger problem is the one that we're concerned with, and that was the application... yes."
1995.95-591,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,396.142,398.863,Excuse me.
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,412.011,413.203,That's correct.
1995.95-591,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,413.203,414.064,"The Spalding case, et cetera."
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,414.064,422.62,"And the problem, the reason why we chose not to do that is because it is... it requires us to fall back onto an analysis similar to the original package doctrine."
1995.95-591,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,425.381,428.244,But is it so hard in this case to do that?
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,431.385,438.819,"Well, of course you could do that, but it seems to me that the issue ought to be addressed now, that this is a problem that has continued to plague this area--"
1995.95-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,438.819,444.352,"Well, how does your theory not require us to figure out what are imports and what aren't imports?"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,463.566,466.679,"--Then you might well have to face that question, but the test--"
1995.95-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,466.679,466.979,Of course.
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,472.211,482.317,"--The test that we propose will eliminate that inquiry in most every case, because the initial question will be, is this tax discriminatory, and that's a question that can usually be answered quite easily."
1995.95-591,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,482.317,490.343,"Oh, but you've got to say discriminatory against what, and to determine the what, you've got to decide whether the subject of the tax should be treated as an export."
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,492.173,501.871,"Well, on the other hand, Your Honor, if a tax applies across the board to all types of transactions, it is not discriminatory, so you do not need to get into the question of what is an export and what isn't, as long as--"
1995.95-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,501.871,525.056,"So if the South, in other words, exports 100 percent of its indigo crop... no, let's say only 99.99 percent, and Congress were to pass a tax saying all shipments of indigo pay a 10 percent tax, in your view that's nondiscriminatory and, therefore, at the time this Constitution was enacted, the court should have upheld it?"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,525.056,531.91,--I think that the question of whether any particular tax is going to be discriminatory may require a further analysis.
1995.95-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,531.91,533.401,What about the case I put?
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,533.401,540.386,"At the moment that that tax is imposed, perhaps it is a tax on exports, but you must remember that markets constantly change."
1995.95-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,540.386,547.42,"The question I think that was being asked is, isn't... don't you have to figure out whether the tax is on an export or not even under your analysis?"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,547.42,559.647,"You do, but you can... the analysis we propose simplifies this area in the same way that it has simplified the area in the Import-Export Clause cases by focusing on the nature of the tax."
1995.95-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,567.953,568.914,Mr. Minear--
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,592.469,592.799,Yes.
1995.95-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,592.799,600.443,"And yet that seems such a simple argument that you avoid, and I'm not clear on why you're doing that."
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,600.443,602.426,We do not mean to avoid that argument.
1995.95-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,634.477,654.7,"Mr. Minear, I'm just skeptical that the canny southerners who got this provision included in the Constitution were resigned to the notion that if a tax were placed upon indigo, it would be up to the courts as to whether that was a discriminatory... you know, upon shipments of indigo."
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,668.11,668.559,It could be.
1995.95-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,669.55,669.931,I--
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,669.931,671.651,Your Honor--
1995.95-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.651,677.464,--I'm skeptical that that's all the protection the southerners thought they got when they got the Export Clause included in the Constitution.
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,677.464,684.379,"--Well, if we're looking to what the Framers were concerned about, I think that the Convention debates indicate they were concerned about export taxes."
1995.95-591,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,711.919,714.99,"Well, it isn't just disproportionality, is it?"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,758.648,770.906,"I think that they were... they realized that their ultimate protection from taxation in the southern States, as well in the North, lie in the establishment of a Congress composed of two Houses that would provide the representation that would give weight to their concerns."
1995.95-591,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,770.906,774.577,"Well, if that's all they were concerned about, then they didn't need the clause in the first place."
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,795.761,797.993,I think that their objection was actually more pointed.
1995.95-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,805.799,809.021,"You're... well, then you're being inconsistent in your analysis."
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,819.638,821.08,--My view on that is--
1995.95-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.08,821.551,Which is it?
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,828.925,839.85,"--I'd like to clarify my answer on that, and that is that the tax on an object that is 100 percent exported might very well be a discriminatory tax if it's a pretext for imposing a tax on exports."
1995.95-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,870.271,870.852,Well--
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,870.852,871.903,--that's being rendered in any particular case.
1995.95-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,871.903,882.298,"--what leads you to that conclusion, that the Government can levy a tax on medicine being exported if it has gone to some expense to test it in this country?"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,882.298,890.704,"By... the reason for that is because, even now, the Congress can levy that type of tax if it's a tax on the manufacturer rather than at some later point."
1995.95-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,890.704,896.428,"Well, but you say it can levy a tax on the medicine itself being exported?"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,896.428,904.773,"It can levy a tax on the medicine, not on the medicine... what I'm saying... my point here, Your Honor, is that you have to focus on the specific tax that's at issue."
1995.95-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,904.773,910.238,"Well, of course, the constitutional language says no tax or duty."
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,913.689,915.692,Yes.
1995.95-591,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,929.95,937.724,But it seems to me your answer to the Chief Justice betrays what is the... betrays your argument and what's of concern to the Court.
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,947.682,952.304,"It eliminates the inquiry in most cases, is my point here."
1995.95-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,966.563,969.525,And nondiscriminatory means what?
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,969.525,972.116,It's a tax of general application that's applied to goods across the board.
1995.95-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,972.116,977.932,"Well, do we have to, then, look at the percentage of the thing that's exported as opposed to the percentage that isn't?"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,977.932,978.551,No.
1995.95-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,983.446,984.865,The character of the tax?
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1004.279,1013.305,"My point to you on the indigo example is, we would not say that you are... that a party is precluded from challenging even a nondiscriminatory, a tax that on it's face is nondiscriminatory--"
1995.95-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1013.305,1014.326,"--All right, let me ask you a different--"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1014.326,1014.616,--on the basis--
1995.95-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1014.616,1015.237,--Can I ask you a different question--
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1015.237,1015.638,--Yes.
1995.95-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1015.638,1051.472,"--because this is what is actually worrying me, but I can't... if, it seems to me, if... if, and it's a very big if, a tax on premiums paid to foreign insurers who have no U.S. offices for casualty insurance is in fact a tax on the item that is insured, then we are to look to this as a tax on the item insured."
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1090.656,1093.718,My view on how you approach the question is as follows.
1995.95-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1103.465,1104.166,No.
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1109.47,1109.81,--Yes.
1995.95-591,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1111.61,1124.639,So that must not be very normal that an American buys insurance casualty from an insurer who has no U.S. office but does not intend to ship the goods so insured abroad.
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1125.869,1140.859,"This tax applies not simply to export insurance but across the board to all types of casualty insurance, but again, to get back to the problem that you're postulating here, the approach is to look at the tax and determine whether or not it discriminates against exports."
1995.95-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1157.331,1158.139,"Mr. Minear, do we have any--"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1158.139,1158.88,But that's a very small number of cases.
1995.95-591,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1158.88,1170.277,--Do we have any idea whether there is any business of insuring domestic transport by foreign insurance companies that have no office in the U.S.?
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1170.277,1171.719,I believe that there is.
1995.95-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1188.312,1199.347,"Well, I suppose the tax covers reinsurance so that things like insurance carried by Lloyd's would be covered by this tax--"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1199.347,1199.638,Yes.
1995.95-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1199.638,1200.188,--is that right?
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1200.188,1201.749,It does cover reinsurance at a different rate.
1995.95-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1204.831,1208.063,But that could explain the large revenues.
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1208.063,1209.796,"--That might explain it, that's true."
1995.95-591,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1211.006,1212.348,Let me ask you this.
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1248.62,1259.108,"Oh, I believe that the tax here is designed to eliminate the competitive advantage that foreign insurers enjoy in this market by their exemption from the Federal income tax, and this Court has recognized that that type of tax is permissible."
1995.95-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1270.548,1287.177,"Mr. Minear, to come back to the Framers' perspective, I note in your reply brief even Justice Story's description of the word impost... I'm coming back to the difference between the... in the phrasing of the two clauses."
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1300.097,1300.478,--Yes.
1995.95-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1300.478,1301.6,--in 1833.
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1340.533,1346.319,"No, I don't believe that it is appropriate, first of all because it has a more general meaning, second, because even Justice--"
1995.95-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.319,1346.898,"Well, I--"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1346.898,1347.148,--Story recognizes--
1995.95-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.148,1348.029,"--No, of course it has a more general--"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1348.029,1348.61,"--Yes, and Justice--"
1995.95-591,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.61,1355.384,"--But as between giving it the more general or giving it the narrower, giving it the narrower meaning makes it different."
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1355.384,1367.992,"--But you've already given it a broader meaning than that in Justice Marshall's, Chief Justice Marshall's first opinion, where he felt that impost reached a licensing fee, which would never have been viewed as an impost in the normal, limited meaning of that term."
1995.95-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1404.216,1408.269,"Well, why should we do that, when they're two different clauses and different language?"
1995.95-591,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1408.269,1421.877,"Because that is the one source of consistency in this area of law in the past 170 years, and even in Washington Stevedores, this Court cited Export Clause cases... the Spalding case in particular, as a case that it viewed as taking the wrong approach in this area of law."
1995.95-591,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1424.319,1425.661,"Very well, Mr. Minear."
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1427.871,1435.856,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-591,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1475.453,1481.157,"Absolutely... I mean, you have John Marshall, for starters, as saying that the two clauses mean the same thing."
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1481.157,1485.527,"--Not on this point, Justice Scalia, and I think this is very important."
1995.95-591,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1656.151,1656.882,Why?
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1659.294,1660.704,There is a separate premium--
1995.95-591,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1660.704,1663.265,"My particular question would be, why is a tax on a premium--"
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1663.265,1663.905,--Right.
1995.95-591,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1663.905,1671.65,--It's a tax on a premium that paid for an insurance policy of a sort that exporters might buy and also people who are not exporters might buy.
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1671.65,1672.131,Well--
1995.95-591,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1672.131,1688.262,"And so why is a tax that is applied to an item that both exporters and nonexporters might buy, in some proportion we know not what, why is that a tax on the good that is exported?"
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1688.262,1697.208,"--Because when it is purchased for a shipment of goods, as in the case here, there is a separate premium charged for every shipment."
1995.95-591,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1713.899,1716.16,But that's not the only variable.
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1734.301,1745.368,"--The extent to which the value of the good determines the premium will vary with the length of shipment, but you know, the longer shipments, longer exports are taxed more than shorter shipments."
1995.95-591,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1758.057,1759.349,"Well, that's the way you characterize it."
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1778.29,1795.122,"--I guess the way this tax has been administered is, it goes from one... from where the good takes off from where the good lands, and in terms of the Court's jurisprudence under the Export Clause and under the Import Clause, I think they treat that entire journey as an integrated whole."
1995.95-591,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1826.342,1838.981,"Is a tax on diesel fuel exempt if that's a major portion of the cost of exporting the item, say bulk goods such as wheat or corn?"
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1838.981,1842.353,I think that would be a very good argument that that tax would be unconstitutional.
1995.95-591,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1850.017,1852.569,"Well, that's a very good reason for me to worry about your rationale."
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1852.569,1854.321,"--It's not my rationale, Your Honor."
1995.95-591,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1878.839,1897.211,"Mr. Atwood, the concern of Congress was with domestic insurers, and I take it from your argument that there couldn't be this tax as to exports, but to the extent that they are insuring or reinsuring risks in the United States, the premiums could be taxed."
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1903.846,1908.118,"Well, we understand Congress' objective."
1995.95-591,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1912.542,1916.573,But your response has got to be that Congress can't... it's just too bad for these domestic insurers.
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1920.817,1927.68,"We don't think the perceived problem in effect authorizes a tax in violation of the Constitution, that's right."
1995.95-591,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1928.481,1931.081,Your response is that it's the fault of the Constitution.
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1933.663,1936.886,"--It does, and there are a lot of tax exemptions in our laws."
1995.95-591,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1944.643,1945.114,But--
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1945.114,1945.962,--is it's in the Constitution--
1995.95-591,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.962,1946.583,--Can Congress--
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1946.583,1949.325,--and it's in the Constitution because the Framers thought it was important.
1995.95-591,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1949.325,1958.792,--Why is it inevitable that this must be classed as a tax on the goods rather than a tax on the service of providing insurance?
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1958.792,1974.022,"Well, I... it seems to me the Court's decision on that aspect in Thames & Mersey is correct and has been conceded by the Government, that this is... this bears so closely to the export process that it is a tax on goods."
1995.95-591,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1978.333,1979.444,"Could it say, ""Buy American""?"
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,1979.444,1982.547,"Yes, it probably could say, ""Buy American""."
1995.95-591,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2107.959,2116.335,"Well, we could make it very broad and still adopt the manner of analysis that we've used for the Import-Export Clause."
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,2146.294,2160.883,"Well, I think the... at least under this Court's holding in Michelin and Washington Stevedoring, the concept of discrimination is in the Import-Export clause, and it's in it because of the words duty and impost."
1995.95-591,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2226.166,2228.057,"I must say, I just don't see that."
1995.95-591,1,28880,james_r_atwood,,2267.333,2272.037,--That was not the analysis the Court applied in Michelin and Washington Stevedoring.
1995.95-591,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2339.922,2341.161,"Very well, Mr. Atwood."
1995.95-591,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2348.767,2349.896,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-591,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2371.651,2376.524,"Well, but that's certainly the result of the cases decided under the Export Clause."
1995.95-591,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2379.315,2394.767,"No, I think if we look at the actual cases... now, Fairbanks was the only... the first case in which this Court struck down a Federal tax on an Export Clause theory, and that was a discriminatory tax, and that tax would have been viewed as violative of the Import-Export Clause as well at that time."
1995.95-591,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2402.593,2404.574,But certainly it was true in Thames & Mersey.
1995.95-591,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2404.574,2417.72,"The tax there, I think that under the Import-Export Clause, until this Court's reasoning, new reasoning in Michelin Tires and Washington Stevedores, a State tax on insurance related to exports would have also been struck down."
1995.95-591,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2436.243,2443.39,"Even if that weren't so, I take it that the tax in Washington Stevedoring was a tax that wasn't related directly to the value of the goods."
1995.95-591,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2444.081,2445.069,--It was on--
1995.95-591,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2445.069,2450.081,"--services and, moreover, the tax in Michelin, I guess, was a tax on goods that weren't in transit."
1995.95-591,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2450.081,2451.173,"--Yes, that's correct."
1995.95-591,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2451.173,2461.662,And so I'm not certain that those cases really are contrary to Thames & Mersey if you look at Thames & Mersey as a case where the incidence of the tax fell directly on the export.
1995.95-591,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2461.662,2464.883,"I think that they are, though, if you look at the cases in combination."
1995.95-591,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2472.157,2486.106,"Yes, but the tax in Washington Stevedores was on the service, and thus wasn't directly related to the value of the good, and it's therefore a tax on the service, not on the good, and here the ""big if"" clause that I said before means we have to assume it's a tax on the good."
1995.95-591,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2486.106,2488.618,"--And I believe it's... excuse me, Your Honor."
1995.95-591,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2495.561,2500.174,"Yes, I agree that we're foreclosed on that, because you conceded it, according to your opponents."
1995.95-591,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2500.174,2506.95,--In don't believe you're foreclosed from... by our concession from addressing that issue as you see fit.
1995.95-591,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2534.468,2544.844,"Well, Thames & Mersey was decided in 1915, and I don't see any great trouble having resulted between then and now in applying the Export Clause."
1995.95-591,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2544.844,2558.134,"Well, there have been very few cases since Spalding simply because the effect of the Export Clause is so draconian, and it is this case that we have chosen to ask the Court to review its thinking in this area, and to bring it in line with the Import-Export Clause."
1995.95-591,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2558.134,2577.367,"Well, once again, Mr. Minear, as I think we established earlier, you will enable us to avoid that question usually, at most, because we can decide the question simply on the basis that the tax is not discriminatory, but where it is discriminatory we are going to have to address this same question anyway."
1995.95-591,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2580.459,2589.816,"But that's not an unusual problem, that the taxpayer will bear the burden of showing that a tax that appears to be fair on its face is discriminatory in a particular context, and--"
1995.95-591,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2589.816,2604.336,"No, but once you decide it's discriminatory, you are then going to have to decide whether it is laid upon the process of export, so that, you know, that difficulty that you're now addressing, it isn't eliminated from our jurisprudence entirely."
1995.95-591,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2607.278,2610.78,"--That's right, but the same thing was true with regard to the Import-Export Clause."
1995.95-591,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2631.593,2632.426,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
