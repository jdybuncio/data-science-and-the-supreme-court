2017.16-1466,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.36,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 16-1466, Janus versus the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees. Mr. Messenger."
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,11.36,22.2,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Abood should be overruled because it failed to apply heightened First Amendment scrutiny to a compulsory fee for speech to influence governmental policies."
2017.16-1466,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,38.36,55.8,"May I ask, Mr. Messenger, if you are right about agency fees, what about three things: One is student activities fees."
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,77.4,78.08,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,120.72,179.04,"I'm sorry, I thought that we had always recognized that the government as employer had a compelling interest in regulating its employment decisions. We permit the government to fire people, deprive them of all money, not just a fair share fee, but deprive them of any income if they speak outside of the government's approved policy messages or messages generally. So, if we can permit the government as employer to have a compelling interest to do something as dramatic as firing someone, why can't that interest in having workplace peace, workplace routine in which issues are decided in a -- in a collective way, why isn't that a compelling interest comparable to the others?"
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,179.04,184.16,"Well, the government's interests in restricting speech don't apply to compelling support for speech."
2017.16-1466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,204.6,230.32,"But that's no different than forcing student -- student participation in fees to provide a public forum, to have a bar association regulated. These are all forcing the subsidization of private interests for a government purpose. And the government purpose here is labor relations and labor peace."
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,235.36,236.52,"Well, irrespective of whether --"
2017.16-1466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,236.52,237.92,Or -- I shouldn't say state.
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,240.4,262.68,"Yes, Your Honor. The Court doesn't need to reach whether or not labor peace into that -- such interests are compelling because agency fees are not a least restrictive means to satisfy any labor peace interest the government may have in listening to one union. So the labor peace interest, as this Court has explained in Abood, is the government's interest in listening only to one union so it doesn't have to listen to multiple unions."
2017.16-1466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,262.68,265.44,"Well, there's another way of doing student fees."
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,303.92,306.8,"Well, an agency fee isn't necessary for exclusive representation."
2017.16-1466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,306.8,309.48,Why not? You have free riding.
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,309.48,314.64,"Well, the reason, Your Honor, is exclusive representation in and of itself is a valuable benefit for a union."
2017.16-1466,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,321.92,330.48,But it drains it of resources that make it an equal partner in the marketing setting.
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,363.84,373.12,"Well, I think there's two things in that question, Your Honor. The first, the question is, does the duty to represent nonmembers raise union bargaining costs? And I submit that it does not."
2017.16-1466,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,396.72,398.2,But you're not taking into account what I --
2017.16-1466,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,398.2,398.88,Have the unions --
2017.16-1466,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,398.88,422.08,"-- I suggested, that it's not just the people who oppose the union but the people who support the union but say we have a chance to get out of paying fees to the union, and so, although not for idealogical reasons, we're going to pass and we're not going to pay dues either."
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,422.08,426.76,"Well, I submit, Your Honor, it's immaterial why an individual does not wish to support union advocacy."
2017.16-1466,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,431.2,443.44,So you're saying that you do then recognize that the unions can be in a position where they will be -- that the resources available to them could be substantially diminished?
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,443.44,454.44,"Well, to -- to the degree to which the union resources are diminished by individuals exercising their First Amendment right not to subsidize that union, I submit that's a perfectly acceptable result."
2017.16-1466,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,454.92,474.64,"Does -- does the Constitution require states to demand that unions provide services for nonmembers? For example, is there a constitutional requirement for a union to handle the grievances of nonmembers, or is that something that's imposed by state law?"
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,474.64,478.8,"It varies, Your Honor. In the federal law, this Court implied the duty of --"
2017.16-1466,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,478.8,480.84,"Well, no, we're talking about state law."
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,480.84,481.56,Yes.
2017.16-1466,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,487.2,488.36,"Yeah, I understand that."
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,490.52,492.12,"No, Your Honor."
2017.16-1466,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,492.12,503.24,"With reference to some of the other cases they've discussed, have the unions at any point in this litigation or any point in their history ever said that they're committed to the -- to the idea of viewpoint neutrality?"
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,503.24,505.84,"No, Your Honor."
2017.16-1466,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,505.84,520.56,"I wonder, since your time is limited, let me say three -- three quick questions. What you're doing basically is trying to apply a more modern framework to some older cases."
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,621.52,622.04,Yes.
2017.16-1466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,704.4,718.56,Is it just the collective nature of the union? You're not suggesting that if an employee goes to the state and tries to negotiate his or her wages that that's a First Amendment activity.
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,719.72,720.6,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,720.6,727.08,"That employment-related issues are not entitled to First Amendment protection, correct?"
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,727.08,728.2,"Yes, Your Honor, generally speaking."
2017.16-1466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,728.2,742.72,"So, if an employee is disciplined by the state for some malfeasance, that's an employment-related issue not entitled to First Amendment protection?"
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,742.72,743.72,Oftentimes.
2017.16-1466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,743.72,744.92,Oftentimes.
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,753.4,754.56,"Generally, yes."
2017.16-1466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,754.56,782.6,So why does it transform into some entitlement to First Amendment protection merely because a collective body of employees are coming to the table at once? What -- what's the transformative nature now of making these substantive questions matters of public policy?
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,782.6,785.8,"As this Court recognized in Harris, it's the scale."
2017.16-1466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,795.96,823.72,"It's not going to change whether the union asks for it or the employees come -- what you're now saying is if the employees came into an auditorium at a business site of the state and every one of them got up and said, I want higher wages, the scale of that demand makes it protected by the First Amendment? It's still a work-related demand."
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,823.72,832.36,"Well, in that hypothetical, it would arguably be a matter of public concern if there was a stage-in, you know, at a public auditorium in which employees stood up."
2017.16-1466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,832.36,834.36,"Well, let's -- let's not -- don't put in facts."
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,855.6,859.64,I would submit that it starts to move towards a matter of public policy if it isn't entirely.
2017.16-1466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,859.64,861.88,"So it's now scale, not subject?"
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,861.88,863.88,"Well, it's both scale and subject."
2017.16-1466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,874.96,875.12,Scale --
2017.16-1466,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,875.12,890.44,"Mr. Messenger, may I ask you about reliance interests here? I don't think that we have ever overruled a case where reliance interests are remotely as strong as they are here. So just a few things to put on the table."
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,933.32,943.04,"Well, I'd say two things, Justice Kagan. The first is that the prevalence of these compulsory unionism provisions isn't reason for retaining Abood; it's reason for reversing Abood."
2017.16-1466,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,946.68,950.04,But that would be to flip our usual stare decisis doctrine.
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,957.6,959.44,Reliance on something that's constitutional.
2017.16-1466,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,988.08,992.28,"Well, why is that? How many of these contracts have severability clauses, do you know?"
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,992.28,1003.08,"I couldn't find a number for the public sector, Your Honor, but the general -- most contracts at least I have seen for anecdotal do have severability clauses and the general rule under the Restatement of Contracts, I think it's 184."
2017.16-1466,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1003.08,1005.32,California says the opposite.
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1007.52,1008.52,"Of course, yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1466,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1008.52,1010.08,So what's the answer to that?
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1010.08,1019.2,"The answer, Your Honor, is that I submit they're severable in California because they're not an essential provision of the contract that would require the excision of anything more than the clause."
2017.16-1466,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1019.2,1023.4,"Of course, even if that's true, presumably they're bargained-for provisions."
2017.16-1466,0,45468,william_l_messenger,,1041.32,1044.92,"Well, I don't think that's necessarily always true as a legal matter."
2017.16-1466,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1074.0,1085.52,"Thank you, counsel. General Francisco."
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1085.52,1091.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to focus on three basic issues."
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1117.24,1120.44,We also have more benefits that are given without unions.
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1120.44,1122.32,"Not in the Postal Service, Your Honor."
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1122.96,1143.28,"Well, that may be a different one, but doesn't that beg the question, Mr. General, about not having a record here? There's an awful lot of assumptions that have been bandied back and forth by both sides on the actual effects of this."
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1154.88,1155.0,Right.
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1155.0,1157.32,-- of things that have not been tested anywhere.
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1157.32,1157.6,Right.
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1193.84,1194.24,How much of the workplace --
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1194.24,1196.48,That's according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1196.48,1200.24,How much of the workplace is unionized for the federal government?
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1200.24,1207.08,"I believe that in the federal government generally, about a quarter of the workplace, a quarter to a third of the workplace is unionized."
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1207.08,1213.6,And how much is their unionization in the general corporate sector?
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1213.6,1214.24,I think --
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1214.24,1216.16,Or private sector?
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1216.16,1218.48,My -- I -- I don't know for sure.
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1224.84,1229.96,"In the mechanical industry, in the printing industry, in -- I know a lot of industries --"
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1229.96,1230.24,Yeah.
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1230.24,1232.24,-- that are controlled by union.
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1232.24,1233.28,I don't have that number.
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1233.28,1234.76,I don't mean that in a negative sense.
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1234.76,1234.88,"No, no."
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1234.88,1237.52,Meaning that almost all work --
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1237.52,1239.84,"And I -- and I don't have that number at the top of my head, Your Honor."
2017.16-1466,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1239.84,1241.76,You -- you were trying to get to two other points.
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1241.76,1242.08,Yes.
2017.16-1466,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1291.24,1318.6,"General Francisco, I would like to get your answer to the question I asked Mr. Messenger and didn't have time to ask him a follow-up. Let's say you prevail in this case. What happens in the private sector? We have a doctrine you know well, Shelley against Kraemer, that says if a contract is illegal, the court can't enforce it."
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1318.6,1338.04,"Uh-huh. Respectfully, Your Honor, I don't think anything would happen in the private sector for largely the reasons that Justice Alito identified in his Third Circuit opinion on the issue and the D.C. Circuit identified in an opinion that I -- I believe you were part of, which held that in the private sector, there simply is no state action when it comes to collective bargaining agreements."
2017.16-1466,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1338.04,1338.2,"Look, the --"
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1338.2,1342.88,That's also what the United States argued in its Beck amicus brief here a few -- a few years ago.
2017.16-1466,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1342.88,1357.48,"Labor peace, I once heard Archie Cox, maybe it was in your position right here, say the greatest instrument for labor peace and prosperity from the years 1945 to 1970 was grievance arbitration in the unions."
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1357.48,1358.04,Uh-huh.
2017.16-1466,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1358.04,1360.8,So suddenly we're changing the method of financing that.
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1371.28,1371.48,Uh-huh.
2017.16-1466,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1371.48,1373.56,And not all workers are lawyers.
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1390.44,1392.32,Right.
2017.16-1466,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1392.32,1396.04,Now you are the government of the United States.
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1397.32,1409.2,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the core of this issue goes to -- and I'm reading from the agency brief -- the agency fee provision itself, the cost of the collective bargaining process. And that's separate from the grievance process."
2017.16-1466,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1422.44,1423.88,Please.
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1423.88,1432.88,"-- since the whole idea of agency fees, their justification and their purpose, has been predicated on the need to compel support for the collective bargaining process."
2017.16-1466,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1432.88,1469.64,"General, an important part of Mr. Messenger's argument is the idea that all speech about employment conditions, about pay, about vacation, you know, about all of the various employee benefits that -- that are subjects of collective bargaining, that are really the heart of collective bargaining, that all speech about that is -- are matters of public concern when it happens in the public workplace because they all cost money and, as taxpayers, we would be interested in things that cost money."
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1474.72,1487.52,"Yes, Your Honor. I think in the public bargaining context, all of it goes to the size, structure, cost of government, and the delivery of public services, although I would agree that there are some things that more vividly implicate public policy than others."
2017.16-1466,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1487.52,1504.2,"Can I ask -- it strikes me as a very unusual position for the government to be taking, looking after the long-term interests of the United States government, because essentially what that means is that you will have to litigate all employee/employer disputes under the --"
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1504.2,1504.84,Yeah.
2017.16-1466,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1504.84,1509.08,-- second step of Pickering rather than under the first --
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1509.08,1509.12,Well --
2017.16-1466,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1509.12,1514.28,-- which is quite a striking thing for the government to be saying that it agrees with.
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1514.28,1514.76,Yeah.
2017.16-1466,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1535.44,1550.88,"So you're saying that when a union collectively bargains, it's a matter of public concern but that if employees in their workplace, 10 or 20 of them, get together without the formal collective bargaining that a union does, that that's not a matter of public concern?"
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1550.88,1573.0,"Very much so, Your Honor, because when an individual employee is negotiating with his employer over his particular wage, that's a negotiation that's taking place between the employee and the employer. In the public sector collective bargaining context, it's taking place between a private third-party organization, a union, and the government in order to set the overall size, scope, and structure of government."
2017.16-1466,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1573.0,1582.56,"Well, that union is a representative of the employees and has been chosen to represent the employees so that the employees can better wield their power --"
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1582.56,1582.92,Right.

2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1592.88,1593.12,Yeah.
2017.16-1466,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1593.12,1597.04,-- for the government to be saying that these were matters of public concern.
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1615.4,1618.56,And I think it matters for two reasons: One is the scope of the issue.
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1629.44,1629.64,I'm sorry.
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1629.64,1630.28,And that's the --
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1630.28,1655.6,"If we're going to get into scope under the Pickering test, then the employee who, contrary to the chain of command, talks about rampant corruption in a government agency, then we're not going to permit, as we already have, that employee to be fired because the scope of that affects the public fisc in a huge way."
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1655.6,1657.0,"I very much disagree with that, Your Honor."
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1657.0,1659.24,I -- I -- I don't understand what you're arguing.
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1662.52,1663.48,I don't -- I don't think --
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1663.48,1670.52,"Mr. -- Mr. General, by the way, how many times this term already have you flipped positions from prior administrations?"
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1670.52,1671.6,"Your Honor, I believe --"
2017.16-1466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1671.6,1674.28,This may be -- how many?
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1674.28,1679.44,"Your Honor, I think that we have revised the position in so far three cases."
2017.16-1466,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1679.44,1682.92,"That's fair. Regardless, what is -- what is the answer to Justice Kagan's question?"
2017.16-1466,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1682.92,1682.96,Yeah.
2017.16-1466,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1711.0,1722.8,"Thank you, General. Mr. Franklin."
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,1722.8,1763.08,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court's cases uniformly recognize that the state has a much freer hand when it manages its personnel as an employer than when it regulates its citizens as a sovereign, and this has come up already today, that freer hand includes broad authority to put conditions on employees' speech. Now my friends on the other side this morning argue that that deference to the employer's prerogatives somehow depends on the scale or the scope of the speech in question. That has never been the law. The government is still acting as an employer when it treats with its employees as a group or as a whole."
2017.16-1466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1784.48,1786.48,Garcetti involved government speech.
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,1797.68,1799.56,"I'm happy to speak to that, Justice Kennedy."
2017.16-1466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1829.6,1846.24,Suppose that -- suppose that 80 percent of the fees of the union dues went to matters that were highly political in nature and 20 percent to wage and grievance -- wage hour -- wage negotiations and grievances.
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,1848.76,1851.08,"I -- I don't know that it would, Your Honor."
2017.16-1466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1856.2,1859.04,Then -- then it seems -- then it seems to me your argument doesn't have much weight.
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,1859.04,1864.52,"Well, first of all, we don't know what percentage of the union's activities are wrapped up with grievances."
2017.16-1466,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1913.84,1920.36,"There are -- there are numerous differences between Pickering and the situation here, but let me just ask you about one."
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,1935.52,1941.96,"If the -- if what the state wants them to say is a function of their official duties in the workplace, that's Garcetti --"
2017.16-1466,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1941.96,1944.04,"No, if it's not a function of their official duties."
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,1954.2,1955.6,"No, my boss is right behind me."
2017.16-1466,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1955.6,1956.44,That's right. (Laughter.)
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,1956.44,1958.6,"I -- I -- I -- I'm acting pursuant to official duties, Your Honor."
2017.16-1466,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1958.6,1959.0,I know.
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,1960.36,1960.52,Right.
2017.16-1466,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1961.48,1965.76,"But aside from your official duties, are there any limitations?"
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,1965.76,1966.88,Yes.
2017.16-1466,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1966.88,1967.8,What are they?
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,1967.8,1991.68,"What the Garcetti case underlines is that when the state takes the employment relationship and exploits or leverages that relationship in such a way as to have an effect on the broader marketplace of citizen speech, so that the employer interest is really pretextual, then we're --- we've got a different story. Pickering accounts for this, Justice Alito."
2017.16-1466,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1991.68,1993.92,"Well, let me ask you, I'll give you a concrete situation."
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2028.44,2031.96,It would -- I'll answer your question.
2017.16-1466,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2043.92,2049.44,"No, the Court said that that was a matter of -- that was a -- that was a subject of private concern."
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2049.44,2059.04,"Well, it's possible that if you've got an Orwellian scenario where the employee is being required in the workplace to speak about matters of public concern, we would get to step 2."
2017.16-1466,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2059.04,2060.36,Private concern. Private concern.
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2060.36,2062.0,What we wouldn't get to is strict scrutiny then.
2017.16-1466,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2108.8,2163.76,"Well, then why won't you answer my question about what the assistant district attorney could be required to do? Throughout history, many people have drawn a line between a restriction on their speech and compelled speech. I'll give you an example that's only -- that's quite different given the nature of the -- of the subject from what's involved here. Do you remember the -- the -- the movie and the play ""A Man For All Seasons""? So Thomas Moore didn't insist on saying that he thought the act of supremacy was wrong, but he drew a line and paid for it with his life because he would not affirmatively say that it was wrong. When you compel somebody to speak, don't you infringe that person's dignity and conscience in a way that you do not when you restrict what the person says?"
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2163.76,2166.4,"You do, Your Honor, in some circumstances."
2017.16-1466,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2188.48,2190.72,"No, they're not a -- it's not ""A Man for All Seasons"" scenario."
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2190.72,2191.08,Right.
2017.16-1466,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2191.08,2198.8,But I'm just asking you about the point whether you think that compelling somebody to speak is exactly the same thing as saying you may not speak?
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2198.8,2201.0,"No, it's not exactly the same, Your Honor."
2017.16-1466,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2201.0,2201.12,No.
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2201.12,2204.88,The Pickering balance could come out differently in certain instances.
2017.16-1466,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2220.12,2230.8,"Counsel, what is there -- what is there about compelled speech? I mean, our line has drawn a big difference between compelled speech and compelled subsidy."
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2230.8,2232.4,"I agree with that, Justice Sotomayor."
2017.16-1466,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2234.36,2246.56,And -- and we've compelled people to pay bar associations so long as you're not compelled or stopped from speaking when you disagree.
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2249.4,2249.56,And all --
2017.16-1466,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2249.56,2257.48,Bar members can come out any day they want and say they don't take the same position on a policy question as the bar association.
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2267.24,2267.76,Correct.
2017.16-1466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2346.96,2370.68,"It can be a partner with you in advocating for a greater size workforce, against privatization, against merit promotion, against -- for teacher tenure, for higher wages, for massive government, for increasing bonded indebtedness, for increasing taxes? That's -- that's the interest the state has?"
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2370.68,2371.48,No.
2017.16-1466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2378.28,2381.96,Doesn't it -- doesn't it -- doesn't it blink reality to deny that that is what's happening here?
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2381.96,2393.88,"We -- with all due respect, Justice Kennedy, we've never denied that many of the topics that come up at the bargaining table with public employee unions have serious fiscal and public policy implications."
2017.16-1466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2395.36,2395.88,All right.
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2398.16,2442.92,"The -- the line that Justice Scalia drew in his Lehnert separate opinion was, in our view, superior to the one that was drawn by the plurality. We've offered a test for where to draw the line between chargeable and non-chargeable expenses that, in practice, would overlap with, would coincide with, Justice Scalia's line in most cases, but the reason that we think that it's superior to the plurality's line is that the germaneness test does have a vagueness problem and in -- in some instances, it allows what it shouldn't allow, which is, for chargeability, for speech to the government as a sovereign."
2017.16-1466,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2446.12,2480.2,"Mr. -- Mr. Franklin, Mr. Messenger has suggested, and -- and -- and General Francisco, that if we overruled Abood, things would in a few years get back to normal. The state would pass a new statute, and these municipal contracts would all be renegotiated, and it wouldn't be any real issue. So could you -- what do you think about that? What would the difficulties be, if any, if the state -- if -- if the Court were to overrule Abood?"
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2480.2,2482.12,"I'm happy to speak to that, Justice Kagan."
2017.16-1466,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2520.2,2533.16,"Well, the argument on the other side, of course, is that the need to attract voluntary payments will make the unions more efficient, more effective, more attractive to a broader group of their employees."
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2534.72,2537.68,"Well, two things that -- that I would say about that."

2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2631.48,2633.32,Mr. Chief Justice --
2017.16-1466,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2633.32,2633.72,Please.
2017.16-1466,2,62885,david_l_franklin,,2633.72,2638.32,-- may I respond? We do think the reliance interests are serious here.
2017.16-1466,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2654.64,2664.64,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick."
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,2664.64,2676.24,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would note at the beginning that all of these arguments were before the Court 40 years ago in Abood."
2017.16-1466,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2751.12,2760.76,And what if the statute -- what if the state statute says that lobbying is a man -- is a mandatory subject of bargaining?
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,2760.76,2768.52,"Well, I -- I think that the question -- I guess, what do you mean by lobbying, Justice Alito? I'm not sure exactly what you mean."
2017.16-1466,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2768.52,2783.04,"Well, there's no -- is there any limit on what states can make a mandatory subject of collective bargaining? So if the test is whether it's -- whether the -- it's mandated by the -- by the state, the state can make anything it wants a mandatory subject of bargaining."
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,2783.04,2809.84,"Justice Alito, I would say that that hypothetical is so far outside of what this case is really all about that if you think that there's a problem, that if any state ever in the union would come up with some requirement like that as part of collective bargaining, you have the opportunity to review it at this time. But what we're talking about here is a system that is well-settled within the states to allow for this kind of dynamic interchange for the benefit of management."
2017.16-1466,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2809.84,2814.24,"Well, do you think that this case affects the political influence of the unions?"
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,2814.24,2814.92,No.
2017.16-1466,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2815.8,2827.52,"So you've -- I can try to find a union newsletter which says don't worry about the Supreme Court, our political influence will be exactly the same as it was before, if this case comes out against us?"
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,2827.52,2830.64,"That's not a chargeable expense, Justice Kennedy."
2017.16-1466,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2831.44,2831.76,I'm asking --
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,2831.76,2832.2,-- chargeable --
2017.16-1466,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2832.2,2842.76,"I'm asking you whether or not in your view, if you do not prevail in this case, the unions will have less political influence; yes or no?"
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,2842.76,2844.96,"Yes, they will have less political influence and --"
2017.16-1466,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2844.96,2846.52,Isn't that the end of this case?
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,2846.52,2851.08,"It is not the end of the case, Your Honor, because that is not the question."
2017.16-1466,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2868.84,2878.72,And in which they mandate people that object to certain union policies to pay for the implementation of those policies against their First Amendment interests?
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,2878.72,2887.0,"Justice Kennedy, I would ask you to read Justice Harlan's opinion in Lathrop where he addressed every single one of those considerations."

2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,2891.92,2925.88,"It's a wonderful -- it's a wonderful opinion, because what he says is that the -- what he says is that the subsidization goes to the purpose of the organization, here that is state-mandated collective bargaining, and in which the person who doesn't agree with the positions basically gets two cracks. One is to try to persuade the group that he's right and, if that doesn't fail, he still has his conscience and his speech to speak outside as a citizen to explain why that position is wrong."
2017.16-1466,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2925.88,2927.0,Is -- is it possible to --
2017.16-1466,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2927.0,2949.52,"Mr. Frederick, I -- when I -- when I read your brief, I saw something I thought I would never see in a brief filed by a public employee union, and that is the argument that the original meaning of the Constitution is that public employees have no free speech rights. Where do you want us to go with that?"
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,2949.52,2949.76,Well --
2017.16-1466,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2949.76,2951.0,Should -- should we adopt that rule?
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,2951.0,3004.96,"-- what I would say is that what this Court, Justice White's opinion in Connick, explains that if you look at this from a question of what are the three choices before you, at the origins, there were no rights. What they are asking for is basically unfettered First Amendment for public servants, and what Justice White explained was that, as the First Amendment evolved, there were limitations on what the government could do with respect to certain expression, but the core principle, from the founding to today, is that government has a free rein in regulating expressive rights in its workplace. That principle from the founding to today is at stake here because what they are saying is that every grievance, every employment issue, becomes a constitutional issue."
2017.16-1466,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3010.56,3013.6,Do you think that's a fair characterization of their argument?
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3013.6,3026.32,I do think that it is a fair characterization insofar as what they say is the collective bargaining issues that are in the contract are all raising matters of public concern. You could look at them.
2017.16-1466,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3043.16,3044.0,If I understood --
2017.16-1466,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3044.0,3055.68,"Can you do that? Can you limit it to wages, hours, working conditions, where mandated as subjects of compulsory bargaining by the state, those three terms have a hundred years of history written around them."
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3060.48,3061.04,That's correct.
2017.16-1466,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3062.12,3063.36,Is that correct? Is that what you favor?
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3063.36,3064.44,"Yes, it is."
2017.16-1466,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3064.76,3071.64,"And can we get that from the Connick -- from the Connick -- from the Lehnert Kennedy, Scalia compromise there?"

2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3088.96,3091.28,-- is how you manage the workplace.
2017.16-1466,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3091.28,3097.4,How do negotiation over wages not affect the state budget?
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3097.4,3113.28,"Your Honor, what essentially happens as I understand it is that either the budget is set and the negotiation occurs within that parameter, or the Governor takes the collective bargaining agreement to the state and the legislature decides to either ratify it or not."
2017.16-1466,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3113.28,3122.36,So the public unions do not engage in advocacy with respect to the state budget to the extent that impacts the available wages?
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3122.36,3124.0,I think -- I wouldn't put it quite that way.
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3132.44,3141.12,"And the question is -- the question is, how do you come to the appropriate compromises in order to achieve a system that attracts the best workers?"
2017.16-1466,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3141.12,3158.6,"I just want to make sure that if I want to write something down to get -- the amount of wages paid to government employees, the size of the workforce, the amount of overtime, and the existence of tenure do not affect the amount of the state budget? That's what I've got down."
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3158.6,3158.8,No.
2017.16-1466,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3160.04,3161.08,Isn't that what you just said?
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3161.08,3179.64,"What I said is that in different states the system works differently. Sometimes the budget is set first and then the bargaining happens, and sometimes the bargaining happens and, if the legislature doesn't think it fits within the budget, they say we're not going to ratify this or we're going to ratify the budget, you go back and renegotiate this to make it fit."
2017.16-1466,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3179.64,3205.0,"Mr. Frederick, if I understood General Francisco's argument, it's that speech as to matters of pay and benefits and employment conditions and so forth are matters of public concern when they are addressed in a collective bargaining framework but are not matters of public concern when they are addressed outside of a collective bargaining framework by individual employees. Tell -- tell me about that."
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3207.08,3224.92,"I don't know any case of this Court that hinges the First Amendment prerogatives of the government on the scope or manner of the speech with respect to that. And, in fact, as my colleague said, when this Court upheld the Hatch Act, that applied to all workers."
2017.16-1466,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3252.12,3259.0,"Well, if one employee says I deserve a 5 percent raise, is that a matter of public concern or private concern?"
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3259.0,3280.68,"Well, it depends on whether it affects the morale of the workplace, as Justice White's opinion in Connick said. There may be a circumstance, you look at the balancing, and you look at the content and the context in which that speech arises. So that, for instance, in Connick, what the Court said, the only thing that was a matter of public concern there was whether it affected the morale of the workplace."
2017.16-1466,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3293.96,3294.24,All right.
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3307.92,3308.76,I don't think so because --
2017.16-1466,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3308.76,3309.8,It can't? No?
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3309.8,3329.32,"No, because what the -- what is happening in a negotiation, of course, this is a closed universe, your hypothetical posits the opening bid by the union. And -- and it's important to keep in mind the content and context of that speech. All negotiations between workers and management do not take place in a public forum."
2017.16-1466,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3329.32,3338.8,So what -- what if the effect of the 5 percent wage increase across the board would push a city to the brink and perhaps over the brink into bankruptcy.
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3341.48,3346.04,"Well, I think that you would look at that in terms of the context of the particular scenario."
2017.16-1466,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3377.4,3383.24,"So -- so I don't see how you can say, if one person asks for more money, that affects the budget."
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3421.6,3421.92,Yes.
2017.16-1466,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3430.88,3435.2,"Well, hypotheticals are asked to address a principle that can then be expanded."
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3453.88,3486.4,"Your Honor, the question -- I'll -- I'll concede you that there are certain matters in collective bargaining that might raise matters of public concern. But what the Court's cases say is that, even if there is a matter of public concern, the government has the adequate power to restrict that speech if it can show there's justification. And Justice Scalia's opinion in Lehnert provides the compelling interest by saying that the state is mandated that the union be the exclusive representative and must conduct itself through a duty of fair representation."
2017.16-1466,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3489.72,3494.8,"Well, the germaneness rule came out of Abood itself and it was fleshed out in Lehnert."
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3501.24,3501.36,No.
2017.16-1466,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3513.8,3514.4,And didn't Abood talk --
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3514.4,3515.84,-- in a lot of different areas.
2017.16-1466,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3515.84,3519.24,Didn't Abood draw -- talk about germaneness?
2017.16-1466,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3519.24,3521.88,I think Abood used the word germaneness.
2017.16-1466,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3579.36,3582.56,"Thank you, counsel. Two minutes remaining, Mr. Messenger."
2017.16-1466,4,45468,william_l_messenger,,3582.56,3616.52,"Mr. Chief Justice: Just to pick up on the last point made, the proposition that agency fees are the costs that employees have to pay to prevent unions from striking, I submit is not only extremely attenuated but also would make agency fees effectively a form of protection money, the idea that the government needs to force its employees to subsidize unions or otherwise the unions will disrupt the government, and I submit that's not an interest that this Court can accept as a compelling one for infringing on individuals' First Amendment rights. I'd also like to make a brief point about the grievance process."
2017.16-1466,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3642.24,3658.88,"You're basically arguing do away with unions, because you're really taking, in essence, and saying every single employee decision is really a public policy decision. I have an individual person I want to fire or discipline."
2017.16-1466,4,45468,william_l_messenger,,3662.72,3668.6,"No, where I was going with that, Your Honor, is that grievance as a whole is a public -- a matter of public concern."
2017.16-1466,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3668.6,3671.84,But grievances don't deal with one issue.
2017.16-1466,4,45468,william_l_messenger,,3681.92,3684.96,"Yes, Your Honor, but nonmembers --"
2017.16-1466,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3684.96,3688.36,-- violating a dozen other workplace rules.
2017.16-1466,4,45468,william_l_messenger,,3688.36,3692.32,"But under the statute, nonmembers are charged for contract administration an a whole."
2017.16-1466,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3714.16,3714.48,As Justice --
2017.16-1466,4,45468,william_l_messenger,,3714.48,3715.2,That is what --
2017.16-1466,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3715.2,3727.12,"-- Breyer said, every single decision affects the public fisc. Every time you lose something, you -- the public fisc is affected. You're talking --"
2017.16-1466,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3727.12,3729.12,Care to comment?
2017.16-1466,4,45468,william_l_messenger,,3729.12,3733.68,"Again, to go back, I think it's the scale that makes the distinction, Your Honor."
2017.16-1466,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3733.68,3734.68,"Thank you, counsel."
2017.16-1466,4,45468,william_l_messenger,,3734.68,3734.92,Thank you.
2017.16-1466,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3734.92,0.0,The case is submitted.
