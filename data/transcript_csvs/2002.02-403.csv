2002.02-403,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.208,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-403, the Federal Election Commission v. Christine Beaumont."
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,9.488,12.695,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-403,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,96.396,107.741,"Mr. Clement, the Government does... does not challenge the exemption of this not-for-profit corporation from expenditure limitations?"
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,107.741,109.393,"That's right, Justice Scalia."
2002.02-403,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,165.228,175.186,"Do you think after the decision in Massachusetts... the Massachusetts case, the NRWC would have a right to make independent expenditures?"
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,175.186,191.122,"Well, I think it would, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and I think that where I would point to first is your dissent in that case because in that case in your dissent, you made the argument that National Right to Work Committee was essentially the same as Massachusetts Citizens for Life."
2002.02-403,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,313.654,316.31,Why... why is that an attenuated First Amendment right?
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,327.771,334.785,"Well, certainly in... in the first point, parties are subject to a different type of regulation under the campaign finance laws."
2002.02-403,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,335.745,349.107,"Well, it may well be, but... but I... I wouldn't shrug off as inconsequential the importance of individuals being able to band together to support individual candidates."
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,352.157,368.717,"--And... and I don't want to suggest that there's no First Amendment interest on the other side of... of the argument in this case, but what I did mean to suggest is that interest is less significant than the interest in individuals banding together to make expenditures that they might otherwise not be able to make."
2002.02-403,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,641.563,645.693,Can you summarize briefly what the enhanced disclosure requirements are?
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,645.693,647.531,"--Certainly, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
2002.02-403,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,659.262,660.362,You're talking about PACs.
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,660.931,661.9,PACs.
2002.02-403,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,667.338,669.046,And the donor is listed.
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,669.046,670.325,The donor is listed.
2002.02-403,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,696.801,707.59,"Mr. Clement, is this... is this section 441b related or affected in any way by the McCain-Feingold legislation?"
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,707.59,711.463,"--Justice O'Connor, it really isn't, at least as this case comes to this Court."
2002.02-403,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,741.583,744.995,But at least the issue here in this case is unaffected by that.
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,744.995,752.972,--The issue of corporate contributions is miraculously unaffected by the many reforms that are put in place by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.
2002.02-403,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,754.552,756.787,What is the... what is the limitation of the PAC?
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,760.16,764.847,"--A... a political action committee or any segregated fund can give $5,000."
2002.02-403,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,764.847,775.479,"This... this... you're saying that this particular kind of organization can't contribute directly, but it could set up a... what you call a segregated fund, which I was thinking of as a PAC."
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,786.658,788.041,"There is indeed, Justice Breyer."
2002.02-403,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,788.861,790.412,"$5,000."
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,790.412,793.023,And two points of emphasis just on that question.
2002.02-403,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,827.473,828.977,"I mean, could they have two members?"
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,828.977,833.288,I don't know of any particular limit on... on the members.
2002.02-403,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.337,862.5,Well--
2002.02-403,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,862.5,865.927,"--In Massachusetts Citizens for Life, there was a separate PAC?"
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,865.927,867.23,There was.
2002.02-403,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,880.383,897.876,"But the Court did say for that type of... for that type of corporation, not a commercial corporation, that was burdensome and unnecessary because the risk of corruption for that kind of corporation was significantly less than for commercial corporations."
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,913.669,923.266,--I don't want to suggest that the... that it may not be true that the risks are slightly less in the context of a nonprofit advocacy corporation than in the context of something like General Motors.
2002.02-403,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.893,986.439,--That was an assumption in the case.
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,989.849,994.893,"Well, I don't think it's necessarily the holding of the case because, obviously, that case involved expenditures."
2002.02-403,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.455,1029.314,"You think whenever we distinguish a prior case in one of our opinions, that... that distinguishing has stare decisis effect."
2002.02-403,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1029.314,1033.363,I would think that in many respects that's the most important part of the opinion.
2002.02-403,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1126.467,1127.952,"Very well, Mr. Clement."
2002.02-403,1,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1129.79,1134.396,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-403,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1156.358,1157.372,I... I don't understand that.
2002.02-403,1,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1180.552,1186.979,"Well, that's classic quid pro quo corruption which is dealt with by contribution limits, now--"
2002.02-403,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1186.979,1198.05,"Well, I mean, I... it may well be, but I don't see that the distinction between whether it's an economic actor or a political actor has anything to do with whether there's corruption or not."
2002.02-403,1,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1198.05,1223.675,"--Well, there has been some controversy on this Court on... on whether or not the... the decisions of this Court in Mass. Citizens and on Austin were in accordance with the Constitution, but in both cases the Court distinguished between the types of corruption that are entailed by the corporate form, which is the potential for unfair employment of wealth for political purposes."
2002.02-403,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.65,1240.892,"Well, but you can have an immense corporation formed to advance political ideas."
2002.02-403,1,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1245.494,1245.833,Yes.
2002.02-403,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1246.145,1250.342,"--if you attract enough people, you can have an immense organization."
2002.02-403,1,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1259.224,1262.79,--That's right and the size of the organization is not the issue.
2002.02-403,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1272.902,1287.324,"Well, Mr. Bopp, would you say that the AARP, which was referred to by Justice Scalia, the National Right to Work Committee, which was involved in that opinion, and Massachusetts Citizens for Life are all in the same boat?"
2002.02-403,1,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1287.324,1289.072,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2002.02-403,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1290.288,1290.973,Why not?
2002.02-403,1,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1290.973,1302.972,"--Well, the... the Court in Mass. Citizens established some criteria to determine whether or not an organization, a corporation, benefitted from the MCFL exemption."
2002.02-403,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1340.219,1342.933,"Mr. Bopp, on that point I thought that Massachusetts Citizens for Life went further."
2002.02-403,1,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1367.074,1368.583,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-403,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1398.138,1402.65,"Well, would you call AARP an ideological organization?"
2002.02-403,1,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1402.65,1422.521,"I think they have a mixture of political and nonpolitical purposes and are, therefore, more like Austin... the... the Michigan Chamber of Commerce and Austin that had a mixture of political and nonpolitical purposes and therefore did not qualify for the MCFL exemption."
2002.02-403,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1426.884,1429.043,I'll bet the members also get benefits--
2002.02-403,1,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1429.043,1429.917,--Yes.
2002.02-403,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1429.917,1433.149,--and... and that criterion would... would make it different from--
2002.02-403,1,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1433.149,1451.116,There were also incentives that were economic in nature that would cause people to be reluctant to disassociate with Michigan Chamber of Commerce if it... if it proved to be that they disagreed with their political ideas or the advancement of their political ideas.
2002.02-403,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1472.894,1485.152,"--But they could serve as a conduit for a very large donor, a very wealthy person, who wants to avoid the personal limitations on how much that individual could give."
2002.02-403,1,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1485.152,1491.4,"Well, it is true that there are no contribution limits to not-for-profit corporations."
2002.02-403,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1635.903,1639.557,What you do then... this is what I understand you to be saying.
2002.02-403,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2783.829,2787.151,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-403,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2929.785,2938.106,"Have we actually held, Mr. Clement, that in regulating contributions, the Government must find the least restrictive means?"
2002.02-403,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2938.106,2939.489,"No, and to the contrary."
2002.02-403,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3082.698,3083.819,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
