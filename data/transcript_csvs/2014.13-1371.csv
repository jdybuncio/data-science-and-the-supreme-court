2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,11.508,16.351,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,48.116,61.331,"At the time of Smith and Griggs, neither the Title VII nor the ADEA used the words ""disparate impact"", and yet we recognize they apply disparate impact."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,61.331,68.998,"--At the time, disparate -- the words ""disparate impact"" were not used; however, the words ""adversely affect"" were used."
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,77.854,80.011,"You have a problem, because it says"
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,94.676,101.688,"Justice Sotomayor, the -- the phrase ""make unavailable"" is an act prohibited by the Fair Housing Act."
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,102.312,102.858,Consequence.
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,110.073,117.509,--The act of making unavailable a dwelling to a person is the act prohibited by the Fair Housing Act.
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,154.351,157.335,"Of course, you could say the same thing about ""adversely affect""."
2014.13-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,169.517,171.483,On the basis of--
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,171.483,178.997,"So, you know, I -- the points you make are -- are true enough, but they were also true with -- with respect to Title VII, weren't they?"
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,178.997,181.075,"--Justice Scalia, I don't believe so."
2014.13-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,202.519,207.858,"--But after that language is the phrase ""on the basis of"", race, sex, whatever."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,217.248,223.806,"Well, and that was the interpretation that the Smith plurality and concurrence came to on Section 4(a)(2)."
2014.13-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,238.894,249.419,"Do -- do we take into account at all that in both Title VII and the Fair Housing Act, there was a grand goal that Congress had in mind?"
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,287.155,290.575,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, the Court needs to focus on the plain text."
2014.13-1371,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,323.094,335.384,"But if I could understand your point, General Keller, you agree with Justice Scalia that ""make unavailable"", it's -- like ""adversely affects"", they're -- they're both verbs."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,361.713,363.777,"I do, Justice Kagan."
2014.13-1371,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,363.777,364.729,Okay.
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,400.978,403.614,"Justice Kagan, I don't think it's saying the same thing."
2014.13-1371,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,426.902,435.945,"No, but the -- but the thing that's different in this statute is the ""make unavailable"", which focuses on an effect in the same way that the ""adversely affect"" language does."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,442.348,444.208,It doesn't focus on the effects.
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.972,483.439,"Make -- ""make unavailable"" is not the same language as ""adversely affect""."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,536.087,537.837,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.837,540.898,"Well, why doesn't that -- why doesn't that kill your case?"
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,576.774,592.158,"Justice Scalia, the 1988 amendments, in enacting three exceptions from liability, those provisions merely restricted liability, and the Court rejected a virtually identical argument to what the Respondent and the Solicitor General are making in O'Gilvie v. United States."
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.266,596.03,Is this in your brief?
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,596.03,597.656,The case was not cited in our brief.
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,597.656,598.452,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,598.452,600.53,At Page 89 of that decision--
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.53,600.982,Yeah.
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,600.982,611.866,"--the Court noted that Congress might simply have wanted to clarify the matter in respect to the narrow exemption, but it wanted to leave the law where it found it in respect to the broader issue."
2014.13-1371,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,611.866,623.72,"But the law where it found it here was very clear, because ten circuits had gone the other way and had said that disparate impact was a valid action under the FHA."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,641.807,645.351,"Justice Kagan, in 1988 the state of the law was in flux."
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,667.638,669.841,"How do you put ""adversely affect""?"
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,679.866,680.88,--Otherwise--
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,680.88,688.691,"I mean, it's a little crazy, don't you think, because otherwise adversely affecting someone by making it unavailable."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,691.783,693.016,"--Well, otherwise it could have--"
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,693.016,694.716,--is the short form of that.
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,694.716,700.666,--Or otherwise limit housing opportunities in a way that would adversely affect.
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,703.809,724.832,"But instead what it did, it took a body of law, some of which had held some practices as disparately -- improperly disparately impacting, like drug addiction and others -- and two others, and said, no, those two won't count, those three won't count."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,729.141,736.089,"Well, they were absolutely doing work in 1988, and Congress could take account of the fact the Court--"
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,736.089,743.651,"Well, what do you make of in 1988 where someone wanted to do away with disparate impact and Congress didn't take up that invitation?"
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,743.651,747.866,"--Justice Sotomayor, I believe you're referring to Representative Swindall's amendment."
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,755.204,775.041,"But what -- you're -- you're telling us that these amendments which said that certain types of effects will not qualify, that the purpose of that amendment was to prevent erroneous court of appeals' decisions from affecting those particular areas?"
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,775.041,776.929,"Justice Scalia, that's part of the work that they're doing."
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,776.929,787.146,"That's a very strange thing for Congress to do, to believe that those court of opinions -- court of appeals' opinions are wrong and yet to -- to enact these exemptions."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,793.752,804.857,"Well, in 1988, when Congress was legislating, it agreed on one thing, and that was in these three narrow circumstances, liability would be restricted under the Fair Housing Act."
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,815.023,815.772,Exactly.
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,829.737,838.342,"In the brief that the Solicitor General filed in 1988, it made the point, which is absolutely the same today, which is Congress knows how to enact an effect test."
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,838.342,840.296,"It changed when -- no, no, no."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,871.344,874.281,"It -- it was before the 1988 amendments, that's right."
2014.13-1371,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,887.024,903.298,"Well, General, I thought your argument on the 1988 amendments was as follows: Either the -- the Fair Housing Act contemplated disparate-impact analysis when it was adopted in, when was it, 1968 or it didn't."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,930.254,932.036,"--Precisely, Justice Alito."
2014.13-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,933.425,949.323,"But If we're going to be realistic about this, in 1964, when the Civil Rights Act passed, and in 1968, when the Fair Housing Act passed, nobody knew anything about disparate impact."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,973.203,980.948,"--The Court has to construe the plain text of the statute that Congress enacted, and the text in 1964 did not use effects--"
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,980.948,982.102,It has to--
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,982.102,982.127,--Sorry.
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.127,993.052,"--It has to construe the plain text of the law, and the law consists not just of what Congress did in 1968, but also what it did in '88."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1034.676,1038.143,The 1988 amendments don't refer to disparate impact.
2014.13-1371,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1043.891,1045.014,"Of course not, but--"
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1045.014,1047.311,But they make no sense unless there is such a thing as disparate impact.
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1055.978,1058.396,They could do more work.
2014.13-1371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1085.809,1089.525,"So you have an argument, and so does the other side have an argument."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1152.527,1156.079,If you were to believe the statute's ambiguous--
2014.13-1371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1156.079,1157.245,"Oh, well, I don't think."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1171.078,1177.482,"--In 1988, the amendments didn't touch the text of the 1968 Fair Housing Act--"
2014.13-1371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1177.482,1177.688,"No, no."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1181.233,1181.545,--Sure.
2014.13-1371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1181.545,1195.867,"Which is the question that it's been the law for 40 years of just a little bit less, disaster has not occurred, and why when something is so well established throughout the United States should this Court come in and change it."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1195.867,1199.068,There is a serious equal protection question lurking here.
2014.13-1371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1212.499,1215.891,"You don't like the way it was applied, and I can understand that."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1265.318,1266.554,--Sure.
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1283.516,1285.201,Maybe I'm missing something here.
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1285.201,1285.466,How--
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1285.466,1288.434,Didn't this Court decide Marbury v. Madison?
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1288.434,1290.59,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-1371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1290.59,1293.07,My question was not really about Marbury.
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1293.07,1295.96,"I mean, isn't that a big difference, I mean, between the situation here?"
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1313.312,1317.294,You have rejected the overwhelming consensus of the courts of appeals.
2014.13-1371,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1317.294,1318.358,That's why I asked the question.
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1341.08,1341.454,Sure.
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1353.796,1356.795,"--Well, you're now talking about application."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1430.118,1445.128,"Justice Sotomayor, in -- in Ricci, the Court reserved the question whether disparate-impact liability in requiring race-based decision-making would violate the equal protection clause, and there is a--"
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1445.128,1447.156,But this is not race-based decision-making.
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1463.866,1464.459,--But the--
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1464.459,1468.113,So why is it wrong to have a neutral policy?
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1484.573,1496.754,"--Justice Sotomayor, I would disagree that it's completely race-neutral, because at the outset, statistical disparities based on race, racial classifications, are used and this has the potential to subordinate traditional--"
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1496.754,1497.195,"Well, that--"
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1497.195,1500.475,Which is not the case for the 10 percent plan that Texas uses.
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1500.475,1501.458,"--Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1501.458,1502.881,There's no racial thing in that.
2014.13-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1506.94,1508.157,What was the reason for--
2014.13-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1508.157,1509.206,No race about it.
2014.13-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1509.206,1510.579,--What was the reason for it?
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1544.267,1552.398,"But there's a difference between that race-conscious decision-making and, here, a situation where liability is triggered based on statistical disparities."
2014.13-1371,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1553.599,1559.347,"--It's not -- liability is not -- well, ""triggered"" is a good word; but it's not imposed because of that."
2014.13-1371,0,56070,scott_a_keller,,1589.849,1596.175,--But what objective standard is there to measure whether something is a substantial interest in the housing context?
2014.13-1371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1609.575,1610.589,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,1616.43,1620.598,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1371,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1631.092,1633.447,We're not talking about this case.
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,1633.447,1633.494,--No.
2014.13-1371,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1634.211,1634.539,All right.

2014.13-1371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1729.12,1734.056,So let's not -- let's not equate racial disparity with discrimination.
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,1745.486,1747.206,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-1371,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1783.596,1804.276,"Mr. Daniel, I had thought that Justice Scalia's question was whether the ""because of"" language precludes a disparate-impact theory; in other words, whether the ""because of"" language signals that it has to have a certain kind of intent which is not part of a disparate treatment, a disparate-impact theory."
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,1836.837,1840.12,"Yes, Justice Kagan."
2014.13-1371,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1840.12,1841.868,"I mean, is that your argument, or is your argument something else?"

2014.13-1371,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1851.175,1851.958,Could you--
2014.13-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1851.958,1852.41,--I'm sorry.
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,1857.126,1857.628,"--No, Chief Justice."

2014.13-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1874.604,1876.32,"Well, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,1888.362,1898.262,"--At that point, the housing authority is to say, this is what interest we have that is served by the discriminatory practice causing the racial segregation."
2014.13-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1915.069,1915.977,Is there--
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,1915.977,1916.399,And--
2014.13-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1916.399,1925.348,--Is there a way to avoid a disparate-impact consequence without taking race into account in carrying out the governmental activity?
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,1938.778,1941.274,--You don't have to look at the race at all.
2014.13-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1945.852,1946.913,"Well, what was, in fact, the remedy?"
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,1969.327,1983.728,"It said it had to stop the discriminatory housing practice and then it had to -- then it ordered in place the remedy suggested by the State that was, in fact, the less discriminatory alternative, to a large extent, to what they had been doing."
2014.13-1371,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1998.26,1998.962,--Could we go back?
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,1998.962,1999.352,In fact--
2014.13-1371,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1999.352,2000.257,Could we go back?
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,2029.042,2031.211,"--Yes, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.13-1371,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2031.211,2033.039,So you -- those are the three steps?
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,2033.039,2033.695,Yes.
2014.13-1371,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2033.695,2047.691,"If you can propose ways that are race neutral, practices that' are race neutral that will have -- take care of their needs, meaning the other side's needs, then you get relief."
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,2047.691,2056.328,"And, for example, one of the ways proposed was: Do not continue putting projects next to landfills and hazardous industrial uses."
2014.13-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2058.356,2063.839,Don't you have a tension between two statutes here?
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,2081.442,2094.781,--The law specifically says that there should be a preference among all the projects that are going to be awarded for applications that contribute to a concerted community revitalization plan.
2014.13-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2118.319,2126.75,Why shouldn't it get more if the tax law expresses that preference for the revitalization?
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,2126.75,2130.794,"Justice Ginsburg, it could if the State set it up that way."

2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,2216.209,2216.631,This Court--
2014.13-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2216.631,2217.442,--for an answer somewhat along--
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,2217.442,2217.754,--And this Court--
2014.13-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2217.754,2218.519,--those lines or any other--
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,2218.519,2225.141,"--This Court's two major opinions on this are, of course, Griggs and Smith."
2014.13-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2239.259,2245.335,"In Smith, however, the Court -- the plurality opinion cited two additional things."
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,2266.607,2284.24,"The exemptions are -- are similar in the fact that what those -- they do -- the RFOA in Smith came in and basically said even if you have disparate impact on these factors, if it's a reasonable factor other than age, we're going to excuse the disparate impact."
2014.13-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2297.125,2298.451,So is that critical to your argument?
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,2300.623,2306.758,--We -- we think the exemptions are text to support the use of a disparate-impact liability.
2014.13-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2335.087,2349.676,"If there was no disparate impact under the Act as initially enacted, do you argue that the exemptions expanded the Act so that it then, as of 1988, included disparate impact?"
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,2349.676,2356.719,"Well, it -- if there was none then, there -- there -- indicated the 1988 Congress thought there was."
2014.13-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2365.887,2367.447,"Well, that wasn't really my question."
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,2377.473,2381.988,"No, I think they were doing it in 1988, that counts for 1988."
2014.13-1371,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2383.787,2384.317,All right.
2014.13-1371,1,56071,michael_m_daniel,,2391.561,2394.934,"No, Justice."
2014.13-1371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2450.203,2453.579,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2470.367,2472.491,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.404,2527.089,I think your case would be stronger if there had been no court of appeals that had -- that had favored disparate impact.
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2542.144,2542.659,--Well--
2014.13-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2542.659,2543.813,--and Congress had enacted these--
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2543.813,2548.001,"--No, I actually think it's better the way it happened because -- for our case because of the reenactment canon."
2014.13-1371,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2570.766,2571.156,Can I ask you a question--
2014.13-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2571.156,2579.057,"Well, one concern -- one concern about disparate impact is that it's very difficult to decide what impact is -- is good and bad."
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2609.999,2610.483,Right.
2014.13-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2627.305,2627.586,"No, no."
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2633.551,2634.331,It may well be--
2014.13-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2634.331,2639.69,"If you give the proposal to the low-income housing in the affluent neighborhood, that certainly benefits integration."
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2646.92,2649.06,--So I'm going to answer Your Honor's question directly.
2014.13-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2649.06,2649.575,Good.
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2649.575,2655.339,But I think you've got to do it in the context of the way in which a disparate-impact case has got to be proven.
2014.13-1371,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2665.459,2666.551,And what is the practice here?
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2668.595,2670.03,"--Well, you know, that's a very good question."
2014.13-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2719.476,2721.399,"Well, with respect, I don't think that's responsive."
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2728.41,2728.878,Well--
2014.13-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2728.878,2734.469,"In other words, is it the provision that causes more proposals to go to low-income housing in the affluent area?"
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2743.06,2744.53,"--Well, the disparate -- right."
2014.13-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2754.493,2758.116,"I'm sorry, I -- and I'll just ask it for the last time and then let you get on."
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2758.116,2758.662,Yeah.
2014.13-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2758.662,2762.347,"You're saying you need the justification, but for what?"
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2771.592,2771.872,"You know, it may be--"
2014.13-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2771.872,2774.84,"You say you look at what's causing the bad effect, but what's the bad effect?"
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2774.84,2784.242,"--It may be that neither is because the state may say the -- the government may say in the first case, well, this is our justification, and that may be a justification that holds up."
2014.13-1371,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2790.552,2802.36,Do you think that a private developer would ever be found guilty of disparate impact because he owns a piece of property in an affluent neighborhood?
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2802.36,2805.655,"--No, Certainly not, of course not."
2014.13-1371,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2805.655,2807.074,"He's permitted to develop his property, right?"
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2807.074,2807.511,"Yes, of course."
2014.13-1371,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2808.482,2820.712,"The disparate impact would be if he fails to sell or make available to people of all races, let's say, the units in that property, correct?"
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2820.712,2822.116,--There's got to be specific practice.
2014.13-1371,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2822.116,2822.569,Practice.
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2822.569,2823.161,That's right.
2014.13-1371,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2824.647,2824.709,All right.
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2824.773,2826.309,--And that's just the first statement in the analysis--
2014.13-1371,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2826.309,2826.748,--that has a business--
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2826.748,2827.838,--and it's got to be unjustified.
2014.13-1371,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2827.838,2828.759,--Exactly.
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2828.759,2829.399,That -- and that's--
2014.13-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2829.399,2839.706,"I thought the question was, though, I mean, the -- it's not a developer, it's the Department of Housing and Community Affairs, and I thought the challenge went to where they were -- been -- where they were supporting development--"
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2839.706,2840.236,"--Well, this--"
2014.13-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2840.236,2841.301,"--not the developer, but -- but--"
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2841.301,2845.36,"--This may not be a good disparate-impact claim, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2849.687,2864.338,"But are you saying that in each case that the Chief Justice puts, there is initially a disparate impact at step one, that is to say, Community A wants the development to be in the suburbs."
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2877.613,2880.502,"That may be right, Justice Kennedy, but I think the point--"
2014.13-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2880.502,2882.421,But that -- that seems very odd to me.
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2882.421,2897.82,"--But I think that even if they're difficult cases under disparate impact, there are cases in the Heartland that have been adjudicated for 35 or 40 years, cases such as there is a zoning restriction that has a disparate impact that it cannot be justified on a substantial basis."
2014.13-1371,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2900.568,2904.268,"--Can I ask you a question -- I'm sorry, about Chevron."
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2940.644,2944.875,"--So the -- I understand the import of your question, Your Honor."
2014.13-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2990.323,2991.107,--It was a coincidence.
2014.13-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2991.107,2992.23,--That was very persuasive.
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2992.23,3003.585,"I really -- and so -- so I don't -- I think, actually, this has been a position of HUD for a very long time, and you would get Chevron deference for the adjudications."
2014.13-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3093.099,3101.346,What -- what rule you select depends on what affect that will have on racial -- racial use of the facility.
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3101.346,3103.518,"Well, I think the consequence -- no I think, Justice Scalia, with all due -- all--"
2014.13-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3103.518,3106.423,You select on the basis of what affect it will have on race.
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3106.423,3122.664,"--Well -- well, but that kind of consideration, so long as the -- the rule that comes later is a race-neutral rule, seems to me is exactly the kind of thing that the plurality opinion of this Court in Croson said in the contracting context that governments could do."
2014.13-1371,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3137.83,3147.89,"To underscore that, because I think everybody is getting confused with this, disparate impact does not go to who they take unless they set up a practice--"
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3147.89,3149.793,--That's that's correct.
2014.13-1371,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3149.793,3150.78,--that has that affect.
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3150.78,3161.18,"And so in the Heartland cases, with respect to the Fair Housing Act, the kinds of remedies that are going to be imposed are like the kinds of remedies that the Court said -- or the plurality, excuse me, set in Croson would find."
2014.13-1371,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3168.41,3174.435,"What you're saying is suppose that the plaintiffs in this case, that side, wins -- to try -- they're trying to win."
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3213.563,3214.109,"Yes, but so--"
2014.13-1371,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3214.109,3220.622,"So the answer is case by case, they have a specific set of forms that give answers--"
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3220.622,3220.965,--That's--
2014.13-1371,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3220.965,3222.513,--and judges judge it--
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3222.513,3222.934,--Absolutely.
2014.13-1371,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3222.934,3231.338,"--and HUD can come in and decide, and there is no need to throw the whole baby out -- or I don't know whether it's the baby or the bath water, whatever you're throwing out."
2014.13-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3234.992,3236.63,So just -- I'm sorry.
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3266.632,3267.662,"They might both win, yes."
2014.13-1371,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3354.107,3365.525,"And General, could I just ask -- I don't know a lot about this area and I take it that one of the things that you are warning us against is seeing the entire area through the prism of this one quite unusual case."
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3375.943,3377.924,"Sure they're the kind -- may I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2014.13-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3377.924,3378.245,Sure.
2014.13-1371,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3420.43,3378.245,Thank you.
2014.13-1371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3420.758,3421.344,"Thank you, General."
2014.13-1371,3,56070,scott_a_keller,,3424.205,3430.78,"Mr. Chief Justice, to answer your question, both would open up liability for disparate impact."
2014.13-1371,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3439.804,3444.818,"Well, you keep saying that, but that's not what happened here."
2014.13-1371,3,56070,scott_a_keller,,3468.259,3471.383,--But in the remedy in this case the district court--
2014.13-1371,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3471.383,3472.678,--what they want to do.
