1993.93-517,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.51,"We'll hear argument now in Number 93-517, the Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Louis Grumet, and two cases consolidated with it for argument."
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,14.612,18.383,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,79.913,88.568,"Mr. Lewin, may I inquire, this is a special act of the legislature just directed to form this one school district?"
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,88.568,90.671,"It is an independent... yes, Justice--"
1993.93-517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,90.671,99.267,Were the laws of the State of New York not such that other people similarly situated could form their own special school district?
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,102.299,109.113,--The legislature in New York has... does enact laws that creates school districts and bounds of school districts.
1993.93-517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,114.246,119.599,Is every school district in the State of New York formed by a special act of the legislature?
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,119.599,120.65,--It's formed by acts of the legislature.
1993.93-517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,120.65,126.664,Rather than by a general provision that allows residents of areas to form their own district.
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,126.664,128.167,My understanding is that that's correct.
1993.93-517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,133.279,133.89,It's always done that way--
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,133.89,134.29,Yes.
1993.93-517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,134.29,135.86,--not by some general law--
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,135.86,137.362,Not by some general law.
1993.93-517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,137.362,139.624,--that would allow similar groups to form districts.
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,139.624,140.295,Correct.
1993.93-517,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,140.295,153.131,Is it fair to say that governmental power was transferred here to a geographic entity based on the religious beliefs and practices of its residents?
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,153.131,157.656,"I think, Justice Kennedy, that that's not a fair characterization."
1993.93-517,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,177.088,185.712,"If my characterization that I used in the question were deemed the appropriate characterization, would you lose the case?"
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,185.712,216.464,"Well, I don't think so, not even under those circumstances, although that's not this case, Justice Kennedy, because I think that if in fact, as a matter of legislative accommodation, a group of individuals residing in a particular geographic area would warrant having a separate public school for secular reasons, which is what happened in this case, it would be permissible to accommodate to them, and... or even to accommodate to their religious practice."
1993.93-517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,250.876,264.676,"Well, Mr. Lewin, if... if such a law were to neutrally extend to everybody in New York, so that anybody similarly situated could dispose of their own trash, I think you have a very good argument."
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,299.168,302.74,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1993.93-517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,312.447,313.366,If Aguilar--
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,331.319,335.101,"I think, Justice Kennedy, it would have been permissible."
1993.93-517,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,350.452,355.674,"No, no, no, my question, following Justice O'Connor's, was, had Aguilar v. Felton come out the other way--"
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,355.674,356.215,--Yes.
1993.93-517,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,356.215,368.844,"--And these services had been provided in the private schools themselves, would you then nevertheless have had the constitutional option to have the district formed as it was here?"
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,368.844,369.245,No.
1993.93-517,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,392.64,395.972,"Well, Mr. Lewin, may I ask you a question of fact there?"
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,427.672,431.816,"Justice Souter, I think the record really establishes the contrary."
1993.93-517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,498.778,500.91,"Well, that maybe unconstitutional too, Mr. Lewin, I guess."
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,509.544,533.051,"--Well, Justice Scalia, of course, our view is that the accommodation authority that legislatures have and that this Court has recognized... indeed, even as strong a proponent of the Establishment Clause as Justice Brennan in his Texas Monthly case in footnote 8 specifically referred to the fact that the authority to accommodate is far broader than the mere confines of the Free Exercise Clause."
1993.93-517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.051,557.486,"But the argument being made is that if they had large families for some other reason, not a religious reason, you could... you could establish a special community with different zoning laws for that group, but if they have large families for religious reasons, just as this community has certain customs that make it difficult for them to go to another community for their schooling for religious reasons, then it's bad."
1993.93-517,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,557.486,559.207,"Well, our view, of course, is that that--"
1993.93-517,1,31900,julie_s_mereson,,1038.157,1049.154,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-517,2,33440,jay_worona,,1612.073,1614.687,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-517,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1654.551,1656.041,"Excuse me, you say religiously segregated."
1993.93-517,2,33440,jay_worona,,1664.927,1678.808,"Well, when I refer to religiously segregated, Your Honor, I'm referring to the fact that this community is comprised exclusively of Satmar Hasidic individuals, and as Mr. Lewin indicated, the boundary lines were specifically drawn to only include those members."
1993.93-517,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1678.808,1685.131,"Well, but... well, you could say it was drawn to include those members, or you could say it was drawn to include people who speak Yiddish."
1993.93-517,2,33440,jay_worona,,1693.367,1694.917,"That's correct, Your Honor, but--"
1993.93-517,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.917,1699.411,"Was it accommodating any of their religious practices, their religious ceremonies, anything of that sort?"
1993.93-517,2,33440,jay_worona,,1699.411,1716.242,"--Well, Your Honor, all I can respond to is that in the Monroe-Woodbury v. Wieder case before the appellate division, the residents of the Kiryas Joel Village maintained a free exercise claim for their need to acquire a religiously segregated environment for the children to be educated."
1993.93-517,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1716.242,1731.671,"I think what they were saying is, if you do not make accommodation for a culture which springs out of the religion, you are discriminating against the religion, but that isn't the same thing as saying cultural accommodation is necessarily accommodating their religious beliefs."
1993.93-517,2,33440,jay_worona,,1737.976,1739.396,"Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
1993.93-517,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1742.509,1743.62,That would be a different challenge.
1993.93-517,2,33440,jay_worona,,1751.375,1763.792,"--Yes, Your Honor, because the specific issue before you today is not what the residents of Kiryas Joel may be doing constitutionally or unconstitutionally, it's what the State of New York did when it enacted this particular piece of legislation."
1993.93-517,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1784.727,1785.798,The parents didn't think it was enough.
1993.93-517,2,33440,jay_worona,,1785.798,1798.776,"Well, that may be true, Your Honor, but when we look at a statute to determine whether we are responding to bilingual, bicultural needs of a community, and we see a school district has in fact responded to those needs, certainly we cannot ignore that particular fact."
1993.93-517,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.776,1802.94,You're saying the record shows that it is responding to the religious needs.
1993.93-517,2,33440,jay_worona,,1804.142,1804.553,Well--
1993.93-517,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.553,1805.634,I really don't understand that.
1993.93-517,2,33440,jay_worona,,1814.897,1827.556,"--However, Your Honor, in the court of appeals decision in Monroe-Woodbury v. Wieder, we saw that the village residents were willing to forego bilingual services as long as they acquired a segregated environment for their children to be educated--"
1993.93-517,3,37177,nathan_lewin,,3285.007,3296.116,"With respect to Judge Kaye's suggestion, Justice Souter, we, in addition to thinking it's the wrong test, we think it's not clear that that's the least restrictive alternative by any means."
1993.93-517,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3383.731,3384.743,"Thank you, Mr. Lewin."
1993.93-517,3,37177,nathan_lewin,,3384.743,3385.672,Thank you.
1993.93-517,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3385.672,3387.338,The case is submitted--
