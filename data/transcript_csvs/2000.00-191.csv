2000.00-191,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,48.435,50.385,Thank you.
2000.00-191,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,50.385,53.297,I now recognize you by your true name.
2000.00-191,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,53.297,58.89,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.00-191,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,98.708,118.299,"I think that you do have a problem in sustaining this part of the congressional act because the basis for sustaining the limits on contributions is the corruption rationale that has been in our cases for, you know, 50, 60 years."
2000.00-191,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,125.215,136.392,Political parties present the risk... a risk of the corruption that justifies limits on contributions and coordinated expenditures in two ways.
2000.00-191,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,179.288,194.1,"Well, if those informal arrangements are that actually this money is given to the party but we know you're going to give it to candidate X, certainly the Congress can prohibit that."
2000.00-191,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,195.58,224.469,"Congress has prohibited earmarking, but the Court recognized in Buckley itself that a prohibition on earmarking cannot reach, cannot be effective to reach the whole problem of, in effect, using an intermediary to exceed the limits, and the reason is for one thing an earmarking arrangement requires something more rigid than what would usually happen."
2000.00-191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,253.607,255.48,Let me get this straight.
2000.00-191,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,287.399,288.301,That's the distinction between--
2000.00-191,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.301,298.666,"But if Schwartz gives $100,000 to the Democratic Party, we're suddenly worried that the candidate is going to be corrupted because Schwartz gave $100,000?"
2000.00-191,0,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,319.852,358.157,"--Well, the Court in Buckley had to balance a number of different concerns in arriving at its distinction between independent expenditures, which will certainly often please the candidate, but which it regarded as sufficiently important in First Amendment terms so that limiting them to protect against possible indirect corruption was not permissible on the one hand, and contributions, direct contributions to the candidate, which the Court saw as having a lesser First Amendment component on... importance on one side--"
2000.00-191,1,29078,jan_w_baran,,1600.511,1617.694,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the statute before you makes it a crime for a political party to send one letter to every voter in the State if the candidate requested that letter or collaborated in its preparation."
2000.00-191,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3333.319,3335.589,Thank you.
