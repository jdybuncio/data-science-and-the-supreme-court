1976.75-353,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,18.601,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in three related cases, 75-353, -354 and -55, Piper and others against Chris-Craft and the related cases."
1976.75-353,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,22.46,26.201,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-353,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,179.69,185.02,"Mr. Cutrer, you have referred to both of those as technical violations."
1976.75-353,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,188.032,200.16,"I use it in the sense, Justice Rehnquist, that the violations were, as I just said, found by the District Court to have been made in good faith and without intent to mislead."
1976.75-353,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,200.16,213.837,"May I ask, Mr. Cutrer, am I correct in my understanding that the question of whether or not either or both of these constituted a violation is not an issue here before this Court?"
1976.75-353,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,213.837,215.422,"That's correct, Justice Stewart."
1976.75-353,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,226.107,231.888,So we will see here on the premise that they both did constitute violations.
1976.75-353,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,231.888,232.266,Right.
1976.75-353,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,232.266,232.78,Okay.
1976.75-353,1,21349,david_w_peck,,1219.388,1223.019,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-353,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1361.101,1405.451,"Judge Peck, it's my understanding that your brothers on the other side of the podium claim that you were acting here or you may have been acting as a conventional statutory underwriter in the terms of the 1993 Act in your capacity in connection with the registration statement; that in addition, you had a different hat on through a good deal of these negotiations; and that you were the general or the manager or whatever the language is in their brief -- I've forgotten -- of the whole deal, and in that respect you were not a, quote, ""underwriter"", but you were acting in quite a different capacity."
1976.75-353,1,21349,david_w_peck,,1407.123,1442.807,"Yes, that is their contention, but has been completely rejected expressly and specifically by both the District Court and the Court of Appeals, whose only fault was found as far as First Boston is concerned with respect to 14(e) and it said that it had no directing or responsible connection with any of the other alleged violations; that it acted only in a professional capacity and solely in good faith."
1976.75-353,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.089,1451.768,But that's not saying solely as an underwriter.
1976.75-353,1,21349,david_w_peck,,1453.672,1473.376,"Well, cover it as you will there, in the first place the courts below said that it did not participate in these other matters in any respect other than lending professional advice and assistance."
1976.75-353,2,38231,paul_g_pennoyer_jr,,2135.721,2139.177,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-353,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2367.626,2375.058,You think that might be a relevant factor in a private suit by a shareholders against Piper?
1976.75-353,2,38231,paul_g_pennoyer_jr,,2375.058,2380.734,"Yes, we would not question that in a private suit by shareholders, it might be."
1976.75-353,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2458.94,2462.799,"We're now moving into the rebuttal time, Mr. Pennoyer."
1976.75-353,2,38231,paul_g_pennoyer_jr,,2462.799,2485.07,"Well, then, I will simply close with this statement, that individual liability, a violation of a fiduciary obligation to shareholders, was found on the basis of a single footnote sentence that the Pipers in sending the letters acted in their own interest and not in the interest of the shareholders."
1976.75-353,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2485.07,2490.275,Very well.
1976.75-353,3,16406,arthur_l_liman,,2491.805,2495.67,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-353,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2554.115,2555.729,"Well, there were two violations."
1976.75-353,3,16406,arthur_l_liman,,2570.045,2584.021,"No, Mr. Justice Stewart, there was a violation in January at the time Chris-Craft made its tender offer, when the Piper family to discourage shareholders from accepting that offer made misrepresentations to them."
1976.75-353,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2739.247,2741.466,"Mr. Liman, could I interrupt you there?"
1976.75-353,3,16406,arthur_l_liman,,2754.226,2754.748,Yes.
1976.75-353,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2754.748,2761.881,"And thereafter, as I understand the case, you waived any equitable remedies and elected to stand on damages."
1976.75-353,3,16406,arthur_l_liman,,2769.862,2774.163,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-353,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2774.163,2775.107,"Microphone, please?"
1976.75-353,3,16406,arthur_l_liman,,2775.107,2783.354,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens; but we did not abandon the request for divestiture immediately."
1976.75-353,4,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,5226.006,5226.721,Thank you very much.
1976.75-353,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5226.721,5229.803,"Mr. Cutrer, could I ask you two questions that you covered in your brief?"
1976.75-353,4,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,5229.803,5230.145,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-353,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5230.145,5240.432,"Number one, would you agree or disagree that the management would have standing under 14(e) that's one question, and the other question, I want you to refresh my recollection."
1976.75-353,4,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,5247.921,5254.014,"Your second question was the first one I wanted to take up, Justice Stevens; so if I could, I'd like to answer that first."
1976.75-353,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5283.721,5284.071,Okay.
1976.75-353,4,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,5289.242,5290.258,Right.
1976.75-353,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5313.542,5318.026,"Now, in your counterclaim in the District Court, was that the same position you took there?"
1976.75-353,4,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,5318.888,5319.547,Piper.
1976.75-353,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5319.547,5324.425,"Well, it wasn't yours; rather, the Piper individuals took the position, I guess, that they had standing, didn't they?"
1976.75-353,4,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,5326.118,5343.33,"There was a counterclaim by Bangor Punta, which was a counterclaim once Chris-Craft had sued us; but our answer to Bangor Punta -- it was a stipulated answer -- specifically raised the  question of what we've been calling here their standing to sue, whether there was liability for damages."
1976.75-353,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5343.33,5355.046,"But then if you should admit that management would have standing in a contest like this, doesn't that make it sort of a one-sided standing rule, that one side has standing, but the other does not?"
1976.75-353,4,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,5356.548,5360.024,I was speaking of the management having standing to sue the --
1976.75-353,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5360.024,5361.018,To sue for the corporation.
1976.75-353,4,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,5361.018,5362.46,-- tender offeror.
1976.75-353,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5364.053,5364.6,Yes.
1976.75-353,4,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,5364.6,5376.981,But let's say one tender offeror for an injunction or to recover damages perhaps for the benefit of the target shareholders who are all members of that corporation.
1976.75-353,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5389.447,5390.243,"Right, I understand that."
1976.75-353,4,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,5390.243,5399.195,"But the test, as I think the Chief Justiceâ€™s opinion in Rondeau makes very clear, is, can you show some injury to the shareholders."
1976.75-353,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5527.987,5528.798,"Thank you, gentlemen."
