1992.92-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.388,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 92-515, Wisconsin v. Todd Mitchell."
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,10.575,15.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,95.416,100.054,"General Doyle, your state supreme court was of the opposite view."
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,118.094,126.106,It is our view that the Supreme Court of Wisconsin decided in law that the Wisconsin statute punished thought.
1992.92-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,151.439,166.386,"But if some other state supreme court came to the same disposition that your state supreme court but used legislative history and decided as a factual matter that it had been intended to punish thought, then we would have to come out differently in your view?"
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,166.386,170.853,It very much depends on what the analysis was.
1992.92-515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,197.264,203.653,"You, in other words you're saying that their comments were directed to the First Amendment consequences of this statute?"
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,203.653,205.136,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,226.769,227.066,Yes.
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,253.804,258.303,"Your Honor, I believe that that is their conclusion, that they then lead into their reasons."
1992.92-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,284.228,291.992,"Well, ordinarily we decide what a statute is directed at by the terms of the statute itself, I take it, don't we?"
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,291.992,293.772,"Well, that's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,323.884,342.893,"I take it you make no distinction between, or do you, a statute which simply enhances a sentence for this kind of conduct and a hypothetical statute say in another state which makes this a substantive crime of, in a free-standing statute."
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,345.486,358.011,"I believe there is no constitutional difference, although let me add I think the Wisconsin case is even cleaner than the second one that you gave, that because in order to get into the enhanced punishment... we have not tried to create any type of new crime."
1992.92-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.89,435.074,I would guess in most cases you're not going to get nearly as clear of an evidentiary finding as you did in this as to the motive for the crime?
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,435.074,440.104,It is likely you would not find one so clear.
1992.92-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,482.557,487.084,Is that submitted to the jury at the same time that the substantive criminal offense is tried?
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,487.084,488.022,"Yes, it is."
1992.92-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.963,565.646,Is there any limit on the reasons for selection that the state can specify for higher punishment?
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,579.517,596.51,"I believe that in view of the state if the particular category serves a legitimate state interest and meets equal protection tests and meets vagueness... some of the examples you have given, Justice Scalia, I think would be difficult obviously to put into a statute that would meet the vagueness test."
1992.92-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.008,600.742,It has to serve a legitimate state interest?
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,600.742,602.773,--I believe that--
1992.92-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.773,616.095,"So one has to judge whether being against flat earth people is less important than being against people who don't like particular religions, for example?"
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,616.095,618.328,"--No, that would not be the legitimate state interest."
1992.92-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,647.738,647.972,Okay.
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,656.703,664.076,"That's right, whether they present, in a traditional criminal context that they present a significant law enforcement problem to the State of Wisconsin."
1992.92-515,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,664.076,672.541,"So therefore, going back to your prior argument, it wouldn't make any difference whether the reason in this case in fact was the expression of the bigotry?"
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,672.541,687.831,"I think that in my judgment it would not, and I believe in Dawson, if in fact the statute was strictly limited to racial motives, which the Wisconsin statute isn't, if it were that Dawson would suggest that that would be appropriate."
1992.92-515,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,716.773,739.607,"General Doyle, going back to this line of inquiry and looking back at the days of the Vietnam conflict, do you suppose it would have been all right then for the state to enhance the penalty for draft card burning if it's done because of opposition to Government policies, for example?"
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,739.607,749.041,"I believe there are some categories that should very clearly raise a concern in the court, in courts on whether or not there is suppression of ideas that are afoot."
1992.92-515,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,759.913,764.677,I don't see how that's very different from what you have here necessarily.
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,764.677,765.739,--I think the--
1992.92-515,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,765.739,773.828,"I mean, we want to suppress the notion of racial bias."
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,773.828,788.276,"--Wisconsin, while I think we would all like to do away with the notion of racial bias, Wisconsin by this law and by the face of this law is not seeking to suppress racial bias or the notion of racial bias."
1992.92-515,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,806.425,811.547,"Is it a question of proximity, how proximate is the conduct to the thought?"
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,811.547,814.358,"Yes, I think certainly it is."
1992.92-515,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,840.004,857.107,"Does the difference between the draft card burning enhancement and the enhancement here rest on the fact that no one burns draft cards except as, in effect as political statements, whereas people do commit assaults for different reasons?"
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,873.053,882.41,"I believe that that is correct in the draft card, particularly when you're dealing with the motive being opposition to a Government policy."
1992.92-515,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,899.73,909.43,"But, excuse me, I thought we were presenting from that whether the objectives are good or bad, but you say the objectives have to be a legitimate state interest?"
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,926.798,938.699,"--I would say that that would, it's far removed from the Wisconsin example, but I think that it would present to the court a legitimate concern that the Government is attempting to suppress ideas of the Government."
1992.92-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1002.767,1014.183,"What if in the draft card case the statute said that your penalty would be enhanced if you did it because of disagreement with the person's views about the Vietnam war, whether they were pro or con?"
1992.92-515,0,30018,james_e_doyle,,1014.183,1022.805,"--In my view that would, assuming that there is in fact, as there was, a real disruption, I think that that would be constitutional."
1992.92-515,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1026.569,1028.054,"Very well, General Doyle."
1992.92-515,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1029.256,1036.252,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1062.429,1064.554,You have to be an equal opportunity criminal?
1992.92-515,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1069.115,1070.598,"--No, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1114.3,1123.748,So what we have is a crime that itself presents a substantive evil that the state can prevent quite without regard to the thoughts and beliefs of the actor?
1992.92-515,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1123.748,1125.623,"That's exactly right, Justice Kennedy."
1992.92-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1167.965,1172.011,"What do you mean by suppressing, it has an interest in suppressing?"
1992.92-515,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1183.709,1185.645,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1992.92-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.645,1189.957,"What the state can do is to foster the opposite, to show its disapproval of that attitude."
1992.92-515,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1196.797,1197.313,"Well, those--"
1992.92-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1197.313,1199.5,"But it can do that for patriotism as well, couldn't it?"
1992.92-515,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1199.5,1199.733,--That's correct.
1992.92-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1200.155,1206.872,So can you punish a crime more severely if the crime demonstrates a lack of patriotism?
1992.92-515,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1206.872,1207.684,--No.
1992.92-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1239.374,1250.432,"I thought you acknowledged that there's some limit on that, that even in doing that the state can seem to be trying to suppress an idea, and then it would be bad."
1992.92-515,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1252.791,1266.597,"I acknowledge that if the court determined that the law's purpose and effect is really to get at thought and not to get at the conduct that is manifesting the harms in question, then you have a different case."
1992.92-515,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1275.156,1285.682,But if a state is concerned that a wave of intolerance is causing injury it can act both because it disapproves of that intolerance and of the injury.
1992.92-515,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1298.989,1299.927,I would agree with that.
1992.92-515,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1326.916,1340.473,"What if a state which had no history whatsoever of any race-motivated crimes, there simply had never been any in that state, what if that state were to pass a statute like Wisconsin's?"
1992.92-515,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1344.706,1358.654,"In the particular area that this law deals with I don't think there would be any additional scrutiny because the nation has experienced such problems in this area that it cannot be, there can be no doubt whatsoever that the state's motivation in enacting such a law is real and legitimate."
1992.92-515,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1358.654,1360.826,Disability?
1992.92-515,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1374.523,1387.503,"Well, I think of all the categories that are in the list the category of disability is one that is most easy to understand, that the disabled status of a victim may make that victim more vulnerable to crime and the state clearly has a heightened interest in protecting that--"
1992.92-515,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1387.503,1392.828,But is there any evidence that disabled people have been beaten up because they are disabled?
1992.92-515,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1392.828,1395.265,--I don't know that there is any evidence in this record.
1992.92-515,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1400.186,1409.868,"Yes, but I thought your argument was that, in response to Justice Kennedy's question, if there are a rash of church burnings, sure, the state, the Federal Government can come in and legislate about that."
1992.92-515,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1419.537,1429.064,"It may be evidenced in a particular case that there is no real-life problem that the state is attempting to regulate, that the state has some other goal in mind."
1992.92-515,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1569.601,1571.023,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,1573.162,1578.192,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-515,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1605.511,1616.632,"It seems to me he was punished because, not because of his bias but because his bias led him to pick out a victim because of the victim's race."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,1625.299,1629.563,He was punished for the conduct by the battery statute.
1992.92-515,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1639.247,1656.192,"But I have just indicated that there are many sorts of thoughts that you have that are protected as such but that cannot be put into action, and I don't see how this case is really a very remarkable deviation from that simple proposition."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,1656.192,1660.442,"Your Honor, the state can't ever punish a viewpoint."
1992.92-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1685.588,1686.322,What about title VII?
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,1698.097,1698.566,No.
1992.92-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1709.202,1711.015,But they don't punish effects.
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,1719.558,1728.305,"They do... Your Honor, I believe that this Court said in Griggs that you could prove a title VII violation for example on a disparate impact theory."
1992.92-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.124,1753.684,This is inextricably intertwined.
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,1772.428,1774.083,"--No, Your Honor."
1992.92-515,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1793.638,1805.555,Do you want us to pretend that the anti-discrimination clause that protects minorities in employment is not motivated at least in substantial part by our concern with racial intolerance?
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,1805.555,1816.784,"--Your Honor, the interest that's served by title VII is that of providing equal opportunity, equal opportunity to people who have been historically discriminated against."
1992.92-515,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1855.878,1862.548,Could you give me an example of how it might speak in terms of harms and effects in a way that would legitimize it?
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,1862.548,1864.234,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-515,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1878.541,1884.132,"Wait a minute, I thought you were objecting to the statue, statute rather, in its terms."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,1890.114,1894.347,--This statute is directed at motive.
1992.92-515,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1908.326,1916.355,"You don't object then to the statute insofar as it refers to disabilities, victims with disabilities?"
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,1924.133,1927.976,--The because of is the problem with this statute.
1992.92-515,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1928.976,1937.455,"Well, if you didn't couch the statute in terms of because of wouldn't your sentencing in effect be a potentially random act?"
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,1962.727,1963.665,"--No, Your Honor."
1992.92-515,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1993.058,1996.073,"Mr. Adelman, can I question that for a moment?"
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,1996.073,1996.292,Sure.
1992.92-515,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1996.292,2011.908,"Supposing the criminal planning the crime thinks that white people are not as well able to defend themselves as people of other races and for that reason they are sort of easy victims, and therefore makes a practice of always selecting white victims and makes that clear."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2017.609,2020.015,"Your Honor, no."
1992.92-515,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2021.952,2023.811,He selects his victim because of his race.
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2023.811,2028.747,--The Wisconsin Supreme Court interpreted the because of to mean biased motive.
1992.92-515,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.804,2050.927,That part of the burden of proof of the state is to show an animus towards the race of the victim?
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2050.927,2051.317,That's correct.
1992.92-515,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2082.243,2084.882,"Perhaps I'm wrong, counsel."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2109.217,2113.402,"Your Honor, the selection of the victim is part of the underlying crime."
1992.92-515,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2154.541,2160.148,I suppose that's simply because it's mostly bigots who select people because of their race.
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2163.195,2184.701,"Well, Your Honor, even though the state may come up with a few marginal creative hypotheticals which would involve a hypothetical of someone who was committing hate crimes without hate, that's essentially what their hypothetical is, those would be the most remote and marginal applications of this law."
1992.92-515,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2199.648,2201.584,"Mr. Adelman, may I just ask you a technical question?"
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2249.612,2258.843,"--Your Honor, I think that the court clearly was not thinking of these various hypotheticals posed by the state--"
1992.92-515,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2258.843,2263.389,"Well, that may be but I just want to stick at the moment to the specific question."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2269.635,2276.929,"--I don't think the court says that explicitly, but I think it's clear that that's, that their interpretation is to bias."
1992.92-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2322.49,2329.722,"Mr. Adelman, suppose you didn't have a statute and you just have a normal prosecution for a murder."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2370.861,2383.668,In Dawson this Court said that the First Amendment applied its sentence and that biased motive or belief may be considered as evidence of a content-neutral sentencing factor.
1992.92-515,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2421.793,2426.901,Are you arguing that biased thought is an element of the offense?
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2426.901,2429.572,"It's clear, Your Honor, that--"
1992.92-515,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2429.572,2434.366,And is it clear in this case that that element was proved beyond a reasonable doubt in this case?
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2434.366,2438.881,"--Well, it's clear that the... yes, we do not dispute that."
1992.92-515,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2438.881,2446.206,But... you think also the record really does show that this defendant had this kind of bias against whites?
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2446.206,2450.751,"That's a more difficult question, Your Honor, and I think that brings up another problem--"
1992.92-515,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2450.751,2456.499,"It seemed to me, very frankly, that if you thought that was an element of the offense you might well have argued a failure of proof."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2456.499,2465.167,"--Well, Your Honor, that might have been argued below and I think that brings up another problem with this statute, and that is the over-inclusivity."
1992.92-515,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2496.591,2504.323,"Well, incidently, the Wisconsin court hasn't said that it doesn't have to be a substantial factor, does it?"
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2509.024,2510.491,--That's correct.
1992.92-515,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2515.35,2517.49,So this issue is something not before us.
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2517.49,2540.573,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that the, that the 1992 amendments may well have clarified the meaning of the original law, and it's clear that the law now that's in effect in Wisconsin covers because of in whole or in part, which means you can have an unconscious amount of racism, the most minute percentage of disapproved or disfavored motive, and still be subject to this additional penalty."
1992.92-515,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2564.314,2569.267,"Did the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, Mr. Adelman, comment on the meaning of in whole or in part?"
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2576.246,2577.153,They didn't say.
1992.92-515,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2584.135,2586.431,What did the statute say at the time your client--
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2586.431,2586.868,Because of.
1992.92-515,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2586.868,2587.46,--Because of.
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2592.1,2601.05,"Well, I think that the only, I think it's clear because they wanted to get at even minute quantities of the disfavored motives."
1992.92-515,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2642.189,2648.218,Is there any evidence in the record of the way the statute has been used by Wisconsin prosecutors?
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2656.37,2666.335,"The evidence in the record suggests that this statute isn't used much at all in any particular situation, but it surely could be, Your Honor."
1992.92-515,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2720.033,2729.466,"Our cases have said that the legislature can address evils one at a time, that it doesn't have to cover the whole waterfront, so to speak, in one statute."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2729.466,2737.494,But this Court has said also that when under-inclusivity is based on content and viewpoint that makes the statute subject to strict scrutiny.
1992.92-515,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2748.583,2753.518,"Well, maybe the Wisconsin legislature thought there weren't any misogynists in Wisconsin."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2753.518,2758.251,"--It's possible, but I--"
1992.92-515,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2758.251,2759.314,You don't believe so?
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2763.188,2768.67,"--The point is, Your Honor, the content and viewpoint specificity is not necessary."
1992.92-515,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2806.482,2831.488,"Suppose, Mr. Adelman, suppose Wisconsin had a separate statute that said if you do this sort of thing because of race, if you assault another person on account of race you must have a, and they specify the minimum penalty which is just larger than the normal assault statute has in it."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2833.004,2836.627,--The statute can't be based on thought.
1992.92-515,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2838.783,2846.201,"Well, but you would also say that the statute I just posited would be unconstitutional?"
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2859.633,2864.162,If it was because of your views on race that would be unconstitutional.
1992.92-515,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2864.162,2885.95,"What do you do about section 242 of the Federal Criminal Code which says that if you deprive any person of a right, privilege, or immunity protected by the Constitution of the United States and you do it on account of color or race, you have committed a crime and you are punished for that?"
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2885.95,2888.793,"There are two answers to that, Your Honor."
1992.92-515,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2893.713,2894.167,So?
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2920.25,2925.42,"--Your Honor, 242 is distinguishable because it serves a different interest."
1992.92-515,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2937.133,2946.209,"Maybe so, but it's, the thing that makes it a crime is that the conduct is engaged in because of race."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2952.986,2955.719,--Because the statute is not directed at bias.
1992.92-515,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2965.871,2969.792,"Well, I would suppose that your supreme court would declare this statute unconstitutional."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2977.117,2979.537,"I'm sure they wouldn't, Your Honor, because in that case--"
1992.92-515,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2979.537,2980.709,"Well, I don't know."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,2980.709,2986.551,"--the bias, the motive, and the conduct are inextricable."
1992.92-515,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3003.996,3011.635,On that basis I would think 242 would be even more suspect because it just isn't an enhancer.
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3019.772,3021.131,"--No, Your Honor, that's not true."
1992.92-515,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3028.19,3044.37,"Well, I know, but it doesn't, this statute doesn't cover all interferences... under this, this statute would not be violated by someone who interfered with somebody's federally constituted, protected rights for some reason besides race."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3046.651,3049.01,--But the reason you need--
1992.92-515,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3049.01,3053.898,We have a separate statute here criminalizing conduct motivated by race.
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3053.898,3059.069,--You need that because of in that statute to give meaning to the phrase interference with Federal rights.
1992.92-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3093.836,3102.567,What about treason and espionage laws which make certain acts unlawful if committed with the intent to give aid and comfort to the enemy?
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3118.652,3121.027,"Intention is different than motive, Your Honor."
1992.92-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3121.027,3122.746,--Intention is different from motive?
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3122.746,3123.277,"Yes, intention affects--"
1992.92-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3123.277,3123.996,"Okay, then strike it."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3127.836,3131.367,"--Whatever you call it, in your hypothetical that's intent."
1992.92-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3138.052,3140.207,"No, no, the conduct is turning over the information."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3152.031,3155.358,"--See, you could turn it over by accident, and that wouldn't be treason."
1992.92-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3155.358,3155.937,That's right.
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3155.937,3157.498,That's why you need the intent in there.
1992.92-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3160.651,3165.494,"Oh, no, but I... no, I can turn it over intentionally and I know I am giving it to this person."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3172.616,3179.489,"--I believe that treason statutes don't punish, I think they punish the intent--"
1992.92-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3179.489,3179.708,I think you're wrong.
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3181.737,3186.017,"--Well, Your Honor, intent affects the what of conduct."
1992.92-515,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3192.811,3206.524,"I think treason statutes are directed against bad people who wish the country harm, and the same act performed by that person is made more serious than one that is performed by some other person."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3206.524,3211.85,--Wisconsin's concern about biased crimes is well-intentioned.
1992.92-515,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3272.81,3273.888,"One question, Mr. Adelman."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3273.888,3274.622,"Yes, Justice Thomas."
1992.92-515,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3274.622,3277.792,There were 10 individuals involved here?
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3277.792,3278.355,That's correct.
1992.92-515,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3278.355,3290.208,"Let's assume that five were told to attack a white person and five said they would attack a black person, for whatever reasons."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3296.378,3302.344,The second five... any kind of biased motive would be covered.
1992.92-515,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3302.344,3304.296,The statute says because of race.
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3304.296,3306.687,Yes.
1992.92-515,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3308.186,3310.653,So where is the bias in the second five?
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3310.653,3312.497,The bias is a racial bias.
1992.92-515,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3338.346,3343.391,So you're assuming that there's intraracial bias simply because they decided to attack a black person also?
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3343.391,3348.622,"The statute is directed at bias, racial bias."
1992.92-515,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3390.184,3404.553,"So in all the cases that you are aware of the state actually had to prove that there was bias, not simply that this individual was chosen, the victim was chosen because of his or her race, for whatever reasons?"
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3404.553,3408.098,--The Wisconsin Supreme Court said that because of meant biased motive.
1992.92-515,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3416.142,3417.298,"Thank you, Mr. Adelman."
1992.92-515,2,34070,lynn_s_adelman,,3417.298,3417.595,Thank you.
1992.92-515,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3417.595,3420.375,"General Doyle, you have 2 minutes remaining."
1992.92-515,3,30018,james_e_doyle,,3420.375,3423.108,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.92-515,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3535.798,3537.064,"Thank you, General Doyle."
