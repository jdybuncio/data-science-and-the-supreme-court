1971.70-223,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.92,"We'll hear arguments next in 70-223, Central Hardware Co. against the Labor Board."
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,50.928,53.743,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court."
1971.70-223,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,380.923,383.127,McDonalds has it's own parking lot?
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,383.127,384.657,Yes Sir.
1971.70-223,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,384.657,388.221,Is it fenced between the McDonald's parking lot and your's?
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,388.221,392.601,"No sir, there is a curve but, there is access between the two."
1971.70-223,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,392.601,399.869,But you wouldn't draw McDonald's low access places?
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,399.869,408.063,"There is no testimony in the record, Your Honor, but I would have to say, I would myself probably not refer to it as a low traffic place."
1971.70-223,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,408.063,413.495,"Is there any sign that say, this parking lot is restricted to put people at this store?"
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,413.495,414.647,No Sir.
1971.70-223,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,414.647,415.824,In either way.
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,415.824,416.685,No Sir.
1971.70-223,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,416.685,418.359,And the public is free to park there?
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,418.359,419.427,"No, Sir."
1971.70-223,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,419.427,421.739,What happens if they do park?
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,421.739,437.352,"The record is replete with instances where they have been members of the public who came on to parking lot, who were not customers and these people were uniformly, throughout the entire period of this organizational campaign ejected."
1971.70-223,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,437.352,439.006,"They were Union people, weren't they?"
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,439.006,439.916,No Sir.
1971.70-223,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,449.817,459.745,"I think a man that wants set up a business to sell the Christmas trees is not rather talking about it, somebody who just parks at parking lot."
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,470.523,475.358,"No sir, if you are coming as a customer Your Honor, you are more than welcome."
1971.70-223,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,475.358,477.328,Is there any sign that tells me that?
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,477.328,481.069,No sir.
1971.70-223,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,481.069,483.125,So it's not open to the public?
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,483.125,485.444,"No Sir, it's open to our invited customers."
1971.70-223,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,485.444,486.829,But there is no sign that says so?
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,486.829,489.615,"No, there isn't Your Honor."
1971.70-223,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,858.245,862.435,Was the Babcock parking lot open to the public?
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,862.435,869.648,"No, sir I can't say it was, Your Honor."
1971.70-223,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,880.497,890.279,Would you complain to have the solicitation then just outside the entrance doors to your East and the West doors rather than in parking lot?
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,890.279,892.555,Just outside the doors Your Honor?
1971.70-223,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.802,906.342,You didn't have any sidewalk before the entrance as such?
1971.70-223,0,33922,keith_e_mattern,,906.342,907.056,"No, sir."
1971.70-223,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,921.918,923.965,Mr. Aylward.
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,923.965,930.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.70-223,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,989.693,990.089,What page are you on?
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,990.089,993.407,On of page 84 of the Appendix Your Honor.
1971.70-223,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1123.779,1129.521,Didn't the Board make a finding that there was no other feasible means?
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1129.521,1140.4,"The Board in it's -- it spent 4 pages on analyzing a decision over in the Seventh Circuit, its own decision in Solo Cup case."
1971.70-223,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.113,1218.397,Are the cases cited?
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1218.397,1220.953,Yes they are.
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1276.956,1286.71,"Well in fact, Mr. Aylward, didn't the board do that in this footnote 2 at page A 20 of the petition."
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1286.71,1289.638,"Let me see, I don't have the petition."
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1289.638,1296.243,"I am looking at the board's opinion which they say, they have a footnote, footnote 2."
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1306.161,1306.923,What page Your Honor?
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1306.923,1308.972,That's page A 20.
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1308.972,1317.078,A 20.
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1329.332,1338.029,"What I am really getting at is, didn't they find that this was -- this really showed within Babcock & Wilcox in that footnote at least?"
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1338.029,1340.68,"In this footnote, yes Your Honor."
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1340.68,1343.675,Then why in heaven's name are they relying on Logan Valley in this case?
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1343.675,1352.328,"Well, that's what we -- what we are here for because we don't think that -- we think that really -- if they are going to rely on anything, they should rely on Babcock & Wilcox, that they don't have a --"
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1352.328,1357.764,"Well, it's not whether they have to but I can't understand, well I should ask them I guess something."
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1357.764,1365.296,"Yes Your Honor, I agree, I think the proper precedent here is the Babcock & Wilcox and certainly, they should not be relying on your Logan Valley."
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1368.013,1374.211,"Well, if I had -- if this were presented only as a Babcock case, What would your position be?"
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1374.211,1381.962,"The position is I think we'd want it because I think under Babcock & Wilcox, these people have to come on and they have the burden of proof and certainly we don't."
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1389.975,1392.551,But you wouldn't be faced with that finding?
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1392.551,1393.456,Yes that's right.
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1394.064,1397.492,"Would that present, a Universal Camera problem for you --"
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1397.492,1399.286,I am not familiar with that case Your Honor.
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1399.286,1401.79,Universal Camera surely you are.
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1401.79,1403.076,Which is that one?
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1403.076,1407.459,It's on the scope of review of a board finding in --
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1407.459,1409.999,"Yes, yes Your Honor, I think that would be problem."
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1412.532,1416.892,And it's the basis on which this court was upheld?
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1416.892,1418.805,"No, it was upheld on the --"
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1418.805,1420.011,It was upheld on Logan Valley --
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1420.011,1424.267,"The Logan Valley, that's right Your Honor and we maintained that, that's a misapplication of Logan Valley."
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1424.267,1439.788,"Even if it's relying on Logan Valley, I think it is that if it's public and that if it takes if it's -- if you can fairly say that the facility must be treated as part of the government as subject to the First Amendment."
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1439.788,1459.568,"Yes Your Honor, it's kind of a stretch of the imagination what the equation would be the court here relied on Marsh versus Alabama in which I think it clearly should have and they said the Chickasaw Mobile suburb was equivalent to a town and where else could you find the people in the town but on the public sideways walks down in front of the store."
1971.70-223,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1465.666,1474.702,Lets assume this case had arisen in the parking lot of the shopping center involved in Logan Valley --
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1474.702,1476.729,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-223,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1476.729,1484.068,"There wouldn't be any question, you wouldn't even reach the Babcock & Wilcox situation, would you?"
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1484.068,1487.427,"Well, I think it's a --"
1971.70-223,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1487.427,1491.955,"The Union, would be there at the time that you are exercising free speech rights like anybody else?"
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1491.955,1528.2,"Well, I think really, it doesn't really matter what we call, whether we call it First Amendment rights or we call it Section 7 rights, I think what you are going to wind-up in both situations, what you would wound up in Logan Valley is whether or not those pickets could reasonably communicate their message else where and to the persons to whom they were directed and in that case, you said, although if they were directing in to the patrons of wise market and where else could you find the patrons of wise market than right in front of the market's place and the court, Justice Marshall want to extent after he found that, he said, “Now let's take where else could they be?"
1971.70-223,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1589.758,1592.341,Did they have that list when they first started?
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1592.341,1593.179,I beg your pardon.
1971.70-223,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1593.179,1596.38,Did they have that list when they first started?
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1596.38,1614.656,"Yes Your Honor, I think that the these people, the paid insider that was able to get other people to call in and I think the testimony in the case is that this list had been built up so the time the police force came over they had the list."
1971.70-223,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1614.656,1622.713,"My question was, when they first started talking to the employees in the parking lot, did they have this list?"
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1622.713,1625.152,There is no evidence one way or another in the --
1971.70-223,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1625.152,1628.083,"Well, how could they have made house calls without the list?"
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1628.083,1637.234,"Well that's the point because they had their own testimony brought up by Mr. Mattern, was that they did have the list in order to make the house calls."
1971.70-223,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1637.234,1640.322,I understood him to say that was way late in the game?
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1640.322,1642.522,Two months later.
1971.70-223,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1736.987,1739.627,The trial examiner found just the contrary.
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1739.627,1745.2,"Yes but he found that, Your Honor, in our contention, not based upon any evidence in the record."
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1776.997,1781.643,Was the parking lot here posted?
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1781.643,1783.358,"No Your Honor, in fact --"
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1783.358,1785.964,And did the public use it generally?
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1785.964,1791.584,"No, I don't think as Mr. Mattern says, it was mostly used strictly by our customers and by our employees."
1971.70-223,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1791.584,1795.324,"What I am saying, but it supposed to be done whether it was actually a fact."
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1795.324,1804.448,"Yes the only evidence in the record is a fact that we did control the lot, and no one came there -- there is no evidence of anybody else on to those parking lots other than our customers and employees."
1971.70-223,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1804.448,1806.695,Did you put people off--?
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1806.695,1814.086,"Yes, the record is repeat where we have everyone that's come on there for a non-related business to all type of business."
1971.70-223,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1878.814,1882.344,You're now coming into your rebuttal time.
1971.70-223,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1882.344,1885.736,There were other stores in this center.
1971.70-223,1,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,1885.736,1890.686,"Not on our life and Your Honor, we don't classify it as the center."
1971.70-223,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1933.912,1935.954,Mr. Come?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,1935.954,1941.154,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court."
1971.70-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1942.186,1955.81,"If counsel is right in answer to my question, this is the first case in a long, long time from the Labor Board, where there is no evidence at all to support his findings."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,1955.81,1982.834,"I think that counsel is in error because the trial examiner whose findings were adopted by the Board, found on the basis of the fax in the records some of which I will allude to that the situation is not exactly as my colleague has depicted."
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1982.834,1992.245,As to at least part of it Judge Gibson in the Eight Circuit said there was an absence of evidence on some of the crucial points.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,1992.245,2008.724,"Well, Judge Gibson thought that there was an absence of evidence to sustain the board's finding that there were -- that you couldn't reach these people by alternative channels."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2039.151,2048.447,Am I right that the footnote 2 of page 20 is based on the Babcock finding?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2048.447,2056.004,"That is with respect to one leg of holding in the case, there are really two legs."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2056.004,2057.274,May I ask this Mr. Come?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2057.274,2058.137,Yes.
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2058.137,2059.888,Since you have an enforcement order --
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2059.888,2060.659,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2060.659,2066.873,"If this is sustainable under Babcock, are you entitled of affirmance without reference to the Logan Valley?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2066.873,2077.04,"Yes, the problem with that is, however, that the Eighth Circuit didn't reach the Babcock end of it as I read their opinion, they sustained this on the Logan Valley."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2077.04,2083.551,"So that if we agreed with them on the Logan Valley ground, in order to go back for them then to reconsider it on the Babcock ground."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2083.551,2095.186,Unless the court is persuaded that the facts are so clear and they are simple enough so that remand would not be necessary.
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2095.186,2097.751,"Well, in other words, unless we would decide."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2097.751,2098.39,Yes.
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2098.39,2103.645,We're not waiting for Camera -- is that under Universal Camera?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2103.645,2107.018,"Well, a better practice would probably be the remand if you find it necessary --"
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2107.018,2110.864,"Well, that's what Universal Camera actually require us to make the rule."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2110.864,2127.751,"Well, ordinarily the court does that, we had a case called insurance agents and the independent contractor issue where the court after finding that the Seventh Circuit had applied an erroneous standard, proceeded to evaluate the evidence and enforce the Board's order."
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2181.651,2186.021,"Before you go onto that, how large the parking lot is this, how many cars approximately--?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2186.021,2187.429,Right.
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2187.429,2190.981,How many would you say?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2190.981,2205.057,"Each of the stores is a supermarket type structure, which is about 70,000 square feet, situated on a large expanse of a land, the west store according to the evidence in the records about 5 acres."
1971.70-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2265.244,2266.047,Mr. Come?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2266.047,2266.554,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2266.554,2271.055,Did Schneider versus Irvington deal with private property?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2271.055,2277.815,"No, that dealt with a municipality Your Honor."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2327.373,2351.045,"Mr. Come, just for the whole purpose that you're going into these facts to the horizon to demonstrate this, because the parking lot is open to the public and because of the facts about the parking lot, the owner of the parking lot must be treated as an official."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2351.045,2352.841,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2352.841,2355.793,You're going to have to subject it to the First Amendment.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2355.793,2359.206,"No, Your Honor, I think that --"
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2359.206,2361.97,"Logan Valley was a First Amendment case, wasn't it?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2361.97,2364.035,Logan Valley was a First Amendment case.
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2364.035,2369.457,Could the First Amendment apply to just any private person?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2369.457,2391.287,"No, but the problem under the National Labor Relations Act with regard to equating interpreting Section 7, which gives employees the right to organize through their representatives."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2406.667,2409.06,"This sounds like the other leg of your argument, Babcock?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2409.06,2435.145,"No, Your Honor, because, I submit that Babcock makes it clear that this accommodation must be done with its little dislocation of the one as the other, and that in making the accommodation, the facts of the particular use of the property make a difference."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2445.962,2462.201,"But suppose if the parking lot is open to the public, then what follows in terms of Logan Valley in the First Amendment, does the First Amendment come into play every time you run into a parking lot that is so-called open to the public in front of the retail establishment?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2468.539,2475.093,I don't think that you need to reach the First Amendment problem with respect to the National Labor Relations Act.
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2495.891,2497.842,"Why isn't that Babcock, right?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2498.839,2503.467,It is not Babcock because as we read Babcock--
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2503.467,2507.048,I mean the principle of Babcock is a very balancing test you're talking about.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2507.048,2507.59,Yes.
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2507.59,2510.066,I mean Section 7 and Property right.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2514.409,2515.112,That is correct.
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2515.112,2518.491,"That isn't what the Eighth Circuit did use, is it?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2518.491,2524.426,I think that the Eighth Circuit applied by analogy Logan Valley--
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2524.426,2527.221,And the First Amendment?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2527.221,2533.417,"I don't think so Your Honor, because they sustained the Board's finding, that this was a violation of Section 7."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2586.242,2591.326,More than that because people who are working there are the people involved in this controversy.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2591.326,2596.462,"That is correct, and that's the point that I'm coming to."
1971.70-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2634.112,2645.279,"It's Wilcox or Babcock or some kind of argument Mr. Come, but is it -- I just ask you again, is the First Amendment relevant to this case or not?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2649.221,2652.754,"I am not relying on it directly, Your Honor."
1971.70-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2652.754,2655.631,To any extent I said indirectly or any other way?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2655.631,2660.456,"Well, I think that it's indirectly in this picture in the sense."
1971.70-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2660.456,2670.678,How can it be unless the retail establishment operator is equated to a public body?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2670.678,2681.582,"Well, it is only in this, to the extent that the right to self-organization and the right to have--"
1971.70-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2681.582,2682.606,Statutory right.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2682.606,2684.418,The statutory right.
1971.70-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2695.452,2710.191,"That's viz-a-viz government, that's viz-a-viz the state, that's Thomas against Collins as my brother White says the First and Fourteenth Amendments don't come into play, unless or until it's governmental action that suppresses free speech."
1971.70-223,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2710.191,2718.499,"Well, this governmental action here because somebody has stopped the picketing, or has refused to stop the picketing."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2718.499,2740.423,"Well, I think that for purposes of our position in this case, I do not have to establish that the right of the union organizers to get on this property is mandated by the First Amendment."
1971.70-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.423,2747.262,"But to the extent that you rely on Logan Valley, you rely on the First Amendment, do you not, do you not?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2747.262,2749.924,No.
1971.70-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2749.924,2750.961,Alright.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2750.961,2772.295,I am using the principle that Logan Valley established for purposes of the First Amendment by analogy for making a reasonable balance of organizational rights and property rights for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act.
1971.70-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2797.116,2807.266,"Are we to read the Eighth Circuit decision, as resting on the argument that you're now making to us?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2807.266,2812.512,"That is the way I read the Eighth Circuit's opinion, Your Honor, but --"
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2812.512,2827.669,"So whether I label that Babcock or not, the point is that your insistence is that just balancing, is what the Eighth Circuit did, and enforcing the Board's order, it's entitled to affirmance on that ground."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2827.669,2828.558,"Yes, Your Honor and I think --"
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2828.558,2831.336,They can forget all about the First Amendment in this case.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2831.336,2845.787,"I think that, that you can do so because all we have to establish here is not a violation of a First Amendment, but a violation of Section --"
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2845.787,2853.736,"Or is it just Mr. Come, you've to got establish at least for me, you've got to persuade me that's what the Eighth Circuit did."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,2853.736,2880.712,"Well, I think -- well, the Eighth Circuit had before it a Board order which was premised on the ground that there was an evasion, a violation of Section 8(a)(1) of the Act, which makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to restrain or interfere the employees and the exercise of their organizational rights."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3073.157,3077.027,"Or they had a spy on the payroll of the company, didn't they?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3077.027,3080.192,They had an employee who was also a Union Organization --
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3080.192,3081.112,Getting full time pay for Union --
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3081.112,3081.924,However.
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3081.924,3086.658,"And getting full time pay from the company, and the company didn't know that he was an Union employee."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3096.316,3113.717,"That is correct, however the testimony of the Union organizer which was credited by the examiner, was that, the bulk of the names and address came from contact on the parking lot."
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3113.717,3123.284,Mr. Come you just said that the parking lot by its very nature was a place of commotion and movement.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3158.705,3161.706,"Well I suppose that, that could be a one way of --"
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3161.706,3163.719,How else would you do it?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3164.499,3178.168,"Well, he could go to a State Court and attempt to get an injunction, if he found that there was activity that was interfering with his operation."
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3180.253,3187.246,Why should he have to do that on tract private property; a property that's maintained for his customers.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3187.246,3203.72,"Well the question, the question is whether or not by opening it at up for the public he is not narrowed his property interest to the point where he cannot at least impose a blanket ban."
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3203.72,3210.342,How do you make that -- do you raise that question under Logan Valley or under Babcock.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3228.77,3239.083,"Well, I am relying on Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act because I think that, that is what we have in this case."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3256.395,3269.895,"Just to make it clear what's the Board's position is, with respect to parking lot, I take it and what the trial examiner said that whatever he said was adopted by the board."
1971.70-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.212,3308.35,For the purpose of a labor dispute.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3308.35,3309.836,Yes Your Honor.
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3309.836,3311.116,That is the Board's position.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3311.116,3312.289,At least where --
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3312.289,3315.688,If you have a parking lot then you have a different situation than Babcock.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3315.688,3338.723,"Well, that is correct, at least where the dimensions of the parking lot are such that it creates a substantial buffer zone, between the store and the nearest, closest public place where you could appeal to the audience that you are appealing to."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3371.781,3382.914,"You just simply have the different factor to put in the balance when you have a public parking lot, that when you had attempts to isolated parking lots at a plane."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3382.914,3383.826,That is correct.
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3383.826,3388.094,And it makes a different balance between inaccessibility and --
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3388.094,3389.181,Well only -- it only --
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3389.181,3390.907,A burden on the parking lot.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3390.907,3401.094,"That is correct, and it also raises the question as to whether you have to really bear down so strongly on inaccessibility."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3401.094,3401.615,That's right.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3401.615,3402.137,Yes.
1971.70-223,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3402.137,3411.628,"Well, I suppose, that no one would object if the employee crossed the parking lot in order to go to work, no doubt."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3411.628,3414.828,"No, he does that -- he does that even parking car on the parking lot."
1971.70-223,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3414.828,3420.638,"If he comes reverently, and obediently and submissively, but he comes in protest then he can't do it."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3420.638,3422.408,"That is it, Your Honor, I think that's something --"
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3422.408,3428.551,"Well, are these employees who were trying to come on this parking lot or are they strangers?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3428.551,3431.39,These are outside organizers.
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3431.39,3443.021,"So that the employees crossing that lot are using the lot for the precise purpose that the employer, put it there, is he not?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3443.021,3447.106,The employee is using it using it to go to work --
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3447.106,3455.029,You told us that the that about more or less a 100 parking spaces were set aside by the employer for the use of the employees.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3455.029,3483.381,"That is correct, and the question is however, that on one leg of the company's argument here, as I understand it, it would have been all right here had the Union put up a picket line, that appealed to the consuming public and urged them not to patronize this store, because of its non-union conditions."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3514.402,3520.426,"Well I thought, if these had been employees, you have Republic Aviation, then you wouldn't even be here?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3520.426,3521.708,"No, but in Logan Valley --"
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3521.708,3523.063,"These are non-employees, are they not?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3523.063,3526.422,"In the Logan Valley, you didn't have employees either."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3533.139,3548.855,"And that was a constitutional decision, and it had to rest upon a finding, that the people who suppressed that demonstration was equivalent of government or else it could not have been a constitutional decision."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3548.855,3550.723,No Your Honor I do not --
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3550.723,3552.979,Have you read the First and the Fourteenth Amendment?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3552.979,3558.138,"Yes I know that, that requires a state as far the --"
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3558.138,3566.798,"As far as Section 7 goes, you wouldn't make it difficult, it was an employee or employee's representative."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3566.798,3572.586,Babcock does make a distinction with respect to close premises.
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3573.409,3578.627,The public got away from Babcock and Logan Plaza.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3578.627,3585.303,"I so read Logan Plaza, but that of course is the problem that we have here."
1971.70-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3585.303,3592.376,"Although I must say that, Babcock is not mentioned in anyone of the four, five opinions that is written."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3592.376,3630.968,"However it was certainly called to this Court's attention and it was distinguished on the very grounds that I am now urging by the prevailing parties in Logan Valley but I think the short answer to it is the reason why it wasn't mentioned, was the one that Justice White, at least propounded that a different balance is called for where you have open property than when you have the kind of closed property that you --"
1971.70-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3630.968,3634.046,You did the trial examiner or the board said?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3634.046,3636.772,"I think that you can from the trial, I get --"
1971.70-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3636.772,3639.573,It is quite articulated.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3639.573,3647.719,"I think that the trial examiner comes very, very close to articulating it the way I do."
1971.70-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3647.719,3653.216,(Inaudible).
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3653.216,3663.923,"Well, I think that he has two sections of his report, one which deals with the Babcock point and the other with the second ground."
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3663.923,3664.812,Mr. Come?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3664.812,3666.737,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3666.737,3669.875,"Go ahead, Justice Blackmun."
1971.70-223,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3669.875,3673.529,"If you prevail here, what is the practical result?"
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3691.989,3742.936,"I don't think so because I think that if they were to do that, the Union organizers would still have the right to appear -- try to reach the employees on the public portions of the property because I think that you would still be faced with the problem of the employer who has opened up his property to those members of the public that he prefers and is closed it to another segment of the public which has a message that is equally as germane to the purpose of the business."
1971.70-223,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3743.569,3746.89,"But they wouldn't have the right to go into the closed portion, would they?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3746.89,3768.119,"They would not have the right to go into the closed portion but if he does not permit them into the closed portion, I submit that the result would be that he would have to be subjected to the activity on the open portion."
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3768.119,3768.906,Mr. Come.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3768.906,3791.838,"He could minimize the amount of disruption, I don't want to use that word but dislocation by how close he would permit the Union to reach the employees, we have that problem in the secondary (Inaudible)."
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3791.838,3829.391,"Mr. Come after Justice Blackmun's fences up around the parking lot for the employees with appropriate signs, suppose then the owner builds a fence around the entire parking area and puts up signs for customers only, non-customers and others will be toed away at the expense of the owner of the car, parking lot exclusively for customers of this store, now what kind of a case do you have then?"
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3843.794,3847.311,"Well, I think that the word disruption is not --"
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3847.311,3852.485,"Let's just say, we have nine or ten of them circulating around whatever that produces."
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3852.485,3875.643,"I might point out, Your Honor, that there were 6 to 13 in Logan Valley, and there is no showing in the record here that these nine were only there for a part of the time wherever present all at the same time on the parking lot and there were nine in the area but the record does not show that they were all present."
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3875.643,3877.689,What do these signs do?
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3884.393,3902.687,"Well, I think in terms of the argument that I have been making, I don't think that that would alter the fundamental balance, however, that is not this case."
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3938.232,3944.696,You are suggesting that the owner of the store can't discriminate between customers and non-customers.
1971.70-223,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3944.696,3954.621,Not where the non-customers have a purpose germane to the operation of the store as we have here.
1971.70-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3954.621,3959.204,"Thank you, Mr. Come."
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,3973.558,3975.147,"Thank you, Sir."
1971.70-223,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4094.335,4099.08,Would you say then it is the First Amendment that requires the permission of this Union activity here?
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4099.08,4101.415,"Sir, there are two answers to that."
1971.70-223,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4125.837,4139.067,"It's not coextensive, even apart from governmental and private action, it doesn't -- Section 7 doesn't get into the area of the part of obscenity, for example."
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4139.067,4146.584,But every area in which free speech is relevant to a labor dispute is coextensive and that's all we have to have.
1971.70-223,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4146.584,4156.939,But there was a very big difference you've already mentioned that the First and Fourteenth Amendment protect against governmental action in Section 7 is a statutory right as against an employer.
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4156.939,4176.974,"Right, but if Section 7 does, as we maintain incorporate the First Amendment with respect to what an employer may or may not do, then Section 7 reaches employer private action by virtue of Congress saying, in Section 7 “We adopt the First Amendment rights insofar as they relate to labor disputes.”"
1971.70-223,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4224.432,4231.209,"Am I getting messed up with semantics, you keep saying First Amendment rights, do you mean freedom of speech?"
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4231.209,4232.157,That's exactly what I mean.
1971.70-223,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4232.157,4235.001,"Well, why don't you say Freedom of Speech."
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4235.001,4247.898,"I am sorry Sir, that's what I should say because the element of what Section 7 protects here is self organization, which means speaking, talking to people and that's what section 7 protects, that's what the First Amendment protects."
1971.70-223,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4259.899,4275.313,"Mr. Dunau, go back to your illustration about introducing state action by virtue of having the policemen them out and suppose the owner of the store goes out and personally ejects, then you haven't any state action I suppose you would agree."
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4275.313,4276.672,That's correct.
1971.70-223,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4276.672,4277.904,Then what do you have?
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4277.904,4283.712,Then you have Section 7 which incorporates the free speech protections of the First Amendment.
1971.70-223,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4313.323,4318.969,But if you rest that on the free speech Mr. Dunau.
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4326.611,4328.321,"No, sir."
1971.70-223,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4328.321,4332.38,Is the First Amendment only an outdoor activity or it is inside too?
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4332.38,4341.415,"Sir, the First Amendment applies wherever it is appropriate to exercise the right of free speech."
1971.70-223,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4441.052,4451.856,Or you are saying that the employer may do no more to restrict speech than might the Government and whatever the Government can't do the employers do.
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4451.856,4453.198,"Exactly Sir, yes Sir."
1971.70-223,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4473.327,4476.145,This should lead you to say that Babcock was wrong.
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4476.145,4476.904,"No, sir."
1971.70-223,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4505.042,4513.877,"But if you are relying on Section 7, I don't see what difference it makes whether it's open or closed from the point of view of your argument under Section-7?"
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4513.877,4519.243,"Well, if I may say so Your Honor, there has been a suggestion in this case."
1971.70-223,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4538.91,4546.872,"Well, the difficultly is the Board made that contention in Babcock and Wilcox, and laws."
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4546.872,4551.284,"But it made it in a case, in which the property was closed."
1971.70-223,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4554.767,4558.759,"From the point of view of Section 7, what difference does it make, if your argument is correct."
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4558.759,4559.598,Alright Sir.
1971.70-223,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4559.598,4562.517,The employer has no more right than Government has to.
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4562.517,4570.18,Suppose we take the Babcock and Wilcox standard and ignore the distinction between openness and close.
1971.70-223,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4602.835,4606.85,"Well, is the store any less open that the parking lots?"
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4606.85,4608.292,The inside of the store?
1971.70-223,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4608.292,4608.532,Yes.
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4608.532,4609.35,The inside of the store.
1971.70-223,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4609.35,4611.282,Don't you invite the same people in?
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4611.282,4622.2,"Sir, there is a functional difference between what you can do inside a store and what you can do outside of the store, it's based on the use to which the property is put."
1971.70-223,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4622.2,4623.951,Who say that?
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4628.62,4637.057,"I think this court will say it, whenever it gets a First Amendment case in which an employee tries to picket inside the store."
1971.70-223,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4669.643,4677.965,Didn't we have a library case dealt with the First Amendment rights inside a library?
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4677.965,4678.908,You did Your Honor but...
1971.70-223,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4678.908,4680.295,(Voice Overlap) What could be done?
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4680.295,4687.227,All it does is being back a spark as to whether you could or could not eject someone from the library but I just don't remember well enough gentlemen.
1971.70-223,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4687.227,4697.012,"But I thought we made it to the distinction there between exercising First Amendment rights inside which would be parallel of which you're talking about, wouldn't it?"
1971.70-223,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,4698.498,4701.816,Inside is simply not the same thing as outside.
1971.70-223,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4781.594,4784.682,I think you are well over your time now.
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,4795.521,4799.462,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.70-223,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4953.474,4962.539,I take it you don't fundamentally disagree with Mr. Dunau that Section 7 applies the First Amendment to private employees.
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,4962.539,4965.032,"No, I don't have any problem with that."
1971.70-223,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4967.306,4970.975,"In which event Logan Plaza really is rather irrelevant, isn't it?"
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,4970.975,4972.689,"Yes, it is Your Honor."
1971.70-223,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4975.624,4986.394,"And it's really just an excuse to, this is really sort of a some background, to make a different rule in this kind of a case and in the Babcock case."
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,4986.394,4996.783,"Well, I think we've been unjustly put upon when they say we try to draw the difference of a picket having a superior right than viewing the organizer coming on."
1971.70-223,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5008.038,5010.174,There is a time and place problem.
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,5010.174,5012.701,There is a time and place and that's what Babcock says.
1971.70-223,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5025.009,5037.311,So you apparently agree that Section 7 does give employees and organizers and unions some approach to a place like this that non-labor related people wouldn't have.
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,5039.927,5042.185,"Absolutely, because I think you have a statute."
1971.70-223,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5054.877,5063.415,This isn't the case of anybody claiming that this store owner is subject to the First Amendment.
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,5066.079,5067.413,"Yes, that's what we're charged with."
1971.70-223,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5157.675,5168.487,"I thought Mr. Come indicated that if you did fence it in and put all these restrictive signs on, the situation might be different."
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,5168.487,5172.742,I don't know why because I don't see how he can overcome the question.
1971.70-223,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5223.104,5229.667,One thing is true in Logan Valley that is that all opinions didn't -- none of them mentioned that --
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,5229.667,5231.293,Yes and probably say because I think --
1971.70-223,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5231.293,5234.132,And there is one thing in common.
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,5234.132,5235.907,"Yeah, that's right."
1971.70-223,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5271.124,5275.554,"But we are not sure, whether this is a Logan Valley case or a Babcock case."
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,5275.554,5283.948,"Well, I don't you think it really makes any difference because I think the sole criteria in both cases is whether you get the message across some where else."
1971.70-223,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5285.147,5319.269,"The whole point of course in Logan Valley in showing the public characteristics and attributes of that shopping center was to make it equivalent of the company town in Marsh against Alabama in which in turn it had decided that the company town is like any -- like a municipal, convectional municipal town and therefore is a state within the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment in return incorporates the free speech protections of the First Amendment."
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,5334.449,5335.933,Exactly Your Honor because --
1971.70-223,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5335.933,5338.083,"No, it does make a difference (Voice Overlap)"
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,5338.083,5340.959,Where is it more appropriate than on the streets and on the sidewalks.
1971.70-223,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5388.873,5390.312,And this is what Babcock tells?
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,5390.312,5392.255,And this is what Babcock tells us.
1971.70-223,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5396.933,5399.124,The very same kind of means that are present here.
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,5399.124,5401.249,The very same kind.
1971.70-223,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5407.715,5417.694,"But the invasion, the burden on the employers is different here than Babcock?"
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,5417.694,5419.422,Why do you say that Sir?
1971.70-223,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5419.422,5421.96,Well parking lots open to the public.
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,5421.96,5422.88,"Oh, I see."
1971.70-223,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5424.403,5427.44,"Under what rule, it's just opened -- I mean it's just."
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,5427.44,5432.169,In our case it's not open to the public because the record is repeat and has --
1971.70-223,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5432.169,5447.393,"I will put it this way, a manufacturing establishment has a much more limited clientèle coming to them, there may be an establishment that will take anybody as a customer."
1971.70-223,4,33922,keith_e_mattern,,5447.393,5448.229,Alright.
1971.70-223,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5448.229,5449.243,Well that's all I'm saying.
1971.70-223,5,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,5449.243,5452.977,"Alright, let me give you the case of People versus (Inaudible)."
1971.70-223,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5498.36,5500.741,Are you suggesting something?
1971.70-223,5,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,5500.741,5504.883,Yes and I think it might.
1971.70-223,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5524.272,5532.299,That place in Adderley would go in one section of your parking lot.
1971.70-223,5,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,5532.299,5535.666,I don't know how large that lot was Your Honor.
1971.70-223,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5537.78,5539.368,As small as you can get.
1971.70-223,5,38566,ronald_l_aylward,,5539.368,5545.437,"Well five acres is pretty small when you take a 70,000 square foot store on."
1971.70-223,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5545.437,5546.358,Thank you Mr. Aylward.
