1970.95,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,26.675,"We’ll hear arguments in Number 95, Wisconsin against Constantineau."
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,30.034,33.333,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.95,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,193.867,195.581,Mr. Southwick.
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,195.581,197.336,Mr. Justice Black?
1970.95,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,197.336,201.983,The plaintiff here is a woman.
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,213.68,215.667,Not under the statute your honor.
1970.95,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,215.667,218.62,Does this raise an equal protection argument?
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,218.62,224.09,I think there maybe some problems with that but I don’t believe that they’re present in this case.
1970.95,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,224.09,232.616,May I ask whether am I correct in my impression that Wisconsin has a dram shop statute?
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,232.616,236.207,Not to my knowledge your honor.
1970.95,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,240.594,248.924,"I was fairly certain it did have one and my question was that, you know what a dram shop statute is in the mid western sense anyway, it --"
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,248.924,250.846,I believe that imposes liability on a bartender?
1970.95,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,250.846,256.69,"Yes, for sale to one obviously intoxicated, usually arises in the automobile accident context."
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,256.69,259.966,It’s my opinion that Wisconsin Mr. Justice Blackmun does not have such a statute.
1970.95,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,259.966,261.051,Did not have one?
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,261.051,262.245,Yes.
1970.95,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,266.048,273.94,I just want to -- are there any other findings here as to this petitioner has said must precede (inaudible).
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,273.94,275.816,"The findings are not set forth, no."
1970.95,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,276.24,277.392,There’s no where in the record?
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,277.392,286.359,"There is nothing in the record although the deposition was taken later on of the lady, the appellee Mrs. Constantineau who was a -- who these standards were found."
1970.95,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,286.359,294.962,"Now, I gather what you told us this scheme requires the police chief or some other official to make these findings before the note is sent?"
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,294.962,295.54,That is correct.
1970.95,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,305.964,308.82,Where does it (Inaudible) that he in fact made an appointment?
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,308.82,315.137,"Well, he made the finding in the sense that he did issue notice to the bartenders in the City of Hartford, Wisconsin."
1970.95,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,315.137,319.237,We are therefore to assume that he must have made the necessary findings?
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,319.237,321.572,"That’s correct, that’s correct Mr. Justice Brennan."
1970.95,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,321.572,324.041,You mean the findings are implicit in the conclusion?
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,324.041,326.266,That’s correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.95,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,326.538,327.33,"Mr. Southwick, what --"
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,327.33,327.427,I beg --
1970.95,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,327.427,330.258,What do you think is the purpose of the statute?
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,330.258,342.135,The purpose of the statute is I think a very legitimate one which is to regulate and to delimit the noxious effects which alcoholic beverages can have upon individuals.
1970.95,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,342.135,347.243,Do you think it is protective of the individual posted as well as the community?
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,347.243,355.287,"I would certainly say that that’s case Mr. Justice Blackmun, certainly of his family and of the community in which he resides as well."
1970.95,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,355.287,358.165,Do you know of any other states which have a comparable statute?
1970.95,0,18041,benjamin_southwick,,358.165,374.937,"I have set them forth in the appendix (e) of my jurisdictional statement Mr. Justice Blackmun, there are 15 other states which have a similar statute which do not provide as this case does not -- this statute in Wisconsin does not provide for a hearing or notice of intention posed to the individual."
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2036.455,2039.554,"I will Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2052.841,2054.391,How many are they?
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2054.391,2060.17,"There were about 17 taverns and about 20 or 15, 20 liquor stores in this community about five—"
1970.95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2060.17,2064.649,"What would they do in Milwaukee when this arises, you probably have several thousand of them there."
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2064.649,2076.536,"Yes, but I haven’t known of it arising in Milwaukee, it’s only used in the smaller communities where there is probably a more feasible means of controlling it."
1970.95,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2097.882,2099.589,What about the Twentieth Amendment?
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2099.589,2101.187,Pardon me your honor.
1970.95,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2101.187,2103.743,Wouldn’t you think the 21st Amendment had anything to do with this?
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2103.743,2119.021,"If it did your honor Justice Black it won’t be in favor of our case and we did not plead anything with respect to the 21st Amendment, that would be, if it was relevant which the state has brought up would certainly be a factor on their behalf."
1970.95,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2153.871,2159.309,Have you published the state law under which he claimed to exercise that power?
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2159.309,2160.383,Have we published a state law?
1970.95,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2160.383,2162.284,Did you publish in your brief?
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2162.284,2165.436,"No, the state has done that in their appendix."
1970.95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2171.262,2207.025,"Among your constitutional right while we have here just pausing for a moment only last 1969 term, less than a year ago, important federal constitutional claims were raised by some people in the fishing business in Alaska and this Court said that the District Court should have abstained from considering it until the state courts construed, state courts of Alaska had construed their own statute, why shouldn’t the District Court here have abstained until the state courts of Wisconsin have decided to what this statute meant?"
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2207.025,2218.489,"Because your honor Mr. chief Justice, I think it’s well-established in a law when a substantial federal question is raised and a three-judge court has convened, that court can in its own discretion listen to the issues presented."
1970.95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2218.489,2224.227,"Well, but would you negate the abstention doctrine entirely?"
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2224.227,2232.186,"Well, I would not negate it entirely but I would rather put it in a discretionary manner with the United States District Courts especially when there’s a three-judge court."
1970.95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2276.758,2283.744,"Sometime we think that they don’t exercise that discretion, should we enough, we give them some help lines."
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2283.744,2288.349,"Yes your honor, I would go up with that statement."
1970.95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2304.558,2315.409,"Would it make any difference if this were the mayor of the town of Hartford since you emphasized the public officials, does he have a different right from this lady?"
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2315.409,2325.168,"He would have — there would be a right to criticize his actions, his behavior because he is a public official under the New York Times rule."
1970.95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2325.168,2327.69,Could you criticize him by posting him?
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2327.69,2337.116,"That under this law the chief of police could if he dared to do so, but the liability of the chief of police might be different because the mayor is a public official."
1970.95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2344.557,2353.278,And that might affect his right to collect damages but I can’t see what it would have to do with the constitutional issues involved here?
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2353.278,2370.292,"Well, under the First Amendment we have to remember Mr. Chief Justice that free speech and with respect to the criticism of public officials is something that is almost — what is the last thing next to something that is absolute."
1970.95,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.402,2428.485,"Of course, aren’t there limitations to what you’ve just said that one can be committed for the most states anyway for being waster of his substance?"
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2428.485,2432.107,"Well, he can be prosecuted in Wisconsin for non-support."
1970.95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2444.022,2450.173,"If the state had a statute, you say it was indicated in Wisconsin does not have the dram statute."
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2450.173,2450.561,That’s correct —-
1970.95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2450.561,2459.539,But in the state which had the statute giving the bartender the power to decide that a given person has had enough or too much?
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2459.539,2460.304,Right.
1970.95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2460.304,2471.54,Then hasn’t the state vested in that bartender not only the power but a duty to in effect stigmatize them by saying I’m not going to say to you anymore?
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2471.54,2472.261,Well it has —
1970.95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2472.261,2474.961,Those statutes would fall too then wouldn’t they on your theory?
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2474.961,2478.839,Not unless a public declaration of the effect would be made because —-
1970.95,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2478.839,2488.46,"It's pretty public if he says it in the bar with 29 people that line up at the bar that, “I’m not going to let you have anymore drinks you have too much”?"
1970.95,1,41992,s_a_schapiro,,2488.46,2494.455,"But then your honor, it’s the citizens own acts in becoming intoxicated that’s discredited himself not the bartender’s."
1970.95,2,18041,benjamin_southwick,,3029.651,3030.147,Thank you Mr. Schapiro.
1970.95,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3030.147,3032.758,This posting is good for a year?
1970.95,2,18041,benjamin_southwick,,3032.758,3034.299,"Yes, Mr. Justice Douglas but the year was --"
1970.95,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3034.299,3040.263,"Before the year is up, can the man who does the posting un-post it?"
1970.95,2,18041,benjamin_southwick,,3040.263,3049.236,"He did in this case when the lower court ordered him to but whether or not he could, the statute doesn’t provide any mechanism for him to do so."
1970.95,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3058.085,3059.4,Thank you Mr. Schapiro.
