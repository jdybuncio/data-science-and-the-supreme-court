1996.95-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.147,"Well, we'll hear argument now in Number 95-728, Warner-Jenkinson Company, Inc., v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co.--"
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,10.429,12.682,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,48.065,50.236,"Factual inquiry, Mr. Taranto."
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,52.137,57.532,"The pH is a measure of the acidity of a solution, which ordinarily--"
1996.95-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,57.532,57.782,Thank you.
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,57.782,62.497,"--stands for the potential of hydrogen, so that wine would be very acidic, water not at all, et cetera."
1996.95-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,62.497,65.98,"But the lower the pH, the higher the acidity?"
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,65.98,66.521,Yes.
1996.95-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,66.521,68.174,So it's that kind of measure.
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,68.174,69.213,"It's upside down that way, yes."
1996.95-728,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,95.07,98.172,Does that raise... I'm sorry.
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,168.87,180.607,"Well, I think that the fundamental point is that it's in the PTO that the process of negotiating about proper breadth can and does take place."
1996.95-728,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,261.839,285.236,"Well, I think it's still the case... accepting everything you say, as I understand your position, it's still the case that when the PTO is perhaps asleep at the switch and it let's a claim through which in fact is broader than would ultimately prevail, that is the one case in which in your fallback position the doctrine of substantial equivalents would be recognized, is that correct?"
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,285.236,286.397,"--Well, that's right."
1996.95-728,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,286.668,286.988,Yes.
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,286.988,307.003,"--The narrower ground, the prosecution history estoppel ground, in this case applies only where there's a rejection of a broader claim, or a claim that then introduces a limit, and the patent applicant has bypassed the appeal mechanism for challenging that."
1996.95-728,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,325.633,328.425,"And that wouldn't be good enough for you, I mean, on your fallback position."
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,336.603,337.942,--That equivalents would not be recognized?
1996.95-728,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,337.942,338.162,That's right.
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,338.162,339.023,That would be okay for--
1996.95-728,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,339.023,339.484,Yes.
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,339.484,340.693,--For my position.
1996.95-728,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,340.693,340.934,Sure.
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,340.934,341.445,Right.
1996.95-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,396.051,404.586,"Mr. Taranto, you've said... maybe I have it wrong... that the PTO made a mistake of fact as to the 6 and above."
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,404.586,406.456,"--I'm sorry, I--"
1996.95-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,406.456,423.257,"So what you're saying about the... when the PTO makes it precise, that's it and you can't have any doctrine of equivalents, but wasn't there a difference between requiring 9 and under and the 6?"
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,427.761,428.211,--Right.
1996.95-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,434.555,434.726,No.
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,435.437,436.979,"Oh, the Federal circuit did, yes."
1996.95-728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,436.979,456.451,"--thinking that 6 had nothing to do with the PTO's concern, but if the PTO did have a concern and insisted on the number 6 being put in, approximately 6, that concern was different than the prior art ruled out a patent or a number higher than 9."
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,456.451,456.732,Yes.
1996.95-728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.201,468.942,Higher than that?
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,468.942,469.823,--Higher than 6.
1996.95-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,494.518,497.69,"What would happen if... this is a hypothetical case, not this case."
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,531.447,532.346,Right.
1996.95-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,537.301,538.163,Let's... this is a hypothetical.
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,538.163,538.29,--Right.
1996.95-728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.41,583.073,Is that a proper use of purpose?
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,594.36,595.281,"No, I--"
1996.95-728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.281,598.323,"Don't both patents have the same purpose, namely, of filtering?"
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,598.323,598.733,--Right.
1996.95-728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.423,614.632,"Yes, I mean that."
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,620.186,624.89,"Well, I'm in the position of being uncertain exactly what does make a difference."
1996.95-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,640.271,663.287,"--But if you don't have the equivalents doctrine, then, in the example that you and I have just discussed you have to do one of two things, limit your patent to the most efficient range, or (b)... and suffer infringers, and suffer alleged infringers, or (b) expand the patent to an inefficient zone."
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,663.287,664.277,"--Right, and I--"
1996.95-728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,664.277,667.059,And it seems to me the equivalents doctrine protects against that.
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,667.059,669.89,"--Well, I... let me try to answer that."
1996.95-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,708.548,719.444,"Mr. Taranto, on your fallback position where you're talking about the PTO insisting on a limit, how much kind of analogy to legislative history are we letting ourselves in for there?"
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,723.987,738.059,"--No, I think not, and I think that's a principal reason why our position is that looking behind the insistence on a limit for the reason for that insistence is not a good idea in an infringement action because it often will not be clear--"
1996.95-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,738.059,742.9,"Well, can you always find, in the PTO history, the insistence on a limit?"
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,752.757,755.719,--I think always would be too strong.
1996.95-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,813.046,826.515,"Mr. Taranto, perhaps I should ask your opponent this rather than you, but if it was essential that there be a lower limit on the pH, how can it be that the injunction takes away the lower limit entirely, if I read it correctly?"
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,826.515,831.027,"--Right, it does, and we've scratched our heads about that as well."
1996.95-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,851.781,858.367,"But see, the puzzling thing about it is, the court of appeals seems to think 5.0 is equivalent to 6.0."
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,858.367,860.586,--That it makes no scientific difference.
1996.95-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.586,864.139,Makes no... but then the district court seemed to think 0.0 would also be equivalent.
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,867.833,872.865,"I think that is a fair reading of what the district court... what the district court did, yes."
1996.95-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,916.663,922.947,"What does that do to Graver and to the cases that it relied on, going way back into the 19th Century?"
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,922.947,926.1,"Well, let me talk about Graver in particular."
1996.95-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1029.186,1036.021,"When you begin to talk abut a case on its facts, that always suggests that you either want to limit it or overrule it."
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1036.021,1036.303,Yes.
1996.95-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.958,1059.959,You're talking about the manganese and the... and disclosure in Graver?
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1059.959,1061.181,"The manganese, that's right."
1996.95-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1061.181,1065.143,"Which, of course, would have made the patent invalid if it had been exposed, because it was part of the prior art."
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1065.143,1071.518,"Well, that wasn't apparently part of what was in issue in this Court at the time."
1996.95-728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.518,1073.28,"In other words, they never answered Justice Douglas."
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1073.28,1088.48,"Right, and then the case did continue for a dozen years where that question was raised again, but the basic requirement that the patent itself somewhere must disclose the equivalent is entirely consistent with Graver."
1996.95-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1088.48,1090.182,Why is it that Graver should be limited?
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1098.728,1105.644,"Well, I don't think that a departure from it needs to take place, depending on how broadly one reads it."
1996.95-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1189.128,1192.611,But that was decided several years before Graver.
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1192.611,1221.301,"--Right, but Graver is entirely consistent with that, and what we're suggesting is that Graver is properly read as consistent with that, rather than a broader version which would say that every other inventor, every competitor, when reading the patent, has not only to understand its terms to know where the boundary lines are, but also has to undertake experiments to see whether a change, a ten-factor change of the pH from 6 down to 5 would change the functioning of the process."
1996.95-728,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1221.301,1234.379,"So if the... counsel cannot foresee every possible circumstance in which this invention could be used, and a new circumstance arises, one that the Patent Office had thought it wouldn't work."
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1246.73,1247.15,"Well, the--"
1996.95-728,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1247.15,1249.091,How can counsel foresee everything?
1996.95-728,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1249.091,1253.852,"--Well, counsel can't foresee everything, but the patentees themselves have a number of protections."
1996.95-728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1316.564,1318.214,"Very well, Mr. Taranto."
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1319.636,1332.014,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-728,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1408.304,1427.806,"Well, if we assume, Mr. Wallace, that there should be a doctrine of equivalents, and that the pH 5 procedure here probably should qualify under it, what should be the division of function between the judge and the jury?"
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1431.759,1450.803,"--Well, we... we spoke in a very qualified way in only one footnote of our brief, footnote 3, to that because the Markman decision was pending before the Court at the time we filed, and we felt that that would shed considerable light on it."
1996.95-728,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1499.844,1504.058,"Well, what is left, then, for the jury in coming to the ultimate conclusion of infringement?"
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1505.77,1512.053,"--In some cases there will not be anything left for the jury, just as was recognized in Markman."
1996.95-728,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1512.764,1519.229,"Well, and on the reasoning of Markman, are we in a position to take from the jury the ultimate issue?"
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1519.229,1519.64,--Well--
1996.95-728,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1519.64,1520.692,I should have thought not.
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1520.692,1525.246,"--It depends on what is factually disputed, Mr. Justice."
1996.95-728,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1581.854,1593.46,"But in a case in which there was no question, let's say, about the pH level in fact of the alleged infringer's process, then the jury verdict would be a pure formality."
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1593.46,1598.625,"That would be true under Markman with respect to literal infringement, also, if--"
1996.95-728,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1598.625,1612.513,"In this case, then, the court should have... or could have instructed the jury, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I instruct you as a matter of law that the process when used at level 5 is within the scope of the patent under the equivalents doctrine?"
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1612.513,1624.411,--That is in our view a determination for the court to make in defining the scope of protection of that element of the patent claim.
1996.95-728,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1624.411,1636.309,"Mr. Wallace, may I just clarify one thing, because what you've said is substantially different from what I gathered from your footnote, and it is different from what Judges Plager and Lourie said."
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1671.043,1684.751,"I think that the equitable origins of the doctrine of equivalents in affording a remedy, the equitable nature of it is relevant, and--"
1996.95-728,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1684.751,1700.873,"That I don't follow, Mr. Wallace, because as I understand, this was a courtmade doctrine developed for cases, could be applied in a case where injunctive relief was sought, could be applied where legal relief was sought, and--"
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1700.873,1701.705,--That is correct.
1996.95-728,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1701.705,1708.549,--It wasn't an equitable remedy to relieve the rigors of the harsh common law system.
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1714.323,1724.081,"Well, we recognize that the doctrine has been applied in what used to be considered common law causes of action for damages for infringement, which is--"
1996.95-728,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1724.081,1726.802,"And Story, I take it, is authority for the fact that it always was."
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1726.802,1738.669,"--And these are the reasons why I stated our position the way I did, that this is largely a matter of claim interpretation, which is the first thing we said in that footnote."
1996.95-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1755.6,1761.334,"May I ask this question, Mr Wallace: what is the Government's position with regard... I assume the judge is going to make the decision now."
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1768.2,1776.257,"--We... our position is at the time of infringement, not at the... not at the time of trial, but not at the time--"
1996.95-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1776.257,1778.568,"But not at the time the patent issued, either."
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1778.568,1778.838,"--the patent issued, either."
1996.95-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1778.838,1786.001,"If it was not apparent at the time the patent issued, it nevertheless could become equivalent by later... because of later learning?"
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1786.001,1789.304,Because... that's right.
1996.95-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1795.73,1806.617,"So that if the infringement action... say you have continuing development, it might be that at one time 5 would be equivalent, a few years later, 4 might be equivalent, and then today you could have no lower limit."
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1807.838,1808.639,--Well--
1996.95-728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1808.639,1810.261,"That's the Government's view, isn't it?"
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1810.261,1843.033,"--the utility of the doctrine is whether somebody at the time of the alleged act that infringes is misappropriating what the patent has granted to the patentee to assure the commercial viability of his invention in return for disclosing it to the public, and that depends on what someone knowledgeable in the state of the art would recognize to be a substitution at the time that the infringement occurs."
1996.95-728,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1843.033,1863.817,"Mr. Wallace, do I understand that the United States is attempting to persuade other nations to adopt something equivalent to the doctrine of equivalents, and if that's correct, what is the definition that the United States is recommending to the rest of the world, and how does it differ, if it does, from the Federal circuit's decision here?"
1996.95-728,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1863.817,1912.239,"Well, in our negotiations we've pointed to the doctrine as developed in this country, and so far as I'm aware have just said that something comparable as it would fit within your particular system should be recognized in order to afford the protection, and one of the amicus briefs in this case, the brief for Shearon Corporation, cites a very recent decision in Japan, which for the first time recognized and applied a doctrine comparable to our doctrine of equivalents, but it's very hard to equate our system, that involves examination in the Patent Office, with other systems which may not."
1996.95-728,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1914.269,1916.162,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1996.95-728,2,21511,david_e_schmit,,1917.755,1930.594,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
