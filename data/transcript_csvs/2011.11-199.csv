2011.11-199,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.154,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-199, Vasquez v. United States."
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,8.154,12.224,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-199,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,62.121,67.024,My -- my problem is I -- I can accept that formulation certainly for purposes of this case.
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,108.499,118.605,"--Before the harmless-error analysis, the question the Court asks is, what we have to decide is whether a reasonable jury would convict him absent the error."
2011.11-199,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,143.737,146.189,Could you tell me what the error actually was?
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,207.413,219.804,"The -- the statements from counsel, two statements: One, that everyone was going to lose the case, which was repeated several times by government counsel during the cross-examination."
2011.11-199,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,219.804,223.023,"It was never referenced in the summations, however, or in the reply."
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,223.023,227.677,"They were not specific -- the recordings were referenced, and they told them to look at the recordings."
2011.11-199,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,255.326,257.612,So that's the error that you think--
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,257.612,258.578,I think that's--
2011.11-199,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,258.578,260.295,--influenced this trial?
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,260.295,261.73,--I think that's the most substantial one.
2011.11-199,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,261.73,262.313,All right.
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,269.9,271.769,Well--
2011.11-199,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,271.769,277.572,"The fact that they asked for her testimony, well, she was your client's entire defense."
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,284.826,291.832,"--Well, asking for her testimony shows that they were focused on the -- they were asking for a transcript that would have contained that part of the record."
2011.11-199,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,306.092,306.725,Which transcript?
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,308.609,315.447,"--Her testimonies, both on direct -- and then they asked for both, plural, indicating they wanted the rebuttal testimony, which would have included these statements."
2011.11-199,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,341.598,352.288,"Is it correct that the difference between your position and the government's position is that the government says the focus should be on a rational jury, and you say the focus should be on this particular jury?"
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,352.288,354.422,--That is one of the important differences.
2011.11-199,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,354.805,355.505,That I understand.
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,359.393,372.384,"--I -- well, in the government's brief, at some times, as we indicate in our reply, it seems that they support a very similar test to ours, and in others it seems like they want to say that you can just look at a reasonable jury and how they would view the evidence."
2011.11-199,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,372.384,377.955,"Well, let me -- let me read you two sentences and tell me whether you think there is a difference between them."
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,394.781,395.281,I do.
2011.11-199,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,396.081,396.732,What is the difference?
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,396.732,401.35,"--The difference is one of them was going to focus on the entire record, which includes the error."
2011.11-199,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,416.527,416.91,Can I--
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,416.91,417.646,--Yes.
2011.11-199,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,417.646,418.979,--stop you there?
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,427.268,435.005,Part of the government's brief asserts that you can look at whether a reasonable jury would convict him absent the error.
2011.11-199,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,438.64,440.758,Where -- where exactly is that in their brief?
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,456.351,460.405,I think there is a significant -- I don't have the exact citation.
2011.11-199,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,488.722,489.424,"Yes, exactly."
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,496.845,503.249,"If that's the -- and there's parts of -- the government's brief, I think, agrees with us in large part on what this test should be."
2011.11-199,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,509.553,519.294,What would you point out in the majority opinion below that suggests that they did an analysis that didn't look at the error and its possible prejudicial effect?
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,519.294,520.11,Two things.
2011.11-199,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,531.185,532.701,Where -- where is that?
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,535.22,537.239,In the -- you mean in the majority opinion?
2011.11-199,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,537.239,537.839,Yes.
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,537.839,541.691,It's immediately prior to the harmless error analysis.
2011.11-199,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,564.889,577.899,"But -- but in -- in the context of the opinion, and this was my first question, they then proceed to -- to analyze it and that's toward the very end of this discussion, what happened in this particular case."
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,583.803,588.255,"--I think the problem is they asked that question, which I think is the wrong question."
2011.11-199,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,605.483,608.501,"They say, immediately after the sentence you gave us, they say"
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,610.537,611.637,They do say that.
2011.11-199,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,654.464,655.749,You didn't -- you didn't read the whole thing.
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,671.076,674.128,"Yes, that was me, Judge -- Your Honor, yes, it was me."
2011.11-199,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,674.128,674.628,Okay.
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,678.896,679.38,Yes.
2011.11-199,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,679.38,683.734,"--has not yet seen the client, is that right?"
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,703.897,714.169,"I think that actually what they are talking about was whether Mr. Perez's lawyer had talked to me, Mr. Vasquez's lawyer."
2011.11-199,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,714.169,715.086,"Oh, they're talking about the lawyer."
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,724.727,725.677,There is some discussion between--
2011.11-199,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,725.677,726.861,What do you think it means?
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,726.861,729.696,--There's -- it's hard for me to tell exactly what--
2011.11-199,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,729.696,730.046,All right.
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,836.031,843.951,"--Well, because -- I think -- I think the most important thing is what I have already said, is the question they ask isn't about the error, and they don't address it at all."
2011.11-199,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,849.422,849.772,--Okay.
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,876.339,885.361,"I don't think that would be sufficient, because I think the important thing here is that they be required to ask the right question, to focus on this jury that heard the case."
2011.11-199,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,885.361,894.717,"Well, Mr. Brindley, I think one difficulty -- and this is really repeating Justice Alito's question, but it seems that you are parsing things pretty closely."
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,928.538,940.679,"And I think that the -- by asking the question in that way and talking only about a reasonable jury absent the error, when you start saying absent the error and you start looking at the evidence without the error, you are looking at a case the jury didn't hear."
2011.11-199,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,948.518,948.968,Look.
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,964.944,967.396,"No, I don't think so."
2011.11-199,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,967.396,967.729,No?
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,967.729,974.8,"I don't think so, because I think if you do the analysis that way and you say the error is corrected, you don't take into account its impact."
2011.11-199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,999.634,1010.74,Are you -- are you saying that it -- it doesn't matter that the verdict would have been the same by this jury if the error had not been made?
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1010.74,1014.71,"--Yes, I am saying that."
2011.11-199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1016.694,1028.351,"You're saying that the test is whether it contributed to the verdict, and if it did it doesn't matter whether the same verdict would have been pronounced absent that evidence?"
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1028.351,1029.819,"--That is correct, Your Honor, yes."
2011.11-199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1029.819,1030.819,"Well then, what is harmless error?"
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1039.392,1042.794,I think -- I don't think that should be the formulation of the test.
2011.11-199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1053.619,1055.121,What -- what does that mean?
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1073.498,1088.108,"--I think what the -- when you ask the question about whether the verdict contributed substantially to -- or, I'm sorry, whether the error contributed substantially to the verdict, what you are doing is you have to then look at the entire record and you have to look at the error's impact."
2011.11-199,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1120.729,1122.079,Can we get a little more practical here?
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1143.577,1144.528,Yes.
2011.11-199,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1144.528,1145.461,All right.
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1170.829,1171.662,Yes.
2011.11-199,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1171.662,1173.281,Of the potential of convincing the jury.
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1173.281,1182.637,"Yes, absolutely, in addition to the fact that the error -- if those things are taken for their truth, they serve as an independent basis for conviction, believing he's essentially confessed."
2011.11-199,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1182.637,1187.957,"Now, assuming that's your argument, I go back to my question, okay."
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1187.957,1188.357,Yes.
2011.11-199,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1188.357,1201.198,"Because what you said to me earlier, it wasn't about believing her or not; it was about believing the defense attorney when -- whether the defense attorney thought the defendant was guilty or not."
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1201.198,1205.15,I -- I think -- I think the two go hand in hand.
2011.11-199,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1222.26,1222.593,Let's -- let's--
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1222.593,1223.362,--Okay.
2011.11-199,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1223.362,1232.15,--Are you taking the position in this case that a reviewing court under no circumstance could conclude that this error was harmless?
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1245.441,1249.16,I am first saying that the court committed review error.
2011.11-199,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1260.885,1267.306,"And you are agreeing with the dissenting judge, who I think did say this error is harmful."
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1267.306,1268.473,"Yes, of course."
2011.11-199,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1268.473,1287.887,"And so you are not saying that it's just that they didn't use the right formula, but you would say, given what occurred here, the importance of this witness, that -- that this was a harmful error?"
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1287.887,1289.32,"Yes, absolutely."
2011.11-199,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1297.91,1298.793,Back to Justice--
2011.11-199,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1298.793,1300.878,Because your argument is something like this.
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1339.903,1352.829,"I think if you did the examination that way and didn't consider 10 at all, what you are saying is it's possible to convict on 1 through 9, but you are not considering the possibility you could convict as an independent basis on 10."
2011.11-199,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1354.329,1358.298,"We're not only saying it's possible to convict, but that likely probably would have happened."
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1358.298,1374.41,"--I don't -- well, if the error is the error in this case, that's number 10, then I think when you consider the possible impact, sweeping as it might be, I don't think there is any way on this record that the government can prove with fair assurance that that didn't infect the jury."
2011.11-199,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1374.41,1386.651,"No, my hypothetical is that the court of appeals says that if the jury had looked at 1 through 9, which was properly admitted before them in this trial, they would have convicted, likely."
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1400.393,1404.262,"I -- the formulation you've stated, I agree with that."
2011.11-199,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1453.195,1459.016,"Well, maybe the majority in the court of appeals was wrong in its application of the harmless-error test."
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1497.205,1501.573,--Because this -- the reviewing court has to look at everything in the entire record.
2011.11-199,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1519.118,1543.15,"I thought -- I thought your main point, as you said ""this jury"" rather than a hypothetical jury, I thought your main point is that what's wrong is to say, strip out the infected testimony, take that out, look at the rest of the record and if the rest of the record warrants conviction no harmless error."
2011.11-199,0,17483,beau_b_brindley,,1559.528,1561.295,--Yes.
2011.11-199,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1574.371,1574.871,"Thank you,--"
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1582.041,1585.393,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-199,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1602.804,1609.877,"Mr. Yang, that does raise the question that I think most separates you and Mr. Brindley, and it's the question that Justice Alito suggested."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1657.941,1663.345,"--Well, I don't believe our view is quite so firm."
2011.11-199,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1710.576,1712.626,So let me make sure I understand what you are saying to me.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1729.287,1737.227,"Ultimately the appellate court should look back at what the jury was supposed to consider, the evidence in light of the instructions."
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1771.214,1777.435,I don't know how to separate out an admitted error situation.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1812.108,1816.377,--Are we taking Marina's testimony out now?
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1816.377,1816.762,Yes.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1816.762,1817.195,Okay.
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1824.449,1824.733,That's a different standard.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1829.737,1842.394,"--If all you are asking is fair assurance, then I think you could get to the same result here, because when you take Marina's testimony out of the picture, there was really no defense at all."
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1845.512,1846.364,"No, no, no."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1868.059,1873.63,"--So he testified to the substance of Marina's testimony, that he happened to just drive there?"
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1873.63,1874.963,"--She called him, etcetera."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1874.963,1875.332,Right.
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1877.349,1883.486,"It was improperly admitted, without Miranda warning."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1883.486,1884.019,The tapes?
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1884.019,1886.804,"Not the tapes, just the story."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1886.804,1890.008,I'm a little confused.
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1890.008,1890.508,All right.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1890.508,1894.81,"Because if he's testifying in court, the government is not putting him on."
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1897.662,1900.578,"My hypothetical is not working for this reason, and I understand what you are saying."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1914.338,1915.457,Undoubtedly.
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1917.557,1921.861,"If he had not run away, and the tapes were admitted--"
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1921.861,1935.685,"--We would have a weaker case, and it would be -- ultimately these lines that the Court has to draw between a fair assurance or harmless beyond a reasonable doubt are guides to reasoned judgment by the court of appeals."
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1940.489,1941.022,--Exactly.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1963.605,1966.473,"Well, I'm not sure that that's Petitioner's view."
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1993.688,1994.205,Sure.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1995.207,2004.829,"Well, no, but I think the position about this jury versus a rational jury in looking at the deliberative process is entirely foreclosed by this Court's decision in--"
2011.11-199,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2004.829,2005.346,"But, Mr. Yang--"
2011.11-199,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2005.346,2006.931,"Well, you just told me it wasn't, Mr. Yang."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2034.765,2036.45,--I should qualify that.
2011.11-199,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2046.056,2051.459,"Well, a rational jury is not the jury that I said stayed out for 8 days and sent back a note on the seventh day."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2052.393,2062.149,And -- And the reason that I believe that the Court can use that as a benchmark to look back at the evidence is it is some indication of perhaps what the evidence should be saying to a rational jury.
2011.11-199,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2116.169,2132.328,"--Going back then to your position in your brief where you said that you would not include in the harmless error calculus that the jury requested to hear Marina's testimony again, the length of their deliberations, the divided verdict."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2139.351,2140.834,That's right.
2011.11-199,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2144.469,2157.413,"But I think you answered Justice Kagan that you could take them into account, the Court could take them into account but cautiously, not give them -- not give them undue weight."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2157.413,2170.304,"What I think the Court should do is when you have a -- what is a much better indication, or at least a -- of what this jury might have been doing, you use that as a reason to go back and look again at the evidence."
2011.11-199,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2170.721,2190.284,"Suppose you have a case in which after the verdict of guilty there's a motion for a new trial, and it's being heard by the trial judge, and the trial judge said: I now acknowledge that this court committed error in introducing item 10 in evidence."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2215.915,2223.588,"--Well, we think that, again, the inquiry that needs to be focused on is what a rational jury would do."
2011.11-199,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2224.405,2229.925,"That's starting to look, Mr. Yang, very much like a directed verdict for the government on the part of the judge."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2240.383,2242.669,--This Court has repeatedly rejected that.
2011.11-199,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2256.808,2258.724,You do have a jury -- Excuse me.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2269.365,2288.327,"The reason -- This I think can be answered if I could just get out a few of the Court's cases, because I think this shows the Court's rationale here and shows that our view has to be the right view."
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2323.816,2327.535,"Counsel, I just don't see how you can do it without the error."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2339.795,2342.747,"--I'm sorry, I just--"
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2342.747,2356.404,"The lawyer -- the prosecutor got up at the end of trial and said: Disbelieve everything the wife told you, because the lawyer said the defendant was guilty."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2383.741,2384.541,--No.
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2384.541,2385.941,Because under your formulation--
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2385.941,2386.441,No.
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2386.857,2390.225,--A rational jury would have convicted absent the lawyer saying that.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2390.225,2390.692,--That's right.
2011.11-199,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2414.174,2422.613,"You would -- you would take into account that the prosecution apparently thought this was important, so important."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2476.847,2483.667,--I -- I think it's a factor that you consider again in directing the Court's look at really what the trial evidence was.
2011.11-199,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2500.111,2502.145,But my point to you is it wasn't fleeting.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2519.09,2536.552,"--I think when you look at what happened at trial, you see that the tapes were played for two reasons: One, to show that Marina had bias because she was told by Petitioner's counsel, the Petitioner's counsel who she thought this, Petitioner's counsel would be able to make motions and arguments on behalf of her husband at sentencing."
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2536.552,2539.92,The dissent pointed out that she admitted that before the tapes were played.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2539.92,2540.504,Correct.
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2540.504,2544.472,That she was testifying in the hopes of getting a lesser sentence for her husband.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2546.555,2550.375,"Corr -- Well, the tapes certainly were reinforcing of that."
2011.11-199,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2564.366,2565.385,What was your second--
2011.11-199,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2565.385,2571.789,"--What was the line that the government, the prosecutor, repeated three times while she was on of the stand, the exact lines."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2571.789,2573.172,The exact lines?
2011.11-199,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2573.172,2573.889,Yes.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2580.728,2583.847,"Well, to be fair I think you need to look at what is before and after it."
2011.11-199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2609.212,2612.514,Why does any of this have to deal with her credibility?
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2621.403,2621.672,The--
2011.11-199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2621.672,2628.875,"--the dissent just said: It's bad to tell the jury that even the defendant thought he was guilty, or even the defendant's lawyer thought he was going to lose."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2628.875,2653.091,"--The reason that this was in -- and I don't -- it's not contested here -- is because the argument was made that these statements equating Petitioner and Perez in terms of their level of guilt or their likelihood of being convicted is inconsistent with Marina's subsequent testimony that all of us, you know, Vasquez just -- or Petitioner just showed up unknowingly because she asked him."
2011.11-199,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2710.446,2712.396,You are going over the evidence.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2752.706,2758.844,"--Well, I think the former, but let me explain."
2011.11-199,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2776.103,2784.042,But critical to the Court's view in that case was that the -- the defendant could not have contested that element.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2784.042,2794.433,"--Well, but if we're -- again, if we're focusing on the legal dispute between us and the other side about whether we're looking at this jury or what a rational jury would do when you excise--"
2011.11-199,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2794.433,2800.087,"Well, I would like very much to know what your answer is to Justice Kennedy's hypothetical and the Chief Justice's."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2804.622,2804.939,--Right.
2011.11-199,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2804.939,2814.847,"--where a particular piece of improperly admitted evidence -- we know from how the jury reacted, or the kind of evidence -- it's the kind of thing that could really make a difference."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2817.014,2817.647,And--
2011.11-199,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2817.647,2818.166,All right.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2894.197,2913.277,"--The answer is that in a case where the jury, where you have some very provocative evidence, but there's also a very strong case that exists -- it may defend -- depend on the level of certainty that you need to get to, whether it's fair assurance or harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."
2011.11-199,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2930.505,2950.552,"Suppose -- suppose the judge concludes that both this jury that I had, and some hypothetical rational jury would have been so focused on this evidence that that's all they would have looked at, but if they had looked at 1 through 9, the admissible evidence, they would still have found guilt."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2957.472,2957.739,--I think so.
2011.11-199,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3006.053,3025.7,"So you -- you are essentially saying, as I understand you, that -- if there was such a thing as a directed verdict in a criminal case, if the judge would say, you know, I will direct a verdict here because there's only one way a rational -- rational jury could come out."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3025.7,3032.02,--This -- this -- that argument was specifically rejected by this Court in Neder.
2011.11-199,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3047.447,3051.251,"Mr. Yang, you may be taking a harder position than you really need to."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3110.539,3118.21,"I'm -- I don't want to resist this too much, because I think we're fighting about things at the very extreme."
2011.11-199,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3157.437,3157.987,And you would need--
2011.11-199,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3157.987,3165.857,"Counsel, when you began, if I'm remembering correctly, you said there were two ways in which your position was different from Mr. Brindley's."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3165.857,3166.209,Right.
2011.11-199,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3166.209,3169.161,One I understand is that you look at a rational jury--
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3169.161,3169.611,That's right.
2011.11-199,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3169.611,3170.961,--and not the particular jury.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3172.53,3173.58,"Well, it's related."
2011.11-199,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3191.791,3205.518,"--Can I ask you a different question, Mr. Yang, which is, you know, this difference in the formulation of the test -- which I find it hard to wrap my mind around, but and -- it strikes me that there's two different ways of saying the same thing."
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3235.27,3245.911,We don't think that there is this deep -- there are some disagreements or some things we disagree about what did a court of appeals do in particular cases.
2011.11-199,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3304.631,3310.818,You do agree -- you do agree that the government has the burden of showing that the error is harmless?
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3310.818,3312.636,--Yes.
2011.11-199,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3312.636,3313.503,The government's burden.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3321.375,3321.842,No.
2011.11-199,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3360.35,3362.619,--So what does it mean that the government has the burden?
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3363.802,3380.764,"--The government has to show, as -- this is the formulation in Neder, and which the Court has said in Neder is the same thing that applied in erroneous admissions or exclusions of evidence; that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error, and that involves the three core elements we explained in our brief."
2011.11-199,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3382.55,3383.233,The absent error.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3388.454,3394.94,"--In some cases you can do that, where the evidence is so overwhelming -- if I -- if I may finish."
2011.11-199,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3394.94,3395.723,Briefly.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3395.723,3396.24,Briefly.
2011.11-199,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3404.16,3406.262,The Chief Justice allowed me to ask one question.
2011.11-199,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3416.718,3419.503,Yes.
2011.11-199,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3423.99,3425.14,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-199,2,17483,beau_b_brindley,,3427.175,3436.881,"I first want to address Neder, which the government counsel continually referenced."
2011.11-199,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3564.833,3572.82,Did the panel majority in -- did the panel majority in this case say anything that differs from what this Court has said about harmless error?
2011.11-199,2,17483,beau_b_brindley,,3579.26,3587.829,"--I think you would point to that first statement of the test where they say whether the reasonable jury would convict him absent the error, because Kotteakos says you can't strip the error out."
2011.11-199,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3590.731,3593.483,Hasn't -- hasn't this Court said exactly what Seventh Circuit said there?
2011.11-199,2,17483,beau_b_brindley,,3594.185,3596.971,"--This Court has used, I think, dicta that has language of that sort."
2011.11-199,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3610.112,3618.551,"You want us to say -- you want us to say we're reversing you, Seventh Circuit panel, because you said what we have said in prior cases, but we were wrong?"
2011.11-199,2,17483,beau_b_brindley,,3618.551,3631.958,"--I think the reason to reverse them is because that formulation has proven to lead to the wrong analysis, in all of these lower courts, this guilt-based approach; and it is not the law of Kotteakos."
2011.11-199,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3674.054,3674.887,"Thank you, counsel."
