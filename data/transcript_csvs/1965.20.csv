1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,0.0,8.491,-- from West Coast ports to Manila.
1965.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,489.067,492.406,"When was that initiated, Mr. Dunne?"
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,492.406,499.483,That was in -- it was initiated well before this suit.
1965.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,499.483,500.365,Well before this suit?
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,500.365,521.019,"Well before this suit, Your Honor, and it was in the course of this suit that -- and we alleged this in the complaint, Carnation Company learned the facts which I have just recited and thereupon and before that proceeding before the Commission had been determined, brought this action in December of 1962."
1965.20,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,521.019,525.971,How many of these facts were hitherto secret or not published?
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,530.917,532.092,"No, it was not, Your Honor."
1965.20,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,538.983,552.827,"Well, I know that the ultimate, and to your point of view, the controlling fact, that is that in order to change the rates you'd have to have the approval of both conferences, as you say was unknown to you."
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,552.827,553.052,That's correct.
1965.20,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,553.052,560.276,But I wonder how much of this other stuff was a matter of their open and disclose tariff system and procedures --
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,560.276,560.688,"Yes, a very --"
1965.20,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,560.688,562.845,Such as the initiative list and the --
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,562.845,565.778,The affirmance of the complaint are that these were not known.
1965.20,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,565.778,567.289,None of these facts?
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,567.289,568.079,No.
1965.20,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,585.836,587.139,Statute of limitations question.
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,587.139,590.124,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.20,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,698.99,702.324,In foreign -- in foreign commerce or both?
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,702.324,704.737,In foreign commerce only.
1965.20,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,995.808,998.105,May I interrupt at this point?
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,1013.187,1017.057,"We never raised that question, never suggested that."
1965.20,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1022.501,1027.106,Is that because they weren't -- they were never on file?
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,1027.106,1028.584,It's not the rates.
1965.20,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1032.424,1032.839,But that's what --
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,1032.839,1034.318,It said the agreement --
1965.20,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1034.318,1034.604,The agreement --
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,1034.604,1042.421,"– Under which they were fixed was never filed and never approved and, therefore under the procedure that Congress set up --"
1965.20,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1042.421,1044.436,I understand.
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,1044.436,1059.321,"– Were not -- that agreement, under which they were -- was not exempted from the antitrust statutes and, by consequence, for that $2.50 a ton in excess of the only lawfully fixed rate, that is the matter for which we are suing."
1965.20,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1059.321,1063.327,"Were the rates – the rates under the agreements filed, do you know?"
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,1063.327,1067.606,"I believe that is the practice to file, but I can't answer that, and we didn't set that up, Your Honor."
1965.20,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1077.107,1096.035,"Well, is it -- to narrow this, Mr. Dunne, not having the supplemental agreements proved the condition upon which the exemption comes into play was not met and therefore, you're free if you can make out an antitrust law case, bring an antitrust action."
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,1096.035,1099.245,"It's exactly our position, Your Honor, exactly our position."
1965.20,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1099.245,1113.371,"Well, if an agreement is made between two foreign carries or two carriers in foreign commerce on rates, setting rates in so many dollars and cents, and that agreement is filed."
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,1131.065,1133.838,"That is a different question, yes."
1965.20,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1133.838,1142.802,"But, nevertheless, the Commission might approve -- disapprove an agreement on some factor related to rates?"
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,1142.802,1146.048,"It might as to practices or otherwise, it might disapprove an agreement."
1965.20,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1146.048,1158.351,"Your position would be exactly the same here, I suppose, if agreements have been filed, the rates have been filed, and the Commission had disapproved them and they had gone ahead and done it anyway?"
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,1158.351,1163.48,"Except for one thing, and I don't want to be super technical about this, Your Honor."
1965.20,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.501,1168.144,I understand it.
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,1170.893,1172.31,"Correct, exactly."
1965.20,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.107,1184.448,"They might say -- they might say, “We disapprove this agreement, you can't operate under it because the rates are too high?”"
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,1184.448,1185.872,"Conceivably, they could."
1965.20,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.209,1198.536,"But the Commission, itself, could have just started proceeding and say “We're going to investigate rates in foreign commerce?”"
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,1198.536,1202.279,"And not for the purpose of fixing them as such, no."
1965.20,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.279,1207.79,Yes.
1965.20,0,15865,arthur_b_dunne,,1207.79,1237.739,"Now, it is our position very shortly that the matter of possible impact to the antitrust statutes, having been drawn to the attention of Congress when it was considering the adoption of the Shipping Act, so that it had this problem of how the antitrust statutes and the Shipping Act were likely to affect each other, interoperate, and so forth."
1965.20,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1757.906,1761.739,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1965.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1914.332,1919.443,"What was the reason for the holding in what you say, the Commission [Inaudible]"
1965.20,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1919.443,1927.014,The Commission -- its interpretation of the agreement which it previously had filed and had approved.
1965.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2002.735,2010.779,"Could the court determine whether the approval has been had or -- suppose it has been filed, I don't quite understand that."
1965.20,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2024.289,2025.435,"Well, Mr. Justice, if --"
1965.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2025.435,2029.35,"Except whether it's been filed, then that would be a pretty easy issue."
1965.20,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2029.35,2041.602,"Well, that -- if the question was just whether it had been filed, I assume there would be probably no need to have resort to the Maritime Commission for that, but if it has been filed and approved and there is a question whether what they have done is --"
1965.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2041.602,2042.438,That's right.
1965.20,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2050.916,2061.223,"That is correct, but there had been a -- they allege that they were supplementary agreements, supplementary in agreements over and beyond the main agreement that had been approved."
1965.20,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2063.232,2078.299,"But my difficulty is that even though an agreement hasn't been filed, apparently the rates under those agreements were filed and, under Section 18, the Commission would have power to disapprove them."
1965.20,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2078.299,2082.931,"Well, the Commission, Mr. Justice -- this section, by the way, under 18 was a --"
1965.20,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2082.931,2085.963,It's not the agreement per se that we're interested in.
1965.20,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2089.572,2092.4,"Well, Mr. Justice, let me say about it two things."
1965.20,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2099.66,2100.933,"Well, this is 1965 though."
1965.20,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2100.933,2103.66,1965 -- these rates have been altered in 1962.
1965.20,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2116.761,2118.174,"Well, that may be the answer."
1965.20,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2118.937,2120.289,"I think it is, Mr. Justice."
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,2636.191,2641.139,If the Court please.
1965.20,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3208.772,3209.429,Mr. Ransom.
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3209.429,3210.679,Yes?
1965.20,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3210.679,3230.442,"Let's suppose that instead of absorbing the excess rate it had been passed on, would the person to whom it had been passed on, to have a claim for reparations under the Shipping Act?"
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3230.442,3231.529,"I think so, Your Honor."
1965.20,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3231.529,3234.546,You think so?
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3239.038,3246.114,I think that they -- it would depend on the ocean documents and bills of lading as to whether or not -- they would or not --
1965.20,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3246.114,3259.622,"If they had a claim for reparations, then I assume that your position would be that they would be foreclosed from an antitrust action."
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3259.622,3261.396,"Yes, yes it is."
1965.20,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3261.396,3266.364,But -- and you do feel that --
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3266.364,3269.27,"I don't -- I honestly don't know the answer to that, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1965.20,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3269.27,3272.871,Whether they had a claim for reparations or not?
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3272.871,3281.112,"Whether they would or not, I think it might well depend upon the ocean shipping document."
1965.20,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3505.416,3527.574,"Do you claim -- do you claim now that the conference had the right to do what it did in this case, come to an agreement as to the $2.50 raise or is that issue foreclosed to you now by reason of the action of the Commission?"
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3527.574,3554.231,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, the -- I -- what I would claim would be that the conference, under the present decision of the Commission, did violate Section 15 at the time that they made this rate because they -- the Commission has now determined that they went beyond the scope of their filed agreement."
1965.20,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3600.222,3608.714,"Well, can the Commission give approval to those illegal acts that occurred years ago?"
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3608.714,3616.06,"No, there is -- so far as any cases are concerned, there is no such thing as retroactive approval."
1965.20,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3634.122,3643.587,"Well, then the recent action of the Commission would not inure to your benefit, would it?"
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3643.587,3649.822,"No, no, no, the recent action of the Commission would not inure to our benefit at this time."
1965.20,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3653.504,3679.695,"Do you claim the issue is as simple as Mr. Dunne has stated in here as between the parties, as to whether you're wholly beyond the antitrust laws even where you act without the approval of the Shipping Board, or do you claim that the issue was broader than that?"
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3679.695,3706.573,"I think the issue is -- the basic issue in the case as introduced by Mr. Dunne, enlarged by the Solicitor General's Office, but I think the basic issue in the case is whether the decision of this Court in 1932, in the Cunard case, is correct or incorrect."
1965.20,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3756.763,3758.72,I still don't know whether you --
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3758.72,3759.259,I'm sorry.
1965.20,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3759.259,3764.055,Do you agree that the issue is as simple as Mr. Dunne has stated?
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3767.572,3769.976,"I would answer categorically, yes."
1965.20,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3769.976,3771.477,It is as simple as he states it.
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3771.477,3772.367,"Yes, I think it is."
1965.20,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3772.367,3774.381,Yes.
1965.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3774.381,3786.678,"Then what -- and why do you -- why was it do you suggest the Congress felt it necessary to put the Commission in the -- in Section 15 with regard to the antitrust laws because, I take it, your position would be --"
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3786.678,3786.875,Yes.
1965.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3786.875,3791.088,-- the same whether the provision was in or out?
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3791.088,3792.253,"Well, if --"
1965.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3792.253,3792.74,Does this mean that this is --
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3792.74,3806.699,"If Congress had -- had in 1961 expressly added the -- that which was asked for them to do, then I think--"
1965.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3806.699,3807.759,-- that isn't what I'm asking.
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3817.111,3818.571,"That still is in there, yes, Your Honor."
1965.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3818.571,3820.226,"Yes, and it was in there from the start."
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3820.226,3820.973,Yes.
1965.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3820.973,3824.399,Why was it ever necessary to put it in?
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3825.083,3826.755,"Oh, why was it ever necessary to put it in the first place?"
1965.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3826.755,3829.899,-- your position would be the same if it never been put in.
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3829.899,3832.908,"Yes, yes my position would be the same."
1965.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3832.908,3840.298,"So, why -- why did they need it?"
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3840.298,3873.458,"I think that a reason, if you can impute to Congress the sophistication, which we like to impute to Congress after the Act, I think that the reason that they needed the express immunity at that time for approved agreements was because they were making approved agreements lawful."
1965.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3892.755,3894.72,They wouldn't need to say that if your argument is correct.
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3894.72,3896.057,"Well, may I finish?"
1965.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3896.057,3898.294,Sure.
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3898.294,3907.726,"They would need to say that, if my argument is correct insofar as approved agreements."
1965.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3970.418,3977.975,Are you saying approved agreements needed more protection than unapproved agreements under your approach to the Act?
1965.20,2,23007,edward_d_ransom,,3977.975,3979.894,Yes.
1965.20,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4197.685,4199.286,Mr. Turk.
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,4199.286,4204.027,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court."
1965.20,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4483.084,4483.701,Mr. Turk.
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,4483.701,4484.364,Yes?
1965.20,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4484.364,4503.096,"In your -- as you look at this case, is there any area in which the treble damage provisions of the Antitrust Act would operate with respect to the rate procedures of these carriers?"
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,4503.096,4551.129,"I would say, Mr. Justice Fortas, that in the difficult to conceive situation in which a private party claimed he'd been damaged by some collective action of a person subject to the Shipping Act, but the Commission upheld, let's say, on judicial review had found that that did not entitle this party to a remedy under the Shipping Act, not because he just didn't prove his case but because there is something inherent, either substantively or procedurally, in the Shipping Act which denies party complainant a remedy under the Shipping Act, then one of the predicates of supersession, as we call it, would be absent."
1965.20,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4609.614,4627.614,"Mr. Turk, having thought about it as much as you have and making that slight distinction as to the antitrust laws, can you give us any hypothetical case in which the antitrust laws might apply?"
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,4627.614,4645.984,"Well, I think that gets us to that perplexing last portion of the opinion in Far East Conference against the United States where as the Solicitor General suggested, Mr. Justice Frankfurter said “We'll dismiss here."
1965.20,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4731.679,4745.085,"Well I wonder -- I wonder why if it was to be that simple, why Congress couldn't have said so in very simple language instead of the language it used in Section 15?"
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,4745.085,4770.289,"Mr. Justice Warren, without undue levity, I would like to suggest that we are here and a good deal of this Court's business arises because, in advance of these complicated arguments and contentions which resourceful people make up many years later, Congress does not always use the clearest manner of expressing its purpose."
1965.20,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4824.166,4825.693,For all purposes?
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,4825.693,4826.997,Yes.
1965.20,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4927.506,4931.019,"Mr. Turk, I understand your point."
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,4951.734,4953.339,I must agree with that entirely.
1965.20,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4953.339,4969.535,"Now, what you're doing then, if I understand it, is that you are inferring from the structure of the Act, in the absence of any specific provision, you are inferring from the structure of the Act an antitrust exemption."
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,4970.395,4970.746,Yes.
1965.20,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4999.015,5035.959,"Your adversary, if I understand it, makes precisely the opposite argument, which is that, since the statute does contain a specific and narrow exemption from the antitrust laws, that this Court should not infer that Congress really intended a much broader exemption because Congress was specific, it was indefinite and the specific indefinite exemption stated in the statute doesn't help you in this situation."
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,5035.959,5036.677,No.
1965.20,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5083.636,5092.025,"If they were so meticulous in that regard, why didn't they add “If you did not file, then your remedy was under the Act”."
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,5092.025,5099.432,"Well, that is a speculation that is very difficult to answer these 50 years later, Mr. Justice Black."
1965.20,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5174.982,5179.264,Do we still have the same language as was put in recently on this point?
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,5179.264,5180.387,On the exemption?
1965.20,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5180.387,5181.099,Yes.
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,5181.099,5181.789,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.20,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5188.109,5188.754,I know that.
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,5188.754,5190.046,But that was deleted.
1965.20,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5192.153,5193.95,That was in 1916.
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,5193.95,5195.27,"1916, yes, Your Honor."
1965.20,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5195.27,5200.877,"That was along about the time they were pretty active over there in connection with enforcing the antitrust laws, wasn't it?"
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,5200.877,5201.611,"Yes, indeed."
1965.20,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5211.047,5213.959,This was in two years of the passage of the Clayton Act?
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,5213.959,5215.915,That's right.
1965.20,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5215.915,5217.623,Which strengthen the antitrust laws?
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,5217.623,5224.647,"Yes, indeed."
1965.20,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5295.667,5296.084,Mr. Turk.
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,5296.084,5296.771,Yes.
1965.20,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5296.771,5319.821,"Do you agree with Mr. Ransom that the Commission would have no jurisdiction on ex post facto or no proto basis to declare lawful these rates which by hypothesis for purposes of this case, were unlawful [Inaudible]"
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,5319.821,5324.779,"In other words, would retroactive effect wipe out the unlawful as of the date when Carnation --"
1965.20,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5324.779,5330.869,"As I understand Mr. Ransom, he said that the Commission would have no such power."
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,5330.869,5340.124,I must concede the same on the basis of the River Plate & Brazil against Prestil Carr case and --
1965.20,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5340.124,5360.797,"And then Far East and Cunard, as I recall them, isn't it the fact that the -- what was sought there was an injunction as to future action and the Commission did have jurisdiction to commit or disallow the action in question."
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,5360.797,5364.889,No question that it can approve in both cases.
1965.20,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5370.088,5375.147,"And an injunction would undoubtedly have interfered with the primary jurisdiction of the Commission, wouldn't it?"
1965.20,3,23285,elkan_turk_jr,,5375.147,5379.528,"Yes, Your Honor."
