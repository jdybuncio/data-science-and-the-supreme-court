1967.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,27.28,"Number 20, Federal Trade Commission petitioner versus Flotill Products Incorporated et al. Mr. Shapiro."
1967.20,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,27.28,31.893,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,385.619,386.263,As what?
1967.20,0,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,386.263,389.091,As applied to administrative agencies Your Honor.
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,1353.717,1358.235,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.20,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1650.238,1658.01,I had understood if that was one of the things that was provided for by the statute that the Commission could act even when there was a vacancy?
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,1658.01,1673.194,"Yes sir, but not when there are two vacancies, I was just about to say the same Justice Stewart but statute then says that a vacancy, both in the singular, a' and vacancy' in the singular, shall not impair the ability of Commission to act."
1967.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1728.195,1735.155,Then Mr. Shapiro name some other agencies that were set up in a different way?
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,1741.611,1751.892,"Of course, he contends it because they had provided for a quorum provision in some agencies that you must assume they intended to do it for the agencies they didn't."
1967.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1774.472,1780.495,"Well, how long has this quorum provision been on the FTC rules?"
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,1780.495,1791.118,"The quorum provision has been on the rules Mr. Justice Fortas for since 1950, over 50 years but so far as we know --"
1967.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1791.118,1792.256,Since 19-what?
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,1792.256,1800.725,"50, for over 50 years, but so far as we know, the first case in which the Commission ever acted by two-to-one vote occurred in 1963."
1967.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1800.725,1828.072,"Well I know, I understand that but your argument up to this time sounded to me as if you were arguing against the three-man quorum, that you said that some wicked President may come along in appoint three-man by the Commission of his own party and they would function as a Commission and he won't appoint any minority members and summarily it seemed to me you are arguing against the three-man quorum?"
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,1828.072,1828.831,Not at all sir.
1967.20,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1843.194,1852.436,"But if you had three Republicans and all three of them agreed, there would still be a decision by the three Republicans --"
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,1852.436,1863.825,"What Congress provided for was a five-man Commission; three of them may be Republicans, three of them may be Democrats and certainly they can decide cases by a three-to-two vote."
1967.20,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1880.364,1888.519,"Well, it seems Mr. Simon that is that you do not make it requisite that the statutory authority for a three member quorum, is that it?"
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,1888.519,1889.292,No sir.
1967.20,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1889.292,1896.622,As long as they well now if it's immaterial then I put the question to you I put to Mr. Shapiro.
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,1911.197,1914.233,"May I say Mr. Justice Brennan, there are three instances to that."
1967.20,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1930.424,1936.673,You mean that perhaps Congress could not even have said our quorum shall be six and we might think that a quorum of five would do as well?
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,1936.673,1946.066,"Well, I would not want to argue the case, if this Court had adopted a rule for a quorum of five, but the Court is an independent branch of our government."
1967.20,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1988.863,2000.685,"Well, I like to suggest the logic of that seems to be that any decision by which by a quorum of this Court is six would require five votes, then to decision --"
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2000.685,2012.29,"No sir, if six is a quorum then a majority of the quorum would be four, but Congress did not provide Mr. Justice Brennan for a quorum of three of the Commission."
1967.20,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2014.841,2032.575,"Well, and I do not follow, Congress had first time provided and I thought that was going to be the distinction, you just answer Mr. Justice Fortas that you are not quarreling with the quorum of three rule as such, it is only the decision of a majority of the quorum that you challenge?"
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2032.575,2041.078,Yes sir and the distinction I make Mr. Justice Brennan is that I do not agree that the Commission has authority to establish a quorum rule of its own.
1967.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.378,2049.375,Or the three was a quorum?
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2049.375,2057.614,But I concede Mr. Justice White that a decision by three members of the commission is the majority of the whole body.
1967.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2057.614,2080.621,What's the practical difference in the result between this situation and the Federal Trade Commission and the Courts of Appeals where we have nine members in most power and most of the Courts of Appeals and they sit in panels of three and majority of the panels can give final judgment?
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2080.621,2087.438,"Yes sir, but one may file a petition for rehearing en banc before the full Court of Appeals?"
1967.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2087.438,2089.525,I thought it very seldom gets to --
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2089.525,2110.823,"Yes sir, that may be and we filed Mr. Chief Justice a petition for rehearing here properly and we asked in our petition for rehearing that Commissioner Riley who was a member of the commission sit and we said, even though he did not hear the argument, we would like to have him sit and we asked them to wait until the vacancy was filled and let that commissioner fill the vacancy."
1967.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2196.961,2200.727,"Mr. Simon, may I ask you this question Mr. Simon?"
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2213.829,2218.929,"Yes sir, but of course if they granted it and then they split two-to-two, they would have a problem."
1967.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2218.929,2226.206,"That is a different thing, but if they all may have one vacancy at that time, it would be alright."
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2226.206,2230.381,The statute says in just so many words Mr. Chief Justice that a vacancy --
1967.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2230.381,2231.294,I remember you said that --
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2231.294,2234.13,-- shall not impair their ability to act.
1967.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.695,2319.013,"But this argument -- well, in this argument however, the point you should be making up here is that Commission erred in not granting a petition for rehearing?"
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2319.013,2321.792,That is the other side of the same coin Mr. Justice White.
1967.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2321.792,2326.012,"Well, is that what you are arguing here, that they should have granted your petition for rehearing?"
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2326.012,2331.692,"Well, if I may state it differently, what we are arguing is that we want a hearing before the full Commission."
1967.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.308,2360.108,"I think you could argue that this is the actual Commission having a hearing for three and have refusing the petition for rehearing is that, is the Commission designating a panel to overhearing, is that going to effective whether they pass a rule or not, they nevertheless are purporting to have a hearing and as you said --"
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2360.108,2365.187,But that the Reorganization Act provides that they may enact a rule with this effect.
1967.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.864,2369.402,For this case?
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2369.402,2371.47,"After the fact, this suggestion --"
1967.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.47,2374.568,"Or before the fact, they said it's three, didn't they?"
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2374.568,2376.03,Yes sir but they never claimed --
1967.20,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.03,2384.606,But even added ripped out an order and said with respect to Reorganization Act we hereby say that three officers are going to sit.
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2384.606,2393.733,The difficulty with that argument Mr. Justice White is that the Reorganization Act was never mentioned in this case until on petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeals.
1967.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2418.559,2424.974,May I ask when the Reorganization Act was passed in relevance to your appearing here?
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2424.974,2431.168,It was passed in 1961 and this order was in 1964.
1967.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2518.426,2526.839,How many of those cases were the panel of three which unanimous whether appealing to the Court?
1967.20,1,46195,william_simon,,2526.839,2533.747,"I cannot answer that question Mr. Chief Justice, but it was much fewer percentage than where they were two-to-one."
1967.20,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2644.609,2651.64,"Mr. Shapiro, before you head into your argument, may I ask you this?"
1967.20,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2689.303,2697.956,"Well, I think I have been trying to answer it [Laughter] as fairly as I can."
1967.20,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2749.024,2761.97,I understood Mr. Simon was saying that there had been 27 cases that had gone to judgment where you have had only three to sit?
1967.20,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2761.97,2770.4,"There have been I think 30 cases, where only three have sat because of vacancies on the Commission and disqualifications."
1967.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2812.064,2820.904,"What is the provision in the Reorganization Plan from the rehearing by the full Commission, is that set up in your brief anywhere the actual words?"
1967.20,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2820.904,2848.843,"I don't believe the full text is set out, Your Honor, but it is in Section 1(b) I think of the Reorganization Plan and it provides that the Commission may delegate its authority to perform any of its function directly to a division or panel or any employee provided that if -- I think it is provided that a final action is taken disposing of a case."
1967.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.6,2871.71,"So in such a cases that it has no right to have a rehearing, Commission has to --"
1967.20,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2871.71,2877.497,"It's a discretion, it is a vote in the -- in order to have it reviewed, it would take a vote of two members of the Commission."
1967.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2877.497,2887.747,"It says there you got in your brief, say it would be subject to review by the full agency upon the vote of a majority of the agency less one member."
1967.20,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2887.747,2888.55,That is the point.
1967.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.55,2891.011,So that so any two members?
1967.20,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2891.011,2901.586,"Any two members who are qualified to sit and that's the real problem that you may have a case in which for some reason, while you may have a case in which there are only four members available."
1967.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2914.497,2929.323,"So it is not under the Reorganization Plan, but this has to be let us assume that Commission did exercise its power under the Reorganization Plan to hear en banc, set the panel for three for the vote of two and then there were two vacancies."
1967.20,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2929.323,2930.883,Under the Reorganization Plan --
1967.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2930.883,2933.608,"Under that, you can never have a rehearing?"
1967.20,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2933.608,2939.322,"It would really be a question of straight rehearing by the three, trying to decide whether they should grant a rehearing in that discretion."
1967.20,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2939.322,2945.701,[Inaudible] if two people holding one way by it would not be about to have a rehearing.
1967.20,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2945.701,2948.877,"Well, likely you have to change your mind would be so much more."
1967.20,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2948.877,2959.495,"Well, if you adopted the Reorganization Plan that would necessarily mean that you would have to have panels of three always, would it?"
1967.20,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2959.495,2960.91,"No, it would not Your Honor."
1967.20,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2960.91,2966.254,"You can still use it only when you wanted to or where you needed to, could not you?"
1967.20,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2966.254,2969.027,"That is the purpose of the plan, it was designed to give flexibility to the Commission."
1967.20,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2969.027,2973.285,"I wonder why you would not want that flexibility, why that?"
1967.20,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2973.285,2980.755,"Well, partly it's a matter of the five members agreeing as to how they want to delegate their functions I think."
1967.20,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2988.292,2998.554,"Could it mean that they want to delegate it to three members, but they do not want to take on the burden of review of their actions?"
1967.20,2,28026,howard_e_shapiro,,2998.554,3001.561,"No, I do not believe that would be the case Your Honor."
