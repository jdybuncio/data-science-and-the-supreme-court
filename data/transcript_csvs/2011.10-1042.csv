2011.10-1042,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.57,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1042, Freeman v. Quicken Loans."
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,7.687,10.039,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1042,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,36.006,48.931,"Mr. Russell, when you say the agency in charge, am I right in thinking that HUD and its successor, they don't have any suit-commencement authority?"
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,48.931,58.203,"--HUD does have authority to bring suits for injunctive relief for violations of 2607(b), and -- if that answers your question."
2011.10-1042,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,58.203,59.122,For injunctive relief?
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,59.122,60.455,"For injunctive relief, that's correct."
2011.10-1042,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,70.677,71.512,Reaching all?
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,76.081,77.433,All unearned fees.
2011.10-1042,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,77.433,78.683,"All unearned fees, whether--"
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,78.683,80.202,Whether they're split or not.
2011.10-1042,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,80.202,85.606,"And how did this -- this may be a side issue, but I don't see how this is a fee for service."
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,97.162,98.33,"Well, you're right."
2011.10-1042,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,102.566,113.189,"So what are we supposed to do, decide theoretically in the context of a case that does not involve paying a fee for a service that doesn't exist, whether you can pay for a service that doesn't exist?"
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,113.189,118.327,"--I think you can take it on the same assumption that the court of appeals did, that the fee was unearned, and decide the question presented."
2011.10-1042,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,138.824,139.191,How?
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,159.085,169.526,"--The argument is Congress specifically defined the term ""real estate settlement service"" to include the origination of the loan, which includes but is not limited to the funding of the loan."
2011.10-1042,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.731,215.841,"--Well, I suppose if -- if the lower court could have been wrong for either one of two reasons, we don't have to decide which of the two we -- we're precluded from considering, right."
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,215.841,217.357,"--No, I don't think you're precluded from considering -- I--"
2011.10-1042,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,217.357,230.583,"I mean it's -- it would be just as well to say that the question presented here decides the case as it would be to say that the question raised by Justice Breyer decides the case, right?"
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,230.583,230.9,--Right.
2011.10-1042,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,231.4,233.552,Is there any reason to put the one before the other?
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,233.552,234.718,--There are several reasons.
2011.10-1042,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,284.218,290.572,Your -- your argument that 100 percent is certainly true as a matter of logic.
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,304.132,304.665,"Well, I--"
2011.10-1042,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,304.665,310.885,"You could have -- ""portion"" I suppose could still mean a full portion, ""split"" probably not."
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,314.004,317.622,"--Well, I think ""portion"" is the word that best fits this situation."
2011.10-1042,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.347,330.464,"It could mean that, but it need not mean that."
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,371.874,374.259,"Well, I would -- I would say two things about that."
2011.10-1042,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.267,386.051,That's not what we have.
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,389.987,390.57,Right.
2011.10-1042,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,390.57,391.487,Okay?
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,391.92,397.341,"The canon, though, I don't think, is a canon that says when you have related words, you give all them the same meaning."
2011.10-1042,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,408.982,419.524,"But the -- the -- the reason -- one objection to your idea that, well, this covers partial so it must cover 100 percent, is that it's a very different issue if you are talking about partial and 100 percent."
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,447.607,454.428,"Well, you still have to decide when you are talking about a kickback whether the person who received the kickback has done anything to earn their portion of it."
2011.10-1042,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,458.732,463.217,"Yes, but there -- there's a more -- it's a narrower issue when you are talking about a portion."
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,481.078,481.43,But--
2011.10-1042,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,481.43,483.747,"It's just the way these loans work, right?"
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,493.305,496.34,--It's certainly harder to sort out with respect to loan discount fees.
2011.10-1042,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,501.759,502.244,Okay.
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,530.245,530.845,--No.
2011.10-1042,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,532.03,532.397,Why not?
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,532.397,542.103,"What protect consumers is the last words of -- of this provision, which creates a safe harbor for people who give or accept charges for services actually performed."
2011.10-1042,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,559.13,561.28,I don't understand that.
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,577.009,580.211,There are two ways you can construe what it means to pay a charge for.
2011.10-1042,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,582.746,584.48,What you got was nothing.
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,584.48,584.846,--which was nothing.
2011.10-1042,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,589.584,590.267,Yes.
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,590.267,592.536,And I think that latter interpretation--
2011.10-1042,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,592.536,593.252,Yes.
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,593.252,594.186,--is the proper one.
2011.10-1042,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,595.987,599.122,Why hasn't the consumer violated?
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,599.122,605.276,--Because she didn't pay for services other than -- she didn't pay for services other than services actually performed.
2011.10-1042,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,605.809,607.961,Then why is the bank liable?
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,607.961,615.051,"--Because I think it's different, depending on whether you're looking from the perspective of accepting or receiving, what the charge is for."
2011.10-1042,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,624.407,625.04,I can see.
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,634.713,635.146,Right.
2011.10-1042,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,635.146,643.151,"When the consumer pays for the courier service which he sees there, the consumer is not paying for the courier service."
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,644.903,648.538,"No, I think the consumer is paying a charge for the -- for the courier service."
2011.10-1042,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,648.538,648.838,All right.
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,653.426,655.592,Because it's not a violation of the statute.
2011.10-1042,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,655.592,656.092,Why?
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,656.092,657.561,--to pay for a service actually performed.
2011.10-1042,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,661.43,667.35,But the -- but the purchaser is the giver.
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,680.159,680.609,Correct.
2011.10-1042,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,680.609,690.715,But -- so the person who gives is -- is not answerable under your reading of this (b)?
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,690.715,695.936,"Correct, because what she is giving the charge for is what she has been charged for."
2011.10-1042,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,700.74,704.959,"--Give me an example of where the language ""give"" would have an effect."
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,704.959,706.375,I think--
2011.10-1042,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.375,707.911,Have you deprived it of all effect?
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,707.911,708.394,--No.
2011.10-1042,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,723.436,732.126,But then we'd have Quicken as the giver and the person who receives the referral or the kickback as the receiver.
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,732.126,732.976,That's correct.
2011.10-1042,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,741.565,748.221,"Mr. Russell, there is one puzzling aspect of your interpretation."
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,791.148,792.048,That's true.
2011.10-1042,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,797.569,799.936,"But that is, that is HUD's interpretation?"
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,799.936,807.509,"That is one of HUD's interpretations, although it's an interpretation about what it means for something to be unearned, not having anything to do with whether split fees are covered or not."
2011.10-1042,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.998,834.758,"But nothing as big as this, if you accept HUD's interpretation of this, which is essentially the issuance of a price schedule by HUD and anything above these prices is an overcharge and hence falls under -- under this provision."
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,835.677,839.411,"--It would be immense, but this Court doesn't have to accept that view in order to accept HUD's--"
2011.10-1042,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,839.411,846.415,"No, but if we don't then we reject deference to HUD, which you want us to -- to apply."
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,852.985,866.76,"--Certainly you can, and in fact Your Honor did in Smith v. City of Jackson, where you held that a provision of a regulation recognizing disparate impact was entitled to deference, but a provision saying what you had to prove to show a disparate impact violation wasn't."
2011.10-1042,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,875.398,877.348,Do you think this is just a labeling statute?
2011.10-1042,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,888.472,891.341,--I think Congress -- yes.
2011.10-1042,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,913.873,914.223,"Thank you,--"
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,930.083,932.601,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-1042,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,953.947,957.149,And the consumer doesn't violate it in those circumstances because?
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,957.149,960.268,We agree with the Petitioner's interpretation--
2011.10-1042,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,960.268,961.851,Can you tell me where in the briefs?
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,977.645,980.331,"--Justice Breyer, I don't think this is in the brief."
2011.10-1042,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,980.331,980.964,"Well, my goodness."
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1011.884,1017.119,The explanation is encompassed in HUD's policy statement.
2011.10-1042,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1028.494,1030.362,"Oh, you mean it's all prosecutorial discretion?"
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1037.199,1040.234,"Justice Breyer, I think it's more than just prosecutorial discretion."
2011.10-1042,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1041.217,1041.653,What more?
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1041.653,1053.125,--What HUD is explaining is that the reason why it wouldn't prosecute a consumer is because the consumer does not make the payment for -- does not pay a fee for the payment of unearned fees.
2011.10-1042,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1053.125,1059.281,"Have we said in some of our cases, oh, don't worry, this is within the discretion of the prosecutor, close enough for government work?"
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1059.281,1060.181,"No, no."
2011.10-1042,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1071.673,1074.64,Does HUD have expertise in determining criminal statutes?
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1074.64,1087.632,--HUD has an expertise in determining what is earned and unearned and what the practices are in the real estate industry for charging consumers fees that haven't been earned by the service providers.
2011.10-1042,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1088.8,1101.792,"Well, but I assume that HUD's interpretation of a criminal statute like ours must give the defendant the benefit of the doubt, so that if there is any ambiguity -- I mean, that's our standard rule."
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1124.823,1132.996,"--Yeah, it was saying that it doesn't think that a consumer violates the statute because the consumer doesn't pay the fee other than for services earned."
2011.10-1042,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1132.996,1148.606,"But can you -- I don't want to take all your any more time on this because to me the more important problem was the problem of the difference between a kickback statute, which we could understand as well as within HUD's expertise and normal and of course very good reason for doing it."
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1183.36,1190.949,"Justice Breyer, I think the important, important point here is that this is not an overcharge case; this is an unearned fee case."
2011.10-1042,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1209.427,1210.26,I'm not sure.
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1220.302,1227.639,"At some point, under anybody's interpretation there does have to be a determination of whether something was earned."
2011.10-1042,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1237.611,1238.096,Wait a minute.
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1255.306,1256.158,There--
2011.10-1042,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1256.158,1258.308,I don't think you have to evaluate--
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1258.308,1258.927,--No.
2011.10-1042,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1259.46,1268.049,"--Under the Respondent's interpretation, I don't think have you to evaluate the reasonableness of the fee in order to decide whether it was earned or not."
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1268.049,1288.362,"--Under the statute, if it's for -- if the fee is for -- other than for services actually performed, which we think the loan discount fee in this case was a charge other than for a service actually performed, there was no corresponding reduction in the interest rate, that is an unearned fee under -- under anybody's interpretation."
2011.10-1042,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1288.362,1292.331,It looks to me as though you have an additional statutory problem.
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1332.139,1337.21,"Justice Kagan, we agree that that is one scenario covered by 2607(b)."
2011.10-1042,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1364.26,1368.664,But you are now splitting HUD's position.
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1401.568,1411.507,"Justice Ginsburg, in this case we don't think that the Court has to -- has to say anything about overcharges and whether those are covered by the statute."
2011.10-1042,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1425.001,1425.701,What does that mean?
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1439.175,1439.676,Right.
2011.10-1042,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.409,1474.532,"I don't know anybody, any knowledgeable person who applies for a loan, who doesn't ask whether there are any points?"
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1515.425,1535.072,"--What -- what RESPA is intended to do is to protect consumers who often are not sophisticated on what they are doing in securing a residential mortgage loan and to make sure that they understand what the charges are, and also to ensure that they receive the charges -- the services for which they pay at closing."
2011.10-1042,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1535.072,1536.222,"Yes, but that's the problem."
2011.10-1042,1,16657,ann_oconnell,,1567.376,1572.847,"Justice Breyer, this case comes here under the assumption that this was an unearned fee."
2011.10-1042,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1580.451,1581.803,"Thank you, Ms. O'Connell."
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,1589.307,1592.325,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1042,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1664.357,1671.944,"Mr. Hefferon, if you are right about subsection (b) and its meaning, what does it do that subsection (a) does not do?"
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,1671.944,1673.729,It does two things.
2011.10-1042,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1688.488,1696.842,"Well, if that is the case, then why would Congress have done something that says, A, pursuant to an agreement, B, not pursuant to an agreement?"
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,1702.496,1708.566,"--Because (a) covers an entire universe of things which appear, in many instances, away from the closing table."
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1733.2,1740.354,The -- the -- the so-called kickback in (a) is not for services not actually performed.
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,1763.387,1763.987,That's correct.
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1768.69,1780.248,"And under (b), something quite different, and that is giving money to somebody who performs no service at all is made unlawful."
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,1784.3,1784.966,That's correct.
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1787.585,1795.941,"Counsel, under your reading, as I understand it, the words ""portion, split or percentage"" means an amount less than the whole?"
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,1795.941,1797.793,--That's correct.
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1797.793,1808.848,"So what happens if a service provider gives 100 percent to the other side, as opposed to an amount less than the whole?"
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,1808.848,1812.3,We don't believe that it is covered by section 8(b).
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1827.812,1851.61,"Does that make much sense, that if you give one meaning -- if you stay consistent with your meaning, what you are saying is a situation where the service provider gives away everything, 100 percent, they are just not liable under (b); if they give away 1 percent, they are -- if they keep 1 percent, they are liable?"
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,1851.61,1852.51,That's correct.
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1863.418,1871.591,"Is -- is -- is there -- Judge Higginbotham, in his dissent, said there is a big difference between unearned fees and overcharge fees."

2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.181,1913.001,Is this 100 percent thing -- is this a real problem that Congress was addressing?
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,1924.809,1926.193,It -- it -- it--
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1926.193,1931.229,"Isn't that enough reason for its not being addressed, that it's not a real problem?"
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,1931.229,1936.298,"--Justice Scalia, there is no indication that we are aware of in the legislative history that such a thing was happening."
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1937.483,1938.366,You think not?
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,1952.393,1958.897,--It -- it -- it is a -- it is a common arrangement if those subsidiaries are rendering services in connection with the real estate--
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1958.897,1965.134,So why isn't it a potential common practice that they are getting 100 percent of something they didn't do?
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,1965.134,1967.42,"--Again, there is no indication--"
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1967.42,1970.104,If they are rendering -- if they are already rendering services?
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,1970.104,1983.179,"--There is no indication in the legislative history that that type of conduct was going on, and Congress was specifically identifying kickbacks and referral fees which it referred to, for example, as rebates and commissions, unearned commissions."
2011.10-1042,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2004.609,2013.464,"Then why is the statute labeled, titled, ""Prohibition Against Kickbacks"" -- that's one thing -- ""and Unearned Fees""?"
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2021.218,2029.141,"Well, Congress made the decision at the time, as Justice Scalia pointed out, that a fee for referral is -- is not properly earned."
2011.10-1042,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2048.555,2050.355,So you think there could be an earned kickback.
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2050.355,2057.91,There could be -- there could be an earned kickback if Congress was willing to accept the principle that it's okay to earn money for a referral.
2011.10-1042,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2064.664,2069.451,"If it's okay to get money for a referral, what type of kickback is not okay?"
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2069.451,2071.987,"Well, it's -- let me be clear."
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2083.376,2092.4,"It made the decision that a finder's fee in this area, although in all other areas is perfectly okay, but a finder's fee in this area is a kickback."
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2092.4,2093.15,That's correct.
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2093.15,2110.112,"Counsel, if your reading of the language is not plain, if there are two ways to read this statute, give me your best reason for why the policy statement should not be given deference."
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2137.012,2139.245,It certainly is an interpretation of the statute.
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2168.615,2180.206,"The Second Circuit had said something a lot different, and HUD came back and invited HUD to do something, and HUD came back and said: You read it that way; we think this is a better reading."
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2182.308,2189.98,"--Because it, it did not treat the subject with the kind of depth that you would expect or that this Court would want."
2011.10-1042,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2189.98,2202.122,"Well, Mr. Hefferon, I don't think that is true that -- we defer to agencies, not because we think that agencies do statutory interpretation in exactly the way courts do."
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2220.349,2232.657,"What the agency did on that point is it simply said that if one construes it the way they would like to construe it, it would address the concern that Congress had for unnecessarily high settlement charges."
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.606,2277.37,"When an agency is construing a criminal statute, a statute providing for criminal penalties, do you think the agency is constrained to apply the rule of lenity and to assume that if there is ambiguity it should be interpreted in favor of the defendant?"
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2277.37,2296.097,"Yes, Your Honor, because the -- this is a criminal statute, and it is particularly difficult, it seems to us, to give a policy statement deference because in order to get to the policy statement you have to assume the statute's ambiguous and then assume the regulation's ambiguous, and then you get to the -- the policy statement."
2011.10-1042,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2307.222,2313.559,"Well, in 1992 they promulgated the regulation, which is the strongest argument I think on the other side."
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2319.28,2320.513,"--We absolutely have, Your Honor."
2011.10-1042,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2320.513,2321.113,All right.
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2356.653,2369.546,"Justice Breyer, the regulatory history around this section, which is in Regulation X, is actually quite interesting and quite favorable to the reading the Fifth Circuit gave to the statute."
2011.10-1042,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2417.46,2419.312,So you would say--
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2419.312,2420.228,"Counsel, I'm sorry."
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2422.347,2422.647,--Sure.
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2422.647,2427.182,"Didn't HUD in that preamble say explicitly,"
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2437.54,2439.274,"It says that in the policy statement, that's correct."
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2439.274,2442.526,Not in the policy statement; in the preamble to Regulation X.
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2442.526,2444.161,In the--
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2444.161,2446.313,"In, in 1996."
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2454.652,2455.452,--That's correct.
2011.10-1042,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2470.794,2480.85,"--Is this a fair statement in your view, and we will hear this on rebuttal, that in respect to the 1992 regulation there is a sentence which says,"
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2508.25,2510.369,"--Absolutely correct, Justice Breyer."
2011.10-1042,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2516.356,2519.139,Was comment received in respect to that?
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2519.139,2523.357,--I don't know whether comment -- I don't know comment was received or not.
2011.10-1042,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2528.161,2531.28,What -- You were you about to tell us what we said in Long Island Home.
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2531.28,2544.87,"In Long Island Care At Home, the Court merely repeated in particular statements made in Chevron and Mead that, among other things, a regulation cannot get deference unless it -- if it is procedurally defective."
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2563.834,2564.851,But I'm not sure.
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2584.831,2586.931,"Well, there is not a procedural defect."
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2590.735,2597.239,We go back to whether the policy -- whether the policy -- whether the statute is ambiguous or not.
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2597.239,2600.441,"Correct, as well as if it is, whether one gives Chevron deference."
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2600.441,2609.297,And what I'm trying to figure out is what's the deficiency in the policy statement that's independent of the ambiguity you rely upon.
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2609.297,2609.797,Sure.
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2629.893,2631.828,"Well, it says it's longstanding for it--"
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2631.828,2643.203,"--It attempts to explain why it is a finding -- a ruling of long standing, and we point out examples in the red brief where it isn't a finding of -- an interpretation of long standing."
2011.10-1042,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2643.203,2660.079,"Which -- putting aside the notice-and-comment point, which I think is at least ambiguous, which -- which of our cases stands for the proposition that whether or not we give Chevron deference depends on the thoroughness with which the agency addressed an issue, rather than simply an announcement of its interpretation?"
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2660.079,2667.401,I believe that that was -- I believe that that was a factor that the Court looked at in Long Island Care at Home.
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2690.032,2693.067,"But you concede that if we give it Chevron deference, you lose?"
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2693.067,2695.836,On the policy statement?
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.836,2698.121,"No, on both -- the case."
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2704.491,2708.228,"If the Court then also finds that it's deserving of Chevron deference, that is correct."
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2708.228,2709.645,Ah.
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2710.395,2711.947,Sure.
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2711.947,2720.453,"We don't give deference to interpretations that are beyond the limits of what the language will bear, do we?"
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2720.453,2721.253,That -- that's absolutely correct.
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2736.063,2737.413,"--Counsel, I'm -- I'm a little confused."
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2786.161,2786.895,That's correct.
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2786.895,2796.467,So what's the difference between deciding that question and deciding that the -- the one individual provided a service?
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2796.467,2801.521,"We agree that in each instance, the Court would have to make a factual determination."
2011.10-1042,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2811.463,2815.598,"And it listed, as Justice Ginsburg said, unearned fees."
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2840.563,2843.948,That's with respect to settlement service providers.
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2843.948,2845.431,Did you complete your earlier answer?
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2848.669,2856.606,"On the question of whether or not to provide Chevron -- actually provide deference, if Chevron was applicable?"
2011.10-1042,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2870.929,2881.904,"Mr. Hefferon, you might be right that we never get to Chevron deference here because the statute is plain on its face, and there's no ambiguity for the -- the agency to think or do anything about."
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2909.655,2929.901,"Well, the statute does give HUD interpretive authority, but in this instance, what it is doing -- in fact, it's not quite clear what words it is interpreting in a way, trying to -- trying to interpret the words, and any vague aspects of the words -- is not a gap-filling situation that we're talking about."
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.597,2952.499,Doesn't any agency have interpretive authority regarding the statute its implementing?
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2952.499,2953.266,That's correct.
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2953.266,2955.1,Is there agency that doesn't?
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2955.1,2957.052,"Certainly, most agencies would think--"
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2957.052,2959.07,Does it have to be specifically conferred?
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2959.07,2961.856,--I don't believe it has to be specifically conferred.
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2961.856,2964.808,Is it at all increased when it's specifically conferred?
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,2964.808,2971.145,I don't believe the Court's precedents suggest that it's increased if Congress has gone the next step to actually say
2011.10-1042,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3016.441,3019.376,That's just a way of saying that there's no ambiguity here.
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,3038.956,3045.943,--The nature of the question that HUD's addressing is interpreting the legal -- basically giving a legal interpretation of the statute.
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3049.912,3053.716,We give deference to legal interpretations all the time.
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,3053.716,3065.857,"--But it is a -- the question of whether Congress intended -- whether they intended HUD to be giving the interpretation, or filling a gap, or whether it was simply getting guidance."
2011.10-1042,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.857,3067.69,I have no idea.
2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,3071.578,3076.645,HUD issued the policy statement as a guidance document.

2011.10-1042,2,42790,thomas_m_hefferon,,3288.435,3289.002,That's correct.
