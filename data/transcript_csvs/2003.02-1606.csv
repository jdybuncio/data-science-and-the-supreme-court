2003.02-1606,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.94,"We'll hear argument now in No. 82... rather, 02-1606, Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation v. Pamela Hood."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,13.746,16.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1606,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,29.433,53.953,"Well, let's talk a little bit about the notion that's raised in one or more of the amicus briefs, that a bankruptcy proceeding is akin to an in rem proceeding or is an in rem proceeding, such as might be the case in an admiralty suit where we would think the State would be bound."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,60.929,61.838,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,93.145,104.397,"Well, why doesn't it fit in the bankruptcy context too where the debtor's assets are assembled in kind of an in rem proceeding and the creditors share in it?"
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,111.993,134.861,"Well, Your Honor, although there certainly are in rem aspects to bankruptcy jurisdiction in the context of dealing with the property of the estate that is before the court and that is in the custody of the court, bankruptcy jurisdiction also embraces other... other aspects of in personam jurisdiction involving the parties and... and personal relationships."
2003.02-1606,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,134.861,136.719,"Well, could we just stick with the in rem for a moment?"
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,161.822,174.082,"Well, Your Honor, there... there is authority from... from the lower courts that... that it could in fact, and that in... in that situation, the... the State might be bound by a general discharge order."
2003.02-1606,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,174.082,180.602,"Well, what... what happened here was something where... where a summons was issued to the State, wasn't it?"
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,184.029,193.4,"Well, that's... that's exactly right, Your Honor, and it also is a situation in which the State was not making a claim against the... the property of the bankrupt estate."
2003.02-1606,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,193.4,193.5,Yes.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,196.661,197.487,And that--
2003.02-1606,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,197.487,198.042,--get that.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,212.802,214.948,"--I don't want to concede that point, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,237.322,239.801,But this is not a normal suit against the State.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,244.753,248.263,"That's right, Your Honor, except that--"
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,248.263,253.836,So the proceeding itself is to determine whether or not she's entitled to a discharge on the debt at issue.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,253.836,255.815,--Yes.
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,286.203,291.442,"If she... if she prevails in that disputed factual matter, then it will be just like any other discharge case."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,299.494,300.98,"--No, it wouldn't, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,308.948,309.154,No.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,315.431,319.64,"--It... it... yes, if I'm understanding, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.9,333.674,"Moreover, the... the fact that this proceeding had to be brought against the State was purely a result of congressional disposition."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,342.219,344.448,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.448,358.816,"So... so that the... the argument that the bankruptcy... the in rem nature of the bankruptcy procedure gives... gives her all the protection that the Constitution at least requires, vis-a-vis the State, it seems to me is a strong one."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,370.787,372.949,"I think that's exactly right, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,380.485,391.714,"Isn't it... isn't it odd that you are objecting to this proceeding where, if Congress then said, okay, we'll make it dischargeable, you will be worse off?"
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,418.63,419.995,"--No, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,487.777,493.805,"I'm not asking about making it totally dischargeable, but Congress wants to achieve this result and sensitive to your concern."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,520.692,521.974,"--Your Honor, I don't believe it would."
2003.02-1606,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,539.046,554.855,"So you... you would have no problem with Congress' amending this statute so that it reads if the State chooses to waive its sovereign immunity, the debtor has to proceed in this manner."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,566.251,575.372,I'm not... I'm not certain that that would not be the same type of statute that I... I objected to a moment ago.
2003.02-1606,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.372,577.208,No. I thought you accepted that a moment ago.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,597.17,608.316,"Well, I... I agreed, Your Honor, and I still agree that... that Congress could fashion a statute that would make student loans dischargeable in the same manner as... as any other debt."
2003.02-1606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,629.614,633.124,I... I don't understand what the statute has... how the statute is involved in this.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,680.224,689.223,"Well, Your Honor, I... I believe that this statute... this particular subsection affecting student loan discharge is really unique within the exceptions to discharge."
2003.02-1606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,689.223,690.132,All right. Let's assume it's unique.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,690.132,690.604,There--
2003.02-1606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,690.604,704.993,What is it in the Constitution or the Eleventh Amendment that says Congress cannot set a special standard for discharging a bankrupt from a certain kind of debt?
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,704.993,707.072,--Congress--
2003.02-1606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,707.072,717.708,"What... what in... what in the Constitution says that if that kind of debt happens to be one that is owed to the State, Congress is forbidden to do that?"
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,719.938,726.912,"--Your Honor, we... we do not dispute that Congress has the power to set a separate standard for this type of debt--"
2003.02-1606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,726.912,735.663,"I know and so why is the State, if it happens to be owed that kind of money, in any sort of a different position?"
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,735.663,747.802,"--Well, the... the question is not the effectiveness of the congressional determination regarding how to handle that debt, but rather the constitutionality of the means by which Congress--"
2003.02-1606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,747.802,752.026,"Now, then what you're quarreling with is, of course, not the statute."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,798.328,803.53,"--Well, Your Honor, our objection is not merely to the bankruptcy rules."
2003.02-1606,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,805.387,815.623,"I read your position to be that the State isn't bound at all, for instance, that the bankruptcy court cannot discharge property liens held by the State."
2003.02-1606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,827.406,828.399,And so did I.
2003.02-1606,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,828.399,833.516,I guess... I guess the... you would say the State doesn't have to abide by the automatic stay.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,833.516,835.291,"--Oh, certainly not, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,848.006,853.002,I'd rather like to get the answer to the question which is I understand what position you took in the brief.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,877.317,882.518,"--Your Honor, I agree that Congress can make those distinctions."
2003.02-1606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,882.768,883.018,Fine.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,909.6,934.575,"--I disagree with it because the... the legislative reports as to that subsection, section 5239(a)(8), strongly point out that the statute... that that subsection is intended to be self-executing and that the creditor, the lender, the guaranteer, the... the guarantee institution, are not required to initiate action but instead can rely on the nondischarge, on the exception from discharge."
2003.02-1606,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,962.523,972.304,"The statute... the statute doesn't... doesn't require, does it, that that preferred position be established in an adversary proceeding?"
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,972.304,986.012,"--Certainly not by express terms, Your Honor, but... but again, the rules... rules made consistent with that statute, together with that legislative purpose, would certainly indicate that... that--"
2003.02-1606,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.012,988.445,And I suppose you're saying this is an adversary proceeding.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,989.438,990.347,--Oh--
2003.02-1606,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,990.347,1000.378,"--regardless of how... how it got to be so, whether it got to be so through rule or through anything else, it's an adversary proceeding and the State cannot be hailed in in this fashion."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1000.378,1001.327,"--That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1003.267,1034.642,"No, but there is a dispute about whether you could, in fact, call this kind of adversary proceeding, given the underlying standard that all it is is a way of getting to the same result, really not an adversary proceeding for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, since it has no functional difference whatsoever from a proceeding that isn't labeled adversary but simply gives the State notice of what's going on and permits the State to come in, just as if it worked, which is ordinary proceedings."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1034.642,1043.846,"--Except that ordinary proceedings in bankruptcy, as I mentioned earlier, do not involve the individualized adjudication of debts."
2003.02-1606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1049.214,1049.707,That's a good answer.
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.707,1050.616,"Mr. Brand, can I ask you--"
2003.02-1606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1050.616,1051.071,"--Now, what about--"
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1051.071,1052.436,--May I ask one question?
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1064.817,1067.129,"--Certainly, Your Honor, and the--"
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1067.129,1078.896,And does that mean you also would agree that any ordinary commercial obligation to the State such as paying rent for an... an office suite or something like that could also be dischargeable and there would be no sovereign immunity problem there?
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1078.896,1086.16,"--Yes, Your Honor, and the reason... the reason I agree to that is because that does not require an adjudication."
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.875,1096.357,"Well, but there has to be... there has to be a final order in the bankruptcy proceeding discharging... you know, giving the... the debtor a discharge."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1096.357,1100.322,--But we would submit in a... in a very real sense that would be surplusage.
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.322,1105.645,But the... but the net result is I thought your position in your brief was somewhat different from that.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1113.241,1118.443,That's... that's right when the discharge is by operation of law.
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.391,1140.196,"So, but the difference in the automatic stay if the... if the debtor had to go in and prove his name, serial number, and rank or something first, so it wasn't completely automatic, then you would say you have a sovereign immunity objection."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1140.196,1143.334,"--Possibly, possibly not."
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1148.264,1152.25,"Well, I'm really not so much interested in the authority from the lower courts as I am curious about your position."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1156.337,1171.569,--In this case the sovereign immunity defense protects the State from being made a defendant and from having compulsory process issued against it to appear in a bankruptcy court that could be in any State of the union in this case.
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1189.196,1199.887,"I know, but it seems to me somewhat anomalous to say that if you want to do it without giving us a hearing, you can go ahead and do it, but if you give us notice and a hearing and an opportunity to respond, then you're protected by the Eleventh Amendment."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1199.887,1202.116,"Well, again--"
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.116,1202.571,A rather strange position.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1202.571,1205.626,"--again, Your Honor, I think... I think we're talking about very different things there."
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1222.882,1223.42,"Well, you say--"
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1223.42,1223.997,--such as we have here.
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1223.997,1233.451,"--it could well be that the State filed a claim and proved up its claim and then there's not enough money to pay it, the claim, but there would be some kind of proceeding to establish the claim."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1234.499,1243.853,"Well, in... in a case where the State had filed a claim, the State would have voluntarily appeared in the... in the proceeding as relates to the subject matter of that claim."
2003.02-1606,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.652,1252.854,"So that if the State voluntarily appears, it would automatically waive its sovereign immunity defense."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1252.854,1254.219,"As to that claim, yes."
2003.02-1606,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1254.219,1255.455,"Well, that's the Gardner case, isn't it?"
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1255.992,1257.107,"Yes, I believe so."
2003.02-1606,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1259.17,1262.392,--Tell me how bankruptcy works.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1274.752,1278.55,"I... I believe so, Your Honor, but I'm not certain if that is applicable in every... in every district."
2003.02-1606,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1288.46,1293.577,"Because it does seem that if an action is brought by a U.S. trustee, that's an officer... that's the Federal Government."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1293.577,1297.087,"--Well, certainly that would be a different situation and certainly the State--"
2003.02-1606,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1297.087,1298.695,Which is another way of solving this problem.
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1298.695,1299.727,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1304.928,1313.063,"In... in a world of limited resources, especially for the U.S. trustee... this is a no-asset bankruptcy."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1352.816,1358.61,"Well, certainly any lending institution could... could be involved as a... as a creditor in a student loan."
2003.02-1606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1372.628,1381.051,"Do you know what part of the business the States have, to what extent, compared to other creditors, other lenders?"
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1381.051,1384.023,"Well, the... I... I can speak for the State of Tennessee."
2003.02-1606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1430.396,1436.529,"So for... for the primary lender, this procedure would be fine."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1444.125,1452.836,"I... I believe... I believe, Your Honor, certainly the... the initial creditor could certainly be involved, would have no sovereign immunity defense."
2003.02-1606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1455.742,1474.84,"--But if you... if you... Congress was to say, well, too bad, we tried to give them a break, we can't do it, so we're going to make them dischargeable just like any other debt, that would have a very adverse effect on all the other creditors in the picture who are not State actors."
2003.02-1606,0,20594,daryl_j_brand,,1474.84,1485.364,"It certainly would, Your Honor, but it also could create complications as far as... as far as whether States would choose to participate in... in student loan programs."
2003.02-1606,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.226,1541.507,"Very well, Mr. Brand."
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1543.198,1551.638,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1606,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1589.616,1590.154,The State lacked?
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1590.154,1591.64,--Jurisdiction over the--
2003.02-1606,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1591.64,1592.3,The State lacked?
2003.02-1606,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1592.3,1592.922,The Supreme Court.
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1592.922,1593.869,"--I'm... I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.385,1646.67,"Of course, in that case the State had come into bankruptcy... the bankruptcy court voluntarily."
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1646.67,1648.444,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1661.076,1686.589,"If... if we were to analogize bankruptcy proceedings to in rem proceedings in general, nevertheless this dischargeability proceeding is set up under the rules as an adversary one where a notice and a summons is filed on the State."
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1699.592,1725.227,To allow this case to be determined on the basis that an adversary proceeding had been filed would be elevating form over substance because the jurisdiction of the court with respect to the claim arises from the court's jurisdiction over the property of the estate and claims made against it and the... and the debtor.
2003.02-1606,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1773.607,1774.433,Well--
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1774.433,1776.579,--by denying here an opportunity for hardship.
2003.02-1606,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1776.579,1780.006,--What happens when you don't show up in an adversary proceeding?
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1780.006,1783.516,A default judgment is entered.
2003.02-1606,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.516,1783.721,A default judgment.
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1783.721,1783.887,Yes.
2003.02-1606,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.887,1807.377,"So how can you say... I mean, had it not been set up this way, I would assume that the bankruptcy judge would have to make his or her own determination about whether the condition of the statute had been met, but once you have this adversary system set up, I assume the bankruptcy judge is entirely within his or her rights by just saying, hey, the State hasn't shown up, the State loses."
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1807.377,1808.286,I would... I'd like--
2003.02-1606,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1808.286,1811.547,"Now, that... that doesn't seem to me to be elevating form over substance."
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1812.661,1816.831,"--Yes, and I... I believe I incorrectly stated what would happen, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.803,1831.57,So it wouldn't just go by default then if the State didn't show up?
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1831.57,1832.972,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1832.972,1835.534,Do you know any other adversary proceedings that work that way?
2003.02-1606,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1846.968,1859.061,"Well, in a... in a... in an ordinary suit for money judgment, if the defendant fails to show up, he can be defaulted as to liability, but he still has to show the money damages."
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1861.95,1865.665,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1606,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1865.665,1868.06,"Well, is... is the amount at issue here?"
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1868.06,1880.692,"The amount is at issue only to the extent that in order to show undue hardship, Ms. Hood has to demonstrate that she can't repay it."
2003.02-1606,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1880.692,1886.553,"Yes, but the... but the... the amount, how much it is, is not... is not in controversy, is it?"
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1886.553,1887.463,"No, it's not."
2003.02-1606,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1887.463,1888.472,I thought--
2003.02-1606,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1888.472,1889.942,--So what is the situation there?
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1934.608,1957.104,"Well, Justice Breyer, very often adversary proceedings are commenced in bankruptcy court and they're necessary when the kind of action that dispute... in dispute is the equivalent of an action that could have been commenced prior to the establishment of the bankruptcy."
2003.02-1606,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1958.014,1959.379,"Yes, I see--"
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1959.379,1962.889,"--prior, you know, action now brought into the bankruptcy court."
2003.02-1606,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1967.431,1968.507,"--No, I got that."
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1968.507,1969.0,--it would be a traditional action.
2003.02-1606,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1969.0,1970.403,So maybe there are no others.
2003.02-1606,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1975.333,1987.1,"Well, certainly an action by a trustee for... of voidable preference would be quite different, would it not?"
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,1987.1,2012.856,"With respect to a voidable preference, if... if the defendant did not demonstrate it had any defense, a judgment would be issued in favor of the... the State because there is a presumption for a voidable preference once certain factors are met."
2003.02-1606,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2012.856,2015.79,And there you're getting money from outside the estate too.
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2020.287,2038.453,"That's correct, Your Honor, but it is not Ms. Hood's position in this case that a preference action would fall within the traditional in rem jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court and thus the State sovereign immunity would be abrogated."
2003.02-1606,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2038.453,2046.376,"So you would... you would say that if the... if there were a suit for a voidable preference against the State, the 11th Amendment rule would prevail?"
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2046.376,2053.824,"I... that issue is unclear, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2089.08,2092.445,We're trying to get... I'm trying to get the answer still to Justice Scalia's question.
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2100.868,2101.361,--Yes.
2003.02-1606,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2101.361,2101.899,Okay.
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2130.03,2132.409,"It would... it would not be a default judgment, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2134.677,2136.041,I have one other technical question.
2003.02-1606,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2137.732,2138.642,--Excuse me.
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2144.177,2144.299,It would be a judgment--
2003.02-1606,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2144.299,2148.014,"I thought default judgments are, for all purposes, considered judgments on the merits."
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2152.183,2163.495,"--Oh, to... to the extent it is... there's greater flexibility of a defendant to come back and ask for reconsideration, I believe, under normal procedures."
2003.02-1606,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2163.495,2164.915,That doesn't make it not a decision on the merits.
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2168.613,2169.439,That's correct.
2003.02-1606,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2169.439,2191.276,"I thought that the question we... we were talking about before... that there was a clear and certain answer to the question, that... that if the claim is made that there's undue hardship, even if the State doesn't show up... well, let's take the... because this is written for all creditors and not particularly with States in mind."
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2201.678,2204.567,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-1606,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2204.567,2206.591,And where does that come from?
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2214.021,2227.396,I think it comes from the natural reading of the statute that such a finding has to be made that there would be an undue hardship for the debtor to have to repay that... that loan.
2003.02-1606,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2227.396,2236.934,"You... you could say the same about any default judgment in a case... in a tort action where the tort statute, you know, only imposes liability where the defendant has been negligent."
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2252.287,2268.512,"The difference... the difference is... Your Honor, is that all of the property of a debtor and claims against that property... they're... they're all under the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction."
2003.02-1606,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2292.411,2313.011,"In the voidable preference case, it's... it's as if we're... the suggestion is is that the bankruptcy court has the authority to order the res brought before it, commanding the State to deliver the res, i.e., the voidable preference."
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2313.011,2315.695,I... there is a question that--
2003.02-1606,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2315.695,2317.181,And... please.
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2317.181,2327.955,--with... with regard to a voidable preference action whether the funds the debtor would be seeking would be part of the res because it's not in the possession of the estate.
2003.02-1606,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2327.955,2328.698,Right.
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2328.698,2345.417,"And certainly that distinction can be made as made in California v.... v. Deep Sea Research, that if the property is in the possession of the... of the State, rather than the debtor, a different result is required with respect to the Eleventh Amendment."
2003.02-1606,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2345.417,2352.475,"Well, before the Bankruptcy Act in 1978, bankruptcy courts couldn't try voidable preferences."
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2354.333,2356.374,"That's correct, Justice Rehnquist."
2003.02-1606,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2356.374,2371.051,If in fact we assume... let's suppose when we look into this... suppose I was to come to the conclusion that an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy is identical to a case that has nothing to do with bankruptcy in a court.
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2422.504,2429.38,"Yes, it could, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2462.074,2466.903,"And even without 105, could the Rules Committee then devise a different rule?"
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2466.903,2468.472,"Certainly, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2468.472,2487.337,"Mr. Gerson, you... your position depends heavily on the characterization of bankruptcy proceedings as in rem, and one can understand that about the bankrupt estate, it collects whatever assets there are and distributes them."
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2497.451,2511.94,"Because the debtor itself, at least the pre-petition debtor, is also considered part of the res, part of the bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdiction."
2003.02-1606,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2553.346,2564.863,"So what you're saying is the... is the debtor is not a thing, is not a res, but a debtor... this is an adjudication over a status which traditionally is also in rem."
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2564.863,2566.144,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2662.367,2669.51,"Only a small piece of it, according to what you told us earlier, because you said this doesn't involve the preference question."
2003.02-1606,1,34520,leonard__h_gerson,,2669.51,2675.659,"--That's... that's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2717.657,2719.043,"Thank you, Mr. Gerson."
2003.02-1606,2,20594,daryl_j_brand,,2722.098,2723.13,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2754.42,2755.535,Is that loss of its right automatic?
2003.02-1606,2,20594,daryl_j_brand,,2766.27,2770.478,"I am not certain, Your Honor, but I believe that an undue hardship showing would still be necessary."
2003.02-1606,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2888.09,2888.6,I do have.
2003.02-1606,2,20594,daryl_j_brand,,2892.194,2893.074,--It's--
2003.02-1606,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2893.074,2894.423,What is the name of the case?
2003.02-1606,2,20594,daryl_j_brand,,2894.423,2895.721,--It's Hoffman v. Connecticut.
2003.02-1606,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2895.721,2896.364,"Hoffman, thank you."
2003.02-1606,2,20594,daryl_j_brand,,2896.364,2898.238,It's a 1989 case--
2003.02-1606,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2898.238,2898.571,Right.
2003.02-1606,2,20594,daryl_j_brand,,2898.571,2917.929,"--in which... in which the... the plurality of the Court found that Congress had not made a clear statement of intent to override sovereign immunity, but in which two Justices found that in any event Congress had no constitutional authority to override Eleventh Amendment immunity in such a setting."
2003.02-1606,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2920.324,2920.901,"Yes, I had one."
2003.02-1606,2,20594,daryl_j_brand,,2962.101,2972.132,"--Well, we... we did not mean that she would have obtained the undue hardship finding from the... the bankruptcy court, but that she could raise the issue of undue hardship in whatever State proceeding was initiated by the State."
2003.02-1606,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2972.132,2980.51,Why would the State ever initiate such a proceeding when it has much easier... it can garnish wages.
2003.02-1606,2,20594,daryl_j_brand,,2984.514,2988.191,"Your Honor, may I answer the question?"
2003.02-1606,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2988.191,2988.429,"Yes, briefly."
2003.02-1606,2,20594,daryl_j_brand,,2988.429,3008.557,"The answer is, as Your Honor suggests, the primary... the primary means under the student loan program would be through wage garnishments and through tax intercepts, but the Federal regulations and State law would afford the debtor opportunity for administrative proceedings to raise the undue hardship issue and prove that she should be absolved from the student loan debt."
2003.02-1606,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3011.984,3013.181,"Thank... thank you, Mr. Brand."
2003.02-1606,2,20594,daryl_j_brand,,3013.181,3014.174,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2003.02-1606,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3014.174,3014.667,The case is submitted.
