1984.83-5954,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.317,We'll hear arguments next in Lindahl against Office of Personnel Management.
1984.83-5954,0,31995,john_murcko,,75.952,79.882,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-5954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.747,214.241,"Well now, Mr. Murcko, I guess you have to persuade us, first of all, that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction by virtue of Section 7703, do you, before we even reach the 8347(c) question?"
1984.83-5954,0,31995,john_murcko,,214.241,215.122,No--
1984.83-5954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,215.122,218.315,Don't you have a preliminary step?
1984.83-5954,0,31995,john_murcko,,218.315,236.177,"--No, I don't believe that we do have to reach that issue, because I think in the retirement cases, the disability retirement cases, jurisdiction exists under 8347(c), and that that is the basis of jurisdiction."
1984.83-5954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,236.177,250.315,"Well, what if Section 7703 deals only with employees or applicants for employment and there was no jurisdiction conferred at all?"
1984.83-5954,0,31995,john_murcko,,250.315,261.523,"Well, we think that under 7703 that, first, that issue is not related here, that is not related to this case."
1984.83-5954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,299.058,302.241,You think it covers retired employees?
1984.83-5954,0,31995,john_murcko,,302.241,303.73,"--Yes, I think that it does."
1984.83-5954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,303.73,305.42,And survivors?
1984.83-5954,0,31995,john_murcko,,305.42,310.145,"No, I think it just covers employees or retired employees."
1984.83-5954,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,359.718,365.472,"Mr. Murcko, it would be helpful if you would raise your voice and stay near the center of the lectern."
1984.83-5954,0,31995,john_murcko,,365.472,365.832,"--I'm sorry, yes."
1984.83-5954,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,657.644,664.488,"Those were terminations, Mr. Murcko, that had been initiated by the person himself, the ones for mental disability?"
1984.83-5954,0,31995,john_murcko,,664.488,665.067,"--Well, no."
1984.83-5954,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,667.849,668.64,By the agency.
1984.83-5954,0,31995,john_murcko,,668.64,669.471,"Right, the agency."
1984.83-5954,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.829,730.911,"Well, Congress did at least change the language."
1984.83-5954,0,31995,john_murcko,,730.911,735.593,"Congress did make an amendment adding that section to it, that is correct."
1984.83-5954,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,934.052,946.531,"Mr. Murcko, it's Section 8347(c) that the Government relies on to say that the decision in your client's case case wasn't reviewable by the Federal Circuit?"
1984.83-5954,0,31995,john_murcko,,946.531,948.312,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-5954,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,948.312,959.351,"Now, was the language in 8347(c), was that existent, did that exist verbatim before the 1980 amendments?"
1984.83-5954,0,31995,john_murcko,,959.351,967.406,"Yes, it existed verbatim except it said... the amendment said except to the extent as provided in Section (d)."
1984.83-5954,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,969.877,973.179,And the rest of the language remained the same?
1984.83-5954,0,31995,john_murcko,,973.179,975.629,"That's correct, Your Honor, that's correct."
1984.83-5954,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1041.574,1048.319,Mr. Kneedler.
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1048.319,1052.14,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-5954,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.935,1263.712,"If you're right on the first point, the Federal Circuit world have had no jurisdiction to review this claim."
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1282.214,1291.13,"8347(c) would preclude review on the question of disability in any court, by the Federal Circuit or by the district or Claims Court under the Tucker Act."
1984.83-5954,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1291.13,1295.615,So 8347 applies across the board regardless of which court you're in?
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1295.615,1296.223,Yes.
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.907,1326.202,"Am I right, Mr. Kneedler, that what would happen if we accepted your first submission is that we'd dismiss the appeal, he'd refile in the district court or the Court of Claims, go right back to the Federal Circuit, and lose there again, presumably, because they've already decided this question?"
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1328.265,1332.397,"Well, that... I don't think it would be necessary to dismiss the appeal in this case."
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.028,1350.879,--But wouldn't that court be bound by the opinion that's on the books now of the Federal Circuit?
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1350.879,1355.842,"--Well, I think as a legal matter perhaps technically not, because I presume the judgment--"
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1355.842,1356.573,But as a practical matter?
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1356.573,1358.553,--would be vacated in this case.
1984.83-5954,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.841,1370.672,"Well, how could we remand a case which we had no jurisdiction to hear?"
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1370.672,1386.894,"Well, I think it might be in aid of the Court's... the Court certainly has jurisdiction to decide the jurisdictional question, and in that event I think it could reasonably be in aid of the Court's decision on that jurisdictional question."
1984.83-5954,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1386.894,1390.965,We would dismiss the appeal and then remand the case?
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1390.965,1392.257,Dismiss the petition.
1984.83-5954,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1402.773,1408.088,"And there'd be a transfer, if that may be done, Mr. Kneedler, without entering a new judgment below?"
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1408.088,1412.4,I don't think it would be necessary to enter a judgment.
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1492.372,1494.333,"Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you this question."
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1531.398,1533.629,I'm not sure I understand the question.
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1533.629,1550.48,"Well, is it not correct that there is in 8337(c) a provision for temporary disability for employees, who retain their status as employees, and therefore their right to review would be governed by 7703?"
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1550.48,1552.051,I don't think so.
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1552.051,1553.691,There's no temporary disability provision?
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1553.691,1561.528,"No, as I read Section 8337(c) it refers to an annuitant receiving disability retirement."
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1569.613,1575.367,But you would say that even temporary disability claims are--
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1575.367,1576.128,Yes.
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1582.423,1583.013,--Right.
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1583.013,1590.928,"That I think just refers back to the periodic review of someone who is... it refers to an annuitant under 8337(c), not an employee."
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1678.797,1688.692,"Is it not possible... and again, I don't have a feel for the whole thing... that there would be claims where both types of claim would be asserted arising out of the same employment, a personnel action that somebody--"
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1688.692,1689.973,An adverse action and a--
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1689.973,1691.125,--Yes.
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1693.847,1700.51,"--Yes, and in fact OPM recently revised its procedures to try to separate the two to the degree possible."
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1789.07,1794.524,--Why would Congress want the two different procedures for two rather similar types of cases?
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1794.524,1798.445,"Well, in one respect they aren't that similar."
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.818,1865.339,"But it is your view that there would be an extra layer of review in the retirement situation, but not in the other?"
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1868.101,1869.513,"--Yes, that is true."
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1869.513,1873.403,--Just the sort of thing you criticized in the Florida Power & Light case.
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1873.403,1879.688,"Well, the judgment is not... I'm not here suggesting what would be the best policy judgment."
1984.83-5954,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2178.474,2182.067,These are the actions that are initiated originally by the agency?
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2182.067,2183.667,"By the agency, that's correct."
1984.83-5954,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2376.585,2382.999,"But Mr. Kneedler, if you are correct on your first point, then we don't reach this question?"
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2382.999,2384.201,That's correct.
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2384.201,2387.713,Mr. Kneedler... did you finish your answer?
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2387.713,2388.674,Yes.
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2388.674,2398.298,In your earlier point you discussed the difference between actions by the Office of Personnel Management on the one hand and actions of the employing agency on the other hand.
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2408.767,2410.908,Which--
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2410.908,2413.399,The language that they're not subject to review.
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2416.661,2425.287,"--No, I think not, because historically the retirement program was always centrally administered, not handled by the employing agencies."
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2430.771,2431.602,Right.
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2431.602,2434.152,So I don't think it carries that connotation.
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2434.152,2437.014,That would have been understood even if this language were not in?
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2437.014,2438.925,"Yes, yes."
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2597.0,2598.95,"Mr. Kneedler, I just want to be sure you address one thing before you sit down."
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2610.878,2617.944,"Well, in fact what the committee report is referring to is back to the Director of OPM's letter, that the Director would not oppose that."
1984.83-5954,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2682.509,2684.159,"Well, the House report says that"
1984.83-5954,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2693.073,2697.776,"Well, I understood that to be referring back to the Director."
1984.83-5954,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2850.088,2852.979,"Mr. Murcko, do you have anything further?"
1984.83-5954,2,31995,john_murcko,,2852.979,2855.821,"Yes, I have a few points if I have some further time."
1984.83-5954,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3258.46,3259.129,"Thank you, gentlemen."
