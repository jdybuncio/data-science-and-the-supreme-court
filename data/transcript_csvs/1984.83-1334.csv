1984.83-1334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.907,We will hear arguments first this morning in Winston against Lee.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,13.06,28.78,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in 1982, Rudolph Lee attempted to rob a supermarket, and for his efforts received a bullet in his shoulder."
1984.83-1334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,78.232,81.255,Do you feel that you needed that evidence in this case?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,81.255,82.236,"Yes, sir, I do."
1984.83-1334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,111.955,113.525,You say this is particularly difficult in Richmond?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,113.525,114.597,Pardon me?
1984.83-1334,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,114.597,117.589,You say this is particularly difficult in Richmond.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,117.589,118.167,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,127.995,139.663,"While you are on that point, do you understand that if you do go to trial without the bullet, you would be able to put into evidence the refusal of the defendant to submit to this operation?"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,139.663,140.464,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,141.405,144.165,"That would be a rather persuasive bit of evidence in itself, wouldn't it?"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,144.165,151.58,"--Yes, sir, it would, but it also is clouded by the fact that he says, sure, I have a bullet in me, but I didn't get it from attempting to rob the supermarket."
1984.83-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,153.98,156.073,"Then you ask him, why didn't you have this operation?"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,158.174,160.005,I hold my body inviolate.
1984.83-1334,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,167.31,185.473,"Mr. Garrett, on the same point, do you think that as the intrusion in the body becomes greater to recover the bullet, that the corresponding need of the state for the evidence should be greater in order to justify taking it?"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,185.473,190.234,"--If I understand you, ma'am, the deeper the bullet, or the more complicated it is to get it?"
1984.83-1334,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.234,197.869,Do you think the state's need for the evidence should be greater to justify taking it out as it gets more difficult to remove?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,197.869,198.25,Somewhat.
1984.83-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,239.817,244.271,Haven't people died during simple operations?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,244.271,245.791,I am sure they have somewhere.
1984.83-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,246.472,249.174,Like tonsillitis.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,251.825,253.758,"I am sure... yes, sir, they have died."
1984.83-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,253.758,256.74,Don't you agree that any operation is serious if you out somebody?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,256.74,260.391,"No, sir, I don't believe all operations are serious."
1984.83-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,260.391,262.782,But what if it is a general anesthetic?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,269.016,275.34,"The anesthesiologist in this particular case has performed over 150,000, and he has yet to lose the very first one."
1984.83-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,303.049,309.804,"Anyway, the court below didn't turn on that at all, did it, on whether it was a general anesthetic?"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,309.804,314.328,"They ruled... yes, sir, that was their reason, because it was a general anesthesia."
1984.83-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,314.328,318.162,So you think that is not a very good line?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,318.162,318.49,I don't think so.
1984.83-1334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,320.791,326.367,Didn't one physician say that it could be done with a local anesthetic in about 20 minutes?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,326.367,332.98,"The anesthesiologist said it could be, but in this case it was the particular surgeon who said, I want to use a general anesthesia."
1984.83-1334,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,358.608,366.092,"Mr. Garrett, do you propose, then, that the standard of reasonableness is whether it is minor surgery or not?"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,366.092,368.093,I think that should be one of the tests.
1984.83-1334,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,373.278,376.96,"That isn't your test then, whether it is minor surgery?"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,376.96,380.701,--You can get into debate as to what is minor and what is major.
1984.83-1334,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,380.701,382.661,"Yes, I was going to get to that."
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,384.935,394.121,"I think any test, whatever it be, has to include the amount of risk to the victim, or to the person undergoing the surgery."
1984.83-1334,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.955,403.417,So you don't propose that minor surgery be the standard?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,403.417,408.4,"--That is an artful term, ma'am, and it is hard to say."
1984.83-1334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,424.98,428.312,"You are talking about an automobile, not a person, I take it."
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,428.312,429.374,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,429.374,442.331,But any operation that had any substantial risk of a permanent disability or of death you wouldn't classify as minor.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,442.331,443.142,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,452.87,454.27,That is your test then?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,454.27,456.112,That is the way I define it.
1984.83-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,456.112,456.871,Yes.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,456.871,459.912,"I mean, I don't... what is minor or major."
1984.83-1334,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,510.375,519.432,"Mr. Garrett, is there any evidence in the record as to the utility of ballistic test examinations?"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,524.995,528.037,--I am not sure the record contains much.
1984.83-1334,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,581.222,587.566,"Is it possible that the bullet itself, if it were extracted, would not be in perfect condition for a comparison?"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,587.566,590.718,I don't think it would probably be in perfect condition.
1984.83-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.848,630.773,"The court below proceeded on the basis that even if it is very probative and would be necessary, you nevertheless couldn't get it."
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,630.773,632.105,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,632.105,640.65,So we should judge the case on the assumption that the bullet... that the state really has an interest in getting the bullet.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,640.65,648.966,They minimized that interest by saying that the risk to Mr. Lee was too great.
1984.83-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.966,656.372,"I know, but the reason they ruled against you was that the risk was too great?"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,656.372,658.273,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,658.273,659.985,Not that you didn't need the bullet.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,659.985,661.075,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,661.075,683.961,"Mr. Garrett, Judge Widener in his dissent in the Fourth Circuit felt that the cases of Younger and Harris and Perez against LaDezma should have prevented the federal courts from ever getting into this case before it had run its process in the state, but he criticized the majority for not discussing it."
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,686.071,690.904,"Initially when we went into federal court, they were raised."
1984.83-1334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,690.904,696.588,You didn't raise them in the Fourth Circuit?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,696.588,698.46,"No, sir, it was not raised in the Fourth Circuit at all."
1984.83-1334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,698.46,717.901,"From your earlier response to one of the questions, you said that if the bullet were extracted on the ballistic tests, or you intimated if you didn't say it, that the ballistic tests showed that it had not come from the gun of this man that had been found."
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,721.784,722.804,Absolutely.
1984.83-1334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,722.804,723.795,The state would probably dismiss?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,723.795,724.636,Just dismiss the charge.
1984.83-1334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,725.588,734.532,"So the search, the examination of the bullet is in your view as much to produce his innocence as his guilt?"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,734.532,735.543,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,735.543,744.139,"Well, what would you have done if the finding, if they got the bullet out and then couldn't say that it was fired from the victim's gun?"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,744.139,747.471,I would have to go to trial with that knowledge.
1984.83-1334,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,747.471,748.68,You would go to trial?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,748.68,751.284,"Yes, sir, because Mr. Watkinson is--"
1984.83-1334,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,751.284,753.875,But the surgery would have been for nothing.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,765.944,776.42,"--I cannot answer that 100 percent, sir, because we don't know until we actually see the bullet, but from all indication, they will be able to tell, because--"
1984.83-1334,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,776.42,779.793,I understood that sometimes you can't.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,784.124,784.575,"--Yes, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,791.24,792.531,Only in those circumstances?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,792.531,793.34,Most of the time.
1984.83-1334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,813.224,817.406,Where was this gun located?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,817.406,819.148,"Where was the gun located, sir?"
1984.83-1334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,819.148,820.378,Yes.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,825.621,828.714,Moments after the shooting.
1984.83-1334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,841.724,844.225,There is no doubt about whose gun?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,844.225,845.547,"No, sir, none at all."
1984.83-1334,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,846.636,866.461,"I notice in respondent's brief the statement that the firearms identification expert didn't know whether or not a microscopic examination of the bullet itself would show that it was fired from that, and then he goes on to say,"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,875.537,876.476,"No, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,890.984,893.896,Here they were talking about the expert's testimony.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,896.98,899.69,The tests were run after that hearing was held.
1984.83-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,899.69,903.333,Did you contradict the expert's testimony?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,903.333,904.465,Did I contradict it?
1984.83-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,916.303,917.592,"I mean, that's in the record?"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,917.592,920.394,"--No, sir, because it happened afterwards."
1984.83-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,920.394,921.286,It is not in the record?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,921.286,921.786,"No, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,923.449,927.38,Does the record tell us why your adversary doesn't consent to the operation?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,927.38,928.772,"No, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.266,942.069,And he does not place on the record any reason for not having the operation?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,942.069,942.69,"No, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.694,1001.809,"Why shouldn't the state be put, in a situation like this, be put to saying to the court, well, without this bullet we will just have to dismiss?"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1012.604,1013.726,"I have to go forward, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.726,1017.079,So the most you can say is that it would help you case.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1017.079,1018.288,Help it considerably.
1984.83-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.288,1021.48,"Well, I know, but without it... you wouldn't dismiss it, though, without the bullet."
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1021.48,1022.211,"No, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1022.211,1023.541,You would still go through this.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1026.205,1027.474,Considerably.
1984.83-1334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1032.558,1035.702,That is just based on your experience with juries in Richmond?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1035.702,1036.1,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1036.1,1039.082,"Well, but you have an eye--"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1051.271,1051.981,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1051.981,1054.902,But the blood test would tie it up.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1056.492,1057.323,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1057.323,1059.735,So that your bullet is just like the blood.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1059.735,1061.277,"Yes, sir, in that regard."
1984.83-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.038,1082.59,"Yes, but that's not all the evidence you've got."
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1091.929,1092.647,"--That's correct, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1092.647,1098.761,"I mean, the probabilities are fairly remote, it seems to me, that this denial will have any credibility."
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1110.84,1111.731,That's correct.
1984.83-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1111.731,1118.895,"I mean, I don't... really, I just don't think this is a typical one on one confrontation between a defendant and the victim."
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1118.895,1125.159,It is typical in that it is as typical as you can have when you have the alleged perpetrator being shot by his victim.
1984.83-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1125.159,1135.805,"Well, except that you've got the alleged perpetrator here who admittedly has a bullet in him, and he is not willing to explain where it came... we've got a theory about where it came from which is highly implausible."
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1135.805,1137.948,At trial--
1984.83-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.948,1139.397,There is no corroboration.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1144.72,1161.943,"--I have no idea how the trial court would rule, but if the police officer would testify when asked the question, what did Lee tell you how he got that bullet, objection, hearsay, would you advise Mr. Lee of his rights, obviously, you suspect him of being the victim... or the perpetrator of this particular crime."
1984.83-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1163.183,1167.397,"Yes, but you can surely put into evidence the fact that he would not consent to the operation."
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1167.397,1168.316,Certainly.
1984.83-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1168.316,1169.167,At least I would think so.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1172.41,1174.58,That could come in.
1984.83-1334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.58,1178.343,"Well, anyway, I shouldn't... I am getting off on a collateral point, I guess."
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1181.515,1182.406,Of course.
1984.83-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1182.406,1184.837,"But that doesn't give you a right to take one, does it?"
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1184.837,1185.649,"No, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1188.501,1195.624,"I mean, all I am saying is, the fact that it makes it easier for the prosecutor isn't a right of the prosecutor."
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1195.624,1198.897,But I think I have a right to use evidence that is available.
1984.83-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1198.897,1200.399,That is not what I said.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1200.399,1201.258,"I agree, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1201.258,1202.36,It makes it easier.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1202.36,1203.662,It definitely makes it easier.
1984.83-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1203.662,1205.521,You are not alleging that at all.
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1205.521,1206.483,"Pardon me, sir?"
1984.83-1334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1206.483,1208.143,You are not urging that on us at all?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1208.143,1209.064,"No, sir."
1984.83-1334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1209.064,1213.747,Did the record show what happened to the storekeeper's gun or the victim's gun?
1984.83-1334,0,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,1218.759,1220.291,No gun was ever found.
1984.83-1334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1220.291,1237.722,Mr. Winston?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1237.722,1253.263,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I noted Justice White had asked the question, what if there is a general anesthesia to be used in this case."
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.437,1264.73,"I knew that that is what was proposed, a general anesthetic."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1264.73,1265.779,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1334,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1371.989,1385.409,"Well, Mr. Winston, now, in Schmerber, when the blood test was authorized, there is no suggestion that the extent that the state needed the evidence was a factor, is there?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1385.409,1387.62,"Well, I believe that--"
1984.83-1334,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1387.62,1396.105,"It just said, if the evidence is relevant, it can be obtained by means of the blood test."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1404.47,1412.968,"--I think it becomes the initial inquiry, and I believe that the need factor... perhaps if I could borrow from the--"
1984.83-1334,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1412.968,1420.681,"Well, why wasn't it a factor in Schmerber, which also involved some degree of pain and discomfort, I assume."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1420.681,1448.391,"--Perhaps I am in error, but my recollection of Schmerber is that need in the general sense was a very great factor influencing the Court's decision, the national problem of drunken driving and the need for an effective test to determine who is drunk and who is not as a means of detecting, both detecting that behavior and deterring it in the future."
1984.83-1334,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1452.352,1456.145,"Well, if it was, it wasn't articulated, was it?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1456.145,1460.409,"I may be incorrect, but I believe that it was."
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1460.409,1462.289,"Well, at least--"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1462.289,1464.112,And I believe in Breithaupt as well.
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1464.112,1470.617,--there was no indication in Schmerber that the prosecution would not have gone forward without the blood test.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1470.617,1474.268,"No, I believe they would have gone forward in that case as well."
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1474.268,1478.38,"Yes, so it is just a question of having more evidence than you had before."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1478.38,1479.77,I think that's correct.
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.77,1489.017,"Or just maybe it would be relevant evidence, and any relevant evidence supposedly would make the case better for the prosecution."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1489.017,1491.678,"If it is beyond merely being cumulative, I think."
1984.83-1334,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1491.678,1514.636,"Over and above that, isn't there an obligation on the prosecution to come forward with evidence that is exculpatory as well as inculpatory, and that if the ballistics test didn't bear out, or if they showed that it was not the same gun, your man would walk out, wouldn't he?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1514.636,1532.256,"I think that's correct, but I think that is, since we have a defendant in this case rather than... I think this case is about people's rights, and not defendants' rights, but since we have a defendant in this case, I think that that is correct, but I think it is, and it is the defendant's choice."
1984.83-1334,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1549.748,1560.143,"Are you suggesting that if he thought it would help him, he might have the operation?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1560.143,1563.846,That's not the way it's been expressed to me.
1984.83-1334,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1566.808,1579.818,"Mr. Winston, at the time of the first series of hearings in this case, it was thought that the bullet was only a half a centimeter below the skin."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1586.982,1594.147,"I don't believe I have ever changed my position, but I am not sure in regard to what, Your Honor."
1984.83-1334,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1594.147,1601.55,"Well, you have always taken the position, as I understood it, that there could be no cutting without the permission of the defendant."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1601.55,1605.193,"Well, what Your Honor has styled as--"
1984.83-1334,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1605.193,1606.465,Is that correct or not?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1611.819,1613.778,"--No, I would say that my position has modified somewhat."
1984.83-1334,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1621.903,1623.045,"--Oh, there are three hearings?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1623.045,1627.559,He has given three separate opinions at different points in time as to the location of the bullet.
1984.83-1334,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1627.559,1627.828,Yes.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1627.828,1640.556,"Originally he thought it was much deeper and would take about a 45-minute procedure to operate, but then he did come back, as Your Honor quite correctly points out, and says that it was just beneath the skin, in the fatty tissue."
1984.83-1334,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1644.099,1646.961,Would require only local anesthesia?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1646.961,1651.212,"--Local infiltration anesthesia, a solution of 1 percent Xylocaine."
1984.83-1334,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1666.864,1673.649,So there would be no balancing under any circumstances if any cutting were required?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1673.649,1675.94,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1334,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1676.541,1680.054,Regardless of how much the state may need the particular bullet?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1680.054,1681.323,--I beg your pardon?
1984.83-1334,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1681.323,1685.116,Regardless of the state interest in obtaining the bullet?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1685.116,1693.681,"Well, I am assuming that they have an interest, because I think if they don't have an interest, we don't even get to looking at how serious the procedure is."
1984.83-1334,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1693.681,1694.943,But that interest may vary.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1699.204,1700.145,"Oh, the need would be much more minimal."
1984.83-1334,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1700.145,1701.615,The state interest would be minimal.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1730.245,1744.515,"I have not abandoned that position, but I have modified it to some degree, because under the facts as they presently exist, I don't believe that I need a per se rule."
1984.83-1334,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1765.539,1775.995,"Well, Mr. Winston, if we reverse, how much balancing may judges do in circumstances like this?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1775.995,1779.568,How much balancing?
1984.83-1334,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1779.568,1789.963,"If we reverse, and say that the intrusion to this extent, at least, is permissible without violating any of the principles of Schmerber."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1789.963,1811.127,"I think that would create a great deal of confusion, because what we have here, the petitioners are urging this major-minor surgery distinction on the Court, but in this case it is not so clear, major-minor surgery."
1984.83-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1855.196,1860.73,"It is also true that major surgery is sometimes performed with a local anesthetic, is it not?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1860.73,1865.214,"Oh, I think that is absolutely correct, Your Honor, because some local anesthetics are extremely dangerous."
1984.83-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1872.997,1877.412,Does the ex-ray dispose the caliber of the bullet?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1877.412,1880.784,I don't believe that it does.
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1882.064,1884.254,But you know... you have the gun.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1885.185,1891.79,--The firearms identification expert testified that it was a.32 caliber revolver.
1984.83-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1891.79,1902.387,And you say the record does not show as of now what is the caliber of the bullet that is under his collarbone or near his collarbone?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1902.387,1904.079,"No, that is not in the record, Your Honor."
1984.83-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1904.079,1907.502,"Is it ascertainable, if you know?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1907.502,1915.827,"I asked the firearms identification expert about that on cross examination at the hearing, and he said he could not make that determination from an ex-ray."
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.827,1921.17,"Well, he couldn't say it wasn't a.45, or it wasn't a.22?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1921.17,1927.264,"Well, perhaps I should have had a more lengthy cross examination."
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.53,1963.328,"Don't you agree that... as I understand the state's position is that it wouldn't be any balancing in the state's position as long as the evidence is relevant and would improve their case, and that is not a question of balancing, then they are entitled to it unless there is a substantial risk of death or disfigurement or some other kind of permanent in jury."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1963.328,1964.527,That's my understanding of the argument.
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.527,1966.63,"Yes, and that isn't a balancing test at all, is it?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1973.363,1976.625,Unless there is the... unless the doctor comes in and says it is major surgery--
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1976.625,1982.559,"Yes, well, that isn't a balancing test of need from case to case."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,1987.812,1991.896,--I think that's correct.
1984.83-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1991.896,2002.655,"May I ask you if you think the test would vary at all depending on if the bullet were not in the accused person, but rather were in a third party, a witness's body?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2005.627,2013.791,I don't see how the fact that the man was accused of a crime changes his Fourth Amendment right's at all.
1984.83-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2018.633,2021.976,So you would say it is the same case.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2028.05,2029.362,"That has, of course, come up twice in the past."
1984.83-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2029.362,2030.321,--Yes.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2030.321,2040.72,The Supreme Court of Georgia says that... appears to say that defendants have fewer Fourth Amendment rights than witnesses do.
1984.83-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2067.166,2077.802,"So not only would you say that it is not different whether it is a witness or a defendant, but it also should be the same test if the defendant wanted the evidence as if the state wanted it."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2077.802,2080.206,I don't see any reason for any difference.
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.206,2091.503,"I suppose the danger to the state's case is a matter of identification, whether the jury believes the victim."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2091.503,2093.974,I think that's essentially correct.
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.375,2098.576,And was there ever a line-up in this case?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2105.181,2106.773,That's all that's in the record.
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.773,2110.774,"And I don't know whether he was then in bad shape or not, the victim."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2112.046,2112.925,Yes.
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2112.925,2114.648,Was he in bad shape?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2114.648,2116.618,He was--
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2116.618,2120.021,"Well, anyway, is that the only pretrial identification there was?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2120.021,2125.594,"--The confrontation in the emergency room, that's the only one that's reflected in this record."
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.594,2126.986,There never was a line-up?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2126.986,2130.239,There was not a line-up.
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2141.405,2145.787,"Well, it depends, I suppose, on how good a witness they think he is, or maybe--"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2145.787,2149.71,"Well, I cross examined him at the preliminary hearing, and I couldn't shake him."
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2149.71,2158.676,"--But I suppose if you were on the other side, you would like to have the bullet."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2158.676,2162.689,"I don't know that that is so, Your Honor."

1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.496,2207.597,"--It really isn't a Younger against Harris case, is it?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2208.849,2215.544,"Well, the first thing is, whatever happened to it, it is gone now."
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.775,2224.76,"--Do you think it is a semi... it may be, but isn't it a semi-jurisdictional thing?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2224.76,2226.651,"It affects the jurisdictional, but--"
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.651,2227.021,In the federal courts?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2233.496,2238.739,"--Well, I think we had a nearly identical, very similar factual situation."
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.739,2241.119,"--Maybe we can waive Younger against Harris, but I don't know."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2241.119,2249.365,"Ohio Bureau of Employment Services against Fidori, that was a case involving a state agency action."
1984.83-1334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2286.651,2296.025,"But all you are saying is that the state has asked that the Fourth Circuit's holding be reviewed, not that they submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the District Court in the first instance."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2296.025,2298.539,"Oh, no, I had them brought into the District Court."
1984.83-1334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2298.539,2306.042,"Yes, and my understanding from what your opponent said was that they raised this point in the District Court, and the District Court ruled against them on this point."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2306.042,2311.676,"It is difficult to tell whether they raised the question or not, because they never filed any pleadings."
1984.83-1334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2322.683,2326.355,And the District Court ruled against them on that?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2326.355,2328.826,Ruled against them on the Younger question.
1984.83-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2384.642,2388.616,Wouldn't that be a routine police practice in any such case as this?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2388.616,2391.838,To go ahead and fire the weapon?
1984.83-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2391.838,2392.329,Yes.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2392.329,2393.17,I would think so.
1984.83-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2393.17,2393.979,Yes.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2400.985,2413.042,"To fire it to see if it does have grooves on it, but then the question is whether it has grooves on it, and there is no evidence to that effect, but only what I have heard for the first time this morning."
1984.83-1334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2413.042,2419.487,And the record of other cases will show that sometimes you can't find any grooves.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2419.487,2420.405,"Oh, I think the--"
1984.83-1334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2420.405,2422.819,"The barrel of the gun is so corroded, it will not show at all."
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2422.819,2424.189,"Well, that's in the evidence in this case."
1984.83-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2540.368,2546.292,"Mr. Winston, do you agree that the record does not show the reason for the refusal?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2546.292,2550.603,--I believe that the record shows it through counsel.
1984.83-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2552.874,2554.276,And what is the reason?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2554.276,2557.068,--He does not want to be cut open.
1984.83-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2557.068,2559.509,But that doesn't tell us why he doesn't want to be cut open.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2559.509,2568.054,He believes that it is up to him--
1984.83-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2568.054,2571.817,"Is this in the record... now, I am just asking... or are you now telling me what you think?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2571.817,2589.88,"--I believe that my position and Mr. Lee's position through me has been consistent and the same at all times in that regard, that it is his and his doctor's decision to make whether or not he goes under the knife."
1984.83-1334,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2589.88,2597.054,And there is no explanation of why he might not want to have the benefit of exculpatory evidence available?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2597.054,2598.566,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2598.566,2606.28,Was there any cross examination about what his medical history on surgery had been up to that time?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2606.28,2618.067,"The only thing in the record, I believe, is that for reasons I don't know he has had two previous anesthesias without untoward consequences."
1984.83-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2633.437,2643.325,"Do you think the invasion of privacy is fundamentally different from what it was in Schmerber, extracting blood?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2643.325,2650.708,"--It is the same in kind, but much greater in magnitude."
1984.83-1334,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2792.211,2803.979,"Mr. Winston, you concede, do you, that the evidence of your client's refusal to allow the bullet to be retrieved can come into evidence against him?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2803.979,2806.301,"Well, I wouldn't make that concession at all."
1984.83-1334,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2819.028,2825.022,"You would not equate it, then, with admission into evidence of a refusal to have a blood alcohol test?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2825.022,2837.742,"Well, of course, that is a question with which I am not very familiar, because in our state that is prohibited by statute."
1984.83-1334,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2841.054,2853.002,"Mr. Winston, may I ask, you didn't get... or rather, what relief you did get on habeas in the District Court was reversed by the Court of Appeals, wasn't it?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2853.002,2868.521,"They vacated on the ground that there had to be, that the two remedies were so inconsistent that when the plaintiff petitioner prosecuted them both to the judgment stage, the Court was required to make an election."
1984.83-1334,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2868.521,2875.036,But you brought both the habeas and a 1983 action.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2875.036,2876.257,"Yes, Your Honor, one paper."
1984.83-1334,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2876.257,2879.76,And the relief you got was in the 1983 suit?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2879.76,2882.001,We got a permanent injunction and a writ of habeas corpus.
1984.83-1334,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2882.001,2884.012,"And you got habeas, too, did you?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2884.012,2884.563,From Judge Merritt.
1984.83-1334,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2885.103,2894.249,I didn't understand what it meant that the Court of Appeals said it wasn't cognizable on habeas because it related only to conditions of confinement.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2894.249,2897.22,"I have a very difficult time understanding that rationale, but that's what they said."
1984.83-1334,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2897.22,2902.784,"Well, really, what I am getting at is, do we still have the habeas here, or do we have only the 1983--"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2902.784,2906.146,"No, Your Honor, I cross-petitioned on the vacating of the habeas corpus, and it was denied."
1984.83-1334,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2906.146,2909.048,--So the habeas is not here.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2909.048,2909.819,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1334,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2909.819,2911.089,It is only the 1983 suit.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2911.089,2911.61,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1334,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2912.491,2913.361,All right.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2928.06,2935.185,"Well, the ruling of the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond is not a final judgment."
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2936.635,2940.498,Didn't you go up to the Virginia Supreme Court?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2940.498,2943.39,On appeal and habeas corpus and prohibition.
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.682,2945.951,They turned you down.
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2945.951,2948.803,And I suppose that I could have tried to--
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2948.803,2950.566,Would that have been... could you have brought that here?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2950.566,2952.957,"--I suppose that I could have tried, but I--"
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.957,2956.868,"I know you could have tried, but I just... would it have been a final judgment?"
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2956.868,2964.415,--Possibly on the prohibition aspect of the case.
1984.83-1334,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.336,2986.73,Was the defendant in jail or on bail?
1984.83-1334,1,33498,joseph_ryland_winston,,2986.73,2990.743,"He was in jail in lieu of $30,000 bond."
1984.83-1334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3035.932,3040.136,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Garrett?"
1984.83-1334,2,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,3040.136,3041.838,"Just briefly, Your Honor."
1984.83-1334,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3072.626,3078.21,Does the record show why the surgeons in the emergency room didn't remove that bullet at the time?
1984.83-1334,2,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,3078.21,3080.2,"Yes, sir, it was not life-threatening."
1984.83-1334,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3085.666,3093.8,"General Garrett, can I ask you if you would apply the same standard that you seek to apply in this case if the bullet were lodged in a witness rather than a potential defendant?"
1984.83-1334,2,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,3093.8,3095.17,I was afraid you were going to ask that.
1984.83-1334,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3100.763,3105.678,"Because you have to... even though you have a lot of evidence, we have to treat him as presumptively innocent."
1984.83-1334,2,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,3105.678,3106.537,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1334,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3109.349,3112.521,And I gather it would have to be the same standard if the defendant were seeking the evidence.
1984.83-1334,2,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,3112.521,3113.212,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1334,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3116.665,3131.945,"Do you think I correctly described your position in speaking with your opponent that as long as it is relevant evidence, you can get it unless there is a substantial threat of disfigurement or death or something like that?"
1984.83-1334,2,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,3131.945,3132.924,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1334,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3158.624,3159.204,I don't know.
1984.83-1334,2,41359,stacy_f_garrett_iii,,3161.445,3171.93,"--I don't think you could, sir, because the time, the passage of time, the evidence of intoxication was dissipated, and the alcohol wouldn't be in the blood, especially if it were a day or so afterwards."
1984.83-1334,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3186.782,3187.783,"Thank you, gentlemen."
