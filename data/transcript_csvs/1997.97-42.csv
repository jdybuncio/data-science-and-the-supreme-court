1997.97-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.287,"We'll hear argument now in number 97-42, Eastern Enterprises vs. Kenneth S. Apfel."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,10.008,12.84,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1997.97-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,58.59,61.783,Are you arguing substantive due process or procedural due process?
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,61.783,69.516,"Your Honor, we have attempted to the best we can not to put a label, but if a label is necessary."
1997.97-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,69.516,72.438,I suggest you are going to have to if you are going to persuade us.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,72.438,87.709,"Your Honor, if a label must be placed it would have to be substantive due process but as we have pointed out in our briefs, the values that we seek to protect here are largely procedural values."
1997.97-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.919,104.822,You went... it went through the legislative process.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,112.356,125.415,Certainly the Court has restricted procedural due process to the legislative process in the past and we don't mean to suggest that in order to prevail in this case the Court needs to create a new doctrine.
1997.97-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,125.415,137.403,"And substantive due process as you know is not in good odor with regard to economic rights for some reason, although we still apply it with respect to noneconomic rights."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,137.403,142.256,"It certainly has not been in good favor for some decades, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,163.5,177.108,"Well, if your client is not, maybe as sympathetic a client as some of the ones talked about in some of the amicus briefs filed in this case."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,187.114,188.655,We transferred--
1997.97-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,188.655,191.276,And then there was cross management.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,204.957,225.161,"--We are certainly not in the same shoes of those amici who have been driven into bankruptcy, but in terms of the analytical application of the statute to Eastern, liability has been imposed on Eastern solely because it was an employer of miner's before 1946."
1997.97-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,225.161,228.802,Let me ask you one more question and then I'll subside here.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,238.561,259.125,"Section 9706(f), Justice O'Connor, preserves to Eastern any right that it may have had to seek recovery from its subsidiary or the party to whom it sold the subsidiary, Peabody Coal."
1997.97-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,261.836,269.301,Did Eastern preserve a right of recovery against its subsidiary?
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,269.301,276.585,"In the action, in the third party action that we filed below, we alleged that we do have a right."
1997.97-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.65,320.283,Does the record tell us the amount and the extent of the liability and the number of the employees?
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,324.948,340.587,"Justice Kennedy, the record tells us that as of the time that we filed this lawsuit that 1,400 employees, former employees or their spouses had been assigned to Eastern."
1997.97-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,365.163,376.95,"But that's disputed to the extent, at least, that you would have a deduction for that expense, so that would bring that down a considerable amount without any other factor."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,376.95,381.606,"Certainly, Justice Ginsburg, and we are not attaching any special significance to the amount of money."
1997.97-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,381.606,394.131,"May I ask you, your position is that Eastern, which severed its relationship with these employees many decades ago, should not be responsible."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,417.166,435.648,"The test that we have suggested here, and that we think is reflected in the Court's precedence such as Concrete Pipe and Turner Elkhorn is whether a party upon whom Congress seeks to impose a retroactive liability has some reasonable basis to anticipate."
1997.97-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,435.648,437.07,Is there anybody... let's take this case specifically.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,452.341,462.977,There is a class of companies that are included within the Coal Act that we believe properly bear that responsibility.
1997.97-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,462.977,465.178,Would be Peabody who... currently in the business.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,465.178,471.111,We are not seeking at this point to shift our liability to any particular company.
1997.97-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.111,477.857,But which... these are... these are miners who stopped working in the mines in the 1960s.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,477.857,478.478,That's right.
1997.97-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,478.478,481.009,Who in this picture would be responsible for them?
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,481.009,499.922,If we are successful here the miners and their spouses assigned to Eastern will then be reassigned under the priority scheme set forth in the statute to other companies for whom those miners worked or in the absence of such a company will be assigned to what's called the orphan pool.
1997.97-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,499.922,507.236,"Would that be compatible with due process, just concentrating on the people who never worked for any existing company?"
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,507.236,507.967,Certainly.
1997.97-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,507.967,518.962,"These employees, these very employees, would it be compatible with due process to distribute them among employers who never had any employment relationship with them?"
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,518.962,520.563,"Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.97-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,520.563,522.486,What was the notice?
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,537.596,541.267,I don't wish to be categorical as to every single company.
1997.97-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.082,567.115,But for employees who were never beneficiaries of that plan.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,571.858,575.41,"--Some of them may be, Your Honor, but those--"
1997.97-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.41,576.7,Which ones wouldn't be?
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,576.7,577.391,"--Well, certainly--"
1997.97-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,577.391,584.437,Which ones who never employed these people or their decedents would be any closer to responsibility.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,603.31,609.725,--They undertook... they undertook an obligation that was at least as extensive as this obligation.
1997.97-42,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,609.725,615.869,"No, but the fact that I agree to do something for a certain amount... I don't quite understand your distinction."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,615.869,616.658,I agree with that.
1997.97-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,675.676,700.855,"Well, shouldn't, shouldn't you by a similar line of reasoning or shouldn't Eastern have understood that whatever its obligations may be, and I realize those are in question, but whatever its obligations may be, may be affected by the actions of the independent trustees so that it at any time in the future this kind of shortfall, let's say, from imprudent trustee action."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,727.802,745.423,"I would suggest that there is a difference of more than a degree, Justice Souter, in anticipating congressional action within a year or two after a particular development in the history of the plan, another over a generation."
1997.97-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,745.423,769.149,"With respect, perhaps congressional action might be difficult to anticipate, but the need for some action even if it be a lawsuit, judicial action, possibly, to enforce a liability thought to have been incurred, that certainly is not difficult to anticipate."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,777.795,780.476,"That's certainly the case, and our liability--"
1997.97-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,780.476,782.156,"I mean, that much was clear."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,790.444,800.972,"--That's exactly right and prior to 1965 as to the contracts that we signed, those were defined benefit... excuse me, defined contribution contracts."
1997.97-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,800.972,801.393,Limited to the contribution?
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,801.393,806.796,Limited to the contribution without any agreement as to defined benefits.
1997.97-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,806.796,823.067,"But the other side says that, that Congress found that you had created an expectation of lifetime benefits, even though you are only making defined contributions, you had created an expectation."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,825.238,843.081,"Justice Scalia, the Congress only made one finding, and that finding is in the preamble to the statute, and that finding simply says that those, that the Congress seeks to attach liabilities to those most responsible for planned liabilities, period."
1997.97-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.081,846.583,And the rest is from the commission report which the Congress did not itself adopt.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,846.583,847.685,Did not itself adopt.
1997.97-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,857.779,874.442,"If in fact in respect to expectations you had never formed a separate subsidiary, imagine you had never formed it and you stayed in business until 1987, then would you think it was constitutional for Congress to impose upon you the obligation that you are talking about today?"
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,874.442,886.528,"Not at all because it would not have been reasonable on the expectations argument, Justice Breyer, for miners or their spouses to develop any expectation at all as a result of Eastern's conduct."
1997.97-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,886.528,907.512,"So in your view if you had been in business until 1987 and all the companies that were in business up until 1992 or '93 or before this very act was passed, it's constitutional in your view for Congress to sell these companies in the mining industry that you have to take care of the miners who were there previous to 1992?"
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,907.512,909.525,Perhaps I misunderstood your question.
1997.97-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,916.579,917.1,No.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,938.594,942.206,--Our position here would be far weaker if we had never--
1997.97-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,942.206,945.238,"Yes, but I want to know if you think it is or isn't unconstitutional?"
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,945.238,949.64,--I think it is not unless this Court is willing.
1997.97-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,949.64,956.996,"Then your position is that in fact they can't impose these obligations on anybody, however long they stayed in as long as they left prior to this very law being passed; is that right?"
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,956.996,969.723,"Justice Breyer I want... meaning to be clear, I think this Court would have to extend Concrete Pipe in order for liability to attach to companies that were in business up until 1987 or 1988--"
1997.97-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,969.723,970.204,But is--
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,970.204,979.85,"--this Court could do that, and I think it is only a modest extension, but I do not believe that it is constitutional absent that, that determination by this Court."
1997.97-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,979.85,980.391,--All right.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,982.512,983.514,Absolutely.
1997.97-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,983.514,984.352,All right.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,993.118,1003.977,"Congress considered the extent to which it ought to pierce the corporate veil, and it did not."
1997.97-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1003.977,1004.528,Yes.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1005.417,1008.538,"Our expectation clearly was reasonable, we believe--"
1997.97-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1008.538,1009.119,Well--
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1009.119,1018.726,--because we had a well capitalized subsidiary that made all of the contributions that were asked of it and remained in business.
1997.97-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1018.726,1022.807,--That's very helpful because what I get from your answer is that's right.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1051.058,1064.655,"In this particular statute, Congress also pierced the veil and set up a category of responsible parties called related persons."
1997.97-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1075.974,1087.653,"Mr. Montgomery, I think you are saying that it doesn't matter what your expectation was, that even if your expectation was that there would be no veil piercing, that expectation has not been frustrated."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1087.653,1090.652,"It has not been frustrated, that's absolutely correct, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1090.652,1092.995,That the basis for your liability here is not veil piercing.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1092.995,1093.706,It is not.
1997.97-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1100.749,1104.833,"Are you putting all your eggs in the due process basket, I take it, today?"
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1104.833,1106.593,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1997.97-42,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1107.604,1108.854,"Well, I thought he had a takings claim?"
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1108.854,1110.526,--I do indeed.
1997.97-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1133.211,1141.556,What are the cases in which there is a taking but the government has not been enriched?
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1161.568,1171.416,Hodel v. Irving with respect to the escheat of title rights on Indian lands.
1997.97-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1229.024,1256.421,"Well, the argument is made, I think in respect to this singling out and it's made with respect to the rationality under the due process argument that you are not being improperly singled out because as I think you mentioned earlier, because of the finding in the committee report that you in effect had created the expectation that the benefits were going to be lifetime benefits."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1302.121,1309.104,"It is our burden, and I'm going to have to slide back over to the due process side to some extent to answer that question."
1997.97-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1309.104,1310.606,But doesn't it also affect your takings argument?
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1310.606,1311.287,It does.
1997.97-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1321.122,1323.275,"It was not a committee report that made the finding, was it?"
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1323.275,1324.115,--No.
1997.97-42,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1325.246,1326.508,Appointed by the Department of Labor?
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1326.508,1346.54,"Appointed by the Department of Labor though as a technical matter its report was never adopted so far as where we are... by the Secretary of Labor after it was submitted, but that report does not speak specifically to the class of companies of which we are a part, the so called super reach back companies who were in the business directly only up until 1978."
1997.97-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1369.976,1388.798,"If we accept the finding as significant in the decision in this case in judging the nexus, the rationality, however you want to put it under the different headings of your argument, then in fact it is not a fig leaf simply for a finding of unlimited liability."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1402.019,1413.696,"I would suggest, Justice Souter, that the Court is entitled to and ought to look at the facts that underlies that so called expectation finding."
1997.97-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1434.897,1440.812,That's the government's argument in its footnote at page 30 of the brief.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1459.205,1503.504,"--The government says so but there certainly is no finding to that effect and that doesn't make it so, and I would suggest that the Court ought to consider how private contracting, i.e., the employment area or any other area, is going to work, if on the one hand we are entitled as a matter of freedom of contract to participate in bargains and to participate to a limited extent, but at the same time, the government may come along a year later or a generation later or more and say by virtue of your mere participation, you have set up an expectation, and that expectation provides us with a basis, an unlimited basis."
1997.97-42,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1503.504,1514.88,"Well, the government would have us say that this was a consensus in the industry, that this is the duty of the employer because of the fact that wages have been low and benefits have been high."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1517.193,1520.634,"Well, there is no finding with respect to such a consensus."
1997.97-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1529.23,1537.607,"Why did the trustee, I'm sorry, why did the trustee make as I understand it essentially the same statement in what was it 1950?"
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1539.557,1542.79,--That statement needs to be looked at in context.
1997.97-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1553.125,1558.49,"Yes, but, but the terms of his complaint were that basically there had been a promise of lifetime benefits."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1558.49,1566.985,A promise of lifetime benefits which he suggests in his statement that the industry couldn't possibly fulfill.
1997.97-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1568.566,1571.748,Was the trustee authorized to speak for the companies on that point?
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1571.748,1572.699,Absolutely not.
1997.97-42,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1582.124,1616.799,"Well, I would agree with you there but the whole line of questioning I think starts with the assumption that we are going to consider the commission report and your burden, I think if we are going to consider it, your burden is to say that simply is not... that is not a reasonable statement of findings that can be taken into consideration, and I suppose one item of evidence on that would be the fact that somebody, a trustee, who was theoretically neither for you nor for them was saying something very similar to that in 1950."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1618.809,1632.497,"And my response is largely the same, and that is if the statement is looked at in context, I think you will see that it was not made on behalf of the companies and it does not support the weight that the government has attempted to put on it."
1997.97-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1632.497,1660.277,"If the government can come back years later and, say, hold you responsible for having had a small participation in putting out some kind of tailings or toxic waste that people didn't even at the time know was toxic and so forth, why can't they come back years later and say we are going to hold you partly responsible for putting out their millions of miners who spent their working lives in the industry and feel in their old age that somebody has given them an expectation they will be taken care of medically."
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1664.181,1665.322,The difference is causation.
1997.97-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1677.42,1678.92,Had a very small part in it.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1681.241,1687.765,Could have had a very small part of it but causation as a principled matter is fundamental to the operation of that--
1997.97-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1687.765,1694.35,"--So if you caused in part this expectation on behalf of the miners, then would you say it was the same thing?"
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1694.35,1694.831,--No.
1997.97-42,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1706.571,1712.485,You are causing in part their being out there old without medical care.
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1712.485,1719.218,"--Well, the Court in Turner Elkhorn distinguished between specific medical needs and generalized medical needs."
1997.97-42,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1723.422,1748.079,"Would you explain to me once more why a company that's a recent entrant like let's take in this case Ohio Valley Coal, why it's compatible with due process, and I think you said it was, to stick such a company that's a current player, it's a signatory to the most recent contract with liability for people who worked for Eastern from the '40s to the '60s?"
1997.97-42,0,31738,john_t_montgomery,,1760.475,1773.533,Congress has broad latitude to impose obligations on existing members of an industry to bear liability for workers who are currently in the business or formerly in the business.
1997.97-42,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1782.67,1785.933,"Your time just expired, Mr. Montgomery."
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1787.833,1805.785,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the Coal Industry Retirement, Retiree Benefits Act of 1992 rests on two basic determinations made by Congress in that year."
1997.97-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.622,1838.049,Did Congress say why it decided that these people shouldn't simply shift for themselves the way most other people do if they don't have a contractual right?
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1838.049,1842.763,"Well, the determination by Congress at the time, there were two reasons."
1997.97-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1855.429,1859.763,But they were not something that could be enforced in a court?
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1859.763,1872.941,"No, but the Due Process Clause is not limited... Congress' ability under the Due Process Clause is not limited to enforcing existing contractual relationships and as this court's decisions in Concrete Pipe and Connolly have shown."
1997.97-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1872.941,1881.647,"Mr. Kneedler, what was the first time at which miners were actually guaranteed lifetime benefits?"
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1881.647,1895.427,"There is no legal guarantee, but the expectation... there was, there were guarantees during the period of the respective contracts but each of the, each of the contracts was a contract for term, for a term, and it's important to recognize--"
1997.97-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1895.427,1903.381,"Any, in which of those contracts were specific guarantees of lifetime health benefits given?"
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1903.381,1913.66,"--1974 was the first time that the agreement itself contained those... contained those limitations but with respect... excuse me, that guarantee but with respect to the retirees--"
1997.97-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1913.66,1915.74,For the duration of the contract?
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1915.74,1917.531,--That's all it could be.
1997.97-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1920.322,1922.413,Just for the duration of the contract.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1922.413,1923.484,--The contract had a term.
1997.97-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1923.484,1928.668,And what about for the spouses and dependents?
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1932.39,1937.893,"Spouses and dependents of retirees, those benefits were afforded from the beginning."
1997.97-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1945.34,1946.86,Was it ever part of the contract?
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1946.86,1949.991,In 1974 the widows' benefits were again made part of the contract.
1997.97-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1949.991,1950.552,That's what I'm trying to find out.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1954.936,1957.936,In 1974 again was the first time but--
1997.97-42,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1957.936,1968.515,"You said earlier that despite the date you just gave that lifetime benefits had been paid since the 1950s, would you expand on that?"
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1968.515,1969.316,--That's correct.
1997.97-42,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1983.094,1985.555,Beyond the terms of the original contract?
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1985.555,1987.385,"--Well, the contracts, the contracts were renewed."
1997.97-42,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1987.385,1988.737,Basically got rolled over?
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1988.737,1989.428,They got renewed.
1997.97-42,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.428,1995.842,"You are talking about lifetime benefits to people who were lucky enough to die before the company went out of business, right?"
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1995.842,1996.523,Not at all.
1997.97-42,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2022.259,2022.98,Widows?
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2026.904,2027.465,--No.
1997.97-42,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.255,2043.123,--For what year?
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2043.123,2043.934,For some duration.
1997.97-42,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2043.934,2050.51,So the one thing that the term of the contract limited was the term in which contributions are to be made.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2050.51,2051.599,That's correct.
1997.97-42,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2051.599,2061.887,"On expiration, no more contributions unless the contract is renewed but under the plan so long as the plan was funded to the extent it was funded they would continue to draw benefits--"
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2061.887,2062.678,That is correct.
1997.97-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2094.498,2100.702,--But were notices regularly sent saying that these aren't guaranteed and they can be terminated?
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2105.394,2111.749,"They were, they were, they were in the forms but again Justice O'Connor, the question, this is not a contract enforcement question."
1997.97-42,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.235,2120.865,Let's talk about the collective bargaining agreements.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2144.76,2145.582,"But, but--"
1997.97-42,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.582,2151.746,"I mean, this was a sophisticated labor union who adopted that agreement on behalf of their employees."
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2163.053,2164.964,"--Quite the contrary, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2174.52,2176.861,"Well, why did the collective bargaining agreements say that?"
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2189.58,2201.488,"Well, but the expectations involved are not just what comes from the employers' intentions but what expectations were reasonably accrued by virtue of the collective bargaining relationship that the employers entered into."
1997.97-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2201.488,2202.087,I thought--
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2205.23,2208.371,And over the course of the relationship in fact they were renewed.
1997.97-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2226.263,2234.608,"--Mr. Kneedler, with reference to investment backed expectations, I usually thought it was the expectation of the person who is paying the liability."
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2240.723,2244.556,"--Two answers to that, if I may."
1997.97-42,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2314.231,2318.174,May I interrupt you with one question just to be sure I get it in my mind.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2323.246,2324.287,--Yes.
1997.97-42,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.287,2340.248,"That the employee... employers consistently said this is going to be the limit of our liability and our exposure and so forth, but the union representatives consistently told the employees we are going to take care of you, we are going to use enough muscle to be sure that they contribute enough money."
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2346.462,2349.625,I think it would be a sufficient basis on which Congress may act.
1997.97-42,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2349.625,2361.573,"In other words, the unions taking the position they could do it would be enough the employees can rely on that despite the fact, assuming that to be the case, the employers regularly and consistently said this is as much as we are going to do?"
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2361.573,2365.206,"Well, they entered into contracts for a term but what Congress did--"
1997.97-42,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.206,2367.908,And for defined contributions as opposed to benefits.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2367.908,2376.463,--What Congress could look at legitimately was the course of conduct over the history of this industry in which health benefits and retiree health benefits were a critical factor.
1997.97-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2386.92,2394.845,So what you are saying is the reasonable expectations that others have of what claims they have on your property that's controlling?
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2394.845,2395.496,No.
1997.97-42,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2399.93,2413.889,"You are saying, aren't you, that the acts, the unilateral, in answer to Justice Stevens' question, that the unilateral acts of one party to the agreement can create a reasonable expectation when the other party says no."
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2423.224,2426.738,"--Well, if I may, the other party did not say no."
1997.97-42,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2431.85,2432.381,Okay.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2434.053,2445.441,"What they did is, what's significant is that every time there was a contract renewal, the contract was renewed, the contributions paying into the... as you pointed out, the plan is ongoing."
1997.97-42,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2460.551,2465.934,"Mr. Kneedler, may I ask you if you can differentiate the following case from what's going on here."
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2502.697,2509.582,--I think this is very different because this Act only addresses health benefits prospectively from the date of the Act.
1997.97-42,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2537.67,2564.066,"Change Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical a little bit then... so you don't have to pay off all people against whom you..., you were in violation of equal pay but only those people who are now impecunious as a result of your failure to have done that in the past so it has the same future application as this statute."
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2564.867,2566.139,Um--
1997.97-42,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2566.139,2572.186,Those people who would otherwise be on welfare today whom you did not give equal pay 30 years ago.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2572.186,2577.308,--I think under the hypothetical there was no... maybe I misunderstood.
1997.97-42,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2577.308,2577.969,I'm changing it.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2577.969,2578.528,Yes.
1997.97-42,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2579.469,2580.1,Yes.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2592.538,2596.359,"Again, it would depend on the rationality of it."
1997.97-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2680.675,2695.486,"Well, I think, I think clearly it's an area where one might expect Congress to step in as it did with ERISA and provide some multiemployer plans that are specific and provide for funding."
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2705.754,2708.833,"--Well, but, but two things about that."
1997.97-42,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2719.18,2742.128,"You have a different situation probably if the employer and the employment was itself the cause of the miner's disease, than when you were talking about general benefits, for instance, spouses and dependents and general health care needs of people unrelated to their service in the mining industry, isn't that a difference?"
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2742.128,2742.668,No.
1997.97-42,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2765.004,2766.934,It wasn't a guarantee of benefits.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2766.934,2769.445,In the terms that they were--
1997.97-42,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2769.445,2771.238,It was a guarantee of a certain amount of funding.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2771.238,2773.769,--That's true.
1997.97-42,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2782.254,2788.7,What findings do we have by Congress here that there was a guarantee of benefits?
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2789.819,2793.722,--Beginning in 1974 it was expressed in the contract.
1997.97-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2796.514,2800.658,I think Justice Scalia asked did Congress make that finding.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2800.658,2814.035,"--The Act itself doesn't contain the findings but in a due process challenge, the question is whether the facts on which Congress apparently based its action could reasonably be believed to be true."
1997.97-42,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2814.035,2824.083,About a Takings challenge and even if there had been in a Takings case a congressional finding that this property belongs to the United States anyway and we are taking it for that reason.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2826.273,2834.45,Under this Court's Takings jurisprudence there is a vast difference between adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic conduct and--
1997.97-42,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2834.45,2835.559,That's a different issue.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2846.138,2867.071,"--There is some degree of review, but, but, but I think it seems to me hardly irrational for Congress to conclude that over a 50-year course of conduct in an industry of lifetime benefits have in fact been paid that the retirees who worked their entire lives in the mines under such a system in which their fathers and brothers--"
1997.97-42,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2867.071,2872.585,Congress may have concluded that and it would not be unreasonable for Congress to have concluded that if Congress concluded that.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2874.756,2888.396,--The debates leading up to the passage of this Act show careful attention by Congress as to who within the coal industry should bear the burden and Congress concluded that the burden should not be borne by current coal companies--
1997.97-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2888.396,2890.947,Why should it just be the coal company?
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2922.41,2925.011,"--In terms of a current assessment, Congress could certainly do that."
1997.97-42,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2927.693,2934.617,"So you think, you think this case would come out just the same way if the natural gas companies had to pay the liability that we are talking about here?"
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2934.617,2938.04,"--I was responding to the, to current natural gas companies."
1997.97-42,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2979.127,2980.489,I'm carefully tailoring.
1997.97-42,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2988.894,2998.381,"--There is not, but it is not uncommon to have for generally applicable statute to take the company as it finds it with respect to its economic viability."
1997.97-42,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2998.381,2999.931,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1997.97-42,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3001.434,3010.359,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.97-42,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3153.691,3154.492,But excuse me.
1997.97-42,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3168.752,3171.173,"--Your Honor, all I'm saying is--"
1997.97-42,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3171.173,3173.915,That's an irrelevant fact as far as this statute is concerned.
1997.97-42,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3173.915,3175.905,"--Well, I would not agree with that, Your Honor, with all respect."
1997.97-42,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3191.485,3197.47,We look at those aspects of the situation that Congress took into account and made the basis of liability.
1997.97-42,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3204.586,3222.106,"--Well, with respect, Your Honor, I think that this Court has said repeatedly, this Court in reviewing the Constitutionality of legislation may take into account not only what the legislative record may reveal about what Congress actually thought or what some members of Congress actually thought but also what they reasonably could have thought."
1997.97-42,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3227.94,3235.023,"What holding, what holding, what holding do you want us to make if the case comes before us where there is no subsidiary relationship?"
1997.97-42,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3235.023,3236.966,"Well, Your Honor, we think--"
1997.97-42,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3236.966,3239.417,"The Mary Hill mine, I think, was mentioned."
1997.97-42,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3240.978,3254.247,"--Yes, Mary Helen is a case that's pending right now in the Fourth Circuit and the statute has been sustained with respect to Mary Helen by the district court in that case and we think it should be sustained with respect to Mary Helen but that's not the case before this Court."
1997.97-42,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3293.374,3297.845,What is the factual circumstance?
1997.97-42,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3327.365,3333.078,"Your Honor, the most recent statistics as of the beginning of the current fiscal year are as follows."
1997.97-42,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3348.138,3349.9,How many?
1997.97-42,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3349.9,3353.922,"15,469, 20.1 percent."
1997.97-42,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3370.753,3376.328,"Congress could probably afford to take care of them out of general funds, wouldn't you think?"
1997.97-42,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3376.328,3387.484,"--Well, Your Honor, the possibility of alternative funding is not,... I mean, sure, the health care costs for 6,628 people could be paid for, I suspect, out of the Treasury."
1997.97-42,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3396.23,3404.866,"6,628 are assigned to companies like Eastern but that have no subsidiary that was in the business after '78?"
1997.97-42,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3404.866,3405.377,--That's right.
1997.97-42,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3413.243,3415.535,But Eastern had a subsidiary.
1997.97-42,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3415.535,3424.13,"--Eastern had a subsidiary but when the funds list Eastern because of the point that Justice Scalia made, we list Eastern in the pre-'78 group."
1997.97-42,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3424.13,3435.367,"What I'm trying to think of is the practical effect because if you were to win the case on the alternate ground involving the subsidiary whether in fact that would leave a lot of the miners, let's say, out in the cold."
1997.97-42,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3435.367,3442.963,"It would be about 5,000 beneficiaries out of the 76,000 that would still be left that have been assigned to pre-'78 signatories."
1997.97-42,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3442.963,3448.427,"Who are not subsidiaries, or who don't have subsidiaries?"
1997.97-42,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3448.427,3448.997,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-42,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3478.386,3485.673,"Well, Congress actually passed a bill that didn't have this reach back provision in it but it was vetoed, wasn't it?"
1997.97-42,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3485.673,3486.622,Yes.
1997.97-42,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3486.622,3491.046,So then they put in the reach back thing that we are talking about now.
1997.97-42,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3491.046,3493.617,"The bill was a little different, Justice O'Connor, the bill had two features."
1997.97-42,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3607.753,3608.795,"Thank you, Mr. Buscemi."
