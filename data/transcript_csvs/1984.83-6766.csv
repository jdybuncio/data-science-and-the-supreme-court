1984.83-6766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.82,We will hear arguments first this morning in Hayes against Florida.
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,12.141,16.343,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,88.106,88.772,Excuse me.
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,88.772,89.289,"--Yes, sir."
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,89.289,91.641,It's agreed that there was no probable cause?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,91.641,95.843,It was argued by the defense that the state--
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,95.843,98.462,It wasn't agreed to.
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,98.462,100.914,--The court agreed with the petitioner.
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,100.914,101.58,The court did.
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,101.58,102.647,"Yes, sir, Your Honor."
1984.83-6766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,178.747,199.428,"Mr. Raiden, there's some suggestion in either the briefs or somewhere in this record that since they could have taken the fingerprints on his front porch or in his living room, it made no difference that they were taken later in the police station."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,204.814,207.497,"I think that I would be, Your Honor, because--"
1984.83-6766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,207.497,209.199,"There's no difference, in your view."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,209.199,212.218,--Well--
1984.83-6766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,212.218,212.534,There's no difference.
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,221.34,224.692,"--I'd maintain that it is still a search, it is still a seizure."
1984.83-6766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,258.513,264.5,"In other words, they would have had to get a warrant in order to take the first steps."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,264.5,286.765,"I find in Davis v. Mississippi that although the... what happened here, the district court said this is the question left open by Davis, in the opinion of, I believe, Mr. Justice Brennan, that the court could conceive of situations wherein fingerprints might be taken without necessarily having probable cause to do so."
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,321.754,326.558,But aren't those statutes for the most part based on no more than reasonable suspicion?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,326.558,327.474,--That's correct.
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,329.442,332.627,You think there's some problem with those statutes; is that your position?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,332.627,336.829,I think arguably there is a problem.
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,371.502,385.243,Do you think that it is valid within the Terry stop rationale to take a photograph of someone on the street when you make a voluntary stop and use that in evidence?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,385.243,388.278,Well--
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,388.278,392.916,"Does that violate any right of privacy, in your view?"
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,392.916,395.95,"--I'm not sure that I would say it did, Your Honor."
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,396.367,399.569,Why is a fingerprint any different than your face?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,404.389,413.512,--To take a fingerprint requires a little more of the participation of the individual than does submitting to a photograph.
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,422.101,424.303,"Well, I'm talking about a Terry stop."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,436.027,440.729,It's probably more intrusive than a photograph.
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,440.729,447.133,Why is it more intrusive... do you think it's more intrusive than taking a fingerprint?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,447.133,453.739,"I'm not sure that I would agree with that, because you have to place your hands on the person and actually hold the person to take a fingerprint."
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,455.489,458.941,"And you have to place your hands on a person to do a pat-down search, I suppose."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,458.941,459.208,--Yes.
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,484.091,488.46,Have we also held that it's valid to ascertain identity?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,488.46,489.162,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,489.762,495.316,And isn't the taking of fingerprint a form of identification inquiry?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,495.316,507.707,"--When they say in Terry that you may ask identity, I'm not sure the purpose of inquiring into identity is evidentiary in nature."
1984.83-6766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,513.861,520.514,"Well, Place and Royer both certainly involve something more than protection of the officer."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,534.255,546.729,"What I detect in Place and Royer, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is an element of exigency, although I don't find that specific word in the opinions, because of the fact that these people come and go in airports."
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,553.068,562.591,"Well, the decision announced by this Court yesterday in Hensley permitted a Terry-type stop just for identification purposes based on a flyer."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,569.578,578.701,"--As I understood the opinion that you announced yesterday, first of all, there had already been an arrest warrant for the individual; is that correct?"
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,578.701,580.902,That is not correct.
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,580.902,581.785,That is not correct.
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,602.799,618.094,"Well, why, if it's valid to make that kind of a stop to check on identification, would it be invalid to go ahead and print someone at the scene of the Terry-type stop?"
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,618.094,626.081,"I guess it might depend on why you wanted the prints, although I'm not comfortable with saying that now that I've just said it."
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,636.805,646.178,"Of course, in this case the individual was taken to the station, and you don't have the typical Terry-type on the scene stop."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,689.44,697.88,"--They've certainly urged, at least at this level, that reversal would be, as Mr. Justice Stewart said in Davis, a useless gesture."
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,707.235,711.203,"Well, but I think that it's important to explore a bit."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,718.459,735.386,"I'm faced with a record where some things were not done the way I would like to have done them, and one thing that disturbs me about this record is there was no move to suppress the identification by the victim."
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,741.373,750.145,"Well, faced with this record, is there now probable cause to get the... Mr. Hayes' fingerprints?"
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,750.145,764.422,"--If a court... and I submit most properly it should be the trial court... found that Mrs. Hollander's in court identification was constitutionally permissible, then there probably is probable cause now, yes."
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,764.422,772.344,"And if that's the case, what possible use is there in ordering a new trial just to consider the exact same evidence?"
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,772.344,778.498,Because I'm not prepared to state at this point that her identification is constitutionally permissible.
1984.83-6766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,785.568,794.857,"But why should you have a second shot at that issue, just because on a purely unrelated matter there may have been a violation of the Fourth Amendment in taking the fingerprint?"
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,794.857,797.059,"Ordinarily, Your Honor, there may not be."
1984.83-6766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,831.413,833.246,To mean to relitigate Nix against Williams?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,833.246,833.846,"--No, sir."
1984.83-6766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,839.817,842.535,"Well, what possible... what possible flaw could there be in the identification--"
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,842.535,843.554,--I don't--
1984.83-6766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,843.554,849.375,--if in open court she identified him as the attacker?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,849.375,856.294,"--Well, if that's the first time that she's ever seen him, that is arguably a suggestive procedure."
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,874.49,879.56,Was no objection made to her in court identification?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,879.56,882.596,--Here's what happened in that regard.
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1081.407,1092.446,"Well, my trouble is that the purpose of getting fingerprints is singular: it's to identify, right?"
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1092.446,1099.202,"Well, fingerprints are identification-oriented evidence, but the purpose of getting these fingerprints is to find out--"
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1099.202,1101.435,Is it for any other purpose than identification?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1114.811,1117.913,"--That's... under Terry, that's what they're permitted to do."
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1117.913,1122.984,And can you show me some identification; is that okay?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1122.984,1124.967,That is proper under Terry.
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1124.967,1129.221,And he says do you have any copy of your fingerprints?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1132.59,1134.708,You mean a printed copy?
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1134.708,1136.725,A copy.
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1136.725,1140.612,"Well, you always carry a copy with you, if that's what you mean."
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1140.612,1141.629,No.
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1147.782,1149.301,"Well, I suppose he could ask him that."
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1149.767,1152.253,And could he then say let me have it?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1165.644,1169.196,--Under Terry I question whether he could.
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1169.196,1172.215,And what in Terry gives you the right to question?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1172.215,1187.324,"Because, if I can step back about two steps to a question you asked, yes, fingerprints are directed toward identification, but you may want to identify people for more than one reason."
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1211.375,1224.682,"Well, then he can't ask you for your driver's license, because if you're looking for Joe Doaks and your driver's license says Joe Doaks, and you show that driver's license, you're in trouble."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1224.682,1232.955,"I'm not... I'm not sure I agree with that in every case, because it depends on why he wants to know if he's Joe Doaks."
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1232.955,1240.994,"I just don't see the difference in... well, when he gets to the police station, can he identify himself there?"
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1240.994,1243.411,Well--
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1243.411,1245.279,What good does the warrant do?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1245.279,1260.455,"--When you're looking for evidence of a crime, which in this particular case the fingerprints are, in order to conduct a search and a seizure for that evidence, you must have prior judicial authorization unless you have a probable cause of arrest."
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1265.741,1270.744,"Well, why isn't your protest that he was arrested without probable cause?"
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1270.744,1272.846,Excuse me?
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1272.846,1279.75,Why don't you say he was arrested without probable cause when he was carried to the station?
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1279.75,1291.391,"Well, I have argued that under the phraseology of Dunaway that it is tantamount to an arrest, but there was no probable cause."
1984.83-6766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1294.66,1295.962,But you haven't argued it here.
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1298.978,1299.228,"--No, sir."
1984.83-6766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1311.286,1319.123,"But on a Terry stop, could the policeman, if he found a gun, take the gun away from the man?"
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1319.123,1323.276,"--Under a Terry stop, that's part of what Terry's designed to permit."
1984.83-6766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1323.276,1334.734,"And that might well... that might well be evidence, first, of carrying a concealed weapon without a license or, second, if they took some ballistic tests, it might tie him to a murder."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1338.936,1339.636,It's true.
1984.83-6766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1358.267,1366.503,"But he can also detain the person for a brief period at least to question him, ask him some questions."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1366.503,1375.978,I believe the purpose of those questions... this is what I've struggled with.
1984.83-6766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.965,1394.54,"Well, one of the questions that Justice Marshall asked you, whether it could be asked, was who are you and do you have any identification, and you agree that those questions may be asked."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1413.451,1420.257,--I don't know that he could unless... under Florida law we have what's called the loitering and prowling statute.
1984.83-6766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.748,1434.914,"Well, yeah, but he could... but--"
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1434.914,1443.454,"If it doesn't rise to that level, if the person simply refuses to cooperate with the officer, I'm not sure he doesn't have a right to refuse."
1984.83-6766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.454,1463.517,"--And if the officer says do you have... do you have a driver's license, I want to look at your fingerprints, and the fellow says well, I have a driver's license, but you... it's none of your business about looking, and the officer then searches him, not for a gun or anything else but for a driver's license."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1463.517,1465.267,I'm not sure the officer can do that.
1984.83-6766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1465.267,1471.771,"Well, I think I would say you certainly have argued that he could not do that."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1478.693,1480.427,I don't believe he could search him.
1984.83-6766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1518.667,1520.603,May I get back to this case for a moment?
1984.83-6766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1529.292,1531.244,They're at least analytically separate.
1984.83-6766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.244,1539.665,"In your view, which is the greater invasion, the more serious intrusion on the person that's under arrest?"
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1539.665,1545.319,--I would say the fingerprinting... I'm... I'd say the transportation to the station is more serious.
1984.83-6766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1556.36,1557.894,Very well.
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1557.894,1559.244,"I have just one I'd like to ask, if I may."
1984.83-6766,0,36588,michael_e_raiden,,1568.084,1570.517,"I've looked and looked, and I can't find it."
1984.83-6766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1570.517,1571.286,Thank you.
1984.83-6766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1571.286,1577.44,Mr. Munsey.
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1577.44,1582.392,"May it please the Court, and Mr. Chief Justice:"
1984.83-6766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1610.511,1613.463,"Well, wasn't... they took his prints at the station, didn't they?"
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1613.463,1614.046,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-6766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1614.046,1615.163,And didn't they match?
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1615.163,1616.231,"Yes, they did."
1984.83-6766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.231,1617.148,"Well, did--"
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1617.148,1617.665,We had--
1984.83-6766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1617.665,1618.85,--Did they release him then?
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1618.85,1619.483,--No.
1984.83-6766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.367,1621.219,"Well, what's that I said."
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1624.754,1627.004,Well--
1984.83-6766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1627.004,1631.59,He was detained for quite a while.
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1632.79,1633.526,--He was--
1984.83-6766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1633.526,1634.959,"Well, if he wasn't arrested--"
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1634.959,1644.215,"--Up until... up until he was formally arrested, he had been detained for 30 minutes, and it was--"
1984.83-6766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.215,1645.517,"--That's the answer to the question, isn't it?"
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1645.517,1647.184,--Yes.
1984.83-6766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1647.184,1656.808,"Well, if he wasn't legally arrested, arrested as a matter of law when they took him away from his home, he certainly was arrested as soon as they took the fingerprints."
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1656.808,1663.562,"As soon as Officer Cardell of the Sheriff's Department made that match, then he was what I would call formally arrested."
1984.83-6766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1834.44,1835.123,Mr. Munsey--
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1835.123,1835.707,--Excuse me.
1984.83-6766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1835.707,1837.475,--May I back up just a moment?
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1837.475,1838.409,"Yes, sir--"
1984.83-6766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1838.409,1844.029,You said that in some prior case he was arrested and null prossed.
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1844.029,1844.879,--No.
1984.83-6766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1860.408,1866.312,"Well, I'm talking about the one that he wasn't tried on, the one he was null prossed on."
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1866.312,1866.829,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-6766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1866.829,1869.681,Was he arrested in that one?
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1869.681,1875.75,I would presume that he was for the state to go ahead and null prosse--
1984.83-6766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1875.75,1878.452,"Well, how in the world is it that they didn't have his fingerprints?"
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1878.452,1894.046,"--The rape of Velora Davis was April 27th, of Helen Smith was May 18th, and of Julienne Hollander was May 13th."
1984.83-6766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1908.406,1913.542,I just can't how you can null prosse a case when a man is not arrested.
1984.83-6766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1913.542,1923.481,Were these second charges brought after his fingerprinting in the case now before us?
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,1923.481,1925.831,--That is what I presume from the record.
1984.83-6766,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2038.939,2043.324,"Mr. Munsey, may I ask what the point of all this discussion of the evidence is?"
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2043.324,2043.941,--Well--
1984.83-6766,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2043.941,2048.545,What... what relevance does that have to the point that you want to make?
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2048.545,2048.962,--Okay.
1984.83-6766,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2059.936,2063.554,The C.I. being a confidential informant?
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2063.554,2063.754,Confidential informant.
1984.83-6766,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2111.535,2112.669,"Well, what is the point of this?"
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2115.921,2116.689,--Okay.
1984.83-6766,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2126.144,2133.282,"--Well, you're trying to argue here that the court below was wrong in saying there was no probable cause, is that it?"
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2133.282,2134.65,"I... yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-6766,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2135.317,2141.221,And you want us to reweigh the evidence and disagree with the court below and find there's probable cause?
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2142.673,2155.147,"--Well, what I... I don't want you to substitute the judgment of the Second District, but I am saying that the Second District applied an incorrect constitutional standard to probable cause, as this Court has announced in--"
1984.83-6766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2160.099,2167.621,"--Well, then you're saying that this Court is not bound by the state court's determination on this issue because it's a federal issue?"
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2167.621,2168.304,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-6766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2168.304,2175.977,And that you argue here that there was probable cause for the arrest.
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2175.977,2177.16,"I do, Your Honor."
1984.83-6766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2178.096,2184.916,"Well, you are going to get to whether... to the question of whether you can take fingerprints on reasonable suspicion."
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2184.916,2185.433,Yes.
1984.83-6766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.1,2186.75,Soon.
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2186.75,2187.452,Yes.
1984.83-6766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.704,2247.656,"Mr.... General Munsey, may I just ask this one question--"
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2247.656,2248.239,Sure--
1984.83-6766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2248.239,2249.339,--on your probable cause argument.
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2258.945,2259.88,"--Correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-6766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2259.88,2261.964,It partly relies on the trial transcript.
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2261.964,2262.797,Correct.
1984.83-6766,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2342.416,2348.82,Is there any reason why prints couldn't be taken at the scene or at a suspect's home?
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2348.82,2353.807,--Only the economics of the Punta Gorda police department.
1984.83-6766,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2357.092,2360.478,"Well, what's involved... just an ink pad and a piece of paper?"
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2360.478,2370.733,"That might be all that is involved, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-6766,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2378.089,2382.307,Didn't you just roll your finger on an ink pad and put it on a piece of paper?
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2382.307,2385.342,"--It was a big... it was a stable thing, but I imagine that is all that... correct."
1984.83-6766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2387.259,2394.698,May I ask you the same question I asked your adversary?
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2403.47,2414.342,The greater intrusion would be the transportation.
1984.83-6766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.175,2465.044,But maybe you could invite the officer into the living room.
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2465.044,2470.013,"And if... if they weren't invited, we do have problems."
1984.83-6766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2470.013,2470.679,Right.
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2480.387,2490.592,"Well, it's both a seizure and a fingerprint case, Your Honor."
1984.83-6766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2490.592,2508.804,"Your argument here is that this would have been inevitably discovered in any event under the Nix case, and therefore we're spinning our wheels up here, is that right?"
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2508.804,2509.74,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-6766,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2539.925,2552.483,"Well, quite apart from inevitable discovery, is it arguable that no new trial is required simply to present the same evidence all over again?"
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2552.483,2556.471,"I don't believe that a retrial is necessary, Your Honor."
1984.83-6766,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2575.615,2586.823,"Well, it could also conclude, could it not, that for reasons stated by the Florida district court of appeal, this fingerprinting was proper under a Terry standard."
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2586.823,2587.956,"That's true, Your Honor."
1984.83-6766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2589.639,2593.008,I'm a little puzzled about the argument.
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2605.149,2613.587,"Well, her identification certainly antedates the fingerprinting, the arrest."
1984.83-6766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.379,2629.449,But... but you're relying on... on the pre... the pre-fingerprinting identification--
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2629.449,2629.966,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-6766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2629.966,2630.983,--rather than what she said at trial?
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2630.983,2633.918,"Well, that's where her identification came from."
1984.83-6766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2639.805,2640.505,But how--
1984.83-6766,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2640.505,2647.161,--Wasn't her in court identification based on her view of the defendant at the scene of the rape?
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2647.161,2647.795,Yes.
1984.83-6766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2647.795,2652.446,But how do we know he would have even gotten to court if there hadn't been the fingerprinting?
1984.83-6766,1,45504,william_i_munsey_jr,,2658.533,2662.151,That is the only place that she viewed him.
1984.83-6766,2,36588,michael_e_raiden,,2683.898,2692.587,I hope I have time to make--
1984.83-6766,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2692.587,2693.304,Anything further?
1984.83-6766,2,36588,michael_e_raiden,,2693.304,2695.889,--I have just one or two points in response.
1984.83-6766,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2695.889,2696.322,Very well.
1984.83-6766,2,36588,michael_e_raiden,,2696.322,2696.991,I hope I have time.
1984.83-6766,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2696.991,2698.008,You have four minutes remaining.
1984.83-6766,2,36588,michael_e_raiden,,2698.008,2699.691,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.83-6766,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2741.77,2744.52,Was the null prossing after this case?
1984.83-6766,2,36588,michael_e_raiden,,2744.52,2746.722,--After this case was tried and convicted.
1984.83-6766,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2746.722,2748.59,"Well, what in the world that's got to do with this case?"
1984.83-6766,2,36588,michael_e_raiden,,2748.59,2749.307,Excuse me?
1984.83-6766,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2749.307,2752.042,What in the world does that have to do with this case?
1984.83-6766,2,36588,michael_e_raiden,,2752.042,2753.192,The--
1984.83-6766,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2753.192,2760.315,The argument that the Government made was that they had probable cause to think it was him because he had been null processed.
1984.83-6766,2,36588,michael_e_raiden,,2760.315,2762.683,--That's not my understanding of what happened.
1984.83-6766,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2762.683,2782.228,"I understood the Government's argument to be that these other asserted attacks were known to the police at the time they went to his house, and that that furnished an additional basis for a probable cause arrest at that time."
1984.83-6766,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2782.228,2784.013,But that's not what he said.
1984.83-6766,2,36588,michael_e_raiden,,2784.013,2786.549,I don't think that's what he said either.
1984.83-6766,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2787.632,2789.501,"Well, that's the way I understood his argument."
1984.83-6766,2,36588,michael_e_raiden,,2793.469,2795.821,--I'm not sure there is any point in talking about them.
1984.83-6766,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2801.475,2810.83,"Well, I thought the point was that three different people had versions of what he looked like, and together they were able to arrange a composite drawing that gave them their probable cause."
1984.83-6766,2,36588,michael_e_raiden,,2810.83,2812.364,That leads to my last point.
1984.83-6766,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2901.34,2917.184,"But if your friend is right on his theory that there was probable cause at the time they went to the man's home, then the inevitable discovery claim evaporates from the case, is that not right?"
1984.83-6766,2,36588,michael_e_raiden,,2917.184,2917.917,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-6766,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2920.986,2921.869,"Thank you, gentlemen."
