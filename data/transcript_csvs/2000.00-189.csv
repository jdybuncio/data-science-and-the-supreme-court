2000.00-189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.42,"We'll hear argument now in No. 00-189, Idaho versus the United States."
2000.00-189,0,42104,steven_w_strack,,9.456,12.141,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.00-189,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,38.541,48.247,Would you mind if I just get a little background that helps me understand better the practical issues involved here.
2000.00-189,0,42104,steven_w_strack,,58.52,62.073,Actually the acreage would be more like one-fourth of the lake.
2000.00-189,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,62.073,63.273,About one-fourth.
2000.00-189,0,42104,steven_w_strack,,63.273,63.673,Yes.
2000.00-189,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,63.673,65.792,In the southern part of the lake?
2000.00-189,0,42104,steven_w_strack,,65.792,73.362,This is the southern part of Lake Coeur d'Alene and we're also talking about the lower 15 or 20 miles of the St. Joe River.
2000.00-189,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,73.362,80.618,And what are the practical consequences of a finding one way or the other?
2000.00-189,0,42104,steven_w_strack,,87.956,95.562,"Well, I think it makes a very large difference from the state's viewpoint, Justice O'Connor, because this is a public highway."
2000.00-189,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,98.43,99.214,"Well, just tell me what's involved."
2000.00-189,0,42104,steven_w_strack,,108.369,128.598,"We care because the majority of the users on the Lake are not Indians and because of that we have a significant interest in protecting their safety, for example, citing people who are boarding in an unsafe manner or if citing someone who doesn't have the requisite amount of life vests on board for small children."
2000.00-189,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,131.718,144.293,"I'll pursue Justice O'Connor's question, why can't the State, why can't the tribe have the patrol boat just like a tribe has a patrol car on the road?"
2000.00-189,0,42104,steven_w_strack,,144.293,154.166,--Because this is a public highway and the court has been very clear that on a public highway tribes usually do not have general sovereign authority over non-Indians.
2000.00-189,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,161.504,166.724,"Well, then, why can't the state's boat go into the southern part of the lake?"
2000.00-189,0,42104,steven_w_strack,,166.724,174.164,Because the tribe has basically precluded us from that and I believe the Court's decree precludes us from doing that also.
2000.00-189,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,174.164,188.237,You can't work... all this is about is whether or not the State wants to have a policeman in a boat cite somebody for not wearing a life vest and the tribe just won't agree to figuring out some method so that people boat safely?
2000.00-189,0,42104,steven_w_strack,,193.308,196.593,"Justice Breyer, I think there's a lot more at stake than simply that."
2000.00-189,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,196.593,198.112,I'm not saying in principle.
2000.00-189,0,42104,steven_w_strack,,212.622,218.007,"I think there's many practical applications, Justice Breyer, as we spoke about in our brief."
2000.00-189,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,218.007,219.543,"Well, name one."
2000.00-189,0,42104,steven_w_strack,,234.218,245.593,"Oh, for example, we have an in-stream flow, a statutory in-stream flow that protects the lake level and that's certainly broadened the question by this concept of tribal ownership of at least a portion of the lake."
2000.00-189,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,246.493,251.764,"Mr. Strack, may I ask that you raise the podium a bit because I'm having difficulty hearing."
2000.00-189,0,42104,steven_w_strack,,254.799,266.607,"--Another practical aspect would be, for example, our statute that prevents dredging on this portion of the river."
2000.00-189,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,293.091,304.63,"Well, does the Federal Government in its capacity as a trustee, if you will, have any role in how the lake is managed or used if it belongs to the tribe?"
2000.00-189,0,42104,steven_w_strack,,304.63,308.517,--Justice O'Connor I haven't seen any evidence of that to date.
2000.00-189,1,39387,raymond_c_givens,,1546.533,1556.774,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court:"
2000.00-189,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2177.911,2179.311,"Yes, we did."
2000.00-189,3,42104,steven_w_strack,,3309.172,3332.787,"On this question of whether or not there's a difference between beds and navigable waters, I think the court has made that very clear in the Alaska decision where the court looked to purposes that required ownership of the beds themselves; for example, the need to own the bed to preserve the oil deposits."
