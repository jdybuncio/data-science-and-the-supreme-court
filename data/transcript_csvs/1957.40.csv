1957.40,0,39633,robert_e_knowlton,,28.476,31.399,May it please the Court.
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1325.187,1329.9,Mr. Chief Justice if the Court please.
1957.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1503.937,1511.793,Does the record show why there was an -- an indictment or the robbery of this fourth man at the time that they happened?
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1511.793,1513.738,"No it does not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1957.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1513.738,1516.929,Is there any explanation of it?
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1516.929,1520.476,I can -- I can offer an explanation off the record.
1957.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1520.476,1523.627,"Yes, what -- I am --"
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1523.627,1527.075,"Mr. Yager lives in Monmouth County, New Jersey."
1957.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1550.829,1554.822,-- (Voice Overlap) needed him for an indictment?
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1554.822,1555.333,No.
1957.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1561.048,1561.885,All right.
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1561.885,1564.648,"He was available, of course, at the first trial."
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1584.304,1586.524,May I ask you a question about that?
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1604.622,1621.12,"Mr. Justice Black, I -- I think that it is possible that the -- that the jury could have found the defendant innocent of the crime of robbing the other three and found him guilty of the crime of robbing Yager."
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1621.196,1624.972,Do you mean the jury could have found that or was there any basis for it?
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1624.972,1625.363,They --
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1625.363,1626.511,-- (Voice Overlap) what was the basis?
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1626.511,1643.377,"The only contested issue at the first trial, as has been stated by my adversary, was whether Elmer -- whether Hoag was present and a participant."
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1702.418,1720.953,"But whatever they decided on was, were the circumstances -- did it all happen as a part of one kind of this action simultaneously were practically simultaneously insofar as (Inaudible) were concerned in connection with the robbery of the four individuals?"
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1720.953,1726.162,The robbery has occurred within a short period of time.
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1814.638,1819.884,"Was with all that's part of one single transaction that came in, committed a robbery."
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1819.884,1819.976,The --
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1819.976,1821.928,"Are the people in there, is that right?"
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1821.928,1829.416,The evidence indicated that there were at least three men who entered the tavern.
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1848.418,1849.962,Was Yager forced to go up against the wall?
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1849.962,1851.342,That's right.
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1856.196,1857.499,Was Yager taken with them?
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1857.499,1858.554,Yes.
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1860.192,1860.363,Yager --
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1860.363,1860.881,-- (Voice Overlap)
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1860.881,1861.602,-- Yager was tied.
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1861.602,1863.894,Yes.
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1863.894,1872.865,"So that the facts (Inaudible) the robbery was concerned, it was all a part of one single robbery so to speak?"
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1872.865,1873.937,Yes.
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1873.937,1876.15,Of three -- of four different persons?
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1876.15,1876.407,Yes.
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1901.652,1907.649,And what you say is that -- that they're conceding that that's the fact.
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1920.713,1924.514,"I don't necessarily say that, Mr. Justice Black."
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1925.658,1926.373,"Well, two -- two --"
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1926.373,1927.176,Which would -- which --
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1927.176,1932.29,-- different robberies of two different people?
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1932.29,1942.877,"We say that under the -- under these facts, where there was a trial for the robbery of -- of the three men, the State offered proof of the elements of robbery."
1957.40,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1972.998,1989.478,"Well if your -- if your theory is right, would there be any legal distinction between trying him twice as was done here and trying him four times for -- on for the robbery of each one of them individually?"
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,1989.478,1997.689,The only possible legal distinction would be whether -- the four successive trials are not into harassment.
1957.40,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2004.493,2009.774,But you -- there are no other -- other difference that you know of?
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,2009.774,2011.193,"No, sir."
1957.40,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2011.193,2017.897,What is -- what do you mean on the Federal Constitution of harrassment?
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,2017.897,2038.85,"Well as I understand, Mr. Justice Douglas, in -- in the Palko case for example, Mr. Justice Cardozo was very careful to point out that there was no showing, that this -- that the defendant Palko had been carelessly subjected to a retrial."
1957.40,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2072.11,2078.012,Two -- two would be enough for harrassment if the last (Inaudible)
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,2078.012,2089.579,"We would -- we would urge here that -- two does not amount to harassment, that harassment would have to be presented in another record."
1957.40,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2107.815,2110.486,Do you think he (Inaudible)
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,2110.486,2110.616,Yes.
1957.40,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2110.616,2111.509,-- it's possible.
1957.40,1,20833,david_d_furman,,2111.509,2115.469,Yes.
1957.40,2,39633,robert_e_knowlton,,3245.441,3259.065,"I'd like to point out to the Court that although accounts for the State mentioned the number of times separate issue, there was admittedly only one issue in the first trial and in the second trial as well."
1957.40,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3275.806,3277.577,(Voice Overlap) present here?
1957.40,2,39633,robert_e_knowlton,,3277.577,3285.438,There is no doubt that these four -- the four victims named in indictment were all robbed by the same three robbers.
1957.40,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3431.358,3459.787,"Mr. Knowlton, would you agree that Palko decided that -- that double jeopardy as a technical -- by technical I don't mean invidiously -- it was an invidious admiralty that the -- whatever content double jeopardy may have these constitutional provisions containing it is not as such absorbed by the Fourteenth -- by the Due Process Clause."
1957.40,2,39633,robert_e_knowlton,,3463.344,3464.261,"Yes sir, I think that --"
1957.40,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3464.261,3465.541,Very well.
1957.40,2,39633,robert_e_knowlton,,3477.34,3478.979,That is -- that is correct sir.
1957.40,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3478.979,3482.799,Therefore that we are entirely on the -- on the different terrain.
1957.40,2,39633,robert_e_knowlton,,3482.799,3483.519,Yes sir.
1957.40,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3484.165,3501.047,"And call these differences in opinion which has been revealed in -- in this Court, (Inaudible) that clause came under review or -- or not to Government, your problem, or this problem, or my problem."
1957.40,2,39633,robert_e_knowlton,,3501.047,3501.97,"That is correct, sir."
1957.40,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3515.214,3526.161,"Now, have you any observations to make on the bearing of the rejected doctrine of inconsistency and verdict upon our problem here?"
1957.40,2,39633,robert_e_knowlton,,3526.161,3543.939,I believe that that problem is distinguishable because in that situation you have one jury with the possibility of a conviction on -- on two counts or on two indictments joined for one trial.
1957.40,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3567.332,3585.038,"But you remember in the Dunn case, Mr. Justice Holmes said that if there had been two separate indictments, separate trials for the maintenance of (Inaudible) the sale of illegal liquor and another one for the sale or the possession of illegal liquor."
1957.40,2,39633,robert_e_knowlton,,3596.241,3607.422,I think that he is applying here -- I -- I think that the -- the same evidence we have.
1957.40,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3621.12,3630.495,That presupposes that the issue here was the identification or the -- or the killing or the attack to San Diego.
1957.40,2,39633,robert_e_knowlton,,3640.794,3670.689,"But the only -- since all four were robbed by the same robbers and since Yager's testimony was the only identification, the first verdict is inconsistent with the second verdict since that was the only issue and either trial was Mr. Hoag one of the three robbers."
1957.40,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3670.689,3681.556,"And Dunn says that, “We can't go into that for the reason -- the only extensive reasoning is the quotation that Justice Holmes made of Judge Henderson.”"
1957.40,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3717.896,3720.858,"Well, that's the one before you."
1957.40,2,39633,robert_e_knowlton,,3720.858,3733.625,Well I -- I thought that we had determined that the crucial question was the -- the fact of the issue having then the identification.
1957.40,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3738.18,3748.174,I'm suggesting that Yager is not the -- one of the defined people as to whom the crime or crimes were charged.
1957.40,2,39633,robert_e_knowlton,,3782.004,3785.322,Well I -- I think that in that point we choose to disagree.
1957.40,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3870.887,3873.714,But it doesn't -- it doesn't if you follow.
1957.40,2,39633,robert_e_knowlton,,3889.09,3917.805,"Well I think -- I think that is true and I think that this is -- that in -- in some, and I think that is true that because they can do it the second time does not necessarily mean that this Court couldn't say that a third time would be harassment but I -- I myself, if I know logical distinction between one and two and they did do -- it had two trials for petitioner Hoag."
1957.40,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3917.805,3930.711,"Mr. Knowlton, the Court appreciates your acceptance in this assignment to represent this indigent prisoner, and we feel that you've done it with great diligence."
1957.40,3,20833,david_d_furman,,3947.541,3950.372,Thank you.
1957.40,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3950.372,3955.297,Very well.
