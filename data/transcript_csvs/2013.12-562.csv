2013.12-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.546,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-562, United States v. Woods."
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,6.919,9.872,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-562,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,80.219,80.499,Excuse me.
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,102.226,104.551,There are two separate questions here.
2013.12-562,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,141.897,146.318,That is the incongruity of your position in my mind.
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,175.633,191.282,"Let me explain, as best I can, the sequence of events that we think would unfold if this Court affirmed our view of the -- both held that the courts below had jurisdiction and agreed with our view of the way the penalty is supposed to operate."
2013.12-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,377.646,383.674,"Mr. Stewart, can you explain the difference in the two proceedings?"
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,414.645,430.578,"--When we say that the applicability of the penalty should be determined in the partnership level proceeding, all we mean is that the court in the partnership level proceeding should resolve the legal issue that is addressed in Part 2 of the respective briefs for the Petitioner and the Respondent."
2013.12-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,486.805,507.141,"I was just going to ask: If the question were determined of whether the sham transaction counts as an erroneous statement of the basis, if that were determined at the partner level and not in a partnership proceeding, would it be possible to have different outcomes--"
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,507.141,508.546,"Yes, absolutely."
2013.12-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,508.546,509.889,--with respect to different partners?
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,509.889,510.796,Absolutely.
2013.12-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,521.387,523.401,And -- and you have to relitigate the same issue.
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,523.401,524.307,--Exactly.
2013.12-562,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,564.245,571.91,Would it be a fair way to look at this to say that what you do at the partnership level is anything that doesn't require looking at an individual's tax return?
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,571.91,574.425,I think that's a fair way to put it.
2013.12-562,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,650.113,656.641,Is it correct that your position would allow the IRS to evade the normal statute of limitations?
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,656.641,658.969,I don't see--
2013.12-562,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,658.969,659.187,Or deficiency?
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,659.812,660.812,--I don't see how.
2013.12-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,701.108,711.964,"Using the language of the statute that you just quoted, can you explain to us what is the adjustment of the partnership item?"
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,727.77,728.129,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,799.256,813.47,"What Judge Sentelle said in his opinion for the D.C. Circuit is that based -- agreeing with everything you've said, that means that the misstatement of basis might be obvious on an individual partner's returns."
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,822.076,828.416,"Now, we would agree with Judge Sentelle that outside basis, in and of itself, is not a partnership item."
2013.12-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,849.548,850.236,Excuse me.
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,852.564,860.592,"--I mean, in the -- in the more typical case the outside basis would depend upon the amount that a particular partner had paid for his own partnership interest."
2013.12-562,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,905.588,910.93,"Well, isn't it your position in this case that outside basis in this case is necessarily related to inside basis?"
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,910.93,911.382,I think -- I think--
2013.12-562,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,911.382,913.975,Or am I misstating that.
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,913.975,930.75,"--I think what we are saying is in order to determine whether the substantial valuation misstatement penalty would be triggered down the road, the IRS and the Court would have to make certain -- would have to decide what is the proper outside basis in a sham partnership."
2013.12-562,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,954.755,967.421,"But -- but if we were to write an opinion which says -- an opinion ruling in your favor, that in this case outside basis is necessarily related to inside basis in this transaction, you would say that's wrong?"
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,967.421,970.076,I wouldn't -- I wouldn't put it that way.
2013.12-562,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,971.138,972.872,Why -- and why is that?
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,972.872,989.07,"--Because I think that's not really the reason we're saying the Court needs to -- I pointed the Court to a different case in which outside basis had to be determined at the partnership level for a different reason; namely, because it was a -- in that case, it was a component of inside basis."
2013.12-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1017.2,1017.934,Mr. Stewart--
2013.12-562,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1017.934,1018.512,Mr. Stewart--
2013.12-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1018.512,1052.481,"--If we -- if we go over to the merits, if this case came up today and today we have a penalty that wasn't there originally and that is for a non -- noneconomic substance penalty, would -- would the government today be going under that noneconomic substance penalty or would it be going under the 6626(d)(3), that is the substantial valuation misstatement?"
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1054.527,1055.886,I think it's the government's option.
2013.12-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1071.051,1079.299,"If the government could choose either one, what would determine its choice?"
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1079.299,1087.046,"I mean, in some instances, the government will -- the government will pick the one that it thinks is easiest to prove."
2013.12-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1273.049,1276.923,"Mr. Stewart, if I could focus at a somewhat higher level of abstraction."
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1318.156,1329.324,--I guess the two things that -- or at least two things I would say in response to that are that here the whole point of the avoidance scheme was to create an artificially inflated basis.
2013.12-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1372.041,1372.666,I understand that.
2013.12-562,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1393.5,1400.311,"I guess the -- the other couple of points I would make are, there's nothing illegal about engaging in a transaction that lacks economic substance."
2013.12-562,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1510.188,1514.091,"--Mr. Stewart, what -- what is this case a fight about?"
2013.12-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1521.997,1523.792,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1529.587,1532.601,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-562,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1560.715,1565.587,"Mr. Garre, it seems as though you and the Government agree on sort of the nature of this problem, right?"
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1609.227,1612.834,"--Well, I think the Government is asking the Court to add a great deal more than that."
2013.12-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1693.848,1696.862,But it doesn't just say partnership items.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1719.884,1721.758,"You're right, Justice Scalia, and--"
2013.12-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1721.758,1727.74,What -- what can that possibly mean when you're talking about the applicability of any penalty?
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1727.74,1729.334,"--Well, let me tell you, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1729.334,1732.613,That penalty is going to be applicable at the partner stage.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1732.613,1743.203,"Justice Scalia, let me answer it this way: Partnerships can do many things, just like individuals and corporations, and they can engage in things that subject -- that trigger penalties."
2013.12-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1776.626,1783.983,"Well, are there cases in which the partnership is liable for a penalty?"
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1783.983,1786.747,"--Ultimately, Your Honor, the partner--"
2013.12-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1786.747,1788.23,"I mean, I understand it's all passed through and so forth."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1816.487,1822.937,"--Your Honor, the partners don't actually -- the partnership does not pay the penalty, but the partner -- the partnership--"
2013.12-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1822.937,1826.965,Would there be any penalty against the partners in that instance that I put?
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1826.965,1827.933,"--No, I don't believe so."
2013.12-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1828.871,1836.416,Would there be criminal liability for filing a false information return?
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1836.416,1839.775,"--I mean, ultimately I think that would trickle down to the partners."
2013.12-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1846.942,1857.735,"But then -- then that -- that just fortifies the point that Justice Scalia made, that the applicability of the penalty, it's -- it's always going to relate to the partners."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1857.735,1860.203,"Yes and no, Your Honor."
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1885.817,1886.255,So what?
2013.12-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.255,1886.864,So what?
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1886.864,1887.583,So what?
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1942.795,1945.356,--At the partnership level--
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1945.356,1945.763,Yes.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1945.763,1947.06,--because you're talking about--
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1947.06,1947.716,At the -- I'm correct.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1947.716,1949.246,"--inside basis, not outside basis, correct."
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1967.066,1949.246,Okay.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2009.892,2010.001,"Your Honor, I think--"
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2010.001,2018.296,"--the use of this partnership by you, the partner, to reduce your taxes."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2018.296,2018.67,--And--
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2018.67,2022.122,"Now, to the extent you don't use it, of course, you don't have to pay anything."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2028.932,2034.381,--What the court in doing -- what the court is doing in both of those situations is fundamentally different.
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2072.428,2086.377,"So then the question is -- the question is, do the words “ partnership item ” in the section “ scope of judicial review ” refer only to those items that the partnership in fact is concerned with?"
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2089.954,2090.485,Right.
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2091.157,2091.829,That's the issue.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2092.36,2094.14,--And the three circuit courts that have addressed that have agreed with us.
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2095.297,2102.715,"We're interpreting the word “ partnership items ” in that statute, and you are saying the partnership itself is not a partnership item."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2102.715,2104.012,"--No, not at all, Your Honor."
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2104.012,2104.527,What?
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2104.855,2107.589,What we're saying is outside basis is not a partnership item.
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2107.589,2107.774,"Oh, no, no."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2120.176,2126.127,"Your Honor, I think that the confusion maybe is between the statement at issue here."
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2148.041,2151.195,"--I understand how someone could be confused, and I am genuinely confused."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2152.381,2153.038,"--Right, and--"
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2153.038,2163.066,And the reason I'm confused is this: That I -- I understand your difference between the outside basis and the inside basis.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2172.967,2175.967,"--Well, it matters in the scope of jurisdiction, Your Honor."
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2176.826,2178.357,"No, I understand that, too."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2192.819,2195.91,--The words that matter is “ partnership item ”.
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2200.878,2201.393,Okay.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2213.857,2217.637,"The partnership item, Your Honor, can include the partnership."
2013.12-562,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2228.867,2233.646,"And in that sense, Mr. Garre, it strikes me as wrong to say the words in dispute are “ partnership item ”."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2255.903,2256.622,--Right.
2013.12-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.277,2296.964,But it is in addition to partnership item.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2316.925,2317.424,Right.
2013.12-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.424,2319.799,It's in addition to partnership items.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2319.799,2320.594,Now--
2013.12-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2320.594,2329.654,"And -- and it's, it seems to me, not enough to say, well, if you interpret that third part to go beyond partnership items, you're destroying the statute."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2330.467,2341.134,"--Our point is the one that the D.C. Circuit and the other circuits have adopted, which is that to make this determination you have to go beyond the partnership item; you have to determine a non-partnership item, and this grant of jurisdiction--"
2013.12-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2341.134,2347.147,"When would you not have to do that if you are applying the third item,"
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2351.349,2352.409,--Again--
2013.12-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2352.409,2355.128,That will always require you to go down to the partner level.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2355.128,2355.471,--No.
2013.12-562,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2371.793,2382.273,"Mr. Garre, suppose the government had asserted this penalty under sub (6), or the transaction lacking economic substance."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2396.111,2397.173,"We would, Your Honor."
2013.12-562,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2471.081,2472.206,But let me ask you something.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2493.978,2495.165,--Well--
2013.12-562,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2495.165,2507.442,"I mean, it's sort of obvious, just as it's obvious that if a partnership item has a miscalculation that the partner is going to include it in their tax return later."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2519.936,2530.853,"--And then I think what you would be doing is assuming a fact necessary to the penalty, that outside basis was reported as zero, for purposes of finding jurisdiction, and we don't think the court could do that."
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2550.768,2551.533,Try with me again.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2608.322,2609.838,In the individual return?
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2609.838,2610.743,"Yes, yes, in individual gift tax return."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2614.992,2615.772,"You do, but the partner--"
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2615.772,2621.286,"So it affects the taxpayer differently, and I'm just saying, why does it matter?"
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2621.286,2621.864,--Every--
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2621.864,2628.658,--that the way this affects the taxpayer is through what you call his outside basis.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2630.236,2634.984,"--Well, Your Honor, every partner's outside basis is going to vary in the typical situation."
2013.12-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2634.984,2635.656,"Well, yes, yes."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2661.035,2666.814,"And the fact that it can vary, Your Honor, is one of the reasons why Congress wanted these determinations made at the partner level."
2013.12-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2693.991,2707.751,"Couldn't the Government have pursued this instead of saying, you know, it's a sham partnership, just -- just -- couldn't the Government simply have said that the partnership overstated its basis?"
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2707.751,2722.65,"--It couldn't, because -- and it didn't, because again, if you go back to page 186 -- 169 of the Joint Appendix, everything about these transactions is accurately reported on that form which is in the partnership return."
2013.12-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.347,2745.844,"Now, I have a second question which I asked your friend as well."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2758.637,2759.762,No.
2013.12-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.611,2788.875,"Well, but why -- why wouldn't -- couldn't one court say I don't think it's a sham partnership?"
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2788.875,2796.403,"--Well, that determination, Your Honor, is being made at the partnership level, and we agree that it can be made at that level, and that determination applies to all the partners."
2013.12-562,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2811.146,2812.879,But I think that--
2013.12-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2812.879,2824.484,You say that -- you say that that's not true because individual partners may respond differently to the partnership determination with respect to basis.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2824.484,2825.124,Yes.
2013.12-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2825.124,2833.934,"Some of them are going to put in something else, but somebody may put in zero for a number of the reasons that the IRS's counsel suggested."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2833.934,2834.684,Yes.
2013.12-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2834.684,2837.199,"And now, I suspect that those will be only in rare circumstances."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2849.396,2850.474,Exactly.
2013.12-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2850.474,2858.97,"And I think what I understand your friend to be saying is it's not just that it's obvious, but it's ineluctable, and therefore, it doesn't depend on the outside partnership determinations."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2874.964,2878.478,"I -- I think largely, yes, but if I can explain that."
2013.12-562,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2918.136,2923.836,"Could you give me a concrete example, because I'm not quite sure about what you're talking about."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2923.836,2927.694,"--Well, you could have a partnership, Your Honor, that engages in many transactions."
2013.12-562,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2959.932,2964.022,I'm -- I'm a little confused on this example.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2978.97,2997.729,"No, because, Your Honor, again, the penalty is based on what the individual partner claims as his basis, and that partner is going to be looking to everything that goes into his partnership interest, the costs or investment in the partnership, pertaining not only to the one transaction that we have hypothesized has been shammed, but many other transactions as well."
2013.12-562,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3055.658,3057.845,"--Well, that was the prototypical case, Mr. Garre."
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3071.464,3079.227,"--Your Honor, they have basis and we have context, punctuation, pre-enactment history, post-enactment history and structure."
2013.12-562,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3079.227,3079.821,I'm sorry.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3083.225,3083.834,No.
2013.12-562,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3199.976,3210.126,"So just to be clear, if this is -- 6 had been on the books, then you would have no quarrel with the Government 's position, they could do this at the partnership level and--"
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3210.126,3211.578,"Yes, absolutely."
2013.12-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3213.797,3214.968,I didn't get the question.
2013.12-562,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3216.077,3229.665,"--If the noneconomic substance transaction penalty that was enacted in 2010 was on the books, what would happen is a court could determine the applicability of that penalty, which is based on what the partnership did at the partnership proceeding, and we would agree that penalty applies."
2013.12-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3347.84,3350.043,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-562,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3352.386,3359.352,Mr. Chief Justice.
2013.12-562,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3370.485,3371.907,How does it not?
2013.12-562,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3395.179,3395.96,--That's correct.
2013.12-562,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3395.96,3396.539,All right.
2013.12-562,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3416.594,3417.077,I mean--
2013.12-562,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3417.077,3419.561,End of case?
2013.12-562,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3419.561,3421.0,Perhaps--
2013.12-562,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3421.0,3421.9,It can't be that simple.
2013.12-562,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3423.856,3428.198,--Let me -- let me pose perhaps a less friendly question.
2013.12-562,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3450.047,3460.793,"--I think this is a different situation because the IRS did not determine that the underlying transactions, the purchases and sale of currency options and so forth, didn't occur."
2013.12-562,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3465.103,3470.429,"Well, but if you determine that the partnerships were shams, that's like saying that there were no partnerships."
2013.12-562,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3470.429,3471.461,There were no partnerships--
2013.12-562,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3471.461,3475.725,"And if you say, you know, I didn't really give the painting, that means that there wasn't any painting."
2013.12-562,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3478.192,3487.08,"--But what the FPAA also said was, because there were no partnerships, the transactions should be treated as though they had -- were engaged in by the individual partners."
2013.12-562,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3487.08,3489.079,Maybe it was a frame with a blank canvas.
2013.12-562,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3489.079,3514.74,"Well -- and I -- and I think, as -- as I was starting to say at the close of my opening argument, it's no accident that the partnerships were used to effectuate this scheme, because if the individuals had bought and sold the offsetting foreign currency options, they would have had no colorable rationale for contending that they were entitled to a deduction for the cost of the long option but they were not required to treat as income the amount they received from the short option."
2013.12-562,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3567.016,3570.78,Do you -- do you agree that the new legislation completely resolves this problem?
2013.12-562,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3570.78,3579.136,--It completely resolves the specific problem posed by this -- almost completely resolves the specific problem.
2013.12-562,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3611.062,3616.855,Could you -- could you go back just one moment to the practical point that your brother made?
2013.12-562,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3635.223,3645.734,"--With respect to jurisdiction, the question simply goes to the allocation of responsibilities between the partnership-level court and the partner-level court."
2013.12-562,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3664.601,3665.805,"Thank you, counsel."
