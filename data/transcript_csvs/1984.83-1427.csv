1984.83-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,68.144,"Mr. Landry, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1984.83-1427,0,39752,robert_j_landry,,68.144,90.474,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the instant case presents the opportunity for this Court to address and decide for the first time the standard of review which should be made by Federal habeas corpus concerning Witherspoon claims brought by state prisoners in habeas corpus actions."
1984.83-1427,1,45391,william_c_mclain,,1124.855,1151.189,"It was not focused on in the Florida trial court, and I would point out... the second fact I would like to bring to the Court's attention was that Mr. Witt's trial counsel in the state trial court and on appeal admitted, in a deposition which was introduced into evidence at the habeas hearing, that he was not even aware of the Witherspoon decision as the time he selected the jury in this case."
1984.83-1427,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1151.189,1154.374,"Well, how does that bear on his failure to raise it in the trial court?"
1984.83-1427,1,45391,william_c_mclain,,1154.374,1162.397,His failure to raise it in the trial court... the Florida Supreme Court addressed this question on the merits.
1984.83-1427,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1162.397,1162.78,Yes.
1984.83-1427,1,45391,william_c_mclain,,1191.63,1199.301,"That's correct, Your Honor, and I think his statement in the deposition explains why: that he was unfamiliar with the Witherspoon standard at the time he selected the jury."
1984.83-1427,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1199.301,1210.425,"Does that bear on his obligation, if the point is later to be made, eight years later in the case, that a particular question on voir dire wasn't proper, that he ought to do something about it then?"
1984.83-1427,1,45391,william_c_mclain,,1210.425,1213.893,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1427,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1234.124,1242.813,"No, but it's the judge who has to... and I think the Adams language doesn't really use the words ""unmistakably clear""."
1984.83-1427,1,45391,william_c_mclain,,1257.322,1275.134,"I think Adams v. Texas really controls this decision because the term ""interfere"" as used in his questions in this case suffers the same flaw as did the term ""affect"" in the questions used in the Texas case."
1984.83-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1275.134,1284.474,"Do you think if the court or the district court had made findings, that could have remedied this problem?"
1984.83-1427,1,45391,william_c_mclain,,1291.912,1316.195,"The absence... I don't think the Witherspoon question, whether Witherspoon questions are treated as ones involving historical fact, accorded the presumption of correctness under 2254 D, is really relevant to deciding this case at all, because even under the terms of 2254 D, the pertinent fact for dispute was not decided."
1984.83-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1330.003,1349.266,"If the district judge, the trial judge had thought that some findings were either necessary or helpful, do you suppose he might have been dissuaded from making them by the fact that there was no objection to the excusing of this juror?"
1984.83-1427,1,45391,william_c_mclain,,1349.266,1352.468,"That may have been the case, Your Honor."
1984.83-1427,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1354.403,1369.596,"Well, what's your answer to your adversary's argument that if challenge for cause was sustained, that that action in and of itself carries with it findings?"
1984.83-1427,1,45391,william_c_mclain,,1369.596,1376.316,I don't think this record is capable of demonstrating an implicit finding of fact.
1984.83-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1483.603,1488.823,"Well, does that imply that the judge didn't know the right standard?"
1984.83-1427,1,45391,william_c_mclain,,1488.823,1501.147,"It implies the judge did not, by acting upon the prosecutor's inquiry alone which did not comply with the Witherspoon standard."
1984.83-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1501.147,1511.455,The answers to a question might give the judge what he thought anyway was enough evidence to apply the correct standard.
1984.83-1427,1,45391,william_c_mclain,,1511.455,1516.259,I don't... it would not in this case because of the nature of the questions.
1984.83-1427,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1564.74,1597.294,"There is language, though, as was pointed out by Mr. Landry, in Witherspoon itself, using the word ""interfere"", where the Court said courts and other states have sometimes permitted the exclusion for cause of jurors opposed to the death penalty, even in an absence of a showing that their scruples would have interfered with their ability to determine guilt and so forth."
1984.83-1427,1,45391,william_c_mclain,,1601.43,1603.198,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1427,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.422,1623.361,"Did the court below give any deference, or did it treat this as a mixed question of law and fact?"
1984.83-1427,1,45391,william_c_mclain,,1623.361,1630.599,"--Your Honor, the court below noted that there was some uncertainty in the lower courts."
1984.83-1427,2,39752,robert_j_landry,,2727.157,2727.807,"--Nothing further, Your Honor."
1984.83-1427,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2727.807,2729.64,"Thank you, counsel."
