1977.76-1359,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.53,"We will hear arguments next in 1359, Bankers Trust against Mallis and Kupferman."
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,50.453,53.964,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1977.76-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,138.595,141.117,Do you say they are simple?
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,141.117,142.094,"Yes, your honor, they are fairly simple."
1977.76-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,142.094,149.197,I read the briefs in this case a week ago on an airplane and I thought I was going crazy.
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,149.197,150.173,"Well, Maybe I could help clarify them for you, Justice Stewart."
1977.76-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,150.173,152.557,I thought the altitude was getting to me.
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,152.557,160.288,"Maybe I can help clarify and feel free to interrupt and ask any questions, Justice Stewart.[Laughter]"
1977.76-1359,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,160.288,161.76,We will not hesitate counsel.
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,161.76,163.461,"Thank you, sir."
1977.76-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,244.766,255.066,"Let me just isolate, if I may, the very first part of the transaction which you described where the Bankers Trust received the pledge from the Georgia Bank."
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,255.066,255.787,It did not.
1977.76-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,257.351,259.654,"Okay, from Mr. Kates."
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,280.589,286.832,Our position is that Bankers Trust Co. does not need to proceed against him in 10b5 at the time he pledged the collateral.
1977.76-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,286.832,287.972,Could it?
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,287.972,290.881,"No, our position, your honor, is that it does not need that."
1977.76-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,300.48,302.523,Could you proceed against him?
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,307.72,309.173,"No, we would not need that."
1977.76-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.143,318.302,Could you proceed against him by virtue of the fraudulent representation in connection with the pledge by virtue of 10b5?
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,318.302,322.157,Our position is we do not need that as a remedy.
1977.76-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,322.157,323.383,I was not asking if you need it.
1977.76-1359,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,329.24,332.275,Is your position not simply that there would be no sale under this action?
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,332.275,333.015,That is correct.
1977.76-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,336.12,344.009,That was what I was trying to find out.
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,344.009,345.718,"Do you have any other questions, Justice Rehnquist?"
1977.76-1359,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,345.718,346.253,Not right now.
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,346.253,347.12,Okay.
1977.76-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,427.205,429.589,There was Mr. Kupferman somewhere in here too.
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,429.589,433.151,"No, he comes in later in the picture."
1977.76-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,436.587,441.345,"Mr. Weiner, that particular sale you would concede as a sale within the meaning of the statute, the sale between Kates to Arnold and Fowler."
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,441.345,445.506,The sale between Kates to Arnold and Fowler is a sale.
1977.76-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,445.506,450.07,Your position is the pledges were not in connection with that sale or the release of the pledge.
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,450.07,455.384,"That is correct, sir."
1977.76-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,616.204,620.796,"Mr. Weiner, would it make any difference if the bank had introduced the parties or known all these details?"
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,623.696,625.287,It does not have any real relevance to the issue.
1977.76-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,625.287,627.677,Then why do we dwell on those facts?
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,627.677,628.886,But they go to the “in connection with.”
1977.76-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,628.886,631.255,"They go to whether or not “in connection with” the fraud, is that not it?"
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,631.255,632.719,"Yes, in connection with arguments."
1977.76-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,632.719,638.858,"Do we not, for purposes of our decision, have to assume that Bankers Life committed some kind of a fraud but it is not in connection with the sale of this here?"
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,638.858,641.573,"That is correct, sir."
1977.76-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,834.032,839.411,"Mr. Weiner, when you talk about the Act I take it you are talking about the Securities Exchange Act of 1944."
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,839.411,840.525,"That is correct, sir."
1977.76-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,840.525,847.198,I looked at the complaint and the action seems to have been brought out of the Securities Act of 1933.
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,847.198,852.052,The action was originally instituted under the Securities Act of 1933.
1977.76-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,883.254,889.396,It is clear now all around that this is a complaint under the 1934 Act.
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,889.396,890.487,That is correct.
1977.76-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,892.057,893.1,And Rule 10b5.
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,893.1,894.685,And Rule 10b5.
1977.76-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,894.685,896.727,Promulgated under that statute.
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,896.727,897.483,Yes.
1977.76-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,897.483,898.727,The complaint does not indicate that.
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,898.727,900.651,I know it does not.
1977.76-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,900.651,906.063,"Mr. Weiner, do you contend there is a difference in the meaning of the word “sale” between the ’33 Act and the ’34 Act?"
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,906.063,906.768,"Yes, there is."
1977.76-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,912.872,914.483,"They use the word “pledge,” does it not?"
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,914.483,915.84,"No, it does not."
1977.76-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.347,928.96,"It is pretty hard to do so, would it not be?"
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,928.96,929.284,Pardon?
1977.76-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.284,933.884,It is pretty hard not to say a pledge is a disposition of an interest in the securities.
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,933.884,950.209,"The SEC, Allan Troop, the general counsels, and it was cited in our brief, refer to that definition, and they indicate that a pledge was not a sale for purposes of the 1933 Act."
1977.76-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,950.209,952.149,"In any event, we are dealing here with a ’34."
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,952.149,952.608,"We are dealing with the ’34 Act, sir."
1977.76-1359,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,952.608,955.995,And Rule 10b5 promulgated there under.
1977.76-1359,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.995,958.518,"There is no statutory definition of sale, is that right?"
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,958.518,959.791,"There is none in the Act, sir."
1977.76-1359,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1196.805,1206.123,Do I correctly read the Second Circuit opinion as relying on cases that arose chiefly under the ’33 Act rather than the ’34 Act?
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,1206.123,1207.253,"That is correct, sir."
1977.76-1359,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1207.253,1209.448,Where there is a much broader definition of sale.
1977.76-1359,0,33600,jack_h_weiner,,1209.448,1213.916,"That is correct, sir, but the gentile and guilt going for both ’33 Act cases."
1977.76-1359,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1231.301,1234.737,Mr. Warden?
1977.76-1359,1,33671,john_l_warden,,1234.737,1242.233,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1977.76-1359,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1493.547,1499.18,"Do you think there has to be a transfer of title, so to speak, or transfer of ownership?"
1977.76-1359,1,33671,john_l_warden,,1499.18,1509.736,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I think that it would probably be sufficient if there were a purchase and sale in the ordinary informal sense."
1977.76-1359,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1535.46,1540.676,"Mr. Warden, what about the phrase “in connection with”?"
1977.76-1359,1,33671,john_l_warden,,1540.676,1553.776,"Well, Your honor, I do not think that anything that was done or alleged to have been done by Bankers Trust in this case is in connection with the transaction of which the plaintiffs complain."
1977.76-1359,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1598.467,1601.765,"Mr. Warden, is that quite correct?"
1977.76-1359,1,33671,john_l_warden,,1614.016,1617.335,It is not quite clear from reading this record.
1977.76-1359,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1620.611,1621.524,If there is no fraud we do not have objectify it.
1977.76-1359,1,33671,john_l_warden,,1621.524,1622.862,It is not quite clear.
1977.76-1359,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1667.315,1676.9,"Is it not alleged and do we not have to assume it for the purpose of the decision it may not be proved ultimately that, at the closing, Bankers Trust made a fraudulent misrepresentation?"
1977.76-1359,1,33671,john_l_warden,,1678.748,1679.995,That is what the Court of Appeals decision says.
1977.76-1359,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1679.995,1682.928,That is different than just making a conference room available.
1977.76-1359,1,33671,john_l_warden,,1682.928,1687.441,"That is what the court ruled, no but I think that does indicate Your Honor, you are quite right."
1977.76-1359,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1723.426,1729.134,"Mr. Warden, it may be a very weak case but it has nothing to do with the legal question we are supposed to decide."
1977.76-1359,1,33671,john_l_warden,,1729.134,1735.42,"Proceeding from there, we do have to decide whether the misrepresentation was in any way “in connection with.”"
1977.76-1359,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1786.948,1796.506,But are all those matters that were to be resolved in a later stage in the proceeding as Justice Stevens suggested?
1977.76-1359,1,33671,john_l_warden,,1796.506,1799.862,"Your honor, I think that they are both questions of law."
1977.76-1359,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1822.617,1839.32,"In other words, what you are saying, I take it, is that if the Court of Appeals had read the 1934 Act definitions they would have arrived at these results as a matter of law."
1977.76-1359,1,33671,john_l_warden,,1839.32,1840.307,"That is correct, your honor."
1977.76-1359,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1840.307,1843.941,And they would not have to dealt into the facts.
1977.76-1359,1,33671,john_l_warden,,1843.941,1845.286,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.76-1359,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1866.64,1872.603,Mr. Hauser?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,1872.603,1875.805,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1977.76-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1948.954,1950.815,"He denied lease to amend, did he not?"
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,1950.815,1953.144,He denied lease to amend.
1977.76-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1968.027,1974.325,You cannot file a motion for discovery until you have received permission to file your amended complaint.
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,1974.325,1974.965,That is correct.
1977.76-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1974.965,1976.718,And he denied lease to amend.
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,1976.718,1978.008,He denied that lease.
1977.76-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1978.008,1981.168,So you cannot complain about the lack of discovery.
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,1981.168,1983.776,"Well, I can complain about it in this respect."
1977.76-1359,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2041.911,2053.663,"Coming back to this gigantic fraud and all you are talking about, how much of that is involved in the litigation now pending in the New York State torts?"
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2053.663,2059.78,"The amount that the plaintiffs are out at this time is $156,000 plus five years interest."
1977.76-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2133.664,2140.34,"When you said they knew they were in trouble, do you mean they knew the pledge they had taken as security was very likely worthless."
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2140.34,2141.387,Absolutely.
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2208.321,2209.357,Is that in the record?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2209.357,2212.273,Yes.
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2212.273,2217.802,The fact that they made a representation or is it just alleged?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2217.802,2220.362,The plaintiffs have an affidavit as part of the record.
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2237.051,2238.461,Is there affidavit in the record?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2238.461,2242.896,The affidavit was not obtained until after the record was filed in this court.
1977.76-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2242.896,2247.853,You mean their affidavit was not before Judge Pollack?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2247.853,2250.077,The plaintiffs’ affidavit was before Judge Pollack.
1977.76-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.077,2251.849,The plaintiffs’ affidavit was before Judge Pollack.
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2251.849,2253.262,"Yes, it was."
1977.76-1359,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2253.262,2254.855,Is it now included?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2254.855,2257.605,It is included in the record to this court.
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2257.605,2263.16,Does that include a representation about the Bankers Trust representation?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2263.16,2266.421,"Do you mean, in the complaint which we were not allowed to amend?"
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2267.206,2269.858,"No, but the affidavit, that was before Judge Pollack?"
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2269.858,2273.262,"Yes, the affidavit alleges that affirmative representation."
1977.76-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2273.262,2282.699,Where is that?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2282.699,2286.414,Page 110.
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2286.414,2288.659,This was before Judge Pollack?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2288.659,2293.644,"Yes, sir."
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2295.652,2297.537,What does it say?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2299.508,2305.099,I will quote the language exactly.
1977.76-1359,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2328.407,2331.977,Told by whom?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2331.977,2332.697,By the representative.
1977.76-1359,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2332.697,2337.365,It would not help me at all because I do not know a thing from here.
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2341.768,2345.572,“Bankers Trust Co. withheld vitally material information from us and our representatives.”
1977.76-1359,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2345.572,2355.538,I understood you to say that there was an affidavit which said positively that Bankers Trust said that this was good.
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2355.538,2356.123,"Yes, sir."
1977.76-1359,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2356.123,2357.47,Where is that here?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2357.47,2358.108,Right here.
1977.76-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2358.108,2359.345,That is an information.
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2359.345,2360.205,"Yes, it is."
1977.76-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2360.205,2365.094,That is no good.
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2365.094,2374.835,"We were denied the opportunity, as I mentioned before, to amend our complaint so as to affirmatively allege it."
1977.76-1359,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2546.172,2550.632,"Mr. Hauser, this sale you are describing now is a sale from Kates."
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2550.632,2551.677,"Yes, exactly right."
1977.76-1359,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2551.677,2552.75,Not from Bankers Trust?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2552.75,2553.204,No.
1977.76-1359,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2553.204,2553.506,That is right.
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2553.506,2554.522,Not from Bankers Trust.
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.408,2563.917,You do not claim that the release of the pledge was a sale then?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2563.917,2566.744,"I do not believe that the mere release of a pledge is a sale, no."
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2566.744,2569.196,So you do not say Bankers Trust was a seller.
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2569.196,2571.072,I do not believe that Bankers Trust was a seller.
1977.76-1359,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2613.859,2623.128,Does the Second Circuit opinion seem to be in some disagreement with you on whether the release of the pledge is a sale or with Bankers Trust?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2623.128,2640.916,"Yes, I do not think that to the extent that the Second Circuit said that the release by Bankers of the pledge was a sale of stock, I do not think that it was necessary to their decision. I think that all of that was required."
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.916,2643.703,Do you think they thought it was?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2643.703,2646.102,Do I think they thought it was a sale?
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2646.102,2652.068,I know but do you think they thought that holding was essential to their decision?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2652.068,2653.244,I do not think so.
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2663.07,2664.883,This release was in connection with the sale?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2664.883,2665.572,Yes.
1977.76-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2665.572,2674.509,Your position then is that a fraudulent representation by someone who himself is not a seller is actionable under 10b5?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2674.509,2676.828,Absolutely.
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2676.828,2686.394,"But it is necessary that for you to claim, and for us to agree with you, that a pledge is a sale."
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2686.394,2689.941,"No, I do not think so."
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2689.941,2694.478,Because you say there was a sale that took place here and then this release was in connection with the sale.
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2694.478,2706.45,"Right, I say that if the sale occurs at the identical time as does the pledge, the pledge is in connection with the sale."
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.642,2715.672,How do you view the question whether a pledge is a sale?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2715.672,2717.33,How do I view whether a pledge is a sale?
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2717.33,2720.03,Is a pledge a sale or not?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2720.03,2723.113,I do not think that it is necessary.
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2723.113,2724.876,You disagree with the Court of Appeals again.
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2724.876,2726.672,I do not disagree with the Court of Appeals on that.
1977.76-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2734.082,2740.609,You would not suggest the Court of Appeals did not think it was necessary for its decision to hold that a pledge was a sale?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2740.609,2743.169,I do think that the Court of Appeals so thought.
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.169,2746.362,But you do not necessarily defend that conclusion?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2746.362,2748.17,I do not necessarily defend that conclusion.
1977.76-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2778.737,2780.149,I would be interested to hear what you would say.
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2780.149,2790.938,"And Mr. Weiner responded that there would not be any answer, that there would be no occasion to go to 10b5 remedy."
1977.76-1359,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2815.729,2826.732,"Your position, I take it, is that you can rely on the sale from Arnold to Mallis and the misrepresentation made by Bankers Trust was in connection with the sale."
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2826.732,2827.365,Positively.
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2829.061,2832.52,That would protect the new pledgee or not?
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2834.261,2834.748,Yes.
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2835.896,2837.629,"Yes, I know."
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2866.526,2879.196,"Yes, I say that the sale as to which the pledgee generates with the use of his funds is sufficient to supply the statutory requirement of “in connection with” a sale."
1977.76-1359,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2879.196,2881.21,"That certainly is not the theory of the Court of Appeals, is it?"
1977.76-1359,2,37143,noel_w_hauser,,2881.21,2895.328,"No, I do not think it is."
1977.76-1359,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2895.328,2899.187,Mr. Pitt?
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,2899.187,2901.87,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1977.76-1359,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2901.87,2915.545,"Do you think, Mr. Pitt, the Court of Appeals opinion stands independent of the analysis we have just been discussing?"
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,2915.545,2921.465,I think that the analysis of the Court of Appeals with respect to a pledge being a sale is correct.
1977.76-1359,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2936.135,2941.944,You think the Court of Appeals did not need to say that?
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,2941.944,2945.861,I think that the opinion stands analytically without that holding.
1977.76-1359,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2961.791,2977.253,"Do you think then there is very little chance that if we were to disagree with the Court of Appeals on whether a release is a sale, there is very little chance that if we remanded it to them they would come out any other way than they did?"
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,2977.253,2978.432,I would agree with that.
1977.76-1359,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.006,3008.654,"In your view, Bankers liability rest on finding if they made a misrepresentation it was in connection with the sale, not that they were a seller."
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3008.654,3009.367,That is correct.
1977.76-1359,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3021.302,3025.897,"What sale do you say their release was in connection with, the new pledge?"
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3025.897,3038.659,"If I may, your honor, not the release, the sale occurred when Arnold and Fowler pledged their stock to Mallis and Kupferman and Bankers Trust affirmatively made a misrepresentation to these plaintiffs."
1977.76-1359,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3038.659,3042.502,So it is in connection with the new pledge that you say they made a misrepresentation.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3042.502,3052.505,"That is correct and that is all this court need to focus on, except in so far as it may be concerned about the motivation of Bankers Trust as is alleged in the pleadings in the courts below."
1977.76-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3052.505,3060.022,So we are not talking here at all about the pledge by Kates to Bankers Trust nor the release by Bankers Trust of the collateral.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3060.022,3060.802,Definitely not.
1977.76-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3074.708,3078.028,"Again, that is quite a deviation from the Second Circuit’s reasoning, is it not?"
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3078.028,3079.069,Pardon?
1977.76-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3079.069,3081.457,Is this not quite a deviation from the reasoning of the Second Circuit?
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3081.457,3088.642,"Your honor, that is precisely what the Second Circuit was holding with respect to that side of the transaction."
1977.76-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3088.642,3089.963,That is the pledge.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3089.963,3090.942,That is the pledge.
1977.76-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3092.988,3098.237,"That the release to Kates by Bankers Trust of the collateral was a sale, it said that."
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3098.237,3104.719,"But, analytically, once Bankers Trust was satisfied as to the legal terms of its contract with Kates."
1977.76-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3112.25,3128.327,"Then we have now a third theory to support 10b5 liability, i.e. that Bankers Trust’s made a misrepresentation in connection with a sale from 'a' to 'b', Bankers Trust being x'."
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3131.191,3135.079,If I have given the impression that there is yet a third theory then I must apologize.
1977.76-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3135.079,3135.669,It is not you.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3137.1,3144.837,I believe that the theory that we have espoused is wholly consistent with the Second Circuit’s decision.
1977.76-1359,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3144.837,3152.505,I do not say that we do not have before us the question of whether a release of a pledge is a sale.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3160.733,3165.532,"Analytically, I would submit that that is irrelevant to the decision and I would like to explain why."
1977.76-1359,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3165.532,3167.464,I know you already submitted it.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3167.464,3169.857,I would like to explain why if I may.
1977.76-1359,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3213.18,3227.428,"Mr. Pitt, Bankers Trust on the paragraph on page 110, do you have anything more than that to show its implication or are you also relying on this one paragraph about the informants?"
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3227.428,3231.74,We are relying on 110 as I understand it.
1977.76-1359,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3231.74,3233.032,And what else?
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3233.032,3236.676,"No, on 110 as to the affirmative misrepresentations, yes."
1977.76-1359,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3236.676,3238.016,And what else?
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3238.016,3238.965,What else?
1977.76-1359,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3244.513,3245.979,All I am trying to get is that this is all you have.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3245.979,3247.516,"This is all, your honor."
1977.76-1359,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3247.516,3251.496,"That is a denial of a motion to amend not a motion to dismiss, is it not?"
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3251.496,3262.878,"Your Honor, as I understand the procedures, what occurred here was that Judge Pollack instituted a motion to dismiss on his own suggestion and, in connection with that, refused to allow an amendment of the complaint."
1977.76-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3283.231,3286.054,According to the Court of Appeals there was no judgment in the District Court.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3286.054,3288.368,Except the motion to dismiss.
1977.76-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3288.368,3289.424,A motion is not a judgment.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3289.424,3289.764,I am sorry.
1977.76-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3293.244,3296.071,They say every good case requires a mystery document.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3299.52,3302.746,"That may be, Your Honor."
1977.76-1359,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3302.746,3316.583,"Mr. Pitt, I take it from what you said that it would not have made any difference to your position whether there ever had been a pledge to Bankers on a release by Bankers."
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3319.303,3335.664,"No, although I think when this case was tried one of the allegations that the plaintiffs appeared to be making is that Bankers realizing it had a defective set of securities as collateral was anxious and deliberately misrepresented the value of that stock so that it could get out of its bad transaction."
1977.76-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3339.564,3341.56,That goes to the merits of the case.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3341.56,3348.537,"That is precisely what we have been hearing to some extent, I must say, respectfully from my brothers."
1977.76-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3348.537,3356.516,The question here is whether or not there was a purchase or a sale as within the meaning of the ’34 Act and 10b5.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3365.217,3367.505,That is precisely our position.
1977.76-1359,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3367.505,3376.071,"Bankers Trust could have held the securities in safekeeping, not having ever received them under a pledge."
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3376.071,3379.458,"Analytically, that would not affect the allegation of fraud in this case."
1977.76-1359,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3397.877,3400.181,But there has to be a sale.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3400.181,3404.002,There must be a disposition of an interest which is a sale.
1977.76-1359,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3405.275,3415.005,And the pledge by Arnold to Mallis and Kupferman was a sale under your theory.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3415.005,3415.509,"Yes, it was."
1977.76-1359,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3415.509,3416.827,May I ask this entirely?
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3427.058,3431.605,We have taken that position since the late 1950s.
1977.76-1359,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3431.605,3436.145,Have you issued any release as to that effect?
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3436.145,3438.885,We have filed a number of lawsuits.
1977.76-1359,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3477.872,3490.211,Is there anything in the legislative history of either the Act of ’33 or ’34 that supports your position that a pledge is a sale?
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3490.211,3496.316,"If there is something specific on pledges, I must confess, I am unaware of that."
1977.76-1359,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3496.316,3505.167,The hearings that led up to those Acts were very extensive and they dealt with all sorts of problems relating to securities.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3514.712,3532.779,"Your honor, I had occasion before coming here today to review our amicus brief and the Superintendent of insurance case where this court expressly held that not only shareholders but creditors were specifically within the intendment of the Securities Exchange Act protections for Anti-fraud."
1977.76-1359,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3600.924,3605.421,"Mr. Pitt, in that connection, this transaction is quite extraordinary."
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3635.28,3637.167,"If I may, I have two responses to that."
1977.76-1359,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3674.266,3682.325,"If foreclosed and if the securities have not been registered, they are subject to the provisions of the Act of ’33."
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3682.325,3685.816,Some of the cases we have had have had knowing schemes in that direction.
1977.76-1359,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3722.996,3729.19,This bank is not planning about the protections of the Act.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3732.666,3743.082,"In this particular situation, I agree with Justice Powell that this is a very unusual situation where the bank is alleged to have made an affirmative misrepresentation."
1977.76-1359,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3750.896,3758.259,"I was told in pleading, when you plead something like fraud you would be as specific as you can."
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3758.259,3763.593,"I was taught the same thing, your honor, and I wish this complaint had been more specific but I would hope."
1977.76-1359,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3763.593,3768.986,The difference is I stick to my teaching and you have left yours.
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3768.986,3770.02,"I hope not, your honor."
1977.76-1359,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3789.958,3798.535,"Mr. Pitt, did I understand you to say to Justice Powell that there was not any case authority for you position?"
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3798.535,3799.855,No.
1977.76-1359,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3834.032,3840.285,How long has the courts held that a pledge is a sale?
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3840.285,3847.32,Consistently with one minor exception since we commenced raising this issue which was started in late 1950s.
1977.76-1359,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3857.869,3859.235,Under the ’33 and ’34 Act?
1977.76-1359,3,27809,harvey_l_pitt,,3859.235,3860.76,Under the both Acts.
1977.76-1359,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3912.205,3917.207,Thank you.
1977.76-1359,4,33600,jack_h_weiner,,3917.207,3917.896,I thought I had a few minutes left.
1977.76-1359,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3917.896,3919.803,"Yes, you have about four minutes left."
1977.76-1359,4,33600,jack_h_weiner,,3919.803,3921.168,Yes.
1977.76-1359,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4013.717,4015.493,That goes to the merits of this controversy.
1977.76-1359,4,33600,jack_h_weiner,,4015.493,4016.198,Yes.
1977.76-1359,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4016.198,4019.454,"That is no part of what is before us now, is it?"
1977.76-1359,4,33600,jack_h_weiner,,4019.454,4020.603,"I recognize that, sir."
1977.76-1359,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4026.629,4028.35,All we have is the pleadings.
1977.76-1359,4,33600,jack_h_weiner,,4028.35,4028.645,That is correct.
1977.76-1359,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4028.645,4039.514,And all we have here is a fairly precise issue as to whether or not a pledge is a sale within the meaning of the ’34 Act.
1977.76-1359,4,33600,jack_h_weiner,,4039.514,4041.151,And whether or not it was “in connection with.”
1977.76-1359,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4041.151,4051.792,What confused me was that you and your brief were talking about the pledge by Kates to Bankers Trust and the release of the pledge and the SEC is talking about quite a different pledge.
1977.76-1359,4,33600,jack_h_weiner,,4058.154,4060.526,Because the Court of Appeals speaks about it.
1977.76-1359,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4060.526,4063.452,I know it does and that is what makes this case actually confusing.
1977.76-1359,4,33600,jack_h_weiner,,4068.387,4070.524,And whether or not it was “in connection with” also.
1977.76-1359,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4074.829,4075.474,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
